PETITIONER v. ALLSTATE INSURANCE 

COMPANY

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[March 31, 2010] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY,
JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
The Court today approves Shady Grove’s attempt to
transform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award, although
the State creating the right to recover has proscribed this
alchemy. If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York state
court, the 2% interest payment authorized by New York
Ins. Law Ann. §5106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty for over
due benefits would, by Shady Grove’s own measure,
amount to no more than $500. By instead filing in federal
court based on the parties’ diverse citizenship and request
ing class certification, Shady Grove hopes to recover, for
the class, statutory damages of more than $5,000,000.
The New York Legislature has barred this remedy, in
structing that, unless specifically permitted, “an action to
recover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery cre
ated or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a
class action.” N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) §901(b)
(West 2006). The Court nevertheless holds that Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures
for the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts
the application of §901(b) in diversity suits.
The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New
York’s restriction on the availability of statutory damages.

Our decisions, however, caution us to ask, before under
mining state legislation: Is this conflict really necessary?
Cf. Traynor, Is This Conflict Really Necessary? 37 Tex.
L. Rev. 657 (1959). Had the Court engaged in that in
quiry, it would not have read Rule 23 to collide with New
York’s legitimate interest in keeping certain monetary
awards reasonably bounded. I would continue to interpret
Federal Rules with awareness of, and sensitivity to, im
portant state regulatory policies. Because today’s judg
ment radically departs from that course, I dissent.

“Under the Erie doctrine,” it is long settled, “federal
courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and
federal procedural law.” Gasperini v. Center for Humani
ties, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 427 (1996); see Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938). Justice Harlan aptly
conveyed the importance of the doctrine; he described Erie
as “one of the modern cornerstones of our federalism,
expressing policies that profoundly touch the allocation of
judicial power between the state and federal systems.”
Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 474 (1965) (concurring
opinion). Although we have found Erie’s application
“sometimes [to be] a challenging endeavor,” Gasperini, 518
U. S., at 427, two federal statutes mark our way.
The first, the Rules of Decision Act,1 prohibits federal
courts from generating substantive law in diversity ac
tions. See Erie, 304 U. S., at 78. Originally enacted as
part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, this restraint serves a
policy of prime importance to our federal system. We have
——————
1 The Rules of Decision Act directs that, “[t]he laws of the several
states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or
Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as
rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in
cases where they apply.” 28 U. S. C. §1652.

GINSBURG, J., dissenting

therefore applied the Act “with an eye alert to . . . avoiding
disregard of State law.” Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326
U. S. 99, 110 (1945).
The second, the Rules Enabling Act, enacted in 1934,
authorizes us to “prescribe general rules of practice and
procedure” for the federal courts, but with a crucial re
striction: “Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify
any substantive right.” 28 U. S. C. §2072. Pursuant to
this statute, we have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. In interpreting the scope of the Rules, includ
ing, in particular, Rule 23, we have been mindful of the
limits on our authority. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Fibreboard
Corp., 527 U. S. 815, 845 (1999) (The Rules Enabling Act
counsels against “adventurous application” of Rule 23; any
tension with the Act “is best kept within tolerable limits.”);
Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 612–613
(1997). See also Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin
Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 503–504 (2001).
If a Federal Rule controls an issue and directly conflicts
with state law, the Rule, so long as it is consonant with
the Rules Enabling Act, applies in diversity suits. See
Hanna, 380 U. S., at 469–474. If, however, no Federal
Rule or statute governs the issue, the Rules of Decision
Act, as interpreted in Erie, controls. That Act directs
federal courts, in diversity cases, to apply state law when
failure to do so would invite forum-shopping and yield
markedly disparate litigation outcomes. See Gasperini,
518 U. S., at 428; Hanna, 380 U. S., at 468. Recognizing
that the Rules of Decision Act and the Rules Enabling Act
simultaneously frame and inform the Erie analysis, we
have endeavored in diversity suits to remain safely within
the bounds of both congressional directives.
B
In our prior decisions in point, many of them not men
tioned in the Court’s opinion, we have avoided immoderate

SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

interpretations of the Federal Rules that would trench on
state prerogatives without serving any countervailing
federal interest. “Application of the Hanna analysis,” we
have said, “is premised on a ‘direct collision’ between the
Federal Rule and the state law.” Walker v. Armco Steel
Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749–750 (1980) (quoting Hanna, 380
U. S., at 472). To displace state law, a Federal Rule,
“when fairly construed,” must be “ ‘sufficiently broad’ ” so
as “to ‘control the issue’ before the court, thereby leaving
no room for the operation of that law.” Burlington North
ern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1987) (quoting
Walker, 446 U. S., at 749–750, and n. 9; emphasis added);
cf. Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22,
37–38 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[I]n deciding
whether a federal . . . Rule of Procedure encompasses a
particular issue, a broad reading that would create signifi
cant disuniformity between state and federal courts
should be avoided if the text permits.”).
In pre-Hanna decisions, the Court vigilantly read the
Federal Rules to avoid conflict with state laws. In Palmer
v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 117 (1943), for example, the
Court read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative de
fenses, to control only the manner of pleading the listed
defenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in
such cases, Palmer held, state law controls.
Six years later, in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &
Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949), the Court ruled that
state law determines when a diversity suit commences for
purposes of tolling the state limitations period. Although
Federal Rule 3 specified that “[a] civil action is commenced
by filing a complaint with the court,” we held that the
Rule did not displace a state law that tied an action’s
commencement to service of the summons. Id., at 531–
533. The “cause of action [wa]s created by local law,” the
Court explained, therefore “the measure of it [wa]s to be
found only in local law.” Id., at 533.

GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Similarly in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,
337 U. S. 541 (1949), the Court held applicable in a diver
sity action a state statute requiring plaintiffs, as a prereq
uisite to pursuit of a stockholder’s derivative action, to
post a bond as security for costs. At the time of the litiga
tion, Rule 23, now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiff’s insti
tution of a derivative action in federal court. Although the
Federal Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder’s
maintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no
conflict between the Rule and the state statute in ques
tion; the requirements of both could be enforced, the Court
observed. See id., at 556. Burdensome as the security-for
costs requirement may be, Cohen made plain, suitors
could not escape the upfront outlay by resorting to the
federal court’s diversity jurisdiction.
In all of these cases, the Court stated in Hanna, “the
scope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing
party urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule
which covered the point in dispute, Erie commanded the
enforcement of state law.” 380 U. S., at 470. In Hanna
itself, the Court found the clash “unavoidable,” ibid.; the
petitioner had effected service of process as prescribed by
Federal Rule 4(d)(1), but that “how-to” method did not
satisfy the special Massachusetts law applicable to service
on an executor or administrator. Even as it rejected the
Massachusetts prescription in favor of the federal proce
dure, however, “[t]he majority in Hanna recognized . . .
that federal rules . . . must be interpreted by the courts
applying them, and that the process of interpretation can
and should reflect an awareness of legitimate state inter
ests.” R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro,
Hart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal
System 593 (6th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Hart & Wechsler).
Following Hanna, we continued to “interpre[t] the fed
eral rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory
policies.” Hart & Wechsler 593. In Walker, the Court took


6

SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

up the question whether Ragan should be overruled; we
held, once again, that Federal Rule 3 does not directly
conflict with state rules governing the time when an ac
tion commences for purposes of tolling a limitations pe
riod. 446 U. S., at 749–752. Rule 3, we said, addresses
only “the date from which various timing requirements of
the Federal Rules begin to run,” id., at 751, and does not
“purpor[t] to displace state tolling rules,” id., at 750–751.
Significant state policy interests would be frustrated, we
observed, were we to read Rule 3 as superseding the state
rule, which required actual service on the defendant to
stop the clock on the statute of limitations. Id., at 750–
752.
We were similarly attentive to a State’s regulatory
policy in Gasperini. That diversity case concerned the
standard for determining when the large size of a jury
verdict warrants a new trial. Federal and state courts
alike had generally employed a “shock the conscience” test
in reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. See 518 U. S.,
at 422. Federal courts did so pursuant to Federal Rule
59(a) which, as worded at the time of Gasperini, instructed
that a trial court could grant a new trial “for any of the
reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted
in actions at law in the courts of the United States.” Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a) (West 1995). In an effort to provide
greater control, New York prescribed procedures under
which jury verdicts would be examined to determine
whether they “deviate[d] materially from what would be
reasonable compensation.” See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at
423–425 (quoting CPLR §5501(c)). This Court held that
Rule 59(a) did not inhibit federal-court accommodation of
New York’s invigorated test.
Most recently, in Semtek, we addressed the claim
preclusive effect of a federal-court judgment dismissing a
diversity action on the basis of a California statute of
limitations. The case came to us after the same plaintiff

GINSBURG, J., dissenting

renewed the same fray against the same defendant in a
Maryland state court. (Plaintiff chose Maryland because
that State’s limitations period had not yet run.) We held
that Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involun
tary dismissal “operate[d] as an adjudication on the mer
its,” did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in
Maryland. To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded the Mary
land courts from entertaining the case, we said, “would
arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules
Enabling Act,” 531 U. S., at 503, and “would in many cases
violate [Erie’s] federalism principle,” id., at 504.
In sum, both before and after Hanna, the above
described decisions show, federal courts have been cau
tioned by this Court to “interpre[t] the Federal Rules . . .
with sensitivity to important state interests,” Gasperini,
518 U. S., at 427, n. 7, and a will “to avoid conflict with
important state regulatory policies,” id., at 438, n. 22

2JUSTICE

STEVENS stakes out common ground on this point: “[F]ederal
rules,” he observes, “must be interpreted with some degree of ‘sensitiv
ity to important state interests and regulatory policies,’ . . . and applied
to diversity cases against the background of Congress’ command that
such rules not alter substantive rights and with consideration of ‘the
degree to which the Rule makes the character and result of the federal
litigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts,’ Hanna
[v. Plumer], 380 U. S. [460, 473 (1965)].” Ante, at 3. (opinion concurring
in part and concurring in judgment). See also ante, at 4 (“A ‘state
procedural rule, though undeniably procedural in the ordinary sense of
the term’ may exist ‘to influence substantive outcomes,’ . . . and may in
some instances become so bound up with the state-created right or
remedy that it defines the scope of that substantive right or remedy.”
(some internal quotation marks omitted)); ante, at 5 (“When a State
chooses to use a traditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining
the scope of substantive rights or remedies, federal courts must recog
nize and respect that choice.”). Nevertheless, JUSTICE STEVENS sees no
reason to read Rule 23 with restraint in this particular case; the Fed
eral Rule preempts New York’s damages limitation, in his view, be
cause §901(b) is “a procedural rule that is not part of New York’s
substantive law.” Ante, at 1. This characterization of §901(b) does not

away from that approach—and conspicuously, its most
recent reiteration in Gasperini, ante, at 11, n. 7—in favor
of a mechanical reading of Federal Rules, insensitive to
state interests and productive of discord.
C
Our decisions instruct over and over again that, in the
adjudication of diversity cases, state interests—whether
advanced in a statute, e.g., Cohen, or a procedural rule,
e.g., Gasperini—warrant our respectful consideration. Yet
today, the Court gives no quarter to New York’s limitation
on statutory damages and requires the lower courts to
thwart the regulatory policy at stake: To prevent excessive
damages, New York’s law controls the penalty to which a
defendant may be exposed in a single suit. The story
behind §901(b)’s enactment deserves telling.
In 1975, the Judicial Conference of the State of New
York proposed a new class-action statute designed “to set
up a flexible, functional scheme” that would provide “an
effective, but controlled group remedy.” Judicial Confer
ence Report on CPLR, reprinted in 1975 N. Y. Laws
pp. 1477, 1493 (McKinney). As originally drafted, the
legislation addressed only the procedural aspects of class
actions; it specified, for example, five prerequisites for
certification, eventually codified at §901(a), that closely
tracked those listed in Rule 23. See CPLR §901(a) (requir
ing, for class certification, numerosity, predominance,
typicality, adequacy of representation, and superiority).
While the Judicial Conference proposal was in the New
York Legislature’s hopper, “various groups advocated for
the addition of a provision that would prohibit class action
plaintiffs from being awarded a statutorily-created penalty

mirror reality, as I later explain. See infra, at 17–24. But a majority of
this Court, it bears emphasis, agrees that Federal Rules should be read
with moderation in diversity suits to accommodate important state
concerns.

“feared that recoveries beyond actual damages could lead
to excessively harsh results.” Ibid. “They also argued that
there was no need to permit class actions . . . [because]
statutory penalties . . . provided an aggrieved party with a
sufficient economic incentive to pursue a claim.” Ibid.
Such penalties, constituents observed, often far exceed a
plaintiff’s actual damages. “When lumped together,” they
argued, “penalties and class actions produce overkill.”

Aiming to avoid “ annihilating punishment of the defen

actions. V. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, C901:11,

York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (internal quotation marks omit

stated that the new statute “empowers the court to pre

“[T]he final bill . . . was the result of a compromise
among competing interests.” Sperry, 8 N. Y. 3d, at 211,

in deciding whether to certify a class, but §901(b) rejects
the use of the class mechanism to pursue the particular
remedy of statutory damages. The limitation was not
designed with the fair conduct or efficiency of litigation in
mind. Indeed, suits seeking statutory damages are argua
bly best suited to the class device because individual proof

of actual damages is unnecessary. New York’s decision
instead to block class-action proceedings for statutory
damages therefore makes scant sense, except as a means
to a manifestly substantive end: Limiting a defendant’s
liability in a single lawsuit in order to prevent the exorbi

Shady Grove contends—and the Court today agrees—
that Rule 23 unavoidably preempts New York’s prohibi
tion on the recovery of statutory damages in class actions.
The Federal Rule, the Court emphasizes, states that
Shady Grove’s suit “may be” maintained as a class action,
which conflicts with §901(b)’s instruction that it “may not”
so proceed. Ante, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted
and emphasis deleted). Accordingly, the Court insists,
§901(b) “cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is
ultra vires.” Ibid. Concluding that Rule 23 does not vio
late the Rules Enabling Act, the Court holds that the
federal provision controls Shady Grove’s ability to seek, on
behalf of a class, a statutory penalty of over $5,000,000.

3 Even in the mine-run case, a class action can result in “potentially
ruinous liability.” Advisory Committee’s Notes on Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 143. A court’s decision to certify a class
accordingly places pressure on the defendant to settle even unmeritori
ous claims. See, e.g., Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 476
(1978). When representative plaintiffs seek statutory damages, pres
sure to settle may be heightened because a class action poses the risk of
massive liability unmoored to actual injury. See, e.g., Ratner v. Chemi
cal Bank New York Trust Co., 54 F. R. D. 412, 416 (SDNY 1972) (exer
cising “considerable discretion of a pragmatic nature” to refuse to
certify a class because the plaintiffs suffered negligible actual damages
but sought statutory damages of $13,000,000).

necessary. Mindful of the history behind §901(b)’s enact
ment, the thrust of our precedent, and the substantive
rights limitation in the Rules Enabling Act, I conclude, as
did the Second Circuit and every District Court to have
considered the question in any detail,4 that Rule 23 does
not collide with §901(b). As the Second Circuit well un
derstood, Rule 23 prescribes the considerations relevant to
class certification and postcertification proceedings—but it
does not command that a particular remedy be available
when a party sues in a representative capacity. See 549
F. 3d 137, 143 (2008).5 Section 901(b), in contrast, trains
on that latter issue. Sensibly read, Rule 23 governs proce
dural aspects of class litigation, but allows state law to
control the size of a monetary award a class plaintiff may
pursue.

5 Shady Grove projects that a dispensation in favor of Allstate would
require “courts in all diversity class actions . . . [to] look to state rules
and decisional law rather than to Rule 23 . . . in making their class
certification decisions.” Brief for Petitioner 55. This slippery-slope
projection is both familiar and false. Cf. R. Bork, The Tempting of
America 169 (1990) (“Judges and lawyers live on the slippery slope of
analogies; they are not supposed to ski it to the bottom.”). In this case,
CPLR §901(a) lists the state-law prerequisites for class certification,
but Allstate does not contend that §901(a) overrides Rule 23. Brief for
Respondent 18 (“There is no dispute that the criteria for class certifica
tion under state law do not apply in federal court; that is the ground
squarely occupied by Rule 23.”). Federal courts sitting in diversity have
routinely applied Rule 23’s certification standards, rather than compa
rable state provisions. See, e.g., In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian
Export Antitrust Litigation, 522 F. 3d 6, 18–24 (CA1 2008); Order and
Reasons in In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation, Civ.

In other words, Rule 23 describes a method of enforcing
a claim for relief, while §901(b) defines the dimensions of
the claim itself. In this regard, it is immaterial that
§901(b) bars statutory penalties in wholesale, rather than
retail, fashion. The New York Legislature could have
embedded the limitation in every provision creating a
cause of action for which a penalty is authorized; §901(b)
operates as shorthand to the same effect. It is as much a
part of the delineation of the claim for relief as it would be
were it included claim by claim in the New York Code.
The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit
“may” or “may not” be maintained as a class action. See
ante, at 4–6. Putting the question that way, the Court
does not home in on the reason why. Rule 23 authorizes
class treatment for suits satisfying its prerequisites be
cause the class mechanism generally affords a fair and
efficient way to aggregate claims for adjudication. Section
901(b) responds to an entirely different concern; it does
not allow class members to recover statutory damages
because the New York Legislature considered the result of
adjudicating such claims en masse to be exorbitant.6 The
fair and efficient conduct of class litigation is the legiti
mate concern of Rule 23; the remedy for an infraction of
state law, however, is the legitimate concern of the State’s
lawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers. Cf. Ely, The
Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 693, 722
(1974) (It is relevant “whether the state provision embod

see ante, at 9, but offers no alternative account of §901(b)’s purpose.
Perhaps this silence indicates how very hard it would be to ascribe to
§901(b) any purpose bound up with the fairness and efficiency of
processing cases. On its face, the proscription is concerned with reme
dies, i.e., the availability of statutory damages in a lawsuit. Legislative
history confirms this objective, but is not essential to revealing it.

fairest and most efficient way of conducting litigation.”).
Suppose, for example, that a State, wishing to cap dam
ages in class actions at $1,000,000, enacted a statute
providing that “a suit to recover more than $1,000,000
may not be maintained as a class action.” Under the
Court’s reasoning—which attributes dispositive signifi
cance to the words “may not be maintained”—Rule 23
would preempt this provision, nevermind that Congress,
by authorizing the promulgation of rules of procedure for
federal courts, surely did not intend to displace state
created ceilings on damages.7 The Court suggests that the
analysis might differ if the statute “limit[ed] the remedies
available in an existing class action,” ante, at 7, such that
Rule 23 might not conflict with a state statute prescribing
that “no more than $1,000,000 may be recovered in a class
action.” There is no real difference in the purpose and
intended effect of these two hypothetical statutes. The
notion that one directly impinges on Rule 23’s domain,
while the other does not, fundamentally misperceives the
office of Rule 23.8
——————
7 There

is, of course, a difference between “justly administering [a]
remedy,” Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14 (1941), and prescrib
ing the content of that remedy; if Rule 23 can be read to increase a
plaintiff’s recovery from $1,000,000 to some greater amount, the Rule
has arguably “enlarge[d] . . . [a] substantive right” in violation of the
Rules Enabling Act. 28 U. S. C. §2072(b). The plurality appears to
acknowledge this point, stating that the Federal Rules we have found
to be in compliance with the Act have not “altered . . . available reme
dies.” Ante, at 13. But the Court’s relentless reading of Rule 23 today
does exactly that: The Federal Rule, it says, authorizes the recovery of

v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

The absence of an inevitable collision between Rule 23
and §901(b) becomes evident once it is comprehended that
a federal court sitting in diversity can accord due respect
to both state and federal prescriptions. Plaintiffs seeking
to vindicate claims for which the State has provided a
statutory penalty may pursue relief through a class action
if they forgo statutory damages and instead seek actual
damages or injunctive or declaratory relief; any putative
class member who objects can opt out and pursue actual
damages, if available, and the statutory penalty in an
individual action. See, e.g., Mendez v. The Radec Corp.,
260 F. R. D. 38, 55 (WDNY 2009); Brzychnalski v. Unesco,
Inc., 35 F. Supp. 2d 351, 353 (SDNY 1999).9 See also
Alexander, Practice Commentaries, at 105 (“Even if a
statutory penalty or minimum recovery is involved, most
courts hold that it can be waived, thus confining the class
recovery to actual damages and eliminating the bar of
CPLR 901(b).”). In this manner, the Second Circuit ex

for purposes of tolling a state statute of limitations (although the Rule
indisputably controls when an action commences for federal procedural
purposes), so too we could read Rule 23 not to direct when a class action
may be maintained for purposes of recovering statutory damages
prescribed by state law. On this reading of Rule 23, no rewriting of
§901(b) is necessary to avoid a conflict.
9 The New York Legislature appears to have anticipated this result.
In discussing the remedial bar effected by §901(b), the bill’s sponsor
explained that a “statutory class action for actual damages would still
be permissible.” S. Fink, [Sponsor’s] Memorandum, Bill Jacket, L.
1975, Ch. 207. See also State Consumer Protection Board Memoran
dum (May 29, 1975), Bill Jacket, L. 1975, Ch. 207. On this understand
ing, New York courts routinely authorize class actions when the class
waives its right to receive statutory penalties. See, e.g., Cox v. Micro
soft Corp., 8 App. Div. 3d 39, 778 N. Y. S. 2d 147 (2004); Pesantez v.

plained, “Rule 23’s procedural requirements for class
actions can be applied along with the substantive re
quirement of CPLR 901(b).” 549 F. 3d, at 144. In sum,
while phrased as responsive to the question whether
certain class actions may begin, §901(b) is unmistakably
aimed at controlling how those actions must end. On that
remedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.
Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves §901(b) in control of
the remedial issue at the core of this case should be dis
pelled by our Erie jurisprudence, including Hanna, which
counsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions
against stretching a rule to cover every situation it could
conceivably reach.10 The Court states that “[t]here is no
reason . . . to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether
claims made eligible for class treatment by some other law
should be certified as class actions.” Ante, at 5. To the
contrary, Palmer, Ragan, Cohen, Walker, Gasperini, and
Semtek provide good reason to look to the law that creates
the right to recover. See supra, at 4–7. That is plainly so
on a more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there
any reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief
when the State that created the remedy disallows its
pursuit on behalf of a class? None at all is the answer our
federal system should give.
Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain
penalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class
relief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for
certain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum
recovery. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(B) (Truth in
Lending Act) (“[I]n the case of a class action . . . no mini

(Electronic Fund Transfer Act) (same); 12 U. S. C.
§4010(a)(2)(B)(i) (Expedited Fund Availability Act) (same).
Today’s judgment denies to the States the full power
Congress has to keep certain monetary awards within
reasonable bounds. Cf. Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___,
___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (“In light of . . . federalism and
comity concerns . . . it would seem particularly strange to
disregard state . . . rules that are substantially similar to
those to which we give full force in our own courts.”).
States may hesitate to create determinate statutory penal
ties in the future if they are impotent to prevent federal
court distortion of the remedy they have shaped.11
By finding a conflict without considering whether Rule
23 rationally should be read to avoid any collision, the
Court unwisely and unnecessarily retreats from the feder
alism principles undergirding Erie. Had the Court re
flected on the respect for state regulatory interests en
dorsed in our decisions, it would have found no cause to
interpret Rule 23 so woodenly—and every reason not to do
so. Cf. Traynor, 37 Tex. L. Rev., at 669 (“It is bad enough

11 States have adopted a variety of formulations to limit the use of

unforgiveable when inquiry might have revealed that
there was no real conflict.”).
II
Because I perceive no unavoidable conflict between Rule
23 and §901(b), I would decide this case by inquiring
“whether application of the [state] rule would have so
important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the
litigants that failure to [apply] it would be likely to cause a
plaintiff to choose the federal court.” Hanna, 380 U. S., at
468, n. 9. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 428.
Seeking to pretermit that inquiry, Shady Grove urges
that the class-action bar in §901(b) must be regarded as
“procedural” because it is contained in the CPLR, which
“govern[s] the procedure in civil judicial proceedings in all
courts of the state.” Brief for Petitioner 34 (quoting CPLR
§101; emphasis in original). Placement in the CPLR is
hardly dispositive. The provision held “substantive” for
Erie purposes in Gasperini is also contained in the CPLR
(§5501(c)), as are limitations periods, §201 et seq., pre
scriptions plainly “substantive” for Erie purposes however
they may be characterized for other purposes, see York,
326 U. S., at 109–112. See also, e.g., 1 Restatement (Sec
ond) of Conflict of Laws §133, Reporter’s Note, p. 369
(1969) (hereinafter Restatement) (“Under the rule of Erie
. . . the federal courts have classified the burden of persua
sion as to contributory negligence as a matter of substan
tive law that is governed by the rule of the State in which
they sit even though the courts of that State have charac
terized their rule as procedural for choice-of-law pur
poses.”); Cook, “Substance” and “Procedure” in the Conflict
of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333 (1933).
Shady Grove also ranks §901(b) as “procedural” because
“nothing in [the statute] suggests that it is limited to
rights of action based on New York state law, as opposed
to federal law or the law of other states”; instead it “ap

plies to actions seeking penalties under any statute.” Brief
for Petitioner 35–36. See also ante, at 17–18 (STEVENS, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (Section
901(b) cannot “be understood as a rule that . . . serves the
function of defining New York’s rights or remedies” because
its “text . . . expressly and unambiguously applies not only
to claims based on New York law but also to claims based on
federal law or the law of any other State.”).
It is true that §901(b) is not specifically limited to claims
arising under New York law. But neither is it expressly
extended to claims arising under foreign law. The rule
prescribes, without elaboration either way, that “an action
to recover a penalty . . . may not be maintained as a class
action.” We have often recognized that “general words”
appearing in a statute may, in fact, have limited applica
tion; “[t]he words ‘any person or persons,’ ” for example,
“are broad enough to comprehend every human being.
But general words must not only be limited to cases within
the jurisdiction of the state, but also to those objects to
which the legislature intended to apply them.” United
States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 631 (1818) (opinion for the
Court by Marshall, C. J.). See also Small v. United States,
544 U. S. 385, 388 (2005) (“In law, a legislature that uses
the statutory phrase ‘any person’ may or may not mean to
include ‘persons’ outside the jurisdiction of the state.”
(some internal quotation marks omitted)); Flora v. United
States, 362 U. S. 145, 149 (1960) (The term “ ‘any sum’ is a
catchall [phrase,] . . . but to say this is not to define what
it catches.”).
Moreover, Shady Grove overlooks the most likely expla
nation for the absence of limiting language: New York
legislators make law with New York plaintiffs and defen
dants in mind, i.e., as if New York were the universe. See
Baxter, Choice of Law and the Federal System, 16 Stan.
L. Rev. 1, 11 (1963) (“[L]awmakers often speak in univer

to their constituents.”); cf. Smith v. United States, 507
U. S. 197, 204, n. 5 (1993) (presumption against extrater
ritoriality rooted in part in “the commonsense notion that
Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in
mind”).
The point was well put by Brainerd Currie in his semi
nal article on governmental interest analysis in conflict-oflaws cases. The article centers on a now-archaic Massa
chusetts law that prevented married women from binding
themselves by contract as sureties for their husbands.
Discussing whether the Massachusetts prescription ap
plied to transactions involving foreign factors (a foreign
forum, foreign place of contracting, or foreign parties),
Currie observed:
“When the Massachusetts legislature addresses itself
to the problem of married women as sureties, the un
developed image in its mind is that of Massachusetts
married women, husbands, creditors, transactions,
courts, and judgments. In the history of AngloAmerican law the domestic case has been normal, the
conflict-of-laws case marginal.” Married Women’s
Contracts: A Study in Conflict-of-Laws Method, 25 U.
Chi. L. Rev. 227, 231 (1958) (emphasis added).
Shady Grove’s suggestion that States must specifically
limit their laws to domestic rights of action if they wish
their enactments to apply in federal diversity litigation
misses the obvious point: State legislators generally do not
focus on an interstate setting when drafting statutes.12
——————
12 Shady Grove’s argument that §901(b) is procedural based on its
possible application to foreign claims is also out of sync with our Erie
decisions, many of them involving state statutes of similarly unquali
fied scope. The New Jersey law at issue in Cohen v. Beneficial Indus
trial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 544, n. 1 (1949), for example, required
plaintiffs to post a bond as security for costs in “any [stockholder’s
derivative] action.” (quoting 1945 N. J. Laws ch. 131 (emphasis

Shady Grove also observes that a New York court has
applied §901(b) to a federal claim for relief under the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), 47
U. S. C. §227, see Rudgayzer & Gratt v. Cape Canaveral
Tour & Travel, Inc., 22 App. Div. 3d 148, 799 N. Y. S. 2d
795 (2005), thus revealing §901(b)’s “procedural” cast.
Brief for Petitioner 36. We note first that the TCPA itself
calls for the application of state law. See Rudgayzer, 22
App. Div. 3d, at 149–150, 799 N. Y. S. 2d, at 796–797
(federal action authorized in state court “if otherwise
permitted by the laws or rules of the court of [the] State”
(quoting 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3))). See also Gottlieb v.
Carnival Corp., 436 F. 3d 335, 342 (CA2 2006) (Sotomayor,
J.) (“Congress sought, via the TCPA, to enact the func
tional equivalent of a state law.”). The TCPA, the Su
preme Court of Connecticut has recognized, thus “carves
out an exception to th[e] general rule” that “when Erie . . .
is reversed . . . , a state court hearing a federal case is
normally required to apply federal substantive law”: “Un
der §227(b)(3) . . . it is state substantive law that deter
mines, as a preliminary matter, whether a federal action
under the act may be brought in state court.” Weber v.
U. S. Sterling Securities, Inc., 282 Conn. 722, 736, 924

added)). See also, e.g., Walker, 446 U. S., at 742–743, and n. 4 (Okla
homa statute deemed “[a]n action” commenced for purposes of the
statute of limitations upon service of the summons (quoting Okla. Stat.,
Tit. 12, §97 (1971)). Our characterization of a state statute as substan
tive for Erie purposes has never hinged on whether the law applied only
to domestic causes of action. To the contrary, we have ranked as
substantive a variety of state laws that the state courts apply to federal
and out-of-state claims, including statutes of limitations and burden-of
proof prescriptions. See infra, at 21.


Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)

GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Moreover, statutes qualify as “substantive” for Erie
purposes even when they have “procedural” thrusts as
well. See, e.g., Cohen, 337 U. S., at 555; cf. Woods v. Inter
state Realty Co., 337 U. S. 535, 536–538, and n. 1 (1949)
(holding diversity case must be dismissed based on state
statute that, by its terms, governed only proceedings in
state court). Statutes of limitations are, again, exemplary.
They supply “substantive” law in diversity suits, see York,
326 U. S., at 109–112, even though, as Shady Grove ac
knowledges, state courts often apply the forum’s limita
tions period as a “procedural” bar to claims arising under
the law of another State, see Reply Brief 24, n. 16; Tr. of
Oral Arg. 16–17. See also Restatement §§142–143 (when
adjudicating a foreign cause of action, State may use
either its own or the foreign jurisdiction’s statute of limi
tations, whichever is shorter). Similarly, federal courts
sitting in diversity give effect to state laws governing the
burden of proving contributory negligence, see Palmer v.
Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 177 (1943), yet state courts adju
dicating foreign causes of action often apply their own
local law to this issue. See Restatement §133 and Re
porter’s Note.
In short, Shady Grove’s effort to characterize §901(b) as
simply “procedural” cannot successfully elide this funda
mental norm: When no federal law or rule is dispositive of
an issue, and a state statute is outcome affective in the
sense our cases on Erie (pre- and post-Hanna) develop, the
Rules of Decision Act commands application of the State’s
law in diversity suits. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 428;
Hanna, 380 U. S., at 468, n. 9; York, 326 U. S., at 109. As
this case starkly demonstrates, if federal courts exercising
diversity jurisdiction are compelled by Rule 23 to award
statutory penalties in class actions while New York courts
are bound by §901(b)’s proscription, “substantial varia
tions between state and federal [money judgments] may be
expected.” Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 430 (quoting Hanna,


22

SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.

GINSBURG, J., dissenting

380 U. S., at 467–468 (internal quotation marks omitted)).
The “variation” here is indeed “substantial.” Shady Grove
seeks class relief that is ten thousand times greater than
the individual remedy available to it in state court. As the
plurality acknowledges, ante, at 22, forum shopping will
undoubtedly result if a plaintiff need only file in federal
instead of state court to seek a massive monetary award
explicitly barred by state law. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at
431 (“Erie precludes a recovery in federal court signifi
cantly larger than the recovery that would have been
tolerated in state court.”).13 The “accident of diversity of
citizenship,” Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U. S.
487, 496 (1941), should not subject a defendant to such
augmented liability. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at 467 (“The
Erie rule is rooted in part in a realization that it would be
unfair for the character or result of a litigation materially
to differ because the suit had been brought in a federal
court.”).
It is beyond debate that “a statutory cap on damages
would supply substantive law for Erie purposes.”
Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 428. See also id., at 439–440
(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“A state-law ceiling on allowable
damages . . . is a substantive rule of decision that federal
courts must apply in diversity cases governed by New

13 In

contrast, many “state rules ostensibly addressed to procedure,”
ante, at 10 (majority opinion)—including pleading standards and rules
governing summary judgment, pretrial discovery, and the admissibility
of certain evidence—would not so hugely impact forum choices. It is
difficult to imagine a scenario that would promote more forum shopping
than one in which the difference between filing in state and federal
court is the difference between a potential award of $500 and one of
$5,000,000.

ness of a jury verdict was designed to provide a control
analogous to a damages cap. Id., at 429. The statute was
framed as “a procedural instruction,” we noted, “but the
State’s objective [wa]s manifestly substantive.” Ibid.
Gasperini’s observations apply with full force in this
case. By barring the recovery of statutory damages in a
class action, §901(b) controls a defendant’s maximum
liability in a suit seeking such a remedy. The remedial
provision could have been written as an explicit cap: “In
any class action seeking statutory damages, relief is lim
ited to the amount the named plaintiff would have recov
ered in an individual suit.” That New York’s Legislature
used other words to express the very same meaning
should be inconsequential.
We have long recognized the impropriety of displacing,
in a diversity action, state-law limitations on state-created
remedies. See Woods, 337 U. S., at 538 (in a diversity
case, a plaintiff “barred from recovery in the state court
. . . should likewise be barred in the federal court”); York,
326 U. S., at 108–109 (federal court sitting in diversity
“cannot afford recovery if the right to recover is made
unavailable by the State nor can it substantively affect the
enforcement of the right as given by the State”). Just as
Erie precludes a federal court from entering a deficiency
judgment when a State has “authoritatively announced
that [such] judgments cannot be secured within its bor
ders,” Angel v. Bullington, 330 U. S. 183, 191 (1947), so too
Erie should prevent a federal court from awarding statu
tory penalties aggregated through a class action when
New York prohibits this recovery. See also Ragan, 337
U. S., at 533 (“Where local law qualifies or abridges [a
claim], the federal court must follow suit. Otherwise there
is a different measure of the cause of action in one court
than in the other, and the principle of Erie . . . is trans
gressed.”). In sum, because “New York substantive law
governs [this] claim for relief, New York law . . . guide[s]

III
The Court’s erosion of Erie’s federalism grounding im
pels me to point out the large irony in today’s judgment.
Shady Grove is able to pursue its claim in federal court
only by virtue of the recent enactment of the Class Action
Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U. S. C. §1332(d). In
CAFA, Congress opened federal-court doors to state-law
based class actions so long as there is minimal diversity,
at least 100 class members, and at least $5,000,000 in
controversy. Ibid. By providing a federal forum, Congress
sought to check what it considered to be the overreadiness
of some state courts to certify class actions. See, e.g.,
S. Rep. No. 109–14, p. 4 (2005) (CAFA prevents lawyers
from “gam[ing] the procedural rules [to] keep nationwide
or multi-state class actions in state courts whose judges
have reputations for readily certifying classes.” (internal
quotation marks omitted)); id., at 22 (disapproving “the ‘I
never met a class action I didn’t like’ approach to class
certification” that “is prevalent in state courts in some
localities”). In other words, Congress envisioned fewer—
not more—class actions overall. Congress surely never
anticipated that CAFA would make federal courts a mecca
for suits of the kind Shady Grove has launched: class
actions seeking state-created penalties for claims arising
under state law—claims that would be barred from class
treatment in the State’s own courts. Cf. Woods, 337 U. S.,
at 537 (“[T]he policy of Erie . . . preclude[s] maintenance in

14 There

is no question that federal courts can “give effect to the sub
stantive thrust of [§901(b)] without untoward alteration of the federal
scheme for the trial and decision of civil cases.” Gasperini, 518 U. S., at
426. There is no risk that individual plaintiffs seeking statutory
penalties will flood federal courts with state-law claims that could be
managed more efficiently on a class basis; the diversity statute’s
amount-in-controversy requirement ensures that small state-law
disputes remain in state court.
