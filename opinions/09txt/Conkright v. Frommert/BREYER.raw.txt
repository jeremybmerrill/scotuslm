SALLY L. CONKRIGHT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. PAUL
J. FROMMERT ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[April 21, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and
JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.
I agree with the Court that “[p]eople make mistakes,”
ante, at 1, but I do not share its view of the law applicable
to those mistakes. To explain my view, I shall describe the
three significant mistakes involved in this case.
I

A

The first mistake is that of Xerox Corporation’s pension
plan (Plan) and its administrators (collectively, Plan
Administrator), petitioners here. The Plan, as I under­
stand it, pays employees the highest of three benefits upon
retirement. App. 29a–31a. These benefits are calculated
as follows (I simplify and use my own words, not those of
the Plan):
(1) “The Pension”: Take your average salary for your
five highest salary years at Xerox; multiply by 1.4 per­
cent; and multiply again by the number of years you
worked at Xerox (up to 30). Id., at 7a–11a, 29a–30a.
Thus, if the average salary of your five highest paid
years was $50,000 and you worked at Xerox for 30
years, you would be entitled to receive $21,000 per
year ($50,000 × 1.4 percent × 30).
(2) “The Cash Account”: Every year, Xerox credits 5

CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

percent of your salary to a cash account. Id., at 40a.
This account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate 1
percent above the 1-year Treasury bill rate. Id., at
41a. To determine your benefits under this approach,
take the balance of your cash account and convert the
final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a. Thus, if you
have accrued, say, $200,000 in your account and the
relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is
7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approxi­
mately $14,000 per year upon your retirement (ap­
proximately $200,000 ×7 percent).
(3) “The Investment Account”: Before 1990, Xerox
contributed to an employee profit sharing plan. Id., at
33a–34a. Thus, all employees who were hired by the
end of 1989 have an investment account that consists
of all of the contributions Xerox made to this profit
sharing plan (prior to its discontinuation) and the in­
vestment returns on those contributions. Id., at 33a–
36a. To determine your benefits under this approach,
take the balance of your investment account and con­
vert the final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a.
Thus, just like the cash account, if you have accrued
$400,000 in your account and the relevant annuity
rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you
would be entitled to receive approximately $28,000
per year upon your retirement (approximately
$400,000 × 7 percent).
Given these three examples, the retiring employee’s pen­
sion would come from the investment account, and the
employee would receive $28,000 per year.
This case concerns one aspect of Xerox’s retirement
plan, namely, the way in which the Plan treats employees
who leave Xerox and later return, working for additional
years before their ultimate retirement. The Plan has long
treated such leaving-and-returning employees as follows

3

BREYER, J., dissenting

(again, I simplify and use my own words):
First, when an employee initially leaves, she is paid a
lump-sum distribution equivalent to the benefits she has
accrued up to that point (i.e., the highest of her pension,
her cash account, or, if she was hired before the end of
1989, her investment account). See ante, at 2.
Second, when the employee returns, she again begins to
accrue amounts in her cash account, App. 40a–41a, start­
ing from scratch. (She accrues nothing in her investment
account, because Xerox no longer makes profit sharing
contributions. Id., at 34a.) Thus, by the time of her re­
tirement the employee may not have accrued much money
in this account.
Third, a rehired employee’s pension is calculated in the
way I have set forth above, with her entire tenure at Xerox
(both before her departure and after her return) taken into
account. See Brief for Petitioners 9–10.
Fourth, the employee’s benefits calculation is adjusted
to take account of the fact that the employee has already
received a lump-sum distribution from the Plan. See App.
32a; Brief for Petitioners 10–11.
This case is about the adjustment that takes place dur­
ing step four. It concerns the way in which the Plan Ad­
ministrator calculates that adjustment so as to reflect the
fact that a retiring leaving-and-returning employee has
already received a distribution when she initially left
Xerox. Before 1989, the Plan Administrator calculated the
adjusted amount by taking the benefits distribution previ­
ously received (say, $100,000) and adjusting it to equal the
amount that would have existed in the investment account
had no distribution been made. Ibid. Thus, if an employee
had not left Xerox, and if the $100,000 had been left in her
investment account for, say, 20 years, that amount would
likely have increased dramatically—perhaps doubling,
tripling, or quadrupling in amount, depending upon how
well the Plan’s investments performed.

CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

It is this hypothetical sum—termed the “phantom ac­
count,” ante, at 2—that is at issue in this case. Xerox’s
pre-1989 Plan assumed that a rehired employee had this
hypothetical sum on hand at the time of her final retire­
ment from the company, and in effect subtracted the
amount from the employee’s benefits upon her departure.
Brief for Petitioners 10–11; cf. ante, at 2. Depending on
how the Plan’s investments did over time, the Administra­
tor’s use of this “phantom account” could have a substan­
tial impact on a rehired employee’s benefits. (See Appen­
dix, infra, for an example of how this “phantom account”
works.)
When the Plan Administrator amended Xerox’s Em­
ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)
Plan in 1989, however, it made what it tells us was an
“inadverten[t]” omission. Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 3. In
a section of the 1989 Plan applicable to the roughly 100
leaving-and-returning employees who are plaintiffs here,
the Plan said that it would “offset” the retiring employees’
“accrued benefit” (as ordinarily calculated) “by the accrued
benefit attributable” to the prior lump-sum “distribution”
those employees received when they initially left Xerox.
App. 32a. But the Plan said nothing about how it would
calculate this “offset.” In other words, the Plan said noth­
ing about the Administrator’s use of the “phantom ac­
count.”
This led to the first mistake in this case. Despite the
Plan’s failure to include language explaining how the
Administrator would take into account an employee’s prior
distribution, the Plan Administrator continued to employ
the “phantom account” methodology. In essence, the
Administrator read the 1989 Plan to include the language
that had been omitted—an interpretation that, as de­
scribed below, see Part I–B, infra, the Court of Appeals
found to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of
ERISA.

B
The District Court committed the second mistake in this
case. In 1999, the respondents, nearly 100 employees who
left and were later rehired by Xerox, brought this lawsuit.
Ante, at 2; Brief for Petitioners ii–iii, 12. They pointed out
that the 1989 Plan said that it would decrease their re­
tirement benefits to reflect the fact that they had already
received a lump-sum benefits distribution when they
initially left Xerox. But, they added, neither the 1989
Plan, nor the 1989 Plan’s Summary Plan Description, said
anything about whether (or how) the Administrator would
adjust their previous benefits distribution to take into
account that they had received the distribution well before
their retirement. They thus claimed that the Plan Admin­
istrator could not use the “phantom account” methodology
to adjust their previous distributions. See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 4–5.
The District Court, however, rejected respondents’
claims. 328 F. Supp. 2d 420 (WDNY 2004). The court
accepted the Administrator’s argument that the 1989 Plan
implicitly incorporated the “phantom account” approach
that had previously been part of Xerox’s retirement plan.
Id., at 433–434. And the court thus held in favor of peti­
tioners—thereby committing the second mistake in this
case. Id., at 439.
On appeal, the Second Circuit disagreed with the Dis­
trict Court and vacated the District Court’s decision in
relevant part. 433 F. 3d 254 (2006). The Court of Appeals
concluded that, because the 1989 Plan said nothing about
how the Administrator would adjust the previous benefits
distributions, it was “arbitrary and capricious” for the
Administrator to interpret the 1989 Plan as if it still in­
corporated the “phantom account.” Id., at 265–266, and
n. 11. And the Court of Appeals thus held that the lan­
guage of the Plan and the Summary Plan Description, at
the least, violated ERISA by failing to provide respondents

CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

with fair notice that the Administrator was going to use
the “phantom account” approach. See id., at 265 (discuss­
ing 29 U. S. C. §1022); see also 433 F. 3d, at 263, 267–268
(holding that the Administrator’s attempt to apply the
“phantom account” to respondents violated two other
ERISA provisions: 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)’s notice require­
ment and §1054(g)’s prohibition on retroactive benefit
cutbacks). Rather, the court noted, respondents “likely
believed”—based on the language of the Plan—“that their
past distributions would only be factored into their [cur­
rent] benefits calculations by taking into account the
amounts they had actually received.” 433 F. 3d, at 267.
In light of these conclusions, the Court of Appeals rec­
ognized the need to devise a remedy for the Administra­
tor’s abuse of discretion and ERISA violations—a remedy
that took into account the previous benefits distributions
respondents had received in a manner consistent with the
1989 Plan. The court therefore remanded the case to the
District Court, with the following instructions:
“On remand, the remedy crafted by the district court
for those employees [in the respondents’ situation]
should utilize an appropriate [pre-1989 Plan] calcula­
tion to determine their benefits. We recognize the dif­
ficulty that this task poses . . . . As guidance for the
district court, we suggest that it may wish to employ
equitable principles when determining the appropri­
ate calculation and fashioning the appropriate rem­
edy.” Id., at 268.
On remand, the District Court invited the parties to
submit remedial recommendations. Brief for Petitioners
14. The Plan Administrator proposed an approach that
would adjust respondents’ previous benefits distributions
by adding interest, and, as a fallback, the Administrator
suggested that the Plan should treat respondents as new
hires. Ante, at 3; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae

BREYER, J., dissenting

6–7. The District Court rejected these suggestions and
concluded that the “appropriate” remedy was the one
suggested by the Second Circuit: no adjustment to the
prior distributions received by respondents.
472
F. Supp. 2d 452, 458 (WDNY 2007). The court stated that
this remedy was “straightforward; it adequately pre­
vent[ed] employees from receiving a windfall[;] and . . . it
most clearly reflect[ed] what a reasonable employee would
have anticipated based on the not-very-clear language in
the Plan.” Ibid. And the Court of Appeals, finding that
the District Court did not abuse its discretion in crafting a
remedy, affirmed. 535 F. 3d 111 (CA2 2008).
II
The third mistake, I believe, is the Court’s. As the
majority recognizes, ante, at 4, “principles of trust law”
guide this Court in “determining the appropriate stan­
dard” by which to review the actions of an ERISA plan
administrator. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489
U. S. 101, 111–113 (1989); see also Metropolitan Life Ins.
Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 4);
Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 218–219
(2004); Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pen
sion Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559, 570
(1985). And, as the majority also recognizes, ante, at 4,
where an ERISA plan grants an administrator the discre­
tionary authority to interpret plan terms, trust law re
quires a court to defer to the plan administrator’s inter­
pretation of plan terms. See, e.g., Glenn, supra, at ____
(slip op., at 4). But the majority further concludes that
trust law “does not resolve the specific issue before” the
Court in this case—i.e., whether a court is required to
defer to an administrator’s second attempt at interpreting
plan documents, even after the court has already deter­
mined that the administrator’s first attempt amounted to
an abuse of discretion. Ante, at 9. In my view, this final

CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

conclusion is erroneous, as trust law imposes no such rigid
and inflexible requirement.
The Second Circuit found the Administrator’s interpre­
tation of the Plan to be arbitrary and capricious and in
violation of ERISA, and it made clear that the District
Court’s task on remand was to “craf[t]” a “remedy.” See
433 F. 3d, at 268. Trust law treatise writers say that in
these circumstances a court may (but need not) exercise its
own discretion rather than defer to a trustee’s interpreta­
tion of trust language. See G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of
Trusts and Trustees §560, pp. 222–223 (2d rev. ed. 1980)
(hereinafter Bogert & Bogert) (after finding an abuse of
discretion, a court may “decid[e] for the trustee how he
should act,” possibly by “stating the exact result” the court
“desires to achieve”); see also 2 Restatement (Third) of
Trusts §50, p. 258 (2001) (hereinafter Third Restatement)
(“A discretionary power conferred upon the trustee . . . is
subject to judicial control only to prevent misinterpreta­
tion or abuse of the discretion by the trustee”); 1 Restate­
ment (Second) of Trusts §187, p. 402 (1957) (hereinafter
Second Restatement) (“Where discretion is conferred upon
the trustee . . . , its exercise is not subject to control by the
court, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his
discretion”); see also Firestone, supra, at 111. Judges
deciding trust law cases have said the same. See, e.g.,
Colton v. Colton, 127 U. S. 300, 322 (1888) (stating that it
was the “duty of the court” to determine the trust pay­
ments due after rejecting the trustee’s interpretation);
State v. Rubion, 158 Tex. 43, 55, 308 S. W. 2d 4, 11 (1957)
(“Considering that we have held that there has already
been an abuse of discretion by the trustee . . . , we have
concluded that a remand of the case to the trial court for
the definite establishment of amounts to be paid will
better promote a speedy administration of justice and a
final termination of this litigation”); Glenn, supra, at ____
(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5) (court may exercise

BREYER, J., dissenting

discretion under trust law when a “trustee had discretion
but abused it”). In short, the controlling trust law princi­
ple appears to be that, “[w]here the court finds that there
has been an abuse of a discretionary power, the decree to
be rendered is in its discretion.” Bogert & Bogert §560, at
222.
Of course, the fact that trust law grants courts discre­
tion does not mean that they will exercise that discretion
in all instances. The majority refers to the 2007 edition of
Scott on Trusts, ante, at 6, which says that, if there is “no
reason” to doubt that a trustee “will . . . fairly exercise” his
“discretion,” then courts “ordinarily will not fix the
amount” of a payment “but will instead direct the trustee
to make reasonable provision for the beneficiary’s sup­
port,” 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and
Ascher on Trusts §18.2.1, pp. 1348–1349 (5th ed. 2007)
(emphasis added). As this passage demonstrates, there
are situations in which a court will typically defer to a
trustee’s remedial suggestion.
The word “ordinarily”
confirms, however, that the Scott treatise writers recog­
nize that there are instances in which courts will not
defer. And other treatises indicate that black letter trust
law gives the district courts authority to decide which
instances are which. See Bogert & Bogert §560, at 222–
223 (when there is an abuse of discretion, a court “may set
aside the transaction,” “award damages to the benefici­
ary,” or “order a new decision to be made in the light of
rules expounded by the court”); 2 Third Restatement §50,
and Comment b, at 261 (discussing similar remedial op­
tions); 1 Second Restatement §187, and Comment b, at
402 (same); see also 3 Third Restatement §87, and Com­
ment c, at 244–245 (noting that “judicial intervention on
the ground of abuse” is allowed when a “good-faith,” yet
“unreasonable,” decision is made by a trustee); Rubion,
supra, at 54–55, 308 S. W. 2d, at 11 (discussing a court’s
remedial options).


10

CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

Nevertheless, the majority reads the Scott treatise as
establishing an absolute requirement that courts defer to
a trustee’s fallback position absent “reason to believe that
[the trustee] will not exercise [his] discretion fairly—for
example, upon a showing that the trustee has already
acted in bad faith.” Ante, at 6. And based on this reading,
the majority further concludes that the existence of the
Scott treatise creates uncertainty as to whether, under
basic trust law principles, a court has the power to craft a
remedy for a trustee’s abuse of discretion. Ante, at 6–9.
It is unclear to me, however, why the majority reads the
passage from Scott as creating a war among treatise writ­
ers, compare ante, at 6 (discussing Scott) with ante, at 8
(discussing Bogert), when the relevant passages can so
easily be read as consistent with one another. I simply
read the Scott treatise language as identifying circum­
stances in which courts typically choose to defer to an
administrator’s fallback position. The treatise does not
suggest that the law forbids a court from acting on its own
in the exercise of its broad remedial authority—authority
that trust law plainly grants to supervising courts. See
supra, at 8–9.
A closer look at the Scott treatise confirms this under­
standing. The treatise cites seven cases in support of the
passage upon which the majority relies. See 3 Scott
§18.2.1, at 1349, n. 4. Three of these cases explicitly state
that a court may exercise its discretion to craft a remedy if
a trustee has previously abused its discretion. See Old
Colony Trust Co. v. Rodd, 356 Mass. 584, 589, 254 N. E.
2d 886, 889 (1970) (“A court of equity may control a trus­
tee in the exercise of a fiduciary discretion if it fails to
observe standards of judgment apparent from the applica­
ble instrument”); In re Marre’s Estate, 18 Cal. 2d 184, 190,
114 P. 2d 586, 590–591 (1941) (“It is well settled that the
courts will not attempt to exercise discretion which has
been confided to a trustee unless it is clear that the trustee

BREYER, J., dissenting

has abused his discretion in some manner” (emphasis
added)); In re Ferrall’s Estate, 92 Cal. App. 2d 712, 716–
717, 207 P. 2d 1077, 1079–1080 (1949) (following In re
Marre’s Estate). Three other cases are inapposite because
their circumstances do not involve any allegation of abuse
of discretion by the trustee. See In re Ziegler’s Trusts, 157
So. 2d 549, 550 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1963) (per curiam)
(“There is no contention here that the court . . . would not
retain its rights, upon appropriate petition or other plead­
ings by an interested party, to review an alleged abuse, if
any, of the discretion exercised by the trustees”); In re
Grubel’s Will, 37 Misc. 2d 910, 911, 235 N. Y. S. 2d 21, 23
(Surr. Ct. 1962) (stating that “in the first instance” it is
the “proper function of the trustees” to set an amount to be
paid (emphasis added)); Orr v. Moses, 94 N. H. 309, 312,
52 A. 2d 128, 130 (1947) (declining to construe will be­
cause none “of the parties now assert claims adverse to
any position taken by the trustee”). In the final case, the
court decided that, on the facts before it, it did not need to
control the trustees’ discretion. See Estate of Stillman,
107 Misc. 2d 102, 111, 433 N. Y. S. 2d 701 (Surr. Ct. 1980)
(“The fine record of the trustees in enhancing the equity of
these trusts while earning substantial income, also per­
suades the court of the wisdom of retaining their services
as fiduciaries”). Which of these cases says that, after the
trustee has abused its discretion, a district court must still
defer to the trustee? None of them do. I repeat: Not a
single case cited by the Scott treatise writers supports the
majority’s reading of the treatise.
The majority seeks to justify its reading of the Scott
treatise by referring to four cases that Scott does not cite.
See ante, at 7, n. 1. I am not surprised that the treatise
does not refer to these cases. In the first three, a court
thought it best, when a trustee had not yet exercised
judgment about a particular matter, to direct the trustee
to do so. See In re Sullivan’s Will, 144 Neb. 36, 40–41, 12


12

CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

N. W. 2d 148, 150–151 (1943) (finding that the trustees’
“failure to act” was erroneous, and directing the trustees
to exercise their discretion in setting a payment amount);
Eaton v. Eaton, 82 N. H. 216, 218, 132 A. 10, 11 (1926)
(same); Finch v. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., 156 N. C.
App. 343, 347–348, 577 S. E. 2d 306, 309–310 (2003) (hold­
ing trustee erred by “[f]ail[ing] to exercise judgment,” and
directing it to do so). The fourth case concerns circum­
stances so distant from those before us that it is difficult to
know what to say. (The question was whether the benefi­
ciary of a small trust had title in certain trust assets or
whether the trustee had discretionary power to allocate
them in her best interest; the court held the latter, adding
that, if the trustee acted unreasonably, the lower court in
that particular case should seek to have the trustee re­
moved rather than trying to administer the trust funds
itself.) See Hanford v. Clancy, 87 N. H. 458, 460–461, 183
A. 271, 272–273 (1936).
I cannot read these four cases, or any other case to
which the majority refers, as holding that a court, as a
general matter, is required to defer to a trust administra­
tor’s second attempt at exercising discretion. And I am
aware of no such case. In contrast, the Restatement and
Bogert and Scott treatises identify numerous cases in
which courts have remedied a trustee’s abuse of discretion
by ordering the trustee to pay a specific amount. See 2
Third Restatement §50, Reporter’s Note, at 283 (citing
cases such as Coker v. Coker, 208 Ala. 354, 94 So. 566
(1922)); Bogert & Bogert §560, at 223, n. 19 (citing cases
such as Rubion); 3 Scott §18.2.1, at 1348–1349, nn. 3–4
(citing cases such as Emmert v. Old Nat. Bank of Martins
burg, 162 W. Va. 48, 246 S. E. 2d 236 (1978)); see also
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18 (listing cases).
I thus do not find trust law “unclear” on this matter. Ante,
at 6. When a trustee abuses its discretion, trust law
grants courts the authority either to defer anew to the

13

BREYER, J., dissenting

trustee’s discretion or to craft a remedy. See, e.g., 3 A.
Scott & W. Fratcher, Scott on Trusts §187, pp. 14–15 (4th
ed. 1988) (“This ordinarily means that so long as [the
trustee] acts not only in good faith and from proper mo­
tives, but also within the bounds of reasonable judgment,
the court will not interfere; but the court will interfere when he acts outside the bounds of a reasonable
judgment”).
Nor does anything in the present case suggest that the
District Court abused its remedial authority. The Second
Circuit stated that the interpretive problem on remand
was in essence a remedial problem. See 433 F. 3d, at 268.
It added that the remedial problem was “difficul[t]” and
that “the district court . . . may wish to employ equitable
principles when determining the appropriate calculation
and fashioning the appropriate remedy.” Ibid. The Ad­
ministrator had previously abused his discretionary
power. Id., at 265–268. And the District Court found that
the Administrator’s primary remedial suggestion on re­
mand—adjusting respondents’ previous benefits distribu­
tions by adding interest—probably would have violated
ERISA’s notice provisions. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. Under
these circumstances, the District Court reasonably could
have found a need to use its own remedial judgment,
rather than rely on the Administrator’s—which is just
what the Second Circuit said. 535 F. 3d, at 119.
Moreover, even if the “narrow” trust law “question
before us” were difficult, ante, at 6—which it is not—this
difficulty would not excuse the Court from trying to do its
best to work out a legal solution that nonetheless respects
basic principles of trust law. “Congress invoked the com­
mon law of trusts” in enacting ERISA, and this Court has
thus repeatedly looked to trust law in order to determine
“the particular duties and powers” of ERISA plan adminis­
trators. Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas

570–572 (1985); see also, e.g., Glenn, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 4); Davila, 542 U. S., at 218–219; Firestone, 489
U. S., at 111–113. While, as the majority recognizes, ante,
at 8, trust law may “not tell the entire story,” Varity Corp.
v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996), I am aware of no other
case in which this Court has simply ignored trust law (on
the basis that it was unclear) and crafted a legal rule
based on nothing but “the guiding principles we have
identified underlying ERISA,” ante, at 9. See Varity,
supra, at 497 (“In some instances, trust law will offer only
a starting point, after which courts must go on to ask
whether, or to what extent, the language of the statute, its
structure, or its purposes require departing from common­
law trust requirements” (emphasis added)).
In any event, it is far from clear that the Court’s legal
rule reflects an appropriate analysis of ERISA-based
policy. To the contrary, the majority’s absolute “one free
honest mistake” rule is impractical, for it requires courts
to determine what is “honest,” encourages appeals on the
point, and threatens to delay further proceedings that
already take too long. (Respondents initially filed this
retirement benefits case in 1999.) See Glenn, supra, at ___
(slip op., at 10). It also ignores what we previously have
pointed out—namely, that abuses of discretion “arise in
too many contexts” and “concern too many circumstances”
for this Court “to come up with a one-size-fits-all proce­
dural [approach] that is likely to promote fair and accu­
rate” benefits determinations. Ibid. And, finally, the
majority’s approach creates incentives for administrators
to take “one free shot” at employer-favorable plan inter­
pretations and to draft ambiguous retirement plans in the
first instance with the expectation that they will have
repeated opportunities to interpret (and possibly reinter­
pret) the ambiguous terms. I thus fail to see how the
majority’s “one free honest mistake” approach furthers
ERISA’s core purpose of “promot[ing] the interests of

employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit
plans.” Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 90
(1983); see also, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §1001(b) (noting that
ERISA was enacted “to protect . . . employee benefit plans
and their beneficiaries”); Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoone
jongen, 514 U. S. 73, 83 (1995) (discussing ERISA’s central
“goa[l]” of “enab[ing] plan beneficiaries to learn their
rights and obligations at any time”); Massachusetts Mut.
Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 148 (1985) (ERISA
was enacted “to protect contractually defined benefits”).
The majority does identify ERISA-related factors—e.g.,
promoting predictability and uniformity, encouraging
employers to adopt strong plans—that it believes favor
giving more power to plan administrators. See ante, at 9–
13. But, in my view, these factors are, at the least, offset
by the factors discussed above—e.g., discouraging admin­
istrators from writing opaque plans and interpreting them
aggressively—that argue to the contrary. At best, the
policies at issue—some arguing in one direction, some the
other—are far less able than trust law to provide a “guid­
ing principle.” Thus, I conclude that here, as elsewhere,
trust law ultimately provides the best way for courts to
approach the administration and interpretation of ERISA.
See, e.g., Firestone, supra, at 111–113. And trust law
here, as I have said, leaves to the supervising court the
decision as to how much weight to give to a plan adminis­
trator’s remedial opinion.
III
Since the District Court was not required to defer to the
Administrator’s fallback position, I should consider the
second question presented, namely, whether the Court of
Appeals properly reviewed the District Court’s decision
under an “abuse of discretion” standard. Ante, at 4 (ac­
knowledging, but not reaching, this issue). The answer to
this question depends upon how one characterizes the


16

CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

Court of Appeals’ decision. If the court deferred to the
District Court’s interpretation of Plan terms, then the
Court of Appeals most likely should have reviewed the
decision de novo. See Firestone, supra, at 112; cf. Davila,
supra, at 210 (“Any dispute over the precise terms of the
plan is resolved by a court under a de novo review stan­
dard”). If instead the Court of Appeals deferred to the
District Court’s creation of a remedy, in significant part on
the basis of “equitable principles,” then it properly re­
viewed the District Court decision for “abuse of discre­
tion.” See, e.g., Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320
F. 3d 11, 24 (CA1 2003); Zervos v. Verizon N. Y., Inc., 277
F. 3d 635, 648 (CA2 2002); Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere
Life Ins. Co., 237 F. 3d 1154, 1163 (CA9 2001); Halpin v.
W. W. Grainger, Inc., 962 F. 2d 685, 697 (CA7 1992).
The District Court opinion contains language that sup­
ports either characterization. On the one hand, the court
wrote that its task was to “interpret the Plan as written.”
472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. On the other hand, the court said
that “virtually nothing is set forth in either the Plan or the
[Summary Plan Description]” about how to treat prior
distributions; and, in describing its task, it said that the
Court of Appeals had directed it to use “equitable princi­
ples” in fashioning a remedy. Ibid. Ultimately, the Dis­
trict Court appears to have used both the Plan language
and equitable principles to arrive at its conclusion. See
id., at 457–459.
The Court of Appeals, too, used language that supports
both characterizations. Compare 535 F. 3d, at 117 (noting
that the District Court “applied [Plan] terms” in crafting
its remedy), with id., at 117–119 (describing the District
Court’s decision as the “craft[ing]” of a “remedy” and
acknowledging that it had directed the District Court to
use “equitable principles” in doing so). But the Court of
Appeals ultimately treated the District Court’s opinion as
if it primarily created a fair remedy. Ibid. Given the prior

17

BREYER, J., dissenting

Court of Appeals opinion’s language, supra, at 6 (quoting
433 F. 3d, at 268), I believe that view is a fair, indeed a
correct, view. And I consequently believe the Court of
Appeals properly reviewed the result for an “abuse of
discretion.”
Petitioners argue that, because respondents were seek­
ing relief under 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), the Court of
Appeals was, in effect, prohibited from treating the rem­
edy as anything other than an application of a plan’s
terms. Brief for Petitioners 55–56; Reply Brief for Peti­
tioners 3, and n. 8, 16–17. While this provision allows
plaintiffs only to “enforce” or “clarify” rights or to “recover
benefits” “under the terms of the plan,” §1132(a)(1)(B)
(emphasis added), it does not so limit a court’s remedial
authority, Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,
534 U. S. 204, 221 (2002) (In §1132(a)(1)(B), “Congress
authorized ‘a participant or beneficiary’ to bring a civil
action . . . without referenc[ing] whether the relief sought
is legal or equitable”). The provision thus does not pro­
hibit a court from shaping relief through the application of
equitable principles, as trust law plainly permits. See,
e.g., 2 Third Restatement §50, and Comment b, at 261
(discussing remedial options); Bogert & Bogert §870, at
123–126 (2d rev. ed. 1995). Indeed, a court that finds, for
example, that an administrator provided employees with
inadequate notice of a plan’s terms (as was true here) may
have no alternative but to rely significantly upon those
principles. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1104(a)(1)(D) (plan fiduciary
must “discharge his dut[y] . . . in accordance with the
documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as
such documents and instruments are consistent” with
ERISA).
For these reasons I would affirm the decision of the
Court of Appeals. And I therefore respectfully dissent
from the majority’s contrary determination.

APPENDIX

The “Phantom Account” 

This Appendix provides a simplified and illustrative
example of, as I understand it, how the “phantom account”
works. For the purposes of this Appendix, I make the
following assumptions: John worked at Xerox for 10 years
from 1970 to 1980. At the time of his departure from
Xerox, he was issued a lump-sum benefits distribution of
$140,000. He was then rehired in January 1989, and he
worked for Xerox for 5 more years before retiring (until
December 1993), earning $50,000 each year of his second
term of employment. I also assume that (1) Xerox’s con­
tribution to John’s investment account was $2,500 in 1989
(the last year such accounts were offered), (2) Xerox’s
contributions to John’s cash and investment accounts are
always made on the final day of the year, (3) the rate of
return in John’s cash and investment accounts is always 5
percent, and (4) annuity rates are also always 5 percent.
(For the sake of simplicity, I treat all annuities as perpe­
tuities, meaning that I calculate the present value of the
annuities thusly: Present Value = Annual Pay­
ment/Annuity Rate.)
Given the above assumptions, John’s pension upon his
retirement would be $10,500 per year ($50,000 × 1.4 per­
cent × 15 years), which has a present value of $210,000
($10,500/5 percent). John’s cash and investment accounts
at the end of his fifth year would look as follows (While
Xerox’s ERISA Plan did not include cash accounts until
1990, each employee’s opening cash account balance was
credited with the balance of his investment account at the
end of 1989. The figures for John’s cash account in 1989
thus reflect the performance of his investment account. In
addition, all numbers are rounded to the nearest hun­
dred):

Now, as far as I understand it, John’s retirement bene­
fits are calculated as follows, see 433 F. 3d, at 260:
First, the Plan Administrator would choose which of
John’s three accounts would yield him the greatest bene­
fits. In making this comparison, the Plan Administrator
would assume that John had never left Xerox when calcu­
lating John’s pension. The Plan Administrator would also
assume, when calculating the value of John’s cash and
investment accounts, that the lump-sum distribution John
had received from Xerox had remained invested in his
accounts. (In other words, the Plan Administrator would
include the “phantom account” in his calculations. The
total value of this phantom account in 1989, when John
rejoined Xerox, is equal to John’s lump-sum distribution of
$140,000 × 1.059, or approximately $217,200.)
The Plan Administrator would thus compare John’s
pension, column D, and column H to determine John’s
benefit. As you can see above, column H provides the
greatest benefit, so John’s cash account would be used to
calculate the benefits he would receive upon retirement.
Second, the Plan Administrator would “offset” John’s
prior distribution against his current benefits to deter­
mine the amount of benefits John would actually receive.
Thus, the Plan Administrator would take the “total” value
of John’s cash account, including the “phantom account”
($277,800), and subtract out the value of the “phantom


20

B to the opinion of BREYER, J.
AppendixREYER, J., dissenting

account” ($264,000). The total present value of the bene­
fits John would receive upon his second retirement would
thus be $13,800.
This means that John would receive approximately $690
annually ($13,800 × 5 percent) upon retirement under the
Plan Administrator’s “phantom account” approach. In
comparison, if John had simply been treated as a new
employee when he was rehired, his pension would have
entitled him to at least $3,500 annually ($50,000 × 1.4
percent × 5 years) upon his retirement. And the impact of
the “phantom account” may have been even more dramatic
with respect to some of the respondents in this case. See
Brief for Respondents 24 (describing how respondent Paul
Frommert erroneously received a report claiming that his
retirement benefits were $2,482.00 per month, before later
discovering that, because of the “phantom account,” his
actual monthly pension was $5.31 per month); see also
App. 63a.
