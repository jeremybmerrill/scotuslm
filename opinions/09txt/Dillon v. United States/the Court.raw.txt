PERCY DILLON, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[June 17, 2010] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
A federal court generally “may not modify a term of
imprisonment once it has been imposed.” 18 U. S. C.
§3582(c). Congress has provided an exception to that rule
“in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a
term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that
has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Com
mission.” §3582(c)(2). In those circumstances, §3582(c)(2)
authorizes a court to reduce the term of imprisonment “if
such a reduction is consistent with” applicable Commis
sion policy statements. The policy statement governing
§3582(c)(2) proceedings instructs courts not to reduce a
term of imprisonment below the minimum of an amended
sentencing range except to the extent the original term of
imprisonment was below the range then applicable. See
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual
§1B1.10(b)(2) (Nov. 2009) (USSG). This case presents the
question whether our decision in United States v. Booker,
543 U. S. 220 (2005), which rendered the Guidelines advi
sory to remedy the Sixth Amendment problems associated
with a mandatory sentencing regime, requires treating
§1B1.10(b) as nonbinding. We conclude that Booker does


2

DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

not demand that result.
I
The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA or Act), 98
Stat. 1987, established the Sentencing Commission and
authorized it to promulgate Sentencing Guidelines and to
issue policy statements regarding the Guidelines’ applica
tion. See 28 U. S. C. §§991, 994(a). The Act also charged
the Commission with periodically reviewing and revising
the Guidelines. See §994(o). When a revision reduces the
Guidelines range for a given offense, the Commission must
determine “in what circumstances and by what amount
the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment
for the offense may be reduced.” §994(u).
As enacted, the SRA made the Sentencing Guidelines
binding. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 233–234. Except in
limited circumstances, district courts lacked discretion to
depart from the Guidelines range. See Burns v. United
States, 501 U. S. 129, 133 (1991). Under that regime, facts
found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence often
increased the mandatory Guidelines range and permitted
the judge to impose a sentence greater than that sup
ported by the facts established by the jury verdict or guilty
plea. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 235. We held in Booker
that treating the Guidelines as mandatory in these cir
cumstances violated the Sixth Amendment right of crimi
nal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every
element of an offense proved by the Government beyond a
reasonable doubt. Id., at 243–244.
To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the
Guidelines advisory by invalidating two provisions of the
SRA: 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which
generally required a sentencing court to impose a sentence
within the applicable Guidelines range, and §3742(e)
(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the standard of
review on appeal, including de novo review of Guidelines

Opinion of the Court

departures. 543 U. S., at 259. “With these two sections
excised (and statutory cross-references to the two sections
consequently invalidated),” we held that “the remainder of
the Act satisfies the Court’s constitutional requirements.”
Ibid. Booker thus left intact other provisions of the SRA,
including those giving the Commission authority to revise
the Guidelines, 28 U. S. C. §994(o) (2006 ed.), and to de
termine when and to what extent a revision will be retro
active, §994(u).
With respect to drug-trafficking offenses, the Sentencing
Guidelines establish a defendant’s base offense level ac
cording to the type and weight of the drug. See USSG
§§2D1.1(a), (c). When the Commission first promulgated
the Guidelines in 1987, it adopted the 100-to-1 ratio se
lected by Congress in setting mandatory minimum sen
tences in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207.
Under that framework, the Commission “treated every
gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of
powder cocaine.” Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.
85, 96 (2007). The Commission later sought to alleviate
the disparity produced by this ratio. After several failed
attempts at reform, see id., at 99, the Commission in 2007
amended the Guidelines to reduce by two levels the base
offense level associated with each quantity of crack co
caine. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (effective Nov.
1, 2007). In 2008, the Commission made that amendment
retroactive. See id., Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).
When the Commission makes a Guidelines amendment
retroactive, 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2) authorizes a district
court to reduce an otherwise final sentence that is based
on the amended provision. Any reduction must be consis
tent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sen
tencing Commission.
The relevant policy statement,
USSG §1B1.10, instructs courts proceeding under
§3582(c)(2) to substitute the amended Guidelines range
while “leav[ing] all other guideline application decisions

Opinion of the Court

unaffected.” §1B1.10(b)(1).1 Under §3582(c)(2), a court
may then grant a reduction within the amended Guide
lines range if it determines that one is warranted “after
considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the
extent that they are applicable.”2 Except in limited cir
cumstances, however, §1B1.10(b)(2)(A) forecloses a court
acting under §3582(c)(2) from reducing a sentence “to a
term that is less than the minimum of the amended guide
line range.”
II
A jury convicted petitioner Percy Dillon in 1993 of con
spiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to
distribute more than 500 grams of powder cocaine and
more than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21
U. S. C. §846, possession with the intent to distribute
more than 500 grams of powder cocaine in violation of
§841(a)(1), and use of a firearm during and in relation to a
drug-trafficking offense in violation of 18 U. S. C.
§924(c)(1). Dillon’s convictions exposed him to a statutory
sentencing range of 10 years to life for the conspiracy, 5
to-40 years for cocaine possession, and a mandatory mini
mum sentence of 5 years for the firearm offense, to be
served consecutively to the sentence for the drug offenses.
——————
1 The Sentencing Commission substantially revised §1B1.10 in March
2008, see USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 712 (Nov. 2009) (effective Mar. 3,
2008), roughly three months before the District Court’s decision in this
case. Because the current version of the relevant Guidelines provisions
is not meaningfully different from the version in effect at the time of
the District Court’s decision, references in this opinion are to the
current, 2009 edition of the Guidelines.
2 Section 3553(a) provides that a “court shall impose a sentence suffi
cient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set
forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,” and it enumerates several
factors a court “shall consider” in determining an appropriate sentence,
including “the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history
and characteristics of the defendant,” §3553(a)(1).

Opinion of the Court

At sentencing, the District Court made additional find
ings of fact and concluded that Dillon was responsible for
1.5 kilograms of crack and 1.6 kilograms of powder co
caine. Under USSG §2D1.1, those drug quantities pro
duced a base offense level of 38. After offsetting adjust
ments for acceptance of responsibility, §3E1.1, and
reckless endangerment during flight, §3C1.2, Dillon’s total
offense level remained 38. Coupled with a criminal
history category of II,3 that offense level produced a then
mandatory Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months’ im
prisonment for the drug counts.
The court sentenced Dillon at the bottom of the Guide
lines range for those counts, followed by a mandatory 60
month sentence for the firearm count, for a total sentence
of 322 months’ imprisonment. At Dillon’s sentencing, the
court described the term of imprisonment as “entirely too
high for the crime [Dillon] committed.” App. 13. Perceiv
ing no basis for departing from the then-mandatory Sen
tencing Guidelines, the District Court felt constrained to
impose a sentence within the prescribed range. The Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed Dillon’s convic
tions and sentence on appeal. See 100 F. 3d 949 (1996).
After the Sentencing Commission made the amendment
to the crack-cocaine Guidelines retroactive in 2008, Dillon
filed a pro se motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to
§3582(c)(2). In the motion, Dillon asked the court to grant
not just the two-level reduction authorized by the amend
ment but also a further reduction consistent with the
sentencing factors found in §3553(a). Based largely on his
postsentencing conduct, including his determined pursuit
of educational and community-outreach opportunities,
——————
3 The

Probation Office based Dillon’s criminal-history assessment on
two prior misdemeanor convictions, one for possession of marijuana and
one for resisting arrest. Dillon did not object to that calculation of his
criminal-history score.

DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Dillon contended that a variance from the amended Guide
lines range was warranted in his case. He further urged
that, after Booker, the court was authorized to grant such
a variance because the amended Guidelines range was
advisory notwithstanding any contrary statement in
§1B1.10.
The District Court reduced Dillon’s sentence to 270
months—the term at the bottom of the revised Guidelines
range.4 But the court declined to go further. Concluding
that the sentencing proceedings at issue in Booker are
readily distinguishable from those under §3582(c)(2), the
court found Booker’s holdings inapplicable to the instant
proceeding and accordingly held that it lacked authority to
impose a sentence inconsistent with §1B1.10.
The Third Circuit affirmed. 572 F. 3d 146, 150 (2009).
The court noted that §3582(c)(2) is codified in a different
section than the provisions invalidated in Booker and
contains no cross-reference to those provisions. Finding
no other indication that Booker “obviate[d] the congres
sional directive in §3582(c)(2) that a sentence reduction
pursuant to that section be consistent with Sentencing
Commission policy statements,” 572 F. 3d, at 149, the
Third Circuit held that §1B1.10 is binding. It therefore
agreed that the District Court lacked authority to reduce
Dillon’s sentence below the amended Guidelines range.
We granted certiorari to consider Booker’s applicability
to §3582(c)(2) proceedings. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).

Opinion of the Court

stances. §3582(b). Section 3582(c)(2) establishes an ex
ception to the general rule of finality “in the case of a
defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprison
ment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently
been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to
28 U. S. C. §994(o)” and made retroactive pursuant to
§994(u). In such cases, Congress has authorized courts to
“reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the
factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they
are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with appli
cable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commis
sion.” §3582(c)(2).
Characterizing proceedings under §3582(c)(2) as “resen
tencing” proceedings, Dillon contends that “[t]here is no
practical or functional difference between a resentencing
pursuant to §3582(c)(2) and any other resentencing.” Brief
for Petitioner 18. Accordingly, Dillon urges, the same
principles that govern other sentencing proceedings like
wise govern §3582(c)(2) proceedings, and courts have
authority under §3582(c)(2) to vary from the revised
Guidelines range consistent with §3553(a), see
Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 101. Dillon cites as support for
this view §3582(c)(2)’s instruction to consider the factors
in §3553(a) in determining whether a sentence reduction
is warranted. Under Dillon’s approach, Booker would
preclude the Commission from issuing a policy statement
that generally forecloses below-Guidelines sentences at
§3582(c)(2) proceedings, as USSG §1B1.10 purports to do.
Dillon thus asks us to excise the mandatory language of
§1B1.10(b)(2)(A) and treat that provision as advisory, just
as we did the offending statutory provisions in Booker.
The language of §3582(c)(2) belies Dillon’s characteriza
tion of proceedings under that section. By its terms,
§3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentenc
ing proceeding. Instead, it provides for the “modif[ication
of] a term of imprisonment” by giving courts the power to


8

DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

“reduce” an otherwise final sentence in circumstances
specified by the Commission.
Compare 28 U. S. C.
§994(a)(2)(C) (referring to §3582(c)(2) as a “sentence modi
fication provisio[n]”), with 18 U. S. C. §3742(f) (authoriz
ing courts of appeals to remand “for further sentencing”
upon a finding of error), and §3742(g) (establishing the
terms of “sentencing upon remand” and describing the
proceeding as a “resentenc[ing]” (capitalization omitted)).
It is also notable that the provision applies only to a lim
ited class of prisoners—namely, those whose sentence was
based on a sentencing range subsequently lowered by the
Commission. Section 3582(c)(2)’s text, together with its
narrow scope, shows that Congress intended to authorize
only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence
and not a plenary resentencing proceeding.
The substantial role Congress gave the Commission
with respect to sentence-modification proceedings further
supports this conclusion. The SRA charges the Commis
sion both with deciding whether to amend the Guidelines,
§994(o), and with determining whether and to what extent
an amendment will be retroactive, §994(u).5 A court’s
power under §3582(c)(2) thus depends in the first instance
on the Commission’s decision not just to amend the Guide
lines but to make the amendment retroactive. The court is
also constrained by the Commission’s statements dictating
“by what amount” the sentence of a prisoner serving a
term of imprisonment affected by the amendment “may be
reduced.” §994(u); see also Braxton v. United States, 500
U. S. 344, 348 (1991) (noting that the Commission imple
mented that power through §1B1.10).
Read in this context, §3582(c)(2)’s reference to §3553(a)

parties.

Opinion of the Court

does not undermine our narrow view of proceedings under
the former provision. Section 3582(c)(2) instructs a dis
trict court to “conside[r] the factors set forth in section
3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,” but it
authorizes a reduction on that basis only “if such a reduc
tion is consistent with applicable policy statements issued
by the Sentencing Commission”—namely, §1B1.10. The
statute thus establishes a two-step inquiry. A court must
first determine that a reduction is consistent with §1B1.10
before it may consider whether the authorized reduction is
warranted, either in whole or in part, according to the
factors set forth in §3553(a).
Following this two-step approach, a district court pro
ceeding under §3582(c)(2) does not impose a new sentence
in the usual sense. At step one, §3582(c)(2) requires the
court to follow the Commission’s instructions in §1B1.10 to
determine the prisoner’s eligibility for a sentence modifi
cation and the extent of the reduction authorized. Specifi
cally, §1B1.10(b)(1) requires the court to begin by “deter
min[ing] the amended guideline range that would have
been applicable to the defendant” had the relevant
amendment been in effect at the time of the initial sen
tencing. “In making such determination, the court shall
substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for
the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied
when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all
other guideline application decisions unaffected.” Ibid.
Consistent with the limited nature of §3582(c)(2) pro
ceedings, §1B1.10(b)(2) also confines the extent of the
reduction authorized. Courts generally may “not reduce
the defendant’s term of imprisonment under 18 U. S. C.
§3582(c)(2) . . . to a term that is less than the minimum of
the amended guideline range” produced by the substitu
tion. §1B1.10(b)(2)(A). Only if the sentencing court origi
nally imposed a term of imprisonment below the Guide
lines range does §1B1.10 authorize a court proceeding


10

DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

under §3582(c)(2) to impose a term “comparably” below the
amended range. §1B1.10(b)(2)(B).
At step two of the inquiry, §3582(c)(2) instructs a court
to consider any applicable §3553(a) factors and determine
whether, in its discretion, the reduction authorized by
reference to the policies relevant at step one is warranted
in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of
the case. Because reference to §3553(a) is appropriate
only at the second step of this circumscribed inquiry, it
cannot serve to transform the proceedings under
§3582(c)(2) into plenary resentencing proceedings.
This understanding of §3582(c)(2) as a narrow exception
to the rule of finality finds further support outside the
statute. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 requires
that a defendant be present at “sentencing,” see Rule
43(a)(3), but it excludes from that requirement proceed
ings that “involv[e] the correction or reduction of sentence
under Rule 35 or 18 U. S. C. §3582(c),” Rule 43(b)(4). Like
§3582(c)(2), Rule 35 delineates a limited set of circum
stances in which a sentence may be corrected or reduced.
Specifically, it authorizes a court to “correct a sentence
that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear
error” within 14 days after sentencing, Rule 35(a), and it
authorizes a reduction for substantial assistance on the
Government’s motion, Rule 35(b). Rule 43 therefore sets
the proceedings authorized by §3582(c)(2) and Rule 35
apart from other sentencing proceedings.
B
Given the limited scope and purpose of §3582(c)(2), we
conclude that proceedings under that section do not impli
cate the interests identified in Booker. Notably, the sen
tence-modification proceedings authorized by §3582(c)(2)
are not constitutionally compelled. We are aware of no
constitutional requirement of retroactivity that entitles
defendants sentenced to a term of imprisonment to the

Opinion of the Court

benefit of subsequent Guidelines amendments. Rather,
§3582(c)(2) represents a congressional act of lenity in
tended to give prisoners the benefit of later enacted ad
justments to the judgments reflected in the Guidelines.
Viewed that way, proceedings under §3582(c)(2) do not
implicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential
facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Taking
the original sentence as given, any facts found by a judge
at a §3582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the
prescribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only
the judge’s exercise of discretion within that range.
“[J]udges in this country have long exercised discretion of
this nature in imposing sentence within [established]
limits in the individual case,” and the exercise of such
discretion does not contravene the Sixth Amendment even
if it is informed by judge-found facts. Apprendi v. New
Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481 (2000) (emphasis in original).
Because §3582(c)(2) proceedings give judges no more than
this circumscribed discretion, “[t]here is no encroachment
here by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury,
nor any threat to the jury’s domain as a bulwark at trial
between the State and the accused.” Oregon v. Ice, 555
U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8). Accordingly, Dillon’s
Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District
Court’s adherence to the instruction in §1B1.10 to consider
a reduction only within the amended Guidelines range.
Dillon contends that, even if §3582(c)(2) does not impli
cate the constitutional rights vindicated in Booker—
something the dissent appears to concede—the remedial
aspect of the Court’s decision applies to proceedings under
that section and requires that the Guidelines be treated as
advisory in such proceedings just as they are in other
sentencing proceedings. In support of his position, Dillon
invokes the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning in United States v.


12

DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Hicks, 472 F. 3d 1167, 1170 (2007).6 Relying on our rejec
tion in Booker of a remedy that would have made the
Guidelines advisory only in certain cases—namely, when
treating them as binding would run afoul of the Sixth
Amendment, see 543 U. S., at 265–267—the Ninth Circuit
held that Booker precludes treating the Guidelines as
mandatory for purposes of §3582(c)(2) and advisory in
other contexts, see Hicks, 472 F. 3d, at 1171–1172.
This argument is unpersuasive. The incomplete remedy
we rejected in Booker would have required courts to treat
the Guidelines differently in similar proceedings, leading
potentially to unfair results and considerable administra
tive challenges. See 543 U. S., at 266. As already ex
plained, the sentence-modification proceedings authorized
by §3582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other
sentencing proceedings. Given the substantially different
purpose of §3582(c)(2) and the circumscribed nature of
proceedings under that section, requiring courts to honor
§1B1.10(b)(2)’s instruction not to depart from the amended
Guidelines range at such proceedings will create none of
the confusion or unfairness that led us in Booker to reject
the Government’s argument for a partial fix.
The dissent’s contrary conclusion rests on two erroneous
premises. First, the dissent ignores the fundamental
differences between sentencing and sentence-modification
proceedings and asserts without explanation that
“[n]othing turns on” the distinction between them. Post,
at 11. For the reasons stated above, the statutory differ
ences between the proceedings are highly significant.
Second, the dissent gives short shrift to the fact that,
after Booker, the Commission retains at least some au

case. No. 08–30445 (CA9, Dec. 8, 2009).

Opinion of the Court

thority to bind the courts. Through §994(u), Congress
charged the Commission with determining “in what cir
cumstances and by what amount” the sentences of prison
ers affected by Guidelines amendments “may be reduced.”
No one disputes that the Commission’s retroactivity de
terminations made pursuant to the first part of that au
thorization are binding. See post, at 17, and n. 8. This
aspect of the Commission’s power emphatically under
mines the dissent’s insistence that the Guidelines after
Booker are “completely advisory.” Post, at 9. Moreover,
while the dissent criticizes our approach for leaving the
Commission with only the “the tiniest sliver of lawmaking
power,” post, at 11, the dissent would leave the Commis
sion with an even smaller and less explicable sliver by
dissecting the authority granted by §994(u).
For all of these reasons, we conclude that neither
Booker’s constitutional nor remedial holding requires the
result that Dillon urges.
IV
Dillon additionally contends that the District Court
erred in failing to correct two mistakes in his original
sentence. Under his view of §3582(c)(2), a district court is
required to recalculate a defendant’s sentence. Thus, any
mistakes committed at the initial sentencing are imposed
anew if they are not corrected. According to Dillon, the
District Court in the instant proceeding should have cor
rected the Booker error that resulted from the initial
sentencing court’s treatment of the Guidelines as manda
tory, and it should have adjusted his criminal-history
category, which he now contends was erroneously inflated.
Dillon’s arguments in this regard are premised on the
same misunderstanding of the scope of §3582(c)(2) pro
ceedings dispelled above. As noted, §3582(c)(2) does not
authorize a resentencing. Instead, it permits a sentence
reduction within the narrow bounds established by the

Opinion of the Court

Commission. The relevant policy statement instructs that
a court proceeding under §3582(c)(2) “shall substitute” the
amended Guidelines range for the initial range “and shall
leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.”
§1B1.10(b)(1). Because the aspects of his sentence that
Dillon seeks to correct were not affected by the Commis
sion’s amendment to §2D1.1, they are outside the scope of
the proceeding authorized by §3582(c)(2), and the District
Court properly declined to address them.
