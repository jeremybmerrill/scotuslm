SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus

DILLON v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 09–6338. Argued March 30, 2010—Decided June 17, 2010
In 1993, petitioner Dillon was convicted of, inter alia, crack and powder
cocaine offenses, which produced a base offense level of 38 and a
Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months’ imprisonment. The court
sentenced him at the bottom of the range for those counts. After the
Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the base
offense level associated with each quantity of crack cocaine, USSG
Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706, and made that amendment retroactive,
USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 713, Dillon moved for a sentence reduc
tion under 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2). That provision authorizes a
district court to reduce an otherwise final sentence pursuant to a
Guidelines amendment if a reduction is consistent with the Commis
sion’s policy statements. The relevant policy statement, USSG
§1B1.10, precludes a court from reducing a sentence “to a term that is
less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range” except in
limited circumstances. In addition to the two-level reduction author
ized by the amendment, Dillon sought a variance below the amended
Guidelines range, contending that United States v. Booker, 543 U. S.
220, authorized the exercise of such discretion. The District Court
imposed a sentence at the bottom of the revised range but declined to
grant a further reduction. Finding Booker inapplicable to §3582(c)(2)
proceedings, the court concluded that the Commission’s directives in
§1B1.10 constrained it to impose a sentence within the amended
Guidelines range. The Third Circuit affirmed.
Held: Booker’s holdings do not apply to §3582(c)(2) proceedings and
therefore do not require treating §1B1.10(b) as advisory. Pp. 6–14.
(a) The statute’s text and narrow scope belie Dillon’s characteriza
tion of proceedings under §3582(c)(2) as “resentencing” proceedings
governed by the same principles as other sentencing proceedings. In

DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus
stead, §3582(c)(2) authorizes only a limited adjustment to an other
wise final sentence. This conclusion is further supported by the sub
stantial role Congress gave the Commission with respect to sentence
modification proceedings, charging it with determining whether and
to what extent a Guidelines amendment will be retroactive, 28
U. S. C. §994(u), and authorizing a court to grant a reduction under
§3582(c)(2) only “if [it] is consistent with applicable policy statements
issued by the Sentencing Commission.” Section 3582(c)(2) estab
lishes a two-step inquiry: A court must (1) determine the scope of the
reduction, if any, authorized by §1B1.10, and then (2) consider
whether the authorized reduction is warranted according to the ap
plicable §3553(a) factors. At step one, the court must follow the
Commission’s instructions in §1B1.10 to impose a term of imprison
ment within the amended Guidelines range unless the sentencing
court originally imposed a below-Guidelines sentence. §1B1.10(b)(2).
Because reference to §3553(a) is appropriate only at step two, that
provision does not transform §3582(c)(2) proceedings into plenary re
sentencing proceedings. Pp. 6–10.
(b) Given §3582(c)(2)’s limited scope and purpose, proceedings un
der that section do not implicate Booker. The section represents a
congressional act of lenity intended to give prisoners the benefit of
later enacted adjustments to the judgments reflected in the Guide
lines. Taking the original sentence as given, any facts found by a
judge at a §3582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the pre
scribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only the judge’s ex
ercise of discretion within that range. That exercise does not contra
vene the Sixth Amendment, even if it is informed by judge-found
facts. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481. Thus, Dillon’s
Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District Court’s
adherence to §1B1.10’s instruction to consider a reduction only within
the amended Guidelines range. Dillon’s argument that Booker’s re
medial opinion nonetheless requires the Guidelines to be treated as
advisory in such proceedings is unpersuasive given that proceedings
under §3582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other sentencing
proceedings. Pp. 10–13.
(c) Also rejected is Dillon’s argument that the District Court should
have corrected other mistakes in his original sentence, namely, a
Booker error resulting from the initial sentencing court’s treatment of
the Guidelines as mandatory and an alleged error in the calculation
of his criminal-history category. Because those aspects of Dillon’s
sentence were not affected by the crack-cocaine Guidelines amend
ment, they are outside the scope of the §3582(c)(2) proceeding, and
the District Court properly declined to address them. Pp. 13–14.

572 F. 3d 146, affirmed.
