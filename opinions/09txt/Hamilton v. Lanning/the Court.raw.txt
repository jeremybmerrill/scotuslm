JAN HAMILTON, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE,

PETITIONER v. STEPHANIE KAY 

LANNING 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

[June 7, 2010]


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code provides bankruptcy
protection to “individual[s] with regular income” whose
debts fall within statutory limits. 11 U. S. C. §§101(30),
109(e). Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must
liquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors,
see §§704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to
keep their property, but they must agree to a court­
approved plan under which they pay creditors out of their
future income, see §§1306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a). A
bankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a
Chapter 13 debtor’s plan. §1322(a)(1); see also 28 U. S. C.
§586(a)(3).
Section 1325 of Title 11 specifies circumstances under
which a bankruptcy court “shall” and “may not” confirm a
plan. §1325(a),(b). If an unsecured creditor or the bank­
ruptcy trustee objects to confirmation, §1325(b)(1) requires
the debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to
pay all “projected disposable income” to be received by the
debtor over the duration of the plan.

HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

We granted certiorari to decide how a bankruptcy court
should calculate a debtor’s “projected disposable income.”
Some lower courts have taken what the parties term the
“mechanical approach,” while most have adopted what has
been called the “forward-looking approach.” We hold that
the “forward-looking approach” is correct.
I
As previously noted, §1325 provides that if a trustee or
an unsecured creditor objects to a Chapter 13 debtor’s
plan, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless
it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or
“provides that all of the debtor’s projected disposable
income to be received” over the duration of the plan “will
be applied to make payments” in accordance with the
terms of the plan. 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(1); see also
§1325(b)(1) (2000 ed.). Before the enactment of the Bank­
ruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of
2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code)
loosely defined “disposable income” as “income which is
received by the debtor and which is not reasonably neces­
sary to be expended” for the “maintenance or support of
the debtor,” for qualifying charitable contributions, or for
business expenditures. §1325(b)(2)(A), (B).
The Code did not define the term “projected disposable
income,” and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a
mechanical approach in calculating projected disposable
income. That is, they first multiplied monthly income by
the number of months in the plan and then determined
what portion of the result was “excess” or “disposable.”
See 2 K. Lundin, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy §164.1, p. 164–1,
and n. 4 (3d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Lundin (2000 ed.))
(citing cases).
In exceptional cases, however, bankruptcy courts took
into account foreseeable changes in a debtor’s income or
expenses.

any evidence of income the debtor would offer at a con­
tested confirmation hearing”).
BAPCPA left the term “projected disposable income”
undefined but specified in some detail how “disposable
income” is to be calculated. “Disposable income” is now
defined as “current monthly income received by the
debtor” less “amounts reasonably necessary to be ex­
pended” for the debtor’s maintenance and support, for
qualifying charitable contributions, and for business ex­
penditures. §1325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) (2006 ed.). “Current
monthly income,” in turn, is calculated by averaging the
debtor’s monthly income during what the parties refer to
as the 6-month look-back period, which generally consists
of the six full months preceding the filing of the bank­

See §101(10A)(A)(i).1
“amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” in
§1325(b)(2) is also newly defined. For a debtor whose
income is below the median for his or her State, the
phrase includes the full amount needed for “maintenance
or support,” see §1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but for a debtor with
income that exceeds the state median, only certain speci­
fied expenses are included,2 see §§707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).

if a debtor does not file the required schedule (Schedule I),

“means test” and is reflected in a schedule (Form 22C) that a Chapter
13 debtor must file. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 22C

HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

II 

A

Respondent had $36,793.36 in unsecured debt when she
filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October
2006. In the six months before her filing, she received a
one-time buyout from her former employer, and this pay­
ment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to
$11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84,
107. As a result of these payments, respondent’s current
monthly income, as averaged from April through October
2006, was $5,343.70—a figure that exceeds the median
income for a family of one in Kansas. See id., at 78. Re­
spondent’s monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to
§707(b)(2), were $4,228.71. Id., at 83. She reported a
monthly “disposable income” of $1,114.98 on Form 22C.
Ibid.
On the form used for reporting monthly income (Sched­
ule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per
month—which is below the state median. Id., at 66; see
also id., at 78. On the form used for reporting monthly
expenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly ex­
penses of $1,772.97. Id., at 68. Subtracting the Schedule
J figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly
disposable income of $149.03.
Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to
pay $144 per month for 36 months. See id., at 93. Peti­
tioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirma­
tion of the plan because the amount respondent proposed
to pay was less than the full amount of the claims against
her, see §1325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner’s view,
respondent was not committing all of her “projected dis­
posable income” to the repayment of creditors, see
§1325(b)(1)(B). According to petitioner, the proper way to
calculate projected disposable income was simply to mul­
tiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the
number of months in the commitment period. Employing

Opinion of the Court

this mechanical approach, petitioner calculated that credi­
tors would be paid in full if respondent made monthly
payments of $756 for a period of 60 months. Id., at 108.
There is no dispute that respondent’s actual income was
insufficient to make payments in that amount. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 3–4.
B
The Bankruptcy Court endorsed respondent’s proposed
monthly payment of $144 but required a 60-month plan
period. No. 06–41037 etc., 2007 WL 1451999, *8 (Bkrtcy.
Ct. Kan. 2007). The court agreed with the majority view
that the word “projected” in §1325(b)(1)(B) requires courts
“to consider at confirmation the debtor’s actual income as
it was reported on Schedule I.” Id., at *5 (emphasis
added). This conclusion was warranted by the text of
§1325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was
necessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bank­
ruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating fi­
nances in the six months before filing. Ibid.
Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy
Appellate Panel, which affirmed. 380 B. R. 17, 19 (2007).
The Panel noted that, although Congress redefined “dis­
posable income” in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre­
existing term “projected disposable income.” Id., at 24.
Thus, the Panel concluded, there was no reason to believe
that Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice
under which bankruptcy courts determined projected
disposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but
considered other evidence when there was reason to be­
lieve that the schedules did not reflect a debtor’s actual
ability to pay. Ibid.
The Tenth Circuit affirmed. 545 F. 3d 1269, 1270
(2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in calcu­
lating “projected disposable income,” should begin with the
“presumption” that the figure yielded by the mechanical

HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

approach is correct, but the Court concluded that this
figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change
in the debtor’s circumstances. Id., at 1278–1279.
This petition followed, and we granted certiorari. 558
U. S. ___ (2009).
III 

A

The parties differ sharply in their interpretation of
§1325’s reference to “projected disposable income.” Peti­
tioner, advocating the mechanical approach, contends that
“projected disposable income” means past average monthly
disposable income multiplied by the number of months in
a debtor’s plan. Respondent, who favors the forward­
looking approach, agrees that the method outlined by
petitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she
argues that in exceptional cases, where significant
changes in a debtor’s financial circumstances are known or
virtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to
make an appropriate adjustment. Respondent has the
stronger argument.
First, respondent’s argument is supported by the ordi­
nary meaning of the term “projected.” “When terms used
in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary
meaning.” Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179,
187 (1995). Here, the term “projected” is not defined, and
in ordinary usage future occurrences are not “projected”
based on the assumption that the past will necessarily
repeat itself. For example, projections concerning a com­
pany’s future sales or the future cash flow from a license
take into account anticipated events that may change past
trends. See, e.g., Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights,
Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 316 (2007) (describing adjustments to
“projected sales” in light of falling demand); Innovair
Aviation, Ltd. v. United States, 83 Fed. Cl. 498, 502, 504–
506 (2008) (calculating projected cash flow and noting that

7

Opinion of the Court

past sales are “not necessarily the number of sales” that
will be made in the future). On the night of an election,
experts do not “project” the percentage of the votes that a
candidate will receive by simply assuming that the candi­
date will get the same percentage as he or she won in the
first few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not
project that a team’s winning percentage at the end of a
new season will be the same as the team’s winning per­
centage last year or the team’s winning percentage at the
end of the first month of competition. While a projection
takes past events into account, adjustments are often
made based on other factors that may affect the final
outcome. See In re Kibbe, 361 B. R. 302, 312, n. 9 (Bkrtcy.
App. Panel CA1 2007) (contrasting “multiplied,” which
“requires only mathematical acumen,” with “projected,”
which requires “mathematic acumen adjusted by delibera­
tion and discretion”).
Second, the word “projected” appears in many federal
statutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple
multiplication. For example, the Agricultural Adjustment
Act of 1938 defined “projected national yield,” “projected
county yield,” and “projected farm yield” as entailing
historical averages “adjusted for abnormal weather condi­
tions,” “trends in yields,” and “any significant changes in
production practices.” 7 U. S. C. §1301(b)(8)(B), (13)(J),
(K).3

also, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1364(a), (c)(2) (requiring the triennial im­
migration-impact report to include information “projected for the
succeeding five-year period, based on reasonable estimates substanti­
ated by the best available evidence”); 10 U. S. C. A. §2433a(a)(2)(B)
(2010 Cum. Supp.) (“projected cost of completing the [defense acquisi­
tion] program based on reasonable modification of [current] require­
ments”); 15 U. S. C. §719c(c)(2) (2006 ed.) (“projected natural gas supply
and demand”); 25 U. S. C. §2009(c)(1), (2) (requiring the Director of the
Office of Indian Education Programs to submit an annual report
containing certain projections and “a description of the methods and
formulas used to calculate the amounts projected”).

HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

By contrast, we need look no further than the Bank­
ruptcy Code to see that when Congress wishes to mandate
simple multiplication, it does so unambiguously—most
commonly by using the term “multiplied.” See, e.g., 11
U. S. C. §1325(b)(3) (“current monthly income, when mul­
tiplied by 12”); §§704(b)(2), 707(b)(6), (7)(A) (same);
§707(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(iv) (“multiplied by 60”). Accord, 2
U. S. C. §58(b)(1)(B) (“multiplied by the number of months
in such year”); 5 U. S. C. §8415(a) (“multiplied by such
individual’s total service”); 42 U. S. C. §403(f)(3) (“multi­
plied by the number of months in such year”).
Third, pre-BAPCPA case law points in favor of the
“forward-looking” approach. Prior to BAPCPA, the gen­
eral rule was that courts would multiply a debtor’s current
monthly income by the number of months in the commit­
ment period as the first step in determining projected
disposable income. See, e.g., In re Killough, 900 F. 2d 61,
62–63 (CA5 1990) (per curiam); In re Anderson, 21 F. 3d
355, 357 (CA9 1994); In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128, 1132
(CA4 1995). See 2 Lundin §164.1, at 164–1 (2000 ed.)
(“Most courts focus on the debtor’s current income and
extend current income (and expenditures) over the life of
the plan to calculate projected disposable income”). But
courts also had discretion to account for known or virtu­
ally certain changes in the debtor’s income. See Heath,
182 B. R., at 559–561; Richardson, 283 B. R., at 799; In re
James, 260 B. R. 498, 514–515 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Idaho 2001);
In re Jobe, 197 B. R. 823, 826–827 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex.
1996); In re Crompton, 73 B. R. 800, 808 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED
Pa. 1987); see also In re Schyma, 68 B. R. 52, 63 (Bkrtcy.
Ct. Minn. 1985) (“[T]he prospect of dividends . . . is not so
certain as to require Debtors or the Court to consider them
as regular or disposable income”); In re Krull, 54 B. R. 375,
378 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Colo. 1985) (“Since there are no changes
in income which can be clearly foreseen, the Court must
simply multiply the debtor’s current disposable income by

Opinion of the Court

36 in order to determine his ‘projected’ income”).4 This
judicial discretion was well documented in contemporary
bankruptcy treatises.
See 8 Collier on Bankruptcy
¶1325.08[4][a], p. 1325–50 (15th ed. rev. 2004) (hereinaf­
ter Collier) (“As a practical matter, unless there are
changes which can be clearly foreseen, the court must
simply multiply the debtor’s known monthly income by 36
and determine whether the amount to be paid under the
plan equals or exceeds that amount” (emphasis added)); 3
W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice §75.10, p. 64
(1991) (“It has been held that the court should focus upon
present monthly income and expenditures and, absent
extraordinary circumstances, project these current
amounts over the life of the plan to determine projected
disposable income” (emphasis added)); 2 Lundin §164.1, at
164–28 to 164–31 (2000 ed.) (describing how reported
decisions treated anticipated changes in income, particu­
larly where such changes were “too speculative to be pro­
jected”); see also In re Greer, 388 B. R. 889, 892 (Bkrtcy.
——————
4 When pre-BAPCPA courts declined to make adjustments based on
possible changes in a debtor’s future income or expenses, they did so
because the changes were not sufficiently foreseeable, not because they
concluded that they lacked discretion to depart from a strictly mechani­
cal approach. In In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128 (1995), for example, the
Fourth Circuit refused to make such an adjustment because it deemed
disbursements from an individual retirement account during the plan
period to be “speculative” and “hypothetical.” Id., at 1132. There is no
reason to assume that the result would have been the same if future
disbursements had been more assured. That was certainly true of In re
Killough, 900 F. 2d 61 (1990), in which the Fifth Circuit declined to
require inclusion of overtime pay in projected disposable income be­
cause it “was not definite enough.” Id., at 65; see also id., at 66
(“[T]here may be instances where income obtained through working
overtime can and should appropriately be included in a debtor’s pro­
jected disposable income”). See also Education Assistance Corp. v.
Zellner, 827 F. 2d 1222, 1226 (CA8 1987) (affirming bankruptcy court’s
exclusion of future tax returns and salary increases from debtor’s
projected disposable income because they were “speculative”).

virtually certain” (emphasis added)). Indeed, petitioner
concedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to
BAPCPA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.
Pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice is telling because we
“ ‘will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bank­
ruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress
intended such a departure.’ ” Travelers Casualty & Surety
Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443,
454 (2007); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526,
539 (2004); Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998);
see also Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); Kelly
v. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 47 (1986). Congress did not
amend the term “projected disposable income” in 2005,
and pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely
acknowledged and well-documented view that courts may
take into account known or virtually certain changes to
debtors’ income or expenses when projecting disposable
income. In light of this historical practice, we would ex­
pect that, had Congress intended for “projected” to carry a
specialized—and indeed, unusual—meaning in Chapter
13, Congress would have said so expressly. Cf., e.g., 26
U. S. C. §279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly defining “projected
earnings” as reflecting a 3-year historical average).

11

Opinion of the Court

B
The mechanical approach also clashes repeatedly with
the terms of 11 U. S. C. §1325.
First, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s reference to projected disposable
income “to be received in the applicable commitment
period” strongly favors the forward-looking approach.
There is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive
far less than $756 per month in disposable income during
the plan period, so petitioner’s projection does not accu­
rately reflect “income to be received” during that period.
See In re Nowlin, 576 F. 3d 258, 263 (CA5 2009). The
mechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of
the statute when a debtor’s current disposable income is
substantially higher than the income that the debtor
predictably will receive during the plan period. See
Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998) (“[W]e are
hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional
enactment which renders superfluous another portion of
that same law” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Second, §1325(b)(1) directs courts to determine projected
disposable income “as of the effective date of the plan,”
which is the date on which the plan is confirmed and
becomes binding, see §1327(a). Had Congress intended for
projected disposable income to be nothing more than a
multiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no rea­
son why Congress would not have required courts to de­
termine that value as of the filing date of the plan. See
Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring that a plan be
filed within 14 days of the filing of a petition), online at
http://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/FederalRulema
king/Overview/BankruptcyRules.aspx (all Internet mate­
rials as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of
Court’s case file). In the very next section of the Code, for
example, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence
payments “not later than 30 days after the date of the
filing of the plan.” §1326(a)(1) (emphasis added). Con­


12

HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

gress’ decision to require courts to measure projected
disposable income “as of the effective date of the plan” is
more consistent with the view that Congress expected
courts to consider postfiling information about the debtor’s
financial circumstances.
See 545 F. 3d, at 1279
(“[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all
projected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured
creditors ‘as of the effective date of the plan’ suggests
consideration of the debtor’s actual financial circum­
stances as of the effective date of the plan”).
Third, the requirement that projected disposable income
“will be applied to make payments” is most naturally read
to contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors
in the calculated monthly amounts. §1325(b)(1)(B). But
when, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks
the means to do so, this language is rendered a hollow
command.
C
The arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical
approach are unpersuasive. Noting that the Code now
provides a detailed and precise definition of “disposable
income,” proponents of the mechanical approach maintain
that any departure from this method leaves that definition
“ ‘with no apparent purpose.’ ” In re Kagenveama, 541 F.
3d 868, 873 (CA9 2008). This argument overlooks the
important role that the statutory formula for calculating
“disposable income” plays under the forward-looking
approach. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case, a
court taking the forward-looking approach should begin by
calculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing
more is required. It is only in unusual cases that a court
may go further and take into account other known or
virtually certain information about the debtor’s future

Opinion of the Court

income or expenses.5
Petitioner faults the Tenth Circuit for referring to a
rebuttable “presumption” that the figure produced by the
mechanical approach accurately represents a debtor’s
“projected disposable income.” See 545 F. 3d, at 1278–
1279. Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference
to any such presumption but that related Code provisions
expressly create other rebuttable presumptions.
See
§707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i). He thus suggests that the
Tenth Circuit improperly supplemented the text of the
Code.
The Tenth Circuit’s analysis, however, simply heeds the
ordinary meaning of the term “projected.” As noted, a
person making a projection uses past occurrences as a
starting point, and that is precisely what the Tenth Cir­
cuit prescribed. See, e.g., Nowlin, supra, at 260, 263.
Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is
consistent with §1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to “projected
disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section
1325(b)(2)).”
This cross-reference, petitioner argues,
shows that Congress intended for the term “projected
disposable income” to incorporate, presumably in all con­
texts, the defined term “disposable income.” It is evident
that §1129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term “disposable income,” see §1325(b)(2), but that fact offers
no insight into the meaning of the word “projected”
in §§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see
how that word acquires a specialized meaning as a
result of this cross-reference—particularly where both
§§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected dis­
posable income “to be received” during the relevant period.
See supra, at 11.
——————
5 For the same reason, the phrase “[f]or purposes of this subsection”
in §1325(b)(2) is not rendered superfluous by the forward-looking
approach.

Petitioner also notes that §707 allows courts to take
“special circumstances” into consideration, but that
§1325(b)(3) incorporates §707 only with respect to calcu­
lating expenses. See In re Wilson, 397 B. R. 299, 314–315
(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a “special
circumstances” exception should not be inferred with
respect to the debtor’s income. We decline to infer from
§1325’s incorporation of §707 that Congress intended to
eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that courts previ­
ously exercised when projecting disposable income to
account for known or virtually certain changes. Accord,
In re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 613, and n. 15 (Bkrtcy. Ct.
NJ 2008).
D
In cases in which a debtor’s disposable income during
the 6-month look-back period is either substantially lower
or higher than the debtor’s disposable income during the
plan period, the mechanical approach would produce
senseless results that we do not think Congress intended.
In cases in which the debtor’s disposable income is higher
during the plan period, the mechanical approach would
deny creditors payments that the debtor could easily
make. And where, as in the present case, the debtor’s
disposable income during the plan period is substantially
lower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection
of Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter’s main
eligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is
an “individual whose income is sufficiently stable and
regular” to allow her “to make payments under a plan,”
§101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in
§109(e). But if the mechanical approach were used, she
could not file a confirmable plan. Under §1325(a)(6), a
plan cannot be confirmed unless “the debtor will be able to
make all payments under the plan and comply with the
plan.” And as petitioner concedes, respondent could not

Opinion of the Court

possibly make the payments that the mechanical approach
prescribes.
In order to avoid or at least to mitigate the harsh results
that the mechanical approach may produce for debtors,
petitioner advances several possible escape strategies. He
proposes no comparable strategies for creditors harmed by
the mechanical approach, and in any event none of the
maneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.
1
Petitioner first suggests that a debtor may delay filing a
petition so as to place any extraordinary income outside
the 6-month look-back period. We see at least two prob­
lems with this proposal.
First, delay is often not a viable option for a debtor
sliding into bankruptcy.
“Potential Chapter 13 debtors typically find a law­
yer’s office when they are one step from financial
Armageddon: There is a foreclosure sale of the
debtor’s home the next day; the debtor’s only car
was mysteriously repossessed in the dark of last
night; a garnishment has reduced the debtor’s
take-home pay below the ordinary requirements
of food and rent.
Instantaneous relief is expected, if not necessary.” K. Lundin & W. Brown,
Chapter 13 Bankruptcy §3.1[2] (4th ed. rev.2009),
http: // www.ch13online.com / Subscriber / Chapter _13_
Bankruptcy_4th_Lundin_Brown.htm.
See also id., §38.1 (“Debtor’s counsel often has little discre­
tion when to file the Chapter 13 case”).
Second, even when a debtor is able to delay filing a
petition, such delay could be risky if it gives the appear­
ance of bad faith. See 11 U. S. C. §1325(a)(7) (requiring,
as a condition of confirmation, that “the action of the
debtor in filing the petition was in good faith”); see also,

HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

e.g., In re Myers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007) (citing
“ ‘the timing of the petition’ ” as a factor to be considered in
assessing a debtor’s compliance with the good-faith re­
quirement). Accord, Neufeld v. Freeman, 794 F. 2d 149,
153 (CA4 1986) (a debtor’s prepetition conduct may inform
the court’s good-faith inquiry).
2
Petitioner next argues that a debtor with unusually
high income during the 6 months prior to the filing of a
petition, could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of
current income (Schedule I) and then ask the bankruptcy
court to exercise its authority under §101(10A)(A)(ii) to
select a 6-month period that is more representative of the
debtor’s future disposable income. We see little merit in
this convoluted strategy. If the Code required the use of
the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would
improperly undermine what the Code demands. And if, as
we believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence
to the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is
not needed. In any event, even if this strategy were al­
lowed, it would not help all debtors whose disposable
income during the plan period is sharply lower than their
previous disposable income.6
3
Petitioner suggests that a debtor can dismiss the peti­
tion and refile at a later, more favorable date. But peti­
tioner offers only the tepid assurance that courts “gener­
ally” do not find this practice to be abusive. Brief for
Petitioner 53. This questionable stratagem plainly cir­
cumvents the statutory limits on a court’s ability to shift
——————
6 Under

11 U. S. C. §521(i)(3), a debtor seeking additional time to file
a schedule of income must submit the request within 45 days after
filing the petition, and the court may not grant an extension of more
than 45 days.

the look-back period, see supra, at 16, and n. 6, and should
give debtors pause.7 Cf. In re Glenn, 288 B. R. 516, 520
(Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 2002) (noting that courts should
consider, among other factors, “whether this is the first or
[a] subsequent filin[g]” when assessing a debtor’s compli­
ance with the good-faith requirement).
4
Petitioner argues that respondent might have been able
to obtain relief by filing under Chapter 7 or by converting
her Chapter 13 petition to one under Chapter 7. The
availability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who
have above-median incomes is limited. In respondent’s
case, a presumption of abuse would attach under
§707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, “multiplied
by 60,” exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and
(II). See also §707(b)(1) (allowing a court to dismiss a
petition filed by a debtor “whose debts are primarily con­
sumer debts . . . if it finds that the granting of relief would
be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter”); App. 86–88
(“Notice to Individual Consumer Debtor under §342(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code”) (“If your income is greater than the
median income for your state of residence and family size,
in some cases, creditors have the right to file a motion
requesting that the court dismiss your case under §707(b)
of the Code”). Nevertheless, petitioner argues, respondent
might have been able to overcome this presumption by
claiming that her case involves “special circumstances”
within the meaning of §707(b)(2)(B)(i). Section 707 identi­
——————
7 For example, a debtor otherwise eligible for Chapter 13 protection
may become ineligible if “at any time in the preceding 180 days” “the
case was dismissed by the court for willful failure of the debtor to abide
by orders of the court, or to appear before the court in proper prosecu­
tion of the case,” or “the debtor requested and obtained the voluntary
dismissal of the case following the filing of a request for relief from the
automatic stay provided by section 362 of this title.” §109(g).

HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

fies as examples of “special circumstances” a “serious
medical condition or a call or order to active duty in the
Armed Forces,” ibid., and petitioner directs us to no au­
thority for the proposition that a prepetition decline in
income would qualify as a “special circumstance.” In any
event, the “special circumstances” exception is available
only to the extent that “there is no reasonable alternative,”
ibid., a proposition we reject with our interpretation of
§1325(b)(1) today.8
In sum, each of the strategies that petitioner identifies
for mitigating the anomalous effects of the mechanical
approach is flawed. There is no reason to think that Con­
gress meant for any of these strategies to operate as a
safety valve for the mechanical approach.
IV
We find petitioner’s remaining arguments unpersuasive.
Consistent with the text of §1325 and pre-BAPCPA prac­
tice, we hold that when a bankruptcy court calculates a
debtor’s projected disposable income, the court may ac­
count for changes in the debtor’s income or expenses that
are known or virtually certain at the time of confirmation.
We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.
It is so ordered.

——————
8 Petitioner also suggests that some Chapter 13 debtors may be able
to plead “special circumstances” on the expense side of the calculation
by virtue of BAPCPA’s incorporation of the Chapter 7 means test into
Chapter 13. See §707(b)(2)(B)(i), (ii). This is no help to debtors like
respondent, whose income has changed but whose expenses are con­
stant.
