No. 08–1301 [June 1, 2010] JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join the Court’s opinion except for Part III–C. I do not join that part because only the text Congress voted on, and not unapproved statements made or comments written during its drafting and enactment process, is an authori tative indicator of the law. But even if those preenact ment materials were relevant, it would be unnecessary to address them here. The Court’s thorough discussion of text, context, and structure, ante, at 5–17, demonstrates that the meaning of 18 U. S. C. §2250(a) is plain. As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 18, but does not heed, we must not say more: “We have stated time and again that courts must pre sume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is U. S. 249, 253–254 (1992) (citations and internal quo tation marks omitted).
