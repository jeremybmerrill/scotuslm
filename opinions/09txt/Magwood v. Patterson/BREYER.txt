No. 09–158 [June 24, 2010]  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, concurring in part and concur ring in the judgment. I join the Court’s well-reasoned opinion with the excep tion of Part IV–B. The Court neither purports to alter nor 930 (2007). See ante, at 14, n. 11. In Panetti, we “declined to interpret ‘second or successive’ as referring to all §2254 applications filed second or successively in time, even when the later filings address a state-court judgment already challenged in a prior §2254 application.” 551 U. S. at 944 (emphasis added). In this case, by contrast, we determine how 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) applies to a habeas petition that is the first petition to address a new “state court judgment” that has not “already [been] challenged in a prior §2254 application.” And, for the reasons provided by the Court, such a “first” petition is not “second or suc cessive.” Of course, as the dissent correctly states, if Magwood were challenging an undisturbed state-court judgment for the second time, abuse-of-the-writ principles would apply, including Panetti’s holding that an “applica tion” containing a “claim” that “the petitioner had no fair opportunity to raise” in his first habeas petition is not a “second or successive” application. Post, at 3 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, post, at 6–8, the Court’s decision today and our decision in Panetti fit comfortably together.
