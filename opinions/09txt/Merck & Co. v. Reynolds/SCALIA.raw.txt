MERCK & CO., INC., ET AL., PETITIONERS v. RICHARD
REYNOLDS ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[April 27, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
Private suits under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b), must be brought within
“(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the
violation” or “(2) 5 years after such violation,” whichever
comes first. 28 U. S. C. §1658(b)(1). I agree with the
Court that scienter is among the “facts constituting the
violation” that a plaintiff must “discove[r]” for the limita
tions period to begin. Ante, at 12–14 (internal quotation
marks omitted). I also agree that respondents’ suit is
timely, but for a reason different from the Court’s: Merck
has not shown that respondents actually “discover[ed]”
scienter more than two years before bringing suit.
In ordinary usage, “discovery” occurs when one actually
learns something new. See Webster’s New International
Dictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1957)
(defining “discovery” as “[f]inding out or ascertaining
something previously unknown or unrecognized”). As the
Court notes, however, ante, at 8–10, in the context of
statutes of limitations “discovery” has long carried an
additional meaning: It also occurs when a plaintiff, exer
cising reasonable diligence, should have discovered the
facts giving rise to his claim. See, e.g., Wood v. Carpenter,
101 U. S. 135, 140–142 (1879); 2 H. Wood, Limitations of

Opinion of SCALIA, J.

Actions §276b(11)–(13), pp. 1401–1408 (4th ed. 1916);
Dawson, Undiscovered Fraud and Statutes of Limitation,
31 Mich. L. Rev. 591, 619, and n. 77 (1933). Read in isola
tion, “discovery” in §1658(b)(1) might mean constructive
discovery.
In context, however, I do not believe it can. Section 13
of the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, explicitly estab
lished a constructive-discovery rule for claims under §§11
and 12 of that Act:
“No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability
created under section 77k or 77l(a)(2) of this title
unless brought within one year after the discovery of
the untrue statement or the omission, or after such
discovery should have been made by the exercise of
reasonable diligence . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §77m.
“[D]iscovery” in §77m obviously cannot mean constructive
discovery, since that would render superfluous the phrase
“or after such discovery should have been made by the
exercise of reasonable diligence.” Ibid. With §77m al
ready on the books, Congress added limitations periods in
the 1934 Act, 15 U. S. C. §§78i(e), 78r(c), that did not
contain similar qualifying language; instead, each estab
lished a time bar that runs from “discovery” simpliciter.
When Congress enacted §1658(b)(1) in 2002, establishing
a limitations period for private actions for “fraud, deceit,
manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula
tory requirement concerning the securities laws,” specifi
cally including the 1933 and 1934 Acts, see 15 U. S. C.
§78c(a)(47), it likewise included no constructive-discovery
caveat. To interpret §1658(b)(1) as imposing a construc
tive-discovery standard, one must therefore assume, con
trary to common sense, that the same word means two
very different things in the same statutory context of
limitations periods for securities-fraud actions under the
1933 and 1934 Acts.

Opinion of SCALIA, J.

True, the sensible presumption that a word means the
same thing when it appears more than once in the same
statutory context—or even in the very same statute—is
rebuttable. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.
Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595–596 (2004). Context may make
clear that in one instance the word carries one meaning,
and in a second instance another. See, e.g., id., at 596–
597. But nothing in the context of §77m or §1658(b)(1)
suggests that is the case. Both provisions impose limita
tions periods for federal-law claims based on various false
statements or omissions involving securities. The former
applies to false statements or omissions in registration
statements, §77k, and offers to sell securities, §77l(a)(2);
the broad language of the latter (“claim[s] of fraud, deceit,
manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula
tory requirement concerning the securities laws”) covers
other “manipulative or deceptive device[s] or contriv
ance[s]” made “in connection with the purchase or sale” of
a security in violation of Securities and Exchange Com
mission regulations, §78j(b), including SEC Rule 10b–5, 17
CFR §240.10b–5(b) (2009). There is good reason, more
over, for providing an actual-discovery rule for private
§10(b) claims but providing (explicitly) a constructive
discovery rule for claims governed by §77m: The elements
of §10(b) claims, which include scienter, are likely more
difficult to discover than the elements of claims under
§77k or §77l(a)(2), which do not, see Herman & MacLean
v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 382 (1983); Ernst & Ernst v.
Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 208–209 (1976); In re Morgan
Stanley Information Fund Securities Litigation, 592 F. 3d
347, 359 (CA2 2010). And a constructive-discovery stan
dard may be easier to apply to the claims covered by §77m.
Determining when the plaintiff should have uncovered an
untrue assertion in a registration statement or prospectus
is much simpler than assessing when a plaintiff should
have learned that the defendant deliberately misled him

Opinion of SCALIA, J.

using a deceptive device covered by §10(b).1
Unable to identify anything in the statutory context that
warrants giving “discovery” two meanings, the Court
relies on the historical treatment of “discovery” in limita
tions periods (particularly for fraud claims) as incorporat
ing a constructive-discovery rule. Ante, at 8–10, 12. But
that history proves only that “discovery” can carry that
technical meaning, and that without §77m it would be
reasonable (other things equal) to read it that way here.
It does not show what “discovery” means in §1658(b)(1) in
light of §77m’s codification of a constructive-discovery
rule. In my view, the meaning of “discovery” in the
broader context of limitations provisions is overcome by its
meaning in the more specific context of the federal securi
ties laws.
The Court’s other reason for rejecting the more natural
reading of §1658(b)(1) rests on a consensus among the
Courts of Appeals before the provision’s enactment. Ante,
at 11–12. In Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v.
Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), the Court notes, we
explicitly adopted the terms of §78i(e)—which like
§1658(b)(1) refers only to discovery with no mention of
reasonable diligence—as the limitations period for the
private §10(b) cause of action we created. Id., at 364, and
——————
1 The Court appears to believe that §77m’s distinction between actual
and constructive discovery has no bearing on §1658(b)(1)’s meaning
because the latter does not itself draw the same distinction. Ante, at
11–12. The point, however, is that both provisions use the same word
(“discovery”) with no contextual clue that it carries different meanings;
and its use in §77m makes clear that the meaning is actual discovery.
The Court suggests that usages of the same word in other statutes
are irrelevant, ante, at 11–12, but of course it does not believe that. Its
entire argument rests on the meaning courts have ascribed to “discov
ery” in other limitations provisions (some enacted decades ago by state
legislatures), ante, at 8–10. Yet while the Court considers that broader
context, it provides no explanation for ignoring the more specific
context of securities-fraud claims under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.

Opinion of SCALIA, J.

n. 9.2 Since every Circuit to address the issue between
Lampf and §1658(b)(1)’s enactment 11 years later had held
constructive discovery applicable to §10(b) claims—and
since Congress copied §78i(e)’s key text into §1658(b)(1)
with no indication it intended to adopt a contrary rule—the
Court assumes Congress meant to codify (or at least not to
disturb) that consensus. Ante, at 11–12.
Even assuming that Congress intended to incorporate
the Circuits’ views—which requires the further unrealistic
assumption that a majority of each House knew of and
agreed with the Courts of Appeals’ opinions—that would
be entirely irrelevant. Congress’s collective intent (if such
a thing even exists) cannot trump the text it enacts, and in
any event we have no reliable way to ascertain that intent
apart from reading the text. See Graham County Soil and
Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,
559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).
The only way in which the Circuits’ pre-2002 decisions
might bear on §1658(b)(1)’s meaning is if all (or nearly all)
of the Circuits had interpreted “discovery” in §78i(e) to
mean constructive discovery. If that were true, one could
say that those decisions had established the public mean
ing of the term in this context—whether Congress knew of
(or agreed with) that meaning or not. Jerman v. Carlisle,
McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich LPA, 559 U. S. ___, ___,
n. 1 (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring
——————
2 The Court notes that Lampf chose §78i(e)’s limitations period as the
time bar for §10(b) claims, even though it was aware of §77m, 501 U. S.,
at 360, and n. 7, 364, and n. 9; see ante, at 10–11. But I fail to see how
that provides any support for the Court’s interpretation. To the con
trary, the fact that in enacting §1658(b)(1) Congress did not copy
§77m’s constructive-discovery proviso—but decreed instead that “dis
covery” alone starts the clock (as it had done in §78i(e), which we
borrowed in Lampf)—is what makes equating §77m and §1658(b)(1) so
implausible.

in judgment) (slip op., at 2, n. 1).
But as amici note, that is not so. See Brief for Faculty
at Law and Business Schools as Amici Curiae 23–29 (here
inafter Faculty Brief). Some circuit cases cited by the
Court and amici can conceivably be read as interpreting
the language Lampf adopted from §78i(e) as imposing
some form of constructive discovery. See Theoharous v.
Fong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001); Menowitz v.
Brown, 991 F. 2d 36, 41 (CA2 1993) (per curiam); Howard
v. Haddad, 962 F. 2d 328, 329–330 (CA4 1992); Anixter v.
Home-Stake Production Co., 947 F. 2d 897, 898–899 (CA10
1991), vacated on other grounds, 503 U. S. 978 (1992).
Others, however, cannot be so construed. Two were not
interpreting §78i(e) at all, but looked directly to §77m,
despite Lampf’s explicit selection of §78i(e)’s terms. Great
Rivers Cooperative of Southeastern Iowa v. Farmland
Industries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893, 896 (CA8 1997); Topalian
v. Ehrman, 954 F. 2d 1125, 1135 (CA5 1992). Another
court candidly acknowledged that §78i(e)’s text—unlike
§77m’s—forecloses constructive discovery, but it nonethe
less held that courts remain “free to apply to [§78i(e)] the
judge-made doctrine of inquiry notice” as a “modest and
traditional . . . exercise of judicial creativity,” since “Con
gress could not have known when it enacted [§78i(e)] that
this section would someday provide the statute of limita
tions for a wide range of securities frauds.” Tregenza v.
Great American Communications Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721–
722 (CA7 1993) (Posner, J.).
The rest of the Circuits apparently had not decided the
issue before §1658(b)(1)’s enactment. See Betz v. Trainer
Wortham & Co., 519 F. 3d 863, 874 (CA9 2008); New
England Health Care Employees Pension Fund v. Ernst &
Young, LLP, 336 F. 3d 495, 500–501, and n. 3 (CA6 2003);
In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation, 306 F. 3d 1314,
1325 (CA3 2002); see also Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito
Aguada v. Kidder, Peabody & Co., 129 F. 3d 222, 224 (CA1

1997) (applying pre-Lampf rule under 15 U. S. C. §78aa–
1). And of those that were undecided, two had cast doubt
on a constructive-discovery view in dicta—of which the
omniscient Congress of the Court’s imagining should also
have been aware. See Berry v. Valence Technology, Inc.,
175 F. 3d 699, 703–705 (CA9 1999); Gruber v. Price Water
house, 911 F. 2d 960, 964, n. 4 (CA3 1990).
This motley assortment of approaches comes nowhere
near establishing that the word “discovery” in §78i(e)
meant constructive rather than actual discovery despite
§77m. Absent any textual or contextual reason to read
“discovery” differently in §1658(b)(1) and §77m, I would
hold that only actual discovery suffices to start the limita
tions period for §10(b) claims. Since Merck points to no
evidence showing respondents actually discovered scienter
more than two years before bringing this suit, I agree with
the Court that the suit was not time barred.
Respondents suggested at oral argument, Tr. of Oral
Arg. 29, and their amici imply, see Faculty Brief 33–34,
that in fraud-on-the-market cases there is little if any
difference between actual and constructive discovery
because of the presumption of reliance applicable in such
cases, see Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 247 (1988).
It seems to me Basic has no bearing on the question dis
cussed here. A presumption of reliance upon market-price
signals is not a presumption of knowledge of all public
information, much less knowledge of nonpublic informa
tion that a reasonably diligent investor would have inde
pendently uncovered. In any event, whether or not a
constructive-discovery standard will in many cases yield
the same result, actual discovery is what §1658(b)(1)
requires to start the limitations period.
