ROBERT MORRISON, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK 

LTD. ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,
concurring in the judgment.
While I agree that petitioners have failed to state a
claim on which relief can be granted, my reasoning differs
from the Court’s. I would adhere to the general approach
that has been the law in the Second Circuit, and most of
the rest of the country, for nearly four decades.
I
Today the Court announces a new “transactional test,”
ante, at 21, for defining the reach of §10(b) of the Securi­
ties Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 U. S. C.
§78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5(b)
(2009): Henceforth, those provisions will extend only to
“transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges
. . . and domestic transactions in other securities,” ante, at
18. If one confines one’s gaze to the statutory text, the
Court’s conclusion is a plausible one. But the federal
courts have been construing §10(b) in a different manner
for a long time, and the Court’s textual analysis is not
nearly so compelling, in my view, as to warrant the aban­
donment of their doctrine.
The text and history of §10(b) are famously opaque on
the question of when, exactly, transnational securities

frauds fall within the statute’s compass. As those types of
frauds became more common in the latter half of the 20th
century, the federal courts were increasingly called upon
to wrestle with that question. The Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit, located in the Nation’s financial cen­
ter, led the effort. Beginning in earnest with Schoenbaum
v. Firstbrook, 405 F. 2d 200, rev’d on rehearing on other
grounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (1968) (en banc), that court strove,
over an extended series of cases, to “discern” under what
circumstances “Congress would have wished the precious
resources of the United States courts and law enforcement
agencies to be devoted to [transnational] transactions,”
547 F. 3d 167, 170 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit­
ted). Relying on opinions by Judge Henry Friendly,1 the
Second Circuit eventually settled on a conduct-and-effects
test. This test asks “(1) whether the wrongful conduct
occurred in the Unites States, and (2) whether the wrong­
ful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or
upon United States citizens.” Id., at 171. Numerous cases
flesh out the proper application of each prong.
The Second Circuit’s test became the “north star” of
§10(b) jurisprudence, ante, at 8, not just regionally but
nationally as well. With minor variations, other courts
converged on the same basic approach.2 See Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 15 (“The courts have

Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326 (CA2 1972).
2 I acknowledge that the Courts of Appeals have differed in their ap­
plications of the conduct-and-effects test, with the consequence that
their respective rulings are not perfectly “cohesive.” Ante, at 10, n. 4.
It is nevertheless significant that the other Courts of Appeals, along
with the other branches of Government, have “embraced the Second
Circuit’s approach,” ante, at 9. If this Court were to do likewise, as I
would have us do, the lower courts would of course cohere even more
tightly around the Second Circuit’s rule.

uniformly agreed that Section 10(b) can apply to a trans­
national securities fraud either when fraudulent conduct
has effects in the United States or when sufficient conduct
relevant to the fraud occurs in the United States”); see
also 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the
United States §416 (1986) (setting forth conduct-and­
effects test). Neither Congress nor the Securities Ex­
change Commission (Commission) acted to change the
law. To the contrary, the Commission largely adopted the
Second Circuit’s position in its own adjudications. See
ante, at 23–24.
In light of this history, the Court’s critique of the deci­
sion below for applying “judge-made rules” is quite mis­
placed. Ante, at 11. This entire area of law is replete with
judge-made rules, which give concrete meaning to Con­
gress’ general commands.3 “When we deal with private
actions under Rule 10b–5,” then-Justice Rehnquist wrote
many years ago, “we deal with a judicial oak which has
grown from little more than a legislative acorn.” Blue
Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 737
(1975). The “ ‘Mother Court’ ” of securities law tended to
that oak. Id., at 762 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (describing
the Second Circuit). One of our greatest jurists—the judge
who, “without a doubt, did more to shape the law of securi­
ties regulation than any [other] in the country”4—was its
master arborist.
The development of §10(b) law was hardly an instance of

3 It is true that “when it comes to ‘the scope of [the] conduct prohib­
ited by [Rule 10b–5 and] §10(b), the text of the statute [has] control[led]
our decision[s].’ ” Ante, at 12, n. 5 (quoting Central Bank of Denver, N.
A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994);
some brackets in original). The problem, when it comes to transna­
tional securities frauds, is that the text of the statute does not provide a
great deal of control. As with any broadly phrased, longstanding
statute, courts have had to fill in the gaps.

judicial usurpation. Congress invited an expansive role
for judicial elaboration when it crafted such an open-ended
statute in 1934. And both Congress and the Commission
subsequently affirmed that role when they left intact the
relevant statutory and regulatory language, respectively,
throughout all the years that followed. See Brief for
Alecta pensionsförsäkring, ömsesidigt et al. as Amici
Curiae 31–33; cf. Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers
Ins. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 294 (1993) (inferring from
recent legislation Congress’ desire to “acknowledg[e]” the
10b–5 action without “entangling” itself in the precise
formulation thereof). Unlike certain other domains of
securities law, this is “a case in which Congress has en­
acted a regulatory statute and then has accepted, over a
long period of time, broad judicial authority to define
substantive standards of conduct and liability,” and much
else besides. Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.
Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 163 (2008).
This Court has not shied away from acknowledging that
authority. We have consistently confirmed that, in apply­
ing §10(b) and Rule 10b–5, courts may need “to flesh out
the portions of the law with respect to which neither the
congressional enactment nor the administrative regula­
tions offer conclusive guidance.” Blue Chip, 421 U. S., at
737. And we have unanimously “recogniz[ed] a judicial
authority to shape . . . the 10b–5 cause of action,” for that
is a task “Congress has left to us.” Musick, Peeler, 508
U. S., at 293, 294; see also id., at 292 (noting with ap­
proval that “federal courts have accepted and exercised
the principal responsibility for the continuing elaboration
of the scope of the 10b–5 right and the definition of the
duties it imposes”). Indeed, we have unanimously en­
dorsed the Second Circuit’s basic interpretive approach to
§10(b)—ridiculed by the Court today—of striving to “di­

vin[e] what Congress would have wanted,” ante, at 12.5
“Our task,” we have said, is “to attempt to infer how the
1934 Congress would have addressed the issue.” Musick,
Peeler, 508 U. S., at 294.
Thus, while the Court devotes a considerable amount of
attention to the development of the case law, ante, at 6–
10, it draws the wrong conclusions. The Second Circuit
refined its test over several decades and dozens of cases,
with the tacit approval of Congress and the Commission
and with the general assent of its sister Circuits. That
history is a reason we should give additional weight to the
Second Circuit’s “judge-made” doctrine, not a reason to
denigrate it. “The longstanding acceptance by the courts,
coupled with Congress’ failure to reject [its] reasonable
interpretation of the wording of §10(b), . . . argues signifi­
cantly in favor of acceptance of the [Second Circuit] rule
by this Court.” Blue Chip, 421 U. S., at 733.

approach—apart from what the Court views as its exces­
sive reliance on functional considerations and recon­
structed congressional intent—is that the Second Circuit

5 Even as the Court repeatedly declined to grant certiorari on cases
raising the issue, individual Justices went further and endorsed the
Second Circuit’s basic approach to determining the transnational reach
of §10(b). See, e.g., Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 529–
530 (1974) (Douglas, J., joined by Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ.,
dissenting) (“It has been recognized that the 1934 Act, including the
protections of Rule 10b–5, applies when foreign defendants have
defrauded American investors, particularly when . . . they have profited
by virtue of proscribed conduct within our boundaries. This is true
even when the defendant is organized under the laws of a foreign
country, is conducting much of its activity outside the United States,
and is therefore governed largely by foreign law” (citing, inter alia,
Leasco, 468 F. 2d, at 1334–1339, and Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405
F. 2d 200, rev’d on rehearing on other grounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (CA2
1968) (en banc))).

has “disregard[ed]” the presumption against extraterrito­
riality. Ante, at 6. It is the Court, however, that misap­
plies the presumption, in two main respects.
First, the Court seeks to transform the presumption
from a flexible rule of thumb into something more like a
clear statement rule. We have been here before. In the
case on which the Court primarily relies, EEOC v. Ara
bian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991) (Aramco),
Chief Justice Rehnquist’s majority opinion included a
sentence that appeared to make the same move. See id.,
at 258 (“Congress’ awareness of the need to make a clear
statement that a statute applies overseas is amply demon­
strated by the numerous occasions on which it has ex­
pressly legislated the extraterritorial application of a
statute”). Justice Marshall, in dissent, vigorously ob­
jected. See id., at 261 (“[C]ontrary to what one would
conclude from the majority’s analysis, this canon is not a
‘clear statement’ rule, the application of which relieves a
court of the duty to give effect to all available indicia of the
legislative will”).
Yet even Aramco—surely the most extreme application
of the presumption against extraterritoriality in my time
on the Court6—contained numerous passages suggesting
that the presumption may be overcome without a clear
directive. See id., at 248–255 (majority opinion) (repeat­
edly identifying congressional “intent” as the touchstone of
the presumption). And our cases both before and after
Aramco make perfectly clear that the Court continues to
give effect to “all available evidence about the meaning” of
a provision when considering its extraterritorial applica­
tion, lest we defy Congress’ will. Sale v. Haitian Centers
Council, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 177 (1993) (emphasis added).7

6 And also one of the most short lived. See Civil Rights Act of 1991,
§109, 105 Stat. 1077 (repudiating Aramco).

STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA’s personal view of statutory
interpretation, that evidence legitimately encompasses
more than the enacted text. Hence, while the Court’s
dictum that “[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of
an extraterritorial application, it has none,” ante, at 6,
makes for a nice catchphrase, the point is overstated. The
presumption against extraterritoriality can be useful as a
theory of congressional purpose, a tool for managing in­
ternational conflict, a background norm, a tiebreaker. It
does not relieve courts of their duty to give statutes the
most faithful reading possible.
Second, and more fundamentally, the Court errs in
suggesting that the presumption against extraterritorial­
ity is fatal to the Second Circuit’s test. For even if the
presumption really were a clear statement (or “clear indi­
cation,” ante, at 6, 16) rule, it would have only marginal
relevance to this case.
It is true, of course, that “this Court ordinarily construes
——————
(1993) (declining to apply presumption in assessing question of
Sherman Act extraterritoriality); Smith v. United States, 507 U. S. 197,
201–204 (1993) (opinion for the Court by Rehnquist, C. J.) (considering
presumption “[l]astly,” to resolve “any lingering doubt,” after consider­
ing structure, legislative history, and judicial interpretations of Federal
Tort Claims Act); cf. Sale, 509 U. S., at 188 (stating that presumption
“has special force when we are construing treaty and statutory provi­
sions that,” unlike §10(b), “may involve foreign and military affairs for
which the President has unique responsibility”); Dodge, Understanding
the Presumption Against Extraterritoriality, 16 Berkeley J. Int’l L. 85,
110 (1998) (explaining that lower courts “have been unanimous in
concluding that the presumption against extraterritoriality is not a
clear statement rule”). The Court also relies on Microsoft Corp. v.
AT&T Corp., 550 U. S. 437, 455–456 (2007). Ante, at 16. Yet Micro
soft’s articulation of the presumption is a far cry from the Court’s rigid
theory. “As a principle of general application,” Microsoft innocuously
observed, “we have stated that courts should ‘assume that legislators
take account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when
they write American laws.’ ” 550 U. S., at 455 (quoting F. Hoffmann-La
Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U. S. 155, 164 (2004)).

ambiguous statutes to avoid unreasonable interference
with the sovereign authority of other nations,”
F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U. S.
155, 164 (2004), and that, absent contrary evidence, we
presume “Congress is primarily concerned with domestic
conditions,” Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285
(1949). Accordingly, the presumption against extraterrito­
riality “provides a sound basis for concluding that Section
10(b) does not apply when a securities fraud with no ef­
fects in the United States is hatched and executed entirely
outside this country.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 22. But that is just about all it provides a sound
basis for concluding. And the conclusion is not very illu­
minating, because no party to the litigation disputes it.
No one contends that §10(b) applies to wholly foreign
frauds.
Rather, the real question in this case is how much, and
what kinds of, domestic contacts are sufficient to trigger
application of §10(b).8 In developing its conduct-and­
effects test, the Second Circuit endeavored to derive a
solution from the Exchange Act’s text, structure, history,
and purpose. Judge Friendly and his colleagues were well
aware that United States courts “cannot and should not
expend [their] resources resolving cases that do not affect
Americans or involve fraud emanating from America.”

must ultimately grapple with the basic issue of what connection to the
United States is sufficient to justify the assumption that Congress

swer. The text of the Exchange Act indicates that §10(b)
extends to at least some activities with an international
component, but, again, it is not pellucid as to which ones.9
The Second Circuit draws the line as follows: §10(b) ex­
tends to transnational frauds “only when substantial acts
in furtherance of the fraud were committed within the
United States,” SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 193 (CA2
2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), or when the
fraud was “ ‘intended to produce’ ” and did produce “ ‘det­
rimental effects within’ ” the United States, Schoenbaum,
405 F. 2d, at 206.10
This approach is consistent with the understanding
——————
9 By

its terms, §10(b) regulates “interstate commerce,” 15 U. S. C.
§78j, which the Exchange Act defines to include “trade, commerce,
transportation, or communication . . . between any foreign country and
any State, or between any State and any place or ship outside thereof.”
§78c(a)(17). Other provisions of the Exchange Act make clear that
Congress contemplated some amount of transnational application. See,
e.g., §78b(2) (stating, in explaining necessity for regulation, that “[t]he
prices established and offered in [securities] transactions are generally
disseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign
countries and constitute a basis for determining and establishing the
prices at which securities are bought and sold”); §78dd(b) (exempting
from regulation foreign parties “unless” they transact business in
securities “in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Com­
mission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate to prevent the
evasion of this chapter” (emphasis added)); see also Schoenbaum, 405
F. 2d, at 206–208 (reviewing statutory text and legislative history).
The Court finds these textual references insufficient to overcome the
presumption against extraterritoriality, ante, at 13–15, but as ex­
plained in the main text, that finding rests upon the Court’s misappli­
cation of the presumption.
10 The Government submits that a “transnational securities fraud
violates Section 10(b) if significant conduct material to the fraud’s
success occurs in the United States.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 6. I understand the Government’s submission to be largely a
repackaging of the “conduct” prong of the Second Circuit’s test. The
Government expresses no view on that test’s “effects” prong, as the
decision below considered only respondents’ conduct. See id., at 15,
n. 2; 547 F. 3d 167, 171 (CA2 2008).

shared by most scholars that Congress, in passing the
Exchange Act, “expected U. S. securities laws to apply to
certain international transactions or conduct.” Buxbaum,
Multinational Class Actions Under Federal Securities
Law: Managing Jurisdictional Conflict, 46 Colum. J.
Transnat’l L. 14, 19 (2007); see also Leasco Data Process
ing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326, 1336 (CA2
1972) (Friendly, J.) (detailing evidence that Congress
“meant §10(b) to protect against fraud in the sale or pur­
chase of securities whether or not these were traded on
organized United States markets”). It is also consistent
with the traditional understanding, regnant in the 1930’s
as it is now, that the presumption against extraterritorial­
ity does not apply “when the conduct [at issue] occurs
within the United States,” and has lesser force when “the
failure to extend the scope of the statute to a foreign set­
ting will result in adverse effects within the United
States.” Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Massey, 986
F. 2d 528, 531 (CADC 1993); accord, Restatement (Second)
of Foreign Relations Law of the United States §38 (1964–
1965); cf. Small v. United States, 544 U. S. 385, 400 (2005)
(THOMAS, J., joined by SCALIA and KENNEDY, JJ., dissent­
ing) (presumption against extraterritoriality “lend[s] no
support” to a “rule restricting a federal statute from reach­
ing conduct within U. S. borders”); Continental Ore Co. v.
Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U. S. 690, 705 (1962)
(presumption against extraterritoriality not controlling
“[s]ince the activities of the defendants had an impact
within the United States and upon its foreign trade”).
And it strikes a reasonable balance between the goals of
“preventing the export of fraud from America,” protecting
shareholders, enhancing investor confidence, and deter­
ring corporate misconduct, on the one hand, and conserv­
ing United States resources and limiting conflict with

foreign law, on the other.11 547 F. 3d, at 175.
Thus, while §10(b) may not give any “clear indication”
on its face as to how it should apply to transnational
securities frauds, ante, at 6, 16, it does give strong clues
that it should cover at least some of them, see n. 9, supra.
And in my view, the Second Circuit has done the best job
of discerning what sorts of transnational frauds Congress
meant in 1934—and still means today—to regulate. I do
not take issue with the Court for beginning its inquiry
with the statutory text, rather than the doctrine in the
Courts of Appeals. Cf. ante, at 18, n. 9. I take issue with
the Court for beginning and ending its inquiry with the
statutory text, when the text does not speak with geo­
graphic precision, and for dismissing the long pedigree of,
and the persuasive account of congressional intent embod­
ied in, the Second Circuit’s rule.
Repudiating the Second Circuit’s approach in its en­
tirety, the Court establishes a novel rule that will foreclose
private parties from bringing §10(b) actions whenever the
relevant securities were purchased or sold abroad and are
not listed on a domestic exchange.12 The real motor of the
——————
11 Given its focus on “domestic conditions,” Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo,
336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949), I expect that virtually all “ ‘foreign-cubed’ ”
actions—actions in which “(1) foreign plaintiffs [are] suing (2) a foreign
issuer in an American court for violations of American securities laws
based on securities transactions in (3) foreign countries,” 547 F. 3d, at
172—would fail the Second Circuit’s test. As they generally should.
Under these circumstances, the odds of the fraud having a substantial
connection to the United States are low. In recognition of the Exchange
Act’s focus on American investors and the novelty of foreign-cubed
lawsuits, and in the interest of promoting clarity, it might have been
appropriate to incorporate one bright line into the Second Circuit’s test,
by categorically excluding such lawsuits from §10(b)’s ambit.
12 The Court’s opinion does not, however, foreclose the Commission
from bringing enforcement actions in additional circumstances, as no
issue concerning the Commission’s authority is presented by this case.
The Commission’s enforcement proceedings not only differ from private
§10(b) actions in numerous potentially relevant respects, see Brief for

STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

Court’s opinion, it seems, is not the presumption against
extraterritoriality but rather the Court’s belief that trans­
actions on domestic exchanges are “the focus of the Ex­
change Act” and “the objects of [its] solicitude.” Ante, at
17, 18. In reality, however, it is the “public interest” and
“the interests of investors” that are the objects of the
statute’s solicitude. Europe & Overseas Commodity Trad
ers, S. A. v. Banque Paribas London, 147 F. 3d 118, 125
(CA2 1998) (citing H. R. Rep. No. 1838, 73d Cong., 2d
Sess., 32–33 (1934)); see also Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485
U. S. 224, 230 (1988) (“The 1934 Act was designed to
protect investors against manipulation of stock prices”
(citing S. Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1–5 (1934));
Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 195 (1976)
(“The 1934 Act was intended principally to protect inves­
tors . . . ”); S. Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 68 (1934)
(“The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 aims to protect the
interests of the public against the predatory operations of
directors, officers, and principal stockholders of corpora­
tions . . . ”). And while the clarity and simplicity of the
Court’s test may have some salutary consequences, like all
bright-line rules it also has drawbacks.
Imagine, for example, an American investor who buys
shares in a company listed only on an overseas exchange.
That company has a major American subsidiary with
executives based in New York City; and it was in New
York City that the executives masterminded and imple­
mented a massive deception which artificially inflated the
stock price—and which will, upon its disclosure, cause the

self-restraint and consideration of foreign governmental sensibilities
generally exercised by the U. S. Government’ ” (quoting Griffin, Extra­
territoriality in U. S. and EU Antitrust Enforcement, 67 Antitrust L. J.

price to plummet. Or, imagine that those same executives
go knocking on doors in Manhattan and convince an unso­
phisticated retiree, on the basis of material misrepresen­
tations, to invest her life savings in the company’s doomed
securities. Both of these investors would, under the
Court’s new test, be barred from seeking relief under
§10(b).
The oddity of that result should give pause. For in
walling off such individuals from §10(b), the Court nar­
rows the provision’s reach to a degree that would surprise
and alarm generations of American investors—and, I am
convinced, the Congress that passed the Exchange Act.
Indeed, the Court’s rule turns §10(b) jurisprudence (and
the presumption against extraterritoriality) on its head,
by withdrawing the statute’s application from cases in
which there is both substantial wrongful conduct that
occurred in the United States and a substantial injurious

In my judgment, if petitioners’ allegations of fraudulent
misconduct that took place in Florida are true, then re­
spondents may have violated §10(b), and could potentially
be held accountable in an enforcement proceeding brought
by the Commission. But it does not follow that sharehold­

the fraud occurred in the United States, or that the fraud
had an adverse impact on American investors or markets,
may maintain a private action to recover damages they
suffered abroad. Some cases involving foreign securities

securities law based on a plausible, but hardly decisive,

short shrift to the United States’ interest in remedying
frauds that transpire on American soil or harm American
citizens, as well as to the accumulated wisdom and experi­
ence of the lower courts. I happen to agree with the result
the Court reaches in this case. But “I respectfully dis­
sent,” once again, “from the Court’s continuing campaign
to render the private cause of action under §10(b)
toothless.” Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 175 (STEVENS, J.,
