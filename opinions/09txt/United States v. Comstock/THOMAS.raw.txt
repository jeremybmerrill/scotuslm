UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. GRAYDON 

EARL COMSTOCK, JR., ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[May 17, 2010] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins in
all but Part III–A–1–b, dissenting.
The Court holds today that Congress has power under
the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact a law authoriz
ing the Federal Government to civilly commit “sexually
dangerous person[s]” beyond the date it lawfully could
hold them on a charge or conviction for a federal crime. 18
U. S. C. §4248(a). I disagree. The Necessary and Proper
Clause empowers Congress to enact only those laws that
“carr[y] into Execution” one or more of the federal powers
enumerated in the Constitution. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Because
§4248 “Execut[es]” no enumerated power, I must respect
fully dissent.

“As every schoolchild learns, our Constitution estab
lishes a system of dual sovereignty between the States and
the Federal Government.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.
452, 457 (1991). In our system, the Federal Government’s
powers are enumerated, and hence limited. See, e.g.,
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819) (“This
government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumer
ated powers”). Thus, Congress has no power to act unless
the Constitution authorizes it to do so. United States v.
Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000) (“Every law enacted

by Congress must be based on one or more of its powers
enumerated in the Constitution”). The States, in turn, are
free to exercise all powers that the Constitution does not
withhold from them. Amdt. 10 (“The powers not delegated
to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by
it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or
to the people”).1 This constitutional structure establishes
different default rules for Congress and the States: Con
gress’ powers are “few and defined,” while those that
belong to the States “remain . . . numerous and indefinite.”
The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J.
Madison).
The Constitution plainly sets forth the “few and defined”
powers that Congress may exercise. Article I “vest[s]” in
Congress “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,” §1, and
carefully enumerates those powers in §8. The final clause
of §8, the Necessary and Proper Clause, authorizes Con
gress “[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and
proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers,
and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the
Government of the United States, or in any Department or
Officer thereof.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18. As the Clause’s place
ment at the end of §8 indicates, the “foregoing Powers” are
those granted to Congress in the preceding clauses of that
section. The “other Powers” to which the Clause refers are
those “vested” in Congress and the other branches by
other specific provisions of the Constitution.
Chief Justice Marshall famously summarized Congress’
authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in
McCulloch, which has stood for nearly 200 years as this

ments and the people of the States: It is up to the people of each State
to determine which ‘reserved’ powers their state government may
exercise.” U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 848
(1995) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).

THOMAS, J., dissenting

Court’s definitive interpretation of that text:
“Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of
the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not
prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the
constitution, are constitutional.” 4 Wheat., at 421.
McCulloch’s summation is descriptive of the Clause
itself, providing that federal legislation is a valid exercise
of Congress’ authority under the Clause if it satisfies a
two-part test: First, the law must be directed toward a
“legitimate” end, which McCulloch defines as one “within
the scope of the [C]onstitution”—that is, the powers ex
pressly delegated to the Federal Government by some
provision in the Constitution. Second, there must be a
necessary and proper fit between the “means” (the federal
law) and the “end” (the enumerated power or powers) it is
designed to serve. Ibid. McCulloch accords Congress a
certain amount of discretion in assessing means-end fit
under this second inquiry. The means Congress selects
will be deemed “necessary” if they are “appropriate” and
“plainly adapted” to the exercise of an enumerated power,
and “proper” if they are not otherwise “prohibited” by the
Constitution and not “[in]consistent” with its “letter and
spirit.” Ibid.
Critically, however, McCulloch underscores the linear
relationship the Clause establishes between the two in
quiries: Unless the end itself is “legitimate,” the fit be
tween means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no
matter how “necessary” or “proper” an Act of Congress
may be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legis
late if the objective is anything other than “carrying into
Execution” one or more of the Federal Government’s enu
merated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18.
This limitation was of utmost importance to the Fram
ers.
During the State ratification debates, Anti

Federalists expressed concern that the Necessary and
Proper Clause would give Congress virtually unlimited
power. See, e.g., Essays of Brutus, in 2 The Complete
Anti-Federalist 421 (H. Storing ed. 1981). Federalist
supporters of the Constitution swiftly refuted that charge,
explaining that the Clause did not grant Congress any
freestanding authority, but instead made explicit what
was already implicit in the grant of each enumerated
power. Referring to the “powers declared in the Constitu
tion,” Alexander Hamilton noted that “it is expressly to
execute these powers that the sweeping clause . . . author
izes the national legislature to pass all necessary and
proper laws.” The Federalist No. 33, at 245. James Madi
son echoed this view, stating that “the sweeping clause . . .
only extend[s] to the enumerated powers.” 3 J. Elliot, The
Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption
of the Federal Constitution 455 (2d ed. 1854) (hereinafter
Elliot). Statements by delegates to the state ratification
conventions indicate that this understanding was widely
held by the founding generation. E.g., id., at 245–246
(statement of George Nicholas) (“Suppose [the Necessary
and Proper Clause] had been inserted, at the end of every
power, that they should have power to make laws to carry
that power into execution; would that have increased their
powers? If, therefore, it could not have increased their
powers, if placed at the end of each power, it cannot in
crease them at the end of all”).2

Roughly 30 years after the Constitution’s ratification,
McCulloch firmly established this understanding in our
constitutional jurisprudence. 4 Wheat., at 421, 423. Since
then, our precedents uniformly have maintained that the
Necessary and Proper Clause is not an independent fount
of congressional authority, but rather “a caveat that Con
gress possesses all the means necessary to carry out the
specifically granted ‘foregoing’ powers of §8 ‘and all other
Powers vested by this Constitution.’ ” Kinsella v. United
States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 247 (1960); Carter
v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 291 (1936); see Alden v.
Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 739 (1999); Martin v. Hunter’s Les

Section 4248 establishes a federal civil-commitment

n. 24 (1993).
3 The statute authorizes the Attorney General to petition a federal
court to order the commitment of a person in BOP custody (1) who has
been convicted of a federal crime and is serving a federal prison sen
tence therefor, (2) who has been found mentally incompetent to stand
trial, or (3) “against whom all federal criminal charges have been
dismissed solely for reasons related to his mental condition.” 18

dangerous,”4 a court may order the person committed until
he is no longer a risk “to others,” even if that does not
occur until after his federal criminal sentence has expired
or the statute of limitations on the federal charge against
him has run. §§4248(a), (d)–(e).
No enumerated power in Article I, §8, expressly dele
gates to Congress the power to enact a civil-commitment
regime for sexually dangerous persons, nor does any other
provision in the Constitution vest Congress or the other
branches of the Federal Government with such a power.
Accordingly, §4248 can be a valid exercise of congressional
authority only if it is “necessary and proper for carrying
into Execution” one or more of those federal powers actu
ally enumerated in the Constitution.
Section 4248 does not fall within any of those powers.
The Government identifies no specific enumerated power
or powers as a constitutional predicate for §4248, and none
are readily discernable. Indeed, not even the Commerce
Clause—the enumerated power this Court has interpreted
most expansively, see, e.g., NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin
Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937)—can justify federal civil
detention of sex offenders. Under the Court’s precedents,
Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity (such as
sexual violence) based solely on the effect such activity
may have, in individual cases or in the aggregate, on
interstate commerce. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 617–618;
United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 563–567 (1995).

It further defines “sexually dangerous to others” to mean a person who
“suffers from a serious mental illness” such that he would “have serious
difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molesta
tion if released.” §4247(a)(6).

THOMAS, J., dissenting

Government has never argued otherwise, see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 21–22.5
This Court, moreover, consistently has recognized that
the power to care for the mentally ill and, where neces
sary, the power “to protect the community from the dan
gerous tendencies of some” mentally ill persons, are
among the numerous powers that remain with the States.
Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 426 (1979). As a conse
quence, we have held that States may “take measures to
restrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill”—
including those who are sexually dangerous—provided
that such commitments satisfy due process and other
constitutional requirements. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521
U. S. 346, 363 (1997).
Section 4248 closely resembles the involuntary civil
commitment laws that States have enacted under their
parens patriae and general police powers. Indeed, it is
clear, on the face of the Act and in the Government’s
arguments urging its constitutionality, that §4248 is
aimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence,
not toward “carrying into Execution” any enumerated
power or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam
Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat.
587 (entitled “[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual
exploitation and violent crime”), §102, id., at 590 (state
ment of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated
“to protect the public from sex offenders”); Brief for United
States 38–39 (asserting the Federal Government’s power
to “protect the public from harm that might result upon
these prisoners’ release, even when that harm might arise
from conduct that is otherwise beyond the general regula
tory powers of the federal government” (emphasis added)).
——————
5 For the reasons explained in Part III–A–2, infra, the enumerated
power that justifies a particular defendant’s criminal arrest or convic
tion cannot justify his subsequent civil detention under §4248.

UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
THOMAS, J., dissenting

To be sure, protecting society from violent sexual of
fenders is certainly an important end. Sexual abuse is a
despicable act with untold consequences for the victim
personally and society generally. See, e.g., Kennedy v.
Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2, (2008) (ALITO, J., dis
senting) (slip op., at 9, n. 2, 22–23). But the Constitution
does not vest in Congress the authority to protect society
from every bad act that might befall it.6 New York v.
United States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992) (“ ‘The question is
not what power the Federal Government ought to have
but what powers in fact have been given by the people’ ”
(quoting United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 63 (1936)).
In my view, this should decide the question. Section
4248 runs afoul of our settled understanding of Congress’
power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Congress
may act under that Clause only when its legislation
“carr[ies] into Execution” one of the Federal Government’s
enumerated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Section 4248 does
not execute any enumerated power. Section 4248 is there
fore unconstitutional.
III
The Court perfunctorily genuflects to McCulloch’s
framework for assessing Congress’ Necessary and Proper
Clause authority, and to the principle of dual sovereignty
it helps to maintain, then promptly abandons both in favor
of a novel five-factor test supporting its conclusion that
§4248 is a “ ‘necessary and proper’ ” adjunct to a jumble of
unenumerated “authorit[ies].” Ante, at 22. The Court’s
newly minted test cannot be reconciled with the Clause’s
plain text or with two centuries of our precedents inter

6 The absence of a constitutional delegation of general police power to
Congress does not leave citizens vulnerable to the harms Congress
seeks to regulate in §4248 because, as recent legislation indicates, the

preting it. It also raises more questions than it answers.
Must each of the five considerations exist before the Court
sustains future federal legislation as proper exercises of
Congress’ Necessary and Proper Clause authority? What
if the facts of a given case support a finding of only four
considerations? Or three? And if three or four will suffice,
which three or four are imperative? At a minimum, this
shift from the two-step McCulloch framework to this five
consideration approach warrants an explanation as to why
McCulloch is no longer good enough and which of the five
considerations will bear the most weight in future cases,
assuming some number less than five suffices. (Or, if not,
why all five are required.) The Court provides no answers
to these questions.
A
I begin with the first and last “considerations” in the
Court’s inquiry. Ante, at 5. The Court concludes that
§4248 is a valid exercise of Congress’ Necessary and
Proper Clause authority because that authority is “broad,”
ibid., and because “the links between §4248 and an enu
merated Article I power are not too attenuated,” ante, at
18. In so doing, the Court first inverts, then misapplies,
McCulloch’s straightforward two-part test.
1
a
First, the Court describes Congress’ lawmaking power
under the Necessary and Proper Clause as “broad,” relying
on precedents that have upheld federal laws under the
Clause after finding a “ ‘rationa[l]’ ” fit between the law
and an enumerated power. Ante, at 6 (quoting Sabri v.
United States, 541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004)). It is true that
this Court’s precedents allow Congress a certain degree of
latitude in selecting the means for “carrying into Execu

tion” an end that is “legitimate.”7 See, e.g., Jinks v. Rich
land County, 538 U. S. 456, 462–463 (2003) (citing
McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 417, 421). But in citing these
cases, the Court puts the cart before the horse: The fit
between means and ends matters only if the end is in fact
legitimate—i.e., only if it is one of the Federal Govern
ment’s enumerated powers.
By starting its inquiry with the degree of deference
owed to Congress in selecting means to further a legiti
mate end, the Court bypasses McCulloch’s first step and
fails carefully to examine whether the end served by §4248
is actually one of those powers. See Part III–A–2, infra.
b
Second, instead of asking the simple question of what
enumerated power §4248 “carr[ies] into Execution” at
McCulloch’s first step, the Court surveys other laws Con
gress has enacted and concludes that, because §4248 is
related to those laws, the “links” between §4248 and an
enumerated power are not “too attenuated”; hence, §4248
is a valid exercise of Congress’ Necessary and Proper
Clause authority. Ante, at 18. This unnecessarily con
fuses the analysis and, if followed to its logical extreme,
would result in an unwarranted expansion of federal
——————
7 JUSTICE

KENNEDY concludes that the Necessary and Proper Clause
requires something beyond rational-basis scrutiny when assessing the
fit between an enumerated power and the means Congress selects to
execute it. Ante, at 2–4 (opinion concurring in judgment). Other
arguments regarding the degree of fit between means and end have
been lodged elsewhere. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 61
(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (arguing that, for a law to be within the
Necessary and Proper Clause, it must bear an “ ‘obvious, simple, and
direct relation’ ” to an exercise of Congress’ enumerated powers and
must not subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty).
But I find that debate beside the point here, because it concerns the
analysis employed at McCulloch’s second step, see McCulloch v. Mary
land, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), while the Court’s decision today errs by
skipping the first.

power.
The Court observes that Congress has the undisputed
authority to “criminalize conduct” that interferes with
enumerated powers; to “imprison individuals who engage
in that conduct”; to “enact laws governing [those] prisons”;
and to serve as a “custodian of its prisoners.” Ante, at 9,
14. From this, the Court assumes that §4248 must also be
a valid exercise of congressional power because it is “ ‘rea
sonably adapted’ ” to those exercises of Congress’ inciden
tal—and thus unenumerated—authorities. See ante, at 15
(concluding that “§4248 is ‘reasonably adapted’ to Con
gress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian”
(citation omitted)); ante, at 22 (concluding that “the stat
ute is a ‘necessary and proper’ means of exercising the
federal authority that permits Congress to create federal
criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison viola
tors, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to
maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but
who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of oth
ers”). But that is not the question. The Necessary and
Proper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to
enact any law simply because it furthers other laws Con
gress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental author
ity; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every
federal statute “carr[ies] into Execution” one or more of
the Federal Government’s enumerated powers.8
——————

makes this point clear. As the Court notes, ante, at 18–
19, McCulloch states, in discussing a hypothetical, that from Congress’
enumerated power to establish post offices and post roads “has been
inferred the power and duty of carrying the mail,” and, “from this
implied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who
steal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.” 4 Wheat., at 417.
Contrary to the Court’s interpretation, this dictum does not suggest
that the relationship between Congress’ implied power to punish postal
crimes and its implied power to carry the mail is alone sufficient to
satisfy review under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Instead,
McCulloch directly links the constitutionality of the former to Congress’


12

UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes
with enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who
engage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and
treatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal
sentence satisfy this test because each helps to “carr[y]
into Execution” the enumerated powers that justify a
criminal defendant’s arrest or conviction. For example,
Congress’ enumerated power “[t]o establish Post Offices
and post Roads,” Art. I, §8, cl. 7, would lack force or practi
cal effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact crimi
nal laws “to punish those who steal letters from the post
office, or rob the mail.” McCulloch, supra, at 417. Simi
larly, that enumerated power would be compromised if
there were no prisons to hold persons who violate those
laws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that
prisoners could escape or demand their release on the
grounds that the conditions of their confinement violate
their constitutional rights, at least as we have defined
them. See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976).

enumerated power “ ‘to establish post offices and post roads.’ ” Ibid.
(explaining that “the right to . . . punish those who rob [the mail] is not
indispensably necessary to the establishment of a post office and post
road,” but is “essential to the beneficial exercise of th[at] power”). More
importantly, McCulloch’s holding, as well as the holdings of this Court’s
subsequent decisions, make plain that congressional action is valid
under the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it carries into execution
one or more enumerated powers. Id., at 422 (upholding Congress’
incorporation of a bank because it was a “means . . . to be employed
only for the purpose of carrying into execution the given powers” (em
phasis added)); see Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004)

federal moneys to promote the general welfare, and it has correspond

THOMAS, J., dissenting

Civil detention under §4248, on the other hand, lacks any
such connection to an enumerated power.
2
After focusing on the relationship between §4248 and
several of Congress’ implied powers, the Court finally
concludes that the civil detention of a “sexually dangerous
person” under §4248 carries into execution the enumer
ated power that justified that person’s arrest or conviction
in the first place. In other words, the Court analogizes
§4248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care
for federal inmates while they serve sentences or await
trial. But while those laws help to “carr[y] into Execution”
the enumerated power that justifies the imposition of
criminal sanctions on the inmate, §4248 does not bear that
essential characteristic for three reasons.
First, the statute’s definition of a “sexually dangerous
person” contains no element relating to the subject’s
crime. See §§4247(a)(5)–(6). It thus does not require a
federal court to find any connection between the reasons
supporting civil commitment and the enumerated power
with which that person’s criminal conduct interfered. As a
consequence, §4248 allows a court to civilly commit an
individual without finding that he was ever charged with
or convicted of a federal crime involving sexual violence.
§§4248(a), (d). That possibility is not merely hypothetical:
The Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals
against whom §4248 proceedings have been brought fit
this description.9 Tr. of Oral Arg. 23–25.
Second, §4248 permits the term of federal civil commit
ment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted
——————
9 The statute does require the court to find that the subject “has en
gaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child
molestation,” §4247(a)(5), but that factual predicate can be established
by a state conviction, or by clear and convincing evidence that the
person committed a sex crime for which he was never charged.


14

UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
THOMAS, J., dissenting

prisoner’s sentence expires or the date on which the stat
ute of limitations on an untried defendant’s crime has run.
The statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a
person at a time when the Government would lack juris
diction to detain him for violating a criminal law that
executes an enumerated power.
The statute this Court upheld in Greenwood v. United
States, 350 U. S. 366 (1956), provides a useful contrast.
That statute authorized the Federal Government to exer
cise civil custody over a federal defendant declared men
tally unfit to stand trial only “ ‘until the accused shall be
mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending
charges against him are disposed of according to law.’ ”
Id., at 368, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §4246 (1952 ed.)).
Thus, that statute’s “end” reasonably could be interpreted
as preserving the Government’s power to enforce a crimi
nal law against the accused. Section 4248 (2006 ed.),
however, authorizes federal detention of a person even
after the Government loses the authority to prosecute him
for a federal crime.
Third, the definition of a “sexually dangerous person”
relevant to §4248 does not require the court to find that
the person is likely to violate a law executing an enumer
ated power in the future. Although the Federal Govern
ment has no express power to regulate sexual violence
generally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscrib
ing such conduct in special circumstances. All of these
statutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a
connection to one of Congress’ enumerated powers—such
as interstate commerce, e.g., §2252(a)(2)—or that limit the
statute’s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has
plenary authority, e.g., §2243(a). Section 4248, by con
trast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that
the person is “sexually dangerous,” and presents a risk “to
others,” §4247(a)(5). It requires no evidence that this
sexually dangerous condition will manifest itself in a way

15

THOMAS, J., dissenting

that interferes with a federal law that executes an enu
merated power or in a geographic location over which
Congress has plenary authority.10
In sum, the enumerated powers that justify a criminal
defendant’s arrest or conviction cannot justify his subse
quent civil detention under §4248.
B
The remaining “considerations” in the Court’s five-part
inquiry do not alter this conclusion.

First, in a final attempt to analogize §4248 to laws that
authorize the Federal Government to provide care and
treatment to prisoners while they await trial or serve a
criminal sentence, the Court cites the Second Restatement
of Torts for the proposition that the Federal Government
has a “custodial interest” in its prisoners, ante, at 22, and,
thus, a broad “constitutional power to act in order to pro
tect nearby (and other) communities” from the dangers

10 The Constitution grants Congress plenary authority over certain
jurisdictions where no other sovereign exists, including the District of
Columbia, Art. I, §8, cl. 17, and federal territories, Art. IV, §3, cl. 2. In
addition, Congress has “broad general powers to legislate in respect to
Indian tribes,” United States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (citing
Art. I, §8, cl. 3; Art. II, §2, cl. 2), including certain special responsibili
ties over “Indian country,” 18 U. S. C. §1151. Although the Necessary
and Proper Clause did not authorize Congress to enact §4248, I do not
rule out the possibility that Congress could provide for the civil com
mitment of individuals who enter federal custody as a result of acts
committed in these jurisdictions. See, e.g., United States v. Cohen, 733
F. 2d 128 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (upholding civil commitment of a
defendant under a District of Columbia statute authorizing the institu
tionalization of persons acquitted by reason of insanity). Although two
of the respondents in this case were either charged with or convicted of
criminal acts committed in such jurisdictions, see ante, at 3; 507
F. Supp. 2d 522, 527, and n. 2 (EDNC 2007), that question is not
presented here because §4248 does not make that fact essential to an
individual’s placement in civil detention.

they may pose,11 ante, at 14. That citation is puzzling
because federal authority derives from the Constitution,
not the common law. In any event, nothing in the Re
statement suggests that a common-law custodian has the
powers that Congress seeks here. While the Restatement
provides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable
steps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause
“bodily harm to others,” 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts
§319, p. 129 (1963–1964), that duty terminates once the
legal basis for custody expires:
“There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third
person as to prevent him from causing physical harm
to another unless
“(a) a special relation exists between the actor and
the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor
to control the third person’s conduct, or
“(b) a special relation exists between the actor and
the other which gives to the other a right to protec
tion.” Id., §315, at 122.
Once the Federal Government’s criminal jurisdiction over
a prisoner ends, so does any “special relation[ship]” be
tween the Government and the former prisoner.12
——————
11 The Court also cites Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307 (1982), but
that case lends even less support than the Restatement. In Youngberg,
an inmate at a state hospital argued that hospital workers violated his
constitutional rights when they applied restraints to keep him in his
bed at the hospital infirmary. Id., at 310–311. In assessing that claim,
this Court noted that the hospital had a responsibility to “protect its
residents” from the danger of violence. Id., at 320 (emphasis added).
The Court never suggested that this responsibility extended to “nearby
(and other) communities.” Ante, at 14. Moreover, the hospital was a
state institution. Nothing in Youngberg suggests that the Federal
Government can detain a person beyond the date on which its criminal
jurisdiction expires for fear that he may later pose a threat to the
surrounding community.

THOMAS, J., dissenting

For this reason, I cannot agree with JUSTICE ALITO that
§4248 is a necessary and proper incident of Congress’
power “to protect the public from dangers created by the
federal criminal justice and prison systems.” Ante, at 3
(concurring in judgment). A federal criminal defendant’s
“sexually dangerous” propensities are not “created by” the
fact of his incarceration or his relationship with the fed
eral prison system. The fact that the Federal Government
has the authority to imprison a person for the purpose of
punishing him for a federal crime—sex-related or other
wise—does not provide the Government with the addi
tional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that
person.13
2
Second, the Court describes §4248 as a “modest” expan
sion on a statutory framework with a long historical pedi
gree. Ante, at 9. Yet even if the antiquity of a practice
could serve as a substitute for its constitutionality—and
the Court admits that it cannot, ibid.—the Court over
states the relevant history.
Congress’ first foray into this general area occurred in
1855, when it established St. Elizabeth’s Hospital to pro
vide treatment to “insane” persons in the military and the
——————
is complete. 18 U. S. C. §§3583, 3624(e). Contrary to the Government’s
suggestion, federal authority to exercise control over individuals
serving terms of “supervised release” does not derive from the Govern
ment’s “relationship” with the prisoner, see Brief for United States 38,
but from the original criminal sentence itself. Supervised release thus
serves to execute the enumerated power that justifies the defendant’s
statute of conviction, just like any other form of punishment imposed at
sentencing.
13 The fact that Congress has the authority to “provide for the appre
hension of escaped federal prisoners,” see ante, at 3 (ALITO, J., concur
ring in judgment), does not change this conclusion. That authority
derives from Congress’ power to vindicate the enumerated power with
which the escaped defendant’s crime of conviction interfered, not a
freestanding police power.

UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
THOMAS, J., dissenting

District of Columbia. Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682.
But Congress was acting pursuant to enumerated powers
when it took this step. See Art. I, §8, cl. 17 (granting
Congress plenary authority over the District of Columbia);
Art. I, §8, cl. 14 (authorizing Congress to “make Rules for
the Government and Regulation of the land and naval
Forces”). This enactment therefore provides no support
for Congress’ claimed power to detain sexually dangerous
persons without an otherwise valid basis for jurisdiction.
Later, Congress provided for the federal civil commit
ment of “insane” persons charged with or convicted of a
federal crime. Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11 Stat. 158; see
17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881); Act of June 23,
1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251; Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat.
330. As the Court explains, however, these statutes did
not authorize federal custody beyond the completion of the
“term” of federal “imprisonment,” §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252; see
35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569,
570–571 (1916); Act of May 13, 1930, ch. 254, §6, 46 Stat.
271, and thus shed no light on the question presented
here.
In 1949, Congress enacted a more comprehensive re
gime, authorizing the civil commitment of mentally ill
persons in BOP custody. See 18 U. S. C. §§4246, 4247
(1952 ed.). This Court addressed that regime in Green
wood, but never endorsed the proposition that the Federal
Government could rely on that statute to detain a person
in the absence of a pending criminal charge or ongoing
criminal sentence.14
——————
14 In addition, at least some courts questioned the Federal Govern
ment’s power to detain a person in such circumstances. See Dixon v.
Steele, 104 F. Supp. 904, 908 (WD Mo. 1952) (holding that the Federal
Government lacked authority to detain an individual declared mentally
unfit to stand trial once it was determined that he was unlikely to
recover in time to be prosecuted); Higgins v. United States, 205 F. 2d
650, 653 (CA9 1953) (avoiding this constitutional question by interpret

THOMAS, J., dissenting

As already noted, Greenwood upheld the commitment of
a federal defendant declared unfit to stand trial on the
narrow ground that the Government’s criminal jurisdic
tion over the defendant—its “power to prosecute for fed
eral offenses—[wa]s not exhausted,” but rather “per
sist[ed]” in the form of a “pending indictment.” 350 U. S.,
at 375; see supra, at 16. The Court was careful to state
that “[t]his commitment, and therefore the legislation
authorizing commitment in the context of this case, in
volve[d] an assertion of authority” within “congressional
power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.” Green
wood, 350 U. S., at 375 (emphasis added). But it painstak
ingly limited its holding to “the narrow constitutional
issue raised by th[at] order of commitment.” Ibid.
The historical record thus supports the Federal Gov
ernment’s authority to detain a mentally ill person against
whom it has the authority to enforce a criminal law. But
it provides no justification whatsoever for reading the
Necessary and Proper Clause to grant Congress the power
to authorize the detention of persons without a basis for
federal criminal jurisdiction.
3
Finally, the Court offers two arguments regarding
§4248’s impact on the relationship between the Federal
Government and the States. First, the Court and both
concurrences suggest that Congress must have had the
power to enact §4248 because a long period of federal
incarceration might “seve[r]” a sexually dangerous pris
oner’s “claim to ‘legal residence’ ” in any particular State,
ante, at 15 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the pris
oner without any “home State to take charge” of him upon
release, ante, at 5 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment);
——————
ing the statute to permit federal civil detention only for a period rea
sonably related to a criminal prosecution); Wells v. Attorney General of
United States, 201 F. 2d 556, 560 (CA10 1953) (same).

see ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (noting
that many federal prisoners, “as a result of lengthy federal
incarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any
State”). I disagree with the premise of that argument. As
an initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional
authority to “take charge” of a federal prisoner released
within their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that pow
ers not delegated to the Federal Government are “re
served” to the States, and to the people). In addition, the
assumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise
that authority is, in my view, implausible. The Govern
ment stated at oral argument that its “default position” is
to release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was
convicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR §2.33(b)
(2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue
that a State has the power to refuse such a person domi
cile within its borders. Thus, they appear to assume that,
in the absence of 18 U. S. C. §4248, a State would take no
action when informed by the BOP that a sexually danger
ous federal prisoner was about to be released within its
jurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state laws enacted
in recent decades to protect communities from sex offend
ers,15 the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite
——————
15 As

we have noted before, all 50 States have developed “some varia
tion” of a system “for mandatory registration of sex offenders and
corresponding community notification.” Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89–
90 (2003). In addition, several States have taken further steps; some
impose residency restrictions on sex offenders, see, e.g., Kennedy v.
Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___ , ___, n. 5 (2008) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip
op., at 11, n. 5) (collecting statutes), and, most relevant here, 22 States
have enacted involuntary civil-commitment laws substantially similar
to §4248, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §36–3701 et seq. (West 2009); Cal.
Welf. & Inst. Code Ann. §6600 et seq. (West 1988 and Supp. 2010); Fla.
Stat. §394.910 et seq. (2007); Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann., ch. 725, §205 et seq.
(West 2008); Iowa Code §229A (2009); Kan. Stat. Ann. §59–29a01 et
seq. (2005 and 2008 Cum. Supp.); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 123A (West

remote. But even in the event a State made such a deci
sion, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that
decision, and its consequences, to the state government
alone.
Next, the Court submits that §4248 does not upset the
balance of federalism or invade the States’ reserved pow
ers because it “requires accommodation of state interests”
by instructing the Attorney General to release a commit
ted person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried
if that State wishes to “ ‘assume . . . responsibility’ ” for
him. Ante, at 17 (quoting §4248(d)). This right of first
refusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (“It is
not the usual course that the State does take responsibil
ity”). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assur
ance that §4248 preserves the principle of dual sover
eignty—the “letter and spirit” of the Constitution—as the
Necessary and Proper Clause requires.16 McCulloch, 4

§71.09.010 et seq. (2008); Wis. Stat. Ann. §980.01 et seq. (West 2007 and
Supp. 2009).
16 The Court describes my argument as a claim that “§4248 violates
the Tenth Amendment.” Ante, at 16. Yet, I agree entirely with the
Court that “ ‘it makes no difference whether one views the question at
issue [here] as one of ascertaining the limits of the power delegated to
the Federal Government under the affirmative provisions of the Consti
tution or one of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the
States under the Tenth Amendment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting New York v.
United States, 505 U. S. 144, 159 (1992)). Section 4248 is unconstitu
tional because it does not “carr[y] into Execution” an enumerated
power. Therefore, it necessarily intrudes upon the powers our Consti
tution reserves to the States and to the people.

UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Wheat., at 421; Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898,
923–924 (1997). For once it is determined that Congress
has the authority to provide for the civil detention of
sexually dangerous persons, Congress “is acting within the
powers granted it under the Constitution,” and “may
impose its will on the States.” Gregory, 501 U. S., at 460;
see Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 4248’s right of first refusal is
thus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of
legislative grace.
Nevertheless, 29 States appear as amici and argue that
§4248 is constitutional. They tell us that they do not
object to Congress retaining custody of “sexually danger
ous persons” after their criminal sentences expire because
the cost of detaining such persons is “expensive”—
approximately $64,000 per year—and these States would
rather the Federal Government bear this expense. Brief
for Kansas et al. 2; ibid. (“[S]ex offender civil commitment
programs are expensive to operate”); id., at 4 (“these pro
grams are expensive”); id., at 8 (“[T]here are very practical
reasons to prefer a system that includes a federal sex
offender civil commitment program . . . . One such reason
is the significant cost”).
Congress’ power, however, is fixed by the Constitution;
it does not expand merely to suit the States’ policy prefer
ences, or to allow State officials to avoid difficult choices
regarding the allocation of state funds. By assigning the
Federal Government power over “certain enumerated
objects only,” the Constitution “leaves to the several States
a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other ob
jects.” The Federalist No. 39, at 285 (J. Madison). The
purpose of this design is to preserve the “balance of power
between the States and the Federal Government . . . [that]
protect[s] our fundamental liberties.” Garcia v. San Anto
nio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 572
(1985) (Powell, J., dissenting); New York v. United States,
505 U. S., at 181. It is the States’ duty to act as the “im

mediate and visible guardian” of those liberties because
federal powers extend no further than those enumerated
in the Constitution. The Federalist No. 17, at 169 (A.
Hamilton). The Constitution gives States no more power
to decline this responsibility than it gives them to infringe
upon those liberties in the first instance. FTC v. Ticor
Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 636 (1992) (“Federalism
serves to assign political responsibility, not to obscure it”).
Absent congressional action that is in accordance with,
or necessary and proper to, an enumerated power, the
duty to protect citizens from violent crime, including acts
of sexual violence, belongs solely to the States. Morrison,
529 U. S., at 618 (“[W]e can think of no better example of
the police power, which the Founders denied the National
Government and reposed in the States, than the suppres
sion of violent crime”); see Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat.
264, 426 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (stating that Congress
has “no general right to punish murder committed within
any of the States”).

Not long ago, this Court described the Necessary and
Proper Clause as “the last, best hope of those who defend
ultra vires congressional action.” Printz, supra, at 923.
Regrettably, today’s opinion breathes new life into that
Clause, and—the Court’s protestations to the contrary
notwithstanding, see ante, at 18—comes perilously close to
transforming the Necessary and Proper Clause into a
basis for the federal police power that “we always have
rejected,” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 584 (THOMAS, J., concur
ring) (citing Gregory, supra, at 457; Wirtz, 392 U. S., at
196; Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S., at 37). In so
doing, the Court endorses the precise abuse of power
Article I is designed to prevent—the use of a limited grant
of authority as a “pretext . . . for the accomplishment of
objects not intrusted to the government.” McCulloch,
supra, at 423.
I respectfully dissent.
