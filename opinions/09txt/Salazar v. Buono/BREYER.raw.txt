KEN L. SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, 

ET AL., PETITIONERS v. FRANK BUONO 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 28, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.
The District Court in this case entered a permanent
injunction forbidding the Government to “permi[t] the
display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in
the Mojave National Preserve.” App. 39. Subsequently,
Government authorities covered the cross with a plywood
box so that it could not be seen. Congress then enacted a
statute directing the Secretary of the Interior to convey to
a private entity approximately one acre of land upon
which the cross stood, presumably so that the cross could
be displayed uncovered. The plaintiff, returning to the
District Court, asked that court to “ ‘hold that the transfer
Buono v. Norton, 364
violates the . . . injunction.’ ”
F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1177 (CD Cal. 2005) (quoting plaintiff’s
motion). The court held that it did. Id., at 1182. And the
question before us is whether the law permits the District
Court so to interpret its injunction.
To answer this question we need not address any sig
nificant issue of Establishment Clause law. Because the
Government has already lost the case, taken an appeal,
and lost the appeal, we must take as a given the lower
court’s resolution of the Establishment Clause question
before the land transfer. That is to say, as the plurality
points out, ante, at 9, we must here assume that the origi
nal display of the cross violated the Constitution because

“the presence of the cross on federal land conveys a mes
sage” to a “reasonable observer” of governmental “en
dorsement of religion.” Buono v. Norton, 212 F. Supp. 2d
1202, 1216–1217 (CD Cal. 2002). See Travelers Indemnity
Co. v. Bailey, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14)
(once orders become final on direct review, they are res
judicata to the parties). For the same reason, we must
here assume that the plaintiff originally had standing to
bring the lawsuit. Ante, at 7; see also ante, at 1 (SCALIA,
J., concurring in judgment); Travelers, supra, at ___ (slip
op., at 14) (orders are no less preclusive when the collat
eral attack is jurisdictional). And, as the plurality also
points out, the plaintiff consequently has standing now to
seek enforcement of the injunction. Ante, at 8–9; see also
Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 763 (1984).
Moreover, we are not faced with the question whether
changed circumstances require modification of the injunc
tion. The Government did not ask the District Court to
modify it. In fact, the Government did not ask the District
Court for any relief at all. Rather, it was the plaintiff who
asked the District Court either (1) to “ ‘hold that the [land]
transfer violates the current injunction,’ ” or (2) to “ ‘modify
that injunction to prohibit the land transfer because it
violates the Establishment Clause.’ ” 364 F. Supp. 2d, at
1177 (quoting plaintiff’s motion). The District Court did
the former, i.e., it interpreted the injunction as prohibiting
the Government from transferring the land for purposes of
displaying the cross. And having granted the plaintiff’s
request to enforce the injunction, it dismissed the plain
tiff’s alternative request to modify the injunction as moot.
Thus, as I said at the outset, the only question before us
is whether the law permits the District Court to hold that
the land transfer (presumably along with the subsequent
public display of the cross) falls within the scope of its
original injunctive order, an order that says the Govern
ment must not “permi[t] the display of the Latin cross in

the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Pre
serve.” App. 39. In my view the law authorizes the Dis
trict Court to do so.
The legal principles that answer the question presented
are found not in the Constitution but in cases that concern
the law of injunctions. First, the law of injunctions grants
a district court considerable leeway to interpret the mean
ing and application of its own injunctive order. Members
of this Court have written that the “construction given to”
an “injunction by the issuing judge . . . is entitled to great
weight.” Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S.
753, 795 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part). And the Courts of Appeals have
consistently held that district courts have considerable
discretion in interpreting and applying their own injunc
tive decrees. See, e.g., JTH Tax, Inc. v. H & R Block East
ern Tax Servs., Inc., 359 F. 3d 699, 705 (CA4 2004); Ala
bama Nursing Home Assn v. Harris, 617 F. 2d 385, 388
(CA5 1980). This principle is longstanding and well estab
lished, as reflected in a prominent treatise writer’s sum
mary of the case law: “The court granting the injunction is
necessarily invested with large discretion in enforcing
obedience to its mandate, and . . . courts of appellate
powers are exceedingly averse to interfering with the
exercise of such judgment and discretion.” 2 J. High, Law
of Injunctions §1458, pp. 1467–1468 (4th ed. 1905).
Second, a court should construe the scope of an injunc
tion in light of its purpose and history, in other words,
“what the decree was really designed to accomplish.”
Mayor of Vicksburg v. Henson, 231 U. S. 259, 273 (1913).
Courts have long looked to “the objects for which the
[injunctive] relief was granted, as well as the circum
stances attending it,” in deciding whether an enjoined
party has complied with an injunction. 2 High, supra,
§1446, at 1455, and n. 68 (citing cases); see also John B.
Stetson Co. v. Stephen L. Stetson Co., 128 F. 2d 981, 983

(CA2 1942). And they have long refused to “permit defen
dants to evade responsibility for violating an injunction,
by doing through subterfuge a thing which is not in terms
a violation, yet produces the same effect by accomplishing
substantially that which they were enjoined from doing.”
Stodder v. Rosen Talking Mach. Co., 247 Mass. 60, 68, 141
N. E. 569, 571 (1923).
These two principles adequately support the District
Court’s interpretation and application of the injunctive
language at issue here. As an initial matter, the plain text
of the injunction is reasonably read to prohibit the trans
fer. Right now, the cross is covered with a plywood box;
after the transfer, the box will be removed and the cross
will be displayed. The transfer thus “permits” the public
“display” of the cross. Indeed, that is the statute’s
objective.
Consideration of the injunction’s purpose points in the
same direction. The injunction rested upon the District
Court’s determination that the display of the cross “con
veys a message of endorsement of religion” to “a reason
able observer” in violation of the Establishment Clause.
212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1216–1217. (As I have said, for pre
sent purposes we must assume that this is so.) The pur
pose of the injunction is to prevent the conveyance of such
a message to the reasonable observer.
With that purpose in mind, consider the following facts
that confronted the District Court when the plaintiff asked
it to enforce the decree:
•	 The Government had designated the “white cross
. . . as well as a limited amount of adjoining [land]”
as a national memorial. Pub. L. 107–117, §8137(a),
115 Stat. 2278–2279.
•	 The new statute directed the transfer of the “prop
erty . . . designated . . . as a national memorial” to a
private entity with an interest in maintaining the

BREYER, J., dissenting

cross in its current location, in exchange for a par
cel of land located elsewhere in the Preserve owned
by private individuals who have taken a similar in
terest in the cross. Pub. L. 108–87, §§8121(a) and
(b), 117 Stat. 1100.
•	 The transfer was made “subject to the condition
that the recipient maintain the conveyed property
as a memorial,” and the property reverts to the
United States if the Secretary determines that the
recipient has failed to do so. §8121(e), id., at 1100.
•	 After the transfer, the cross would sit on 1 acre of
privately owned land in a 1.6 million acre national
preserve, over 90% of which is federally owned.
212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1205.
•	 Congress had previously prevented the use of fed
eral funds to remove the cross from its present lo
cation. Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551;
Pub. L. 106–554, §133, 114 Stat. 2763A–230.
The District Court considered the facts before it through
the lens of the injunction’s original purpose. See 364
F. Supp. 2d, at 1180 (explaining that the “[G]overnment’s
continuing control over the Latin cross” and the involve
ment of private parties who “desir[e] its continued pres
ence in the Preserve,” “demonstrat[e]” that the transfer
would not end “the [G]overnment’s apparent endorsement
of a particular religion”); id., at 1182 (considering the
historical context of the transfer statute); see also Buono
v. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d 758, 783 (CA9 2008) (“carving
out a tiny parcel of property in the midst of this vast Pre
serve . . . will do nothing to minimize the impermissible
governmental endorsement” perceived by the reasonable
observer). And it concluded that the land transfer would
frustrate that purpose. See 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182 (the
transfer would “keep the Latin cross atop Sunrise Rock
without actually curing the continuing Establishment


6

SALAZAR v. BUONO
BREYER, J., dissenting

Clause violation”); see also 527 F. 3d, at 783 (finding that
“[n]othing in the present posture of the case alters . . .
earlier conclusions” regarding what a reasonable observer
would perceive).
In my view, this is a reasonable
conclusion.
The injunction forbids the Government to permit the
display of the cross on Sunrise Rock, and its basic purpose
was to prevent a reasonable observer from believing that
the Government had endorsed the cross. Under the cir
cumstances presented to the District Court, the transfer
would have resulted in such a display and might well have
conveyed such a message. Consequently, the District
Court’s decision that the land transfer violated the injunc
tion as written and intended was not an abuse of discre
tion. And that is what the Ninth Circuit properly held on
appeal. What the Establishment Clause implications of
the changed circumstances may be is a matter not before
us. Cf. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 442 (2004) (“If
the [enjoined defendant] establishes reason to modify the
decree, the court should make the necessary changes;
where it has not done so, however, the decree should be
enforced according to its terms”).
Because my conclusion rests primarily upon the law of
injunctions, because that law is fairly clear, and because
we cannot properly reach beyond that law to consider the
underlying Establishment Clause and standing questions,
I can find no federal question of general significance in
this case. I believe we should not have granted the peti
tion for certiorari. Having granted it, the Court should
now dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. Since the
Court has not done so, however, I believe that we should
simply affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.
With respect, I dissent.
