TION DISTRICT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED 

STATES EX REL. KAREN T. WILSON 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[March 30, 2010]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
dissenting.
The False Claims Act (FCA) divests federal courts of
jurisdiction to hear qui tam lawsuits based on allegations
or transactions publicly disclosed in a “congressional,
administrative, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)]
report, hearing, audit, or investigation,” unless the qui
tam relator is an “original source” of the information. 31
U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted). Today, the
Court reads the phrase “administrative . . . report, hear
ing, audit, or investigation” to encompass not only federal,
but also state and local, government sources. In my view,
the Court misreads the statutory text and gives insuffi
cient weight to contextual and historical evidence of Con
gress’ purpose in enacting §3730. I would affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that “adminis
trative” in the above-quoted provision refers only to Fed
eral Government sources.1
——————
1 As the Court notes, recent legislation amended the language of 31
U. S. C. §3730(e)(4). See ante, at 1–2, n. 1 (citing Pub. L. 111–148,
§10104(j)(2), 124 Stat. 119). Like the Court, I use the present tense
throughout this opinion in discussing the statute as it existed at the
time this case was argued before this Court.

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


I
Section 3730(e)(4)(A) sets forth three categories of “pub
lic disclosure[s]” that trigger the FCA’s jurisdictional bar:
“allegations or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or
administrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra
tive, or [GAO] report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or
[3] from the news media.”2 (Like the majority, I have
inserted Arabic numerals and refer to the three phrases as
“categories.”) “It is a ‘fundamental canon of statutory
construction that the words of a statute must be read in
their context and with a view to their place in the overall
statutory scheme.’ ” FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco
Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (quoting Davis v. Michi
gan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989)). No
party here disputes that “congressional” and “[GAO]” refer
only to Federal Government sources. Ante, at 6, and nn.
5–6. As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the word
“administrative” is more capacious, potentially reaching
not only federal, state, and local government sources but
also disclosures by private entities. See, e.g., Black’s Law
Dictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining “administrative” as
“pertain[ing] to administration, especially management,
. . . [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or
things”).
Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress’ choice of two
“clearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly fed
eral term” as a “very strong contextual cue about the
meaning of ‘administrative.’ ” 528 F. 3d 292, 302 (CA4
2008). “ ‘The maxim noscitur a sociis, . . . while not an
inescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is

unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.’ ” Gutierrez v.
Ada, 528 U. S. 250, 255 (2000) (quoting Jarecki v. G. D.
Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961)). Here, the imme
diate proximity of “congressional” and “[GAO]” suggests
that “administrative” should be read, like its neighbors, as
referring to Federal Government sources. If Congress had
intended to include state or local government administra
tive materials, it could have said so, for instance by refer
ring generically to “governmental” sources. See 528 F. 3d,
at 304–305.
The Court applies the logic that underlies the noscitur a
sociis canon in concluding that “administrative” does not
refer to private entities because of the meaning suggested
by the slightly more distant neighbors “report, hearing,
audit, or investigation.” See ante, at 5. I agree with the
majority that “administrative” in this context does not
reach private entities. But in my view, “congressional”
and “[GAO]” provide the better textual grounding for that
conclusion. I see no reason why the “administrati[on]” of a
private university, for instance, could not issue a “report,”
order an “audit” or “investigation,” or conduct a “hearing.”
Nor, contrary to the majority’s suggestion, are private
entities—particularly those receiving federal funds or
participating in federal programs—incapable of making
“public disclosure[s]” of fraud on the Federal Government.
Despite its own implicit reliance on the canon, the Court
nevertheless rejects the Court of Appeals’ application of
noscitur a sociis to interpret the three terms in Category 2,
concluding that “[a] list of three items, each quite distinct
from the other no matter how construed, is too short to be
particularly illuminating.” Ante, at 6–7. The three terms
in Category 2, the Court concludes, are “too few and too
disparate” to justify invocation of noscitur a sociis. Ante,
at 7. We have not previously constrained the canon in this
way, and I would not do so here.
To take just one example, in Jarecki we construed the

statutory term “ ‘abnormal income,’ ” which the statute
defined to include income resulting from “ ‘exploration,
discovery, or prospecting.’ ” 367 U. S., at 304–305 (quoting
§456(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Recogniz
ing that the word “ ‘[d]iscovery’ ” is “usable in many con
texts and with various shades of meaning,” we observed
that it “gathers meaning from the words around it” and
concluded that “[t]he three words in conjunction . . . all
describe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and
mining industries.” Id., at 307. As a result, and in light of
other contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion,
we held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera
equipment did not give rise to “abnormal income” even if
such inventions might otherwise be understood as “dis
cover[ies].” See id., at 307–313. In my view, the three
terms in Category 2 are no more “distinct” or “disparate,”
ante, at 7, than the phrase at issue in Jarecki, particularly
given the expansive plain meaning of “discovery.” Cf.
ante, at 7, n. 7. Here, application of the noscitur a sociis
principle readily yields a common feature: The sources at
issue are federal in nature, not related to state or local
governments or private entities. See Third Nat. Bank in
Nashville v. Impac Limited, Inc., 432 U. S. 312, 322–323,
315 (1977) (applying principle that “words grouped in a
list should be given related meaning” where term “ ‘injunc
tion’ ” was “sandwiched” between two other words in the
statutory phrase “ ‘attachment, injunction, or execution’ ”).3
——————
3 The Court relies on Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338–339
(1979), for the proposition that we should not “ ‘rob’ ” any of the three
terms in Category 2 of 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) of “ ‘its independent
and ordinary significance.’ ” Ante, at 7. But Reiter involved the statu
tory term “business or property.” Those two words less readily suggest
a shared limiting principle than do “congressional, administrative, or
[GAO].” Moreover, our concern about “rob[bing]” the word “ ‘property’ ”
of its broader meaning rested on a desire not to “ignore the disjunctive
‘or’ ” in the statutory pairing. 442 U. S., at 338–339; see also id., at 339

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

The Court draws additional support for its conclusion
from reference to the provision’s “larger scheme,” ante, at
8—i.e., the sources enumerated in Categories 1 and 3.
Although the scope of Category 1 is not before us today
(and although this Court has never addressed that ques
tion), the Court believes that reading Category 2 as lim
ited to Federal Government sources would be inconsistent
with decisions of lower courts that have interpreted
“criminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]” in Category
1 to include both state and federal proceedings. There is
no conflict, however, if both categories are read, as re
spondent and the Solicitor General urge, as exclusively
federal. See Brief for Respondent 23–24; Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 25–26. Even reading Category 1
more broadly, however, does not change the exclusively
federal nature of “congressional” and “[GAO],” which
undermines whatever inference might be drawn from
taking the statutory terms in strict succession. Treating
the entirety of §3730(e)(4)(A) as an undifferentiated list of
items gives short shrift to the syntactical choices Congress
made in offsetting each category with commas and prepo
sitions, and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that
modify different nouns.
Finally, the Court also views “news media” as “distinctly
nonfederal in nature.” Ante, at 8–9. But “news media”
does not seem particularly illuminating in this context. As
the Court of Appeals observed, although media sources
——————
disjunctive be given separate meanings”). Because Congress did not
employ a completely disjunctive list in §3730(e)(4)(A)—i.e., “congres
sional or administrative or [GAO]”—the Reiter principle applies with
less force. Cf. Garcia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70, 73 (1984) (applying
disjunctive principle in construing statutory prohibition on assault and
robbery of any custodian of “ ‘mail matter or of any money or other
property of the United States,’ ” and observing that “[t]he three classes
of property . . . are each separated by the conjunction ‘or’ ” (quoting 18
U. S. C. §2114; some emphasis deleted)).

may be national or local in scope, that distinction is not
analogous to the difference between federal and state
government sources. 528 F. 3d, at 304.
II
In my view, the statutory context and legislative history
are also less “opaque,” cf. ante, at 17, and more supportive
of the reading adopted by the Court of Appeals, than the
majority today acknowledges. While the legislative record
is concededly incomplete, it does provide reason to exercise
caution before giving the statutory text its broadest possi
ble meaning—i.e., to encompass not only federal, but also
state and local, government sources.
Three points are particularly salient. First, prior to the
1986 amendments, the “Government knowledge” bar
unquestionably referred only to information in the posses
sion of the Federal Government.4 Even still, the bar was
criticized as overly restrictive. A Senate Report on an
initial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, de
scribed the FCA’s history and need for legislative reform,
noting “several restrictive court interpretations of the act
. . . which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.”
S. Rep. No. 99–345, p. 4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.). For
instance, courts had applied the Government knowledge
bar “even if the Government makes no effort to investigate
or take action after . . . original allegations [a]re received.”
Id., at 12 (citing United States ex rel. Lapin v. Interna
tional Business Machines Corp., 490 F. Supp. 244 (Haw.
1980)).5

4 As

originally enacted in 1943, the bar applied to suits “based upon
evidence or information in the possession of the United States, or any
agency, officer or employee thereof, at the time such suit was brought.”
57 Stat. 609. In 1982, Congress recodified the provision to apply to
suits “based on evidence or information the Government had when the
action was brought.” 96 Stat. 979.

Second, there is more support than the Court recognizes
for the proposition that Congress sought in the 1986
amendments to broaden the availability of qui tam relief.
The Senate Report characterized the reform effort as
intended to “enhance the Government’s ability to recover
losses sustained as a result of fraud against the Govern
ment” and dwelt at length on the “severe” and “growing”
problem of “fraud in Federal programs.” S. Rep., at 1–2;
accord, H. R. Rep. No. 99–660, p. 18 (1986) (“Evidence of
fraud in Government programs and procurement is on a
steady rise”). The Senate Report also articulated a desire
to “encourage any individual knowing of Government
fraud to bring that information forward,” and it identified
as “perhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective
enforcement [of antifraud laws] a lack of resources on the
part of Federal enforcement agencies.” S. Rep., at 2, 7.6
Consistent with these expressed views, the enacted
legislation was replete with provisions encouraging qui
——————
from bringing a qui tam suit for Medicaid fraud because the State had
previously disclosed the information to the Federal Government, even
when the State’s own investigation had discovered the fraud. S. Rep.,
at 12–13. Lower courts have observed that the Dean decision was
controversial and appears to have motivated the inclusion of the
“original source” exception in the 1986 jurisdictional bar. See, e.g.,
Wang v. FMC Corp., 975 F. 2d 1412, 1419 (CA9 1992); see also S. Rep.,
at 13 (noting resolution by the National Association of Attorneys
General criticizing Dean and urging Congress to address the problem).
6 In introducing a later and near-final version of the bill, Senator
Grassley described the reform effort as stemming “from a realization
that the Government needs help—lots of help—to adequately protect
taxpayer funds from growing and increasingly sophisticated fraud.”
132 Cong. Rec. 28580 (1986); see also United States ex rel. Siller v.
Becton Dickinson & Co., 21 F. 3d 1339, 1347 (CA4 1994) (“By 1986,
when section 3730(e)(4) was enacted, Congress had come to the conclu
sion that fraud against the Government was apparently so rampant
and difficult to identify that the Government could use all the help it
could get from private citizens with knowledge of fraud” (internal
quotation marks omitted)).

tam actions. By replacing the Government knowledge bar
with the current text of §3730(e)(4)(A) and including an
exception for “original source[s],” Congress “allowed pri
vate parties to sue even based on information already in
the Government’s possession.” Cook County v. United
States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U. S. 119, 133 (2003). The
1986 amendments also established the right of qui tam
relators to continue as a party to a suit after the Govern
ment intervenes, 31 U. S. C. §3730(c)(1) (1988 ed.); in
creased the percentage of recovery available as an incen
tive for private suits, §3730(d)(1); and created a cause of
action against employers who retaliate against qui tam
relators, §3730(h).7
——————
7 See also 1 J. Boese, Civil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions
§1.04[G], p. 1–22 (Supp. 2007) (“[V]irtually all the changes introduced
in th[e] section [of the 1986 amendments addressing qui tam actions]
expanded the rights of qui tam relators”). The amendments also
contained a number of provisions facilitating enforcement generally,
e.g., lowering the requisite showing of intent by making clear that
“knowing” violations require “no proof of specific intent to defraud,” 31
U. S. C. §3729(b)(1) (1988 ed.); lengthening the statute of limitations,
§3731(b); and authorizing treble damages, §3729(a).
The Court fairly observes that the addition of “news media” to the
jurisdictional bar undercuts attributing to Congress a “single-minded”
intent to expand the availability of qui tam relief. Ante, at 19. But
neither does that provision support reading Category 2 to its broadest
possible extent. Moreover, barring suits based on “news media” disclo
sures may not have constituted a particularly significant expansion of
existing law. Courts had applied the pre-1986 Government knowledge
bar to dismiss actions based on information reported in the news
media. In United States ex rel. Thompson v. Hays, 432 F. Supp. 253,
256, 255 (DC 1976), the court dismissed a suit based on evidence
“gleaned from sources in the news media which received widespread
public attention [alleging fraud by a Member of Congress],” when the
Department of Justice “first obtained information regarding the claims
. . . as a result of [a] Washington Post article.” Similarly, the court in
United States v. Burmah Oil Co., 558 F. 2d 43, 46, n. 1 (CA2 1977) (per
curiam) characterized the Government knowledge bar as “dis
courag[ing] the filing of actions by parties having no information of
their own to contribute, but who merely plagiarized information in

To be sure, Congress was also concerned in 1986, as in
1943, with guarding against purely opportunistic, “para
sitic” qui tam relators. See S. Rep., at 10–11 (describing
history of parasitic suits and the 1943 amendments); ante,
at 12–13. Lower courts have viewed the 1986 amend
ments as striking a balance between the “twin goals of
rejecting suits which the government is capable of pursu
ing itself, while promoting those which the government is
not equipped to bring on its own.” United States ex rel.
Springfield Terminal R. Co. v. Quinn, 14 F. 3d 645, 651
(CADC 1994). But evidence that Congress sought to
balance two competing goals supports moderation in
interpreting an arguably ambiguous statutory text, rather
than woodenly reading the statutory language to its fullest
possible extent.
Third, the legislative record “ ‘contains no hint of any
intention’ ” to bar suits based on disclosures from state or
local government sources. Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 20 (quoting United States ex rel. AntiDiscrimination Center of Metro N. Y., Inc. v. Westchester
Cty., 495 F. Supp. 2d 375, 383 (SDNY 2007)). Inclusion of
state or local government sources would have constituted
a significant departure from the Federal Government
knowledge bar that had existed for four decades by 1986.
But neither the initial bills reported by the Senate and
House Committees nor statements by individual Members
of Congress about subsequent versions of the legislation
suggest any consideration or debate about expanding the
pre-1986 bar to apply to state or local government

indictments returned in the courts, newspaper stories or congressional
investigations.” Congress could have reasonably assumed in 1986 that
news media would report on the kinds of high-profile frauds that would
naturally—perhaps as a result of the reporting—come to the Govern
ment’s attention, and thus would already have been covered under
existing law.

sources.8
Although these points do not definitively resolve the
question presented today, to my mind they counsel against
reading §3730(e)(4)(A) (2006 ed.) so broadly as to disturb
the balance Congress evidently sought to achieve through
the 1986 amendments. Today’s decision risks such a
result. The Court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by
all appearances more restrictive of qui tam suits than the
pre-1986 regime. Construing §3730(e)(4)(A) to encompass
the thousands of state and local government administra
tive reports produced each year effectively imputes to the
Federal Government knowledge of such sources, whether
or not the Government is aware of the information or in a
——————
8 In

June 1986, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported a bill
that would have barred qui tam actions based on information “which
the Government disclosed as a basis for allegations made in a prior
administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding,” “disclosed during the
course of a congressional investigation,” or “disseminated by any news
media.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–660, pp. 2, 3 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The references to information disclosed by the Government
itself (with a capital “G”) and to “congressional investigation[s]” connote
federal, not state or local, government sources. In July, the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary reported its own version of the bill, barring
actions “based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of
a civil suit in which the Government is already a party, or within six
months of the disclosure of specific information relating to such allega
tions or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, a
congressional or Government Accounting Office report or hearing, or
from the news media.” S. Rep., at 43. The reference to suits in which
the Federal Government is a party and absence of the ambiguous term
“administrative” in the bill’s reference to “congressional or [GAO]”
reports or hearings, similarly tend to exclude disclosures from state or
local government reports. The enacted legislation did differ in several
respects from the reported bills, but the subsequent legislative record
contains no reference to the inclusion of state or local government
sources. See, e.g., 132 Cong. Rec. 20535–20537 (statement of Sen.
Grassley); id., at 29321–29322 (statements of Reps. Glickman and
Berman).

position to act on it.9 The Solicitor General specifically
warns that while information in federal administrative
audits or investigations is “readily available” to attorneys
at the Department of Justice, “many state and local re
ports and investigations never come to the attention of
federal authorities.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 22. The Court dismisses this concern as “sheer
conjecture,” postulating that Government lawyers “may”
in fact learn about “quite a few” state or local reports and
investigations, particularly in joint state-federal pro
grams.10 Ante, at 18. Perhaps so. But absent any con

9 Of course, 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) (2006 ed.) speaks of “public
disclosure,” not notice to the Government. But the requirement of a
“public” disclosure countenances notice, both to the public and other
wise. Indeed, a number of lower courts look to whether the Federal
Government is “on notice” of alleged fraud before concluding that a
particular source is a “public disclosure of allegations or transactions”
under §3730(e)(4)(A). See, e.g., United States ex rel. Poteet v. Medtronic,
Inc., 552 F. 3d 503, 512 (CA6 2009) (“[A] public disclosure reveals fraud
if the information is sufficient to put the government on notice of the

11 The majority notes in passing several policy arguments advanced
by petitioners and their amici. Ante, at 20, n. 19. None merits much
weight. Petitioners are concerned about a race to the courthouse, in
which parasitic relators will capitalize on information released in a
state or local government report to the disadvantage of a slow-moving
insider. Brief for Petitioners 31. But the FCA’s first-to-file provision,
31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(5), reflects Congress’ explicit policy choice to
encourage prompt filing and, in turn, prompt recovery of defrauded
funds by the United States. Amici States are concerned that relators
may interfere with ongoing state and local government investigations
by “trolling state records and reports” for evidence of fraud. States
Brief 11. But some state freedom-of-information laws exempt materials
related to ongoing civil investigations. See, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. §45–
221(a)(11) (2008 Cum. Supp.); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 65, §67.708(b)(17)
(Purdon Supp. 2009). In any event, the FCA contains no provision
giving state or local governments a privileged position as qui tam
relators or, with respect to local governments, defendants.
