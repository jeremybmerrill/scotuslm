No. 08–304 GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVA- [March 30, 2010]  JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join Parts I–III and V–VI of the Court’s opinion. As for Part IV, I agree that the stray snippets of legislative his tory respondent, the Solicitor General, and the dissent have collected prove nothing at all about Congress’s pur pose in enacting 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A). Ante, at 14– 18. But I do not share the Court’s premise that if a “ ‘legis lative purpose’ ” were “ ‘evident’ ” from such history it would make any difference. Ante, at 17 (quoting United stitution gives legal effect to the “Laws” Congress enacts, Art. VI, cl. 2, not the objectives its Members aimed to Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80 (1998). If §3730(e)(4)(A)’s text includes state and local administra tive reports and audits, as the Court correctly concludes it does, then it is utterly irrelevant whether the Members of Congress intended otherwise. Anyway, it is utterly impos sible to discern what the Members of Congress intended except to the extent that intent is manifested in the only remnant of “history” that bears the unanimous endorse ment of the majority in each House: the text of the en rolled bill that became law.
