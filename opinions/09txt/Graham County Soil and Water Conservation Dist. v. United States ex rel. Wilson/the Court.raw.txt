GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVA-

TION DISTRICT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED 

STATES EX REL. KAREN T. WILSON 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[March 30, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.
Since its enactment during the Civil War, the False
Claims Act, 31 U. S. C. §§3729–3733, has authorized both
the Attorney General and private qui tam relators to
recover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims
for payment to the United States. The Act now contains a
provision barring qui tam actions based upon the public
disclosure of allegations or transactions in certain speci
fied sources. §3730(e)(4)(A). The question before us is
whether the reference to “administrative” reports, audits,
and investigations in that provision encompasses disclo
sures made in state and local sources as well as federal
sources. We hold that it does.1

March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Pro

Section 10104(j)(2) of this legislation replaces the prior version of 31
U. S. C. §3730(e)(4) with new language. The legislation makes no
mention of retroactivity, which would be necessary for its application to
pending cases given that it eliminates petitioners’ claimed defense to a

GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION 

DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON 

Opinion of the Court 


I
In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North
Carolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to
perform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suf
fered extensive flooding. The Federal Government agreed
to shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent
Karen T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the
Graham County Soil and Conservation District, a special
purpose government body that had been delegated partial
responsibility for coordinating and performing the reme
diation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection
with this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local offi
cials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and
had a meeting with, agents of the USDA.
Graham County officials began an investigation. An
accounting firm hired by the county performed an audit
and, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified
several potential irregularities in the county’s administra
tion of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Caro
lina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural
Resources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying
similar problems. The USDA’s Office of Inspector General
eventually issued a third report that contained additional
findings.
In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petition
ers, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and
Water Conservation Districts and a number of local and
federal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by
knowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant
to the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners
retaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation
of those false claims. Following this Court’s review of the

argued.

Opinion of the Court

statute of limitations applicable to Wilson’s retaliation
claim, Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v.
United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409 (2005), the
Court of Appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as
time barred. 424 F. 3d 437 (CA4 2005). On remand, the
District Court subsequently dismissed Wilson’s qui tam
action for lack of jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a–
105a. The court found that Wilson had failed to refute
that her action was based upon allegations publicly dis
closed in the Audit Report and the DEHNR Report. Id., at
95a–98a. Those reports, the District Court determined,
constituted “administrative . . . report[s], . . . audit[s], or
investigation[s]” within the meaning of the FCA’s public
disclosure bar, 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A).
The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the
District Court because the reports had been generated by
state and local entities. “[O]nly federal administrative
reports, audits or investigations,” the Fourth Circuit
concluded, “qualify as public disclosures under the FCA.”
528 F. 3d 292, 301 (2008) (emphasis added). The Circuits
having divided over this issue,2 we granted certiorari to
resolve the conflict. 557 U. S. __ (2009).

2 Compare

528 F. 3d, at 301–307 (limiting this portion of the public
disclosure bar to federal sources), and United States ex rel. Dunleavy v.
County of Delaware, 123 F. 3d 734, 745–746 (CA3 1997) (same), with
United States ex rel. Bly-Magee v. Premo, 470 F. 3d 914, 918–919 (CA9
2006) (concluding that state and local sources may qualify), cert.

of Ga., 468 F. 3d 755, 762 (CA11 2006) (per curiam) (assuming without
analysis that state audits may qualify). The Eighth Circuit appears to
have taken a “middle road” on this issue, 528 F. 3d, at 301, holding that
disclosures made in nonfederal forums may count as “ ‘administrative
. . . report[s]’ ” or “ ‘audit[s]’ ” under §3730(e)(4)(A) in some instances, as
when they relate to “a cooperative federal-state program through which
the federal government provides financial assistance.” Hays v. Hoff
man, 325 F. 3d 982, 989, cert. denied, 540 U. S. 877 (2003).

GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION 

DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON 

Opinion of the Court 


II
We have examined the FCA’s qui tam provisions in
several recent opinions.3 At issue in this case is the FCA’s
public disclosure bar, which deprives courts of jurisdiction
over qui tam suits when the relevant information has
already entered the public domain through certain chan
nels. The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction
stripping disclosures. Following the example of the Court
of Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 300–301, we have inserted
Arabic numerals to identify these categories:
“No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under
this section based upon the public disclosure of allega
tions or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or admin
istrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra
tive, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report,
hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news
media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney
General or the person bringing the action is an origi
nal source[4] of the information.” §3730(e)(4)(A) (foot
note omitted).
This dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective “ad
ministrative” in the second category (Category 2): whether
it embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as
respondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures
made in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Re
——————
3 See,

e.g., Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. United States, 549 U. S. 457 (2007)
(construing §3730(e)(4)(A)’s original source exception); Cook County v.
United States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U. S. 119 (2003) (holding that local
governments are subject to qui tam liability); Vermont Agency of
Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765 (2000)
(holding that States are not subject to private FCA actions).
4 A separate statutory provision defines an “original source” as “an
individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the informa
tion on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided
the information to the Government before filing an action under this
section which is based on the information.” 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(B).

Opinion of the Court

port and the Audit Report, as petitioners allege.
In debating this question, petitioners have relied pri
marily on the statute’s text whereas respondent and the
Solicitor General, as her amicus, have relied heavily on
considerations of history and policy. Although there is
some overlap among the three types of argument, it is
useful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.
III
The term “administrative” “may, in various contexts,
bear a range of related meanings,” Chandler v. Judicial
Council of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 103, n. 8 (1970)
(Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to
private bodies as well as to governmental bodies. When
used to modify the nouns “report, hearing, audit, or inves
tigation,” in the context of a statutory provision about “the
public disclosure” of fraud on the United States, the term
is most naturally read to describe the activities of govern
mental agencies. See Black’s Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed.
2009) (hereinafter Black’s) (defining “administration,” “[i]n
public law, [as] the practical management and direction of
the executive department and its agencies”). Given that
“administrative” is not itself modified by “federal,” there is
no immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the
activities of state and local agencies (or their contractors)
from its ambit. As the Court of Appeals recognized, “the
statute by its express terms does not limit its reach to
federal administrative reports or investigations.” 528
F. 3d, at 301. “[T]here is nothing inherently federal about
the word ‘administrative,’ and Congress did not define the
term in the FCA.” Id., at 302.
The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that “administrative”
nevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its
application of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis.
See id., at 302–305. This maxim, literally translated as
“ ‘it is known by its associates,’ ” Black’s 1160, counsels

lawyers reading statutes that “a word may be known by
the company it keeps,” Russell Motor Car Co. v. United
States, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923). All participants in this
litigation acknowledge that the terms “congressional” and
“[GAO]” are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative
Branch of the Federal Government,5 and the GAO is a
federal agency.6 Relying on our opinions in S. D. Warren
Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S.
370 (2006), and Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368
(1994), the Court of Appeals reasoned that “the placement
of ‘administrative’ squarely in the middle of a list of obvi
ously federal sources strongly suggests that ‘administra
tive’ should likewise be restricted to federal administrative
reports, hearings, audits, or investigations.” 528 F. 3d, at
302. In so holding, the Court of Appeals embraced what
we might call the Sandwich Theory of the Third Circuit.
Both courts “ ‘f[ou]nd it hard to believe that the drafters of
this provision intended the word “administrative” to refer
to both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched
between modifiers which are unquestionably federal in
character.’ ” Ibid. (quoting United States ex rel. Dunleavy
v. County of Delaware, 123 F. 3d 734, 745 (CA3 1997)).

U. S. Const., Art. I, §1; id., §4, cl. 1 (distinguishing “State . . .

6 The statute refers to the GAO, mistakenly, as the “Government
Accounting Office.” It is undisputed that the intended referent was the
General Accounting Office, now renamed the Government Accountabil
ity Office. See 31 U. S. C. §3730, p. 254, n. 2 (compiler’s note); 528 F. 3d

(Becker, C. J., dissenting) (noting that courts have “frequently” made
the same scrivener’s error). We have described the GAO as “an inde
pendent agency within the Legislative Branch that exists in large part
to serve the needs of Congress.” Bowsher v. Merck & Co., 460 U. S. 824,
844 (1983).

of three items, each quite distinct from the other no mat
ter how construed, is too short to be particularly illuminat
ing. Although this list may not be “completely disjunc
tive,” 528 F. 3d, at 302—it refers to “congressional,
administrative, or [GAO]” sources, §3730(e)(4)(A), rather
than “congressional, or administrative, or [GAO]”
sources—neither is it completely harmonious. The sub
stantive connection, or fit, between the terms “congres
sional,” “administrative,” and “GAO” is not so tight or so
self-evident as to demand that we “rob” any one of them
“of its independent and ordinary significance.” Reiter v.
Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338–339 (1979); see also
Russell, 261 U. S., at 519 (“That a word may be known by
the company it keeps is . . . not an invariable rule, for the
word may have a character of its own not to be submerged
by its association”). The adjectives in Category 2 are too
few and too disparate to qualify as “a string of statutory
terms,” S. D. Warren Co., 547 U. S., at 378, or “items in a
list,” Beecham, 511 U. S., at 371, in the sense that we used
those phrases in the cited cases.7
——————
7 In

Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303 (1961), the Court
applied the noscitur a sociis maxim in construing a statutory provision
that referred to “ ‘[i]ncome resulting from exploration, discovery, or
prospecting,’ ” id., at 305 (quoting §456(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1939). JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that “the three terms in
Category 2 are no more ‘distinct’ or ‘disparate’ than the phrase at issue
in Jarecki.” Post, at 4 (dissenting opinion) (citation omitted). We
disagree. Whether taken in isolation or in context, the phrase “con
gressional, administrative, or GAO” is not as cohesive as the phrase
“exploration, discovery, or prospecting.” That is one reason why nosci
tur a sociis proved illuminating in Jarecki, and why it is less helpful in
this case. On their “face,” the terms “exploration,” “discovery,” and
“prospecting” all describe processes of searching, seeking, speculating;
the centrality of such activities to “the oil and gas and mining indus
tries” gave a clue that it was those industries Congress had in mind
when it drafted the provision. 367 U. S., at 307 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The terms “congressional,” “administrative,” and
“GAO” do not share any comparable core of meaning—or indeed any

Opinion of the Court 


More important, we need to evaluate “administrative”
within the larger scheme of the public disclosure bar.
Both parties acknowledge, as they must, that “[s]tatutory
language has meaning only in context,” Graham County
Soil, 545 U. S., at 415; where they differ is in determining
the relevant context. The Sandwich Theory presupposes
that Category 2 is the only piece of §3730(e)(4)(A) that
matters. We agree with petitioners, however, that all of
the sources listed in §3730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive
guidance. All of these sources drive at the same end:
specifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose qui
tam actions. In light of the public disclosure bar’s gram
matical structure, it may be convenient and even clarify
ing to parse the list of sources into three categories. But it
does not follow that we should treat these categories as
islands unto themselves. Courts have a “duty to construe
statutes, not isolated provisions.” Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,
513 U. S. 561, 568 (1995).
When we consider the entire text of the public disclosure
bar, the case for limiting “administrative” to federal
sources becomes significantly weaker. The “news media”
referenced in Category 3 plainly have a broader sweep.
The Federal Government funds certain media outlets, and
certain private outlets have a national focus; but no one
contends that Category 3 is limited to these sources.
There is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the
“criminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]” listed in
Category 1 must be federal hearings.8 Of the numerous
——————
“common feature” at all, post, at 4—apart from a governmental conno
tation. It takes the Sandwich Theory to graft a federal limitation onto
“administrative.”
8 A number of lower courts have concluded that, as used in Category
1, “ ‘hearing’ is roughly synonymous with ‘proceeding.’ ” United States
ex rel. Springfield Terminal R. Co. v. Quinn, 14 F. 3d 645, 652 (CADC
1994); see also 1 J. Boese, Civil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions
§4.02[B], p. 4–59, and n. 231 (3d ed. 2006) (hereinafter Boese); C.

Opinion of the Court

types of sources that serve a common function in
§3730(e)(4)(A), then, only two are distinctly federal in
nature, while one (the news media) is distinctly nonfederal
in nature.
If the Court of Appeals was correct that the term “ad
ministrative” encompasses state and local sources in
Category 1, see 528 F. 3d, at 303, it becomes even harder
to see why the term would not do the same in Category 2.
See Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U. S. 239, 243 (1972)
(“[A] legislative body generally uses a particular word with
a consistent meaning in a given context”). Respondent
and the Solicitor General assert that §3730(e)(4)(A)’s two
references to “administrative” can be distinguished be
cause Category 1 is best understood to refer to adjudica
tive proceedings, whereas Category 2 is best understood to
refer to legislative or quasi-legislative activities such as
rulemaking, oversight, and investigations. See Brief for
Respondent 16–18; Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 25–26 (hereinafter Brief for United States). Yet
even if this reading were correct, state and local adminis
trative reports, hearings, audits, and investigations of a
legislative-type character are presumably just as public,
and just as likely to put the Federal Government on notice
of a potential fraud, as state and local administrative
hearings of an adjudicatory character.9

GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON
Opinion of the Court

Respondent and the Solicitor General try to avoid this
inference, and to turn a weakness into a strength, by
further averring that the sources listed in Category 1 are
themselves only federal. See Brief for Respondent 23–24;
Brief for United States 25–26. No court has ever taken
such a view of these sources. See 528 F. 3d, at 303 (citing
cases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh
Circuits and stating that “[t]he courts have easily con
cluded that [Category 1] applies to state-level hearings”);
Sylvia §11:37, at 643, n. 1 (citing additional cases).10 The
arguments in favor of reading a federal limitation into
Category 1 are supported, if at all, by legislative history
and policy; they find no support in the statute’s text.
Moving from the narrow lens of the Sandwich Theory to
a bird’s eye view, respondent and the Solicitor General
also maintain that the “exclusively federal focus” of the
FCA counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to
encompass nonfederal sources. Brief for Respondent 10,
18; Brief for United States 13. The FCA undoubtedly has
a federal focus. But so does every other federal statute.

narrowly would have the anomalous result of allowing public disclosure
status to the most obscure local news report and the most obscure state
and local civil lawsuit or administrative hearing, but denying public
disclosure status to a formal public report of a state government
agency”).
10 Following the Court of Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 303, respondent
asserts that only the Ninth Circuit, in A-1 Ambulance Serv., Inc. v.
California, 202 F. 3d 1238, 1244 (2000), has explicitly considered and
rejected the argument that Category 1 is limited to federal sources.
Brief for Respondent 23–24. At least one other Circuit, however, has
done the same, see United States ex rel. Hafter v. Spectrum Emergency
Care, Inc., 190 F. 3d 1156, 1161, n. 6 (CA10 1999), and no lower court,
as far as we are aware, has so much as suggested that an alternative
construction might be viable. Moreover, the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh
Circuit cases cited by the Court of Appeals postdate A-1 Ambulance and
Dunleavy, 123 F. 3d 734, both of which put litigants and courts on
notice of the possibility that §3730(e)(4)(A) might be limited to federal
sources.


Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)

11

Opinion of the Court

And as respondent and the Solicitor General elsewhere
acknowledge, quite a few aspects of the FCA, including a
reference to “administrative” proceedings in §3733(l)
(7)(A)11 and the reference to “news media” in
§3730(e)(4)(A) itself, are not just federal. In any event, the
“federal focus” of the statute, as a whole, does not shine
light on the specific question whether the public disclosure
bar extends to certain nonfederal contexts. It is the fact of
“public disclosure”—not Federal Government creation or
receipt—that is the touchstone of §3730(e)(4)(A).
Respondent and the Solicitor General make one last
argument grounded in the statutory text: It would be
anomalous, they say, for state and local administrative
reports to count as public disclosures, when state legisla
tive reports do not. See Brief for Respondent 15; Brief for
United States 15–16. Yet neither respondent nor the
Solicitor General disputes the contention of petitioners
and their amici that, at the time the public disclosure bar
was enacted in 1986, Congress rarely gave state legisla
tures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing
federally funded programs. See Brief for Petitioners 36–
39; Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici
Curiae 8–13. As in the instant case, the Federal Govern
ment was far more likely to enter into contracts with, and
to provide moneys to, state and local executive agencies.
Whether or not state legislative sources should have been
included in §3730(e)(4)(A), their exclusion therefore car
ries no clear implications for the status of state adminis
trative sources.
In sum, although the term “administrative” may be
sandwiched in Category 2 between terms that are federal
——————
11 On its face, §3733(l)(7)(A) is silent as to whether it includes nonfed
eral proceedings. Respondent and the Solicitor General suggest that it
does, though they fairly argue that this provision, relating to civil
investigative demands, has little if any relevance to the case at hand.
See Brief for Respondent 21, n. 8; Brief for United States 31–32.

in nature, those terms are themselves sandwiched be
tween phrases that have been generally understood to
include nonfederal sources; and one of those phrases, in
Category 1, contains the exact term that is the subject of
our inquiry. These textual clues negate the force of the
noscitur a sociis canon, as it was applied by the Court of
Appeals.12 We are not persuaded that the associates with
which “administrative” keeps company in §3730(e)(4)(A)
endow it with an exclusively federal character.
IV
As originally enacted, the FCA did not limit the sources
from which a relator could acquire the information to
bring a qui tam action. In United States ex rel. Marcus v.
Hess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943), we upheld the relator’s recov
ery even though he had discovered the fraud by reading a
federal criminal indictment—a quintessential “parasitic”
suit. Id., at 545–548; see id., at 545 (“Even if, as the gov
ernment suggests, the petitioner has contributed nothing
to the discovery of this crime, he has contributed much to
accomplishing one of the purposes for which the Act was
passed”). Congress promptly reacted to that decision by
amending the statute to preclude qui tam actions “based
upon evidence or information in the possession of the
United States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof,

12 The Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the three categories in
§3730(e)(4)(A) as “clauses.” See 528 F. 3d, at 300–305. Were they in
fact clauses rather than prepositional phrases, reliance on noscitur a
sociis might have been supported by one of our earliest cases using
that term, Watson v. Mercer, 8 Pet. 88, 105 (1834) (Reporter’s statement
of the case), which suggested that “different clauses of the same sen
tence” should be presumed “to embrace the subject matter of the
sentence.” The Court of Appeals’ mistaken reference to “clauses” is of
course less significant than its failure to treat the public disclosure bar
as an integrated whole. Cf. Stevens, The Shakespeare Canon of Statu
tory Construction, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1373, 1376 (1992) (emphasizing
importance of reading provisions in their broader statutory context).

This amendment erected what came to be known as a

In the years that followed the 1943 amendment, the vol

significant information to contribute of their own,” United

statute once again in 1986 “to make the FCA a ‘more

v. United States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U. S. 119, 133 (2003)
(quoting S. Rep. No. 99–345, p. 2 (1986) (hereinafter S.
Rep.)).
The present text of §3730(e)(4) was enacted in 1986 as
part of this larger reform. Congress apparently concluded
that a total bar on qui tam actions based on information
already in the Government’s possession thwarted a sig
nificant number of potentially valuable claims. Rather
than simply repeal the Government knowledge bar, how
ever, Congress replaced it with the public disclosure bar in
an effort to strike a balance between encouraging private
persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits
such as the one in Hess. How exactly §3730(e)(4) came to
strike this balance in the way it did is a matter of consid
erable uncertainty. The House and Senate Judiciary
Committees each reported bills that contained very differ
ent public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in
the Statutes at Large; the Senate bill, for example, did not

Opinion of the Court

include the words “administrative,” “audit,” or “investiga
tion” in its version of Category 2, nor did it contain an
original source exception. See S. Rep., at 42–43 (text of
proposed §3730(e)(4)).13
In respondent and her amici’s view, this background
counsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of
“administrative” for three separate reasons. First, the
drafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that
Congress intended such a result. Second, a major aim of
the 1986 amendments was to limit the scope of the Gov
ernment knowledge bar, and “[c]onstruing [§3730(e)(4)(A)]
as limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers
Congress’s purpose ‘to encourage more private enforce
ment suits.’ ” Brief for United States 21 (quoting S. Rep.,
at 23–24). Third, whereas federal administrative proceed
ings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General
with a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA
action based on revelations made therein, the Attorney
General is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in
state proceedings. Respondent and her amici further
maintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal
sources in Category 2, as local governments would then be
able to shield themselves from qui tam liability by dis
cretely disclosing evidence of fraud in “public” reports.14
These arguments are reasonable so far as they go, but
they do not go very far. As many have observed, the draft
ing history of the public disclosure bar raises more ques
tions than it answers.15 Significant substantive changes—

only congressional and GAO sources in Category 2 is
therefore of little moment. Neither the House nor the

“administrative” sources to this Category might be taken
as a sign that such a limitation was rejected by the full
Chambers.16

16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR makes a valiant effort to unearth from the
legislative history “the balance Congress evidently sought to achieve
through the 1986 amendments.” Post, at 10. But her reconstruction of
the history assigns little weight to the side of this balance preserved by
the public disclosure bar: the desire to minimize “the potential for
parasitic lawsuits by those who learn of the fraud through public
channels and seek remuneration although they contributed nothing to
the exposure of the fraud,” United States ex rel. Doe v. John Doe Corp.,
960 F. 2d 318, 319 (CA2 1992). And her narrative contains no account
of why Category 2 emerged in the form that it did. Any such account
would necessarily be an exercise in speculation, as the record is silent

GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON
Opinion of the Court

Respondent and her amici place particular emphasis on
a remark made by the lead sponsor of the Senate bill,
Senator Grassley. See Brief for Respondent 29; Brief for
United States 20; Brief for American Center for Law and
Justice as Amicus Curiae 13–14; Brief for Taxpayers
Against Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 30–31.
In a floor statement, Grassley said that “the term ‘Gov
ernment’ in the definition of original source is meant to
include any Government source of disclosures cited in [the
public disclosure bar]; that is[,] Government includes
Congress, the General Accounting Office, any executive or
independent agency as well as all other governmental
bodies that may have publicly disclosed the allegations.”
132 Cong. Rec. 20536 (1986). Yet even if a single sentence
by a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful
weight, Senator Grassley’s remark merely begs the ques
tion before us. His formulation fails to indicate whether
the “other governmental bodies” may be state or local
bodies. It also turns on a term, “Government” with a
capital “G,” that does not appear in the codified version of
the public disclosure bar, which Congress subsequently
revised in numerous respects prior to passage.
There is, in fact, only one item in the legislative record
that squarely corroborates respondent’s reading of the
statute: a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the 1986
amendments to the Attorney General in 1999. See 145
Cong. Rec. 16032 (1999) (reproducing text of letter in
which Rep. Berman and Sen. Grassley state: “We did
intend, and any fair reading of the statute will confirm,
that the disclosure must be in a federal criminal, civil or
administrative hearing. Disclosure in a state proceeding

on the matter. In our view, neither the general trajectory of 20th
century FCA reform nor the specific statements made during the 1986
legislative process clearly point one way or the other on the question
before us.

Opinion of the Court

of any kind should not be a bar to a subsequent qui tam
suit”). Needless to say, this letter does not qualify as
legislative “history,” given that it was written 13 years
after the amendments were enacted. It is consequently of
scant or no value for our purposes.17
We do not doubt that Congress passed the 1986
amendments to the FCA “to strengthen the Government’s
hand in fighting false claims,” Cook County, 538 U. S., at
133–134, and “to encourage more private enforcement
suits,” S. Rep., at 23–24. It is equally beyond cavil, how
ever, that Congress passed the public disclosure bar to bar
a subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or
downright harmful. The question before us concerns the
precise scope of that subset; and on this matter, the record
is all but opaque. While “the absence of specific legislative
history in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty
to give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted
in the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting
the law in question,” United States v. Bornstein, 423 U. S.
——————
17 See Consumer Product Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447
U. S. 102, 118 (1980); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 580, n. 10
(2006); see also Hafter, 190 F. 3d, at 1161, n. 6 (refusing to credit the
Berman-Grassley letter in interpreting the public disclosure bar).
Respondent and her amici additionally contend that the enactment of
the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), 100 Stat.
1934 (codified at 31 U. S. C. §3801 et seq.), shortly before the enactment
of the FCA amendments supports their reading of the latter. See Brief
for Respondent 30–33; Brief for United States 14–15; Brief for Taxpay
ers Against Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 28–29. Yet while
“there is no question that the PFCRA was designed to operate in
tandem with the FCA,” Stevens, 529 U. S., at 786, n. 17, or that the
PFCRA is addressed to federal administrative agencies, there is also no
explicit evidence to suggest that Congress intended to limit Category
2’s reference to “administrative” sources to the same set of agencies.
The FCA’s public disclosure bar serves a distinct function not replicated
in the PFCRA; the text of the public disclosure bar contains no refer
ence to the PFCRA; and no Member of Congress, so far as we are
aware, articulated any such intent.

Opinion of the Court

303, 310 (1976), there is no “evident legislative purpose” to
guide our resolution of the discrete issue that confronts us.
V
Respondent and her amici likewise fail to prove their
case that petitioners’ reading of the statute will lead to
results that Congress could not have intended. Their
argument rests on an empirical proposition: “While federal
inquiries and their outcomes are readily available to De
partment of Justice [(DOJ)] attorneys, many state and
local reports and investigations never come to the atten
tion of federal authorities.” Brief for United States 22; see
also 528 F. 3d, at 306 (“Because the federal government is
unlikely to learn about state and local investigations, a
large number of fraudulent claims against the government
would go unremedied without the financial incentives
offered by the qui tam provisions of the FCA”). This
proposition is not implausible, but it is sheer conjecture.
Numerous federal investigations may be occurring at any
given time, and DOJ attorneys may not reliably learn
about their findings. DOJ attorneys may learn about
quite a few state and local inquiries, especially when the
inquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint federal-state
program financed in part by federal dollars, such as the
program at issue in this case.18 Just how accessible to the
Attorney General a typical state or local source will be, as
compared to a federal source, is an open question. And it
——————
18 In some instances, federal law dictates that state and local govern
ments receiving federal funds perform an audit of their programs. See
31 U. S. C. §7502(a)(1)(B) (requiring nonfederal entities that expend
federal awards above a certain amount to “undergo a single audit” in
accordance with specified conditions); Brief for State of Pennsylvania et
al. as Amici Curiae 7–10 (discussing the Single Audit Act of 1984). It
bears mention that, to the extent one is worried about Federal Gov
ernment ignorance of state and local antifraud efforts, see post, at 10–
11, today’s ruling may induce federal authorities to pay closer attention
to such efforts going forward.

Opinion of the Court

is not even the right question. The statutory touchstone,
once again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been
“public[ly] disclos[ed],” §3730(e)(4)(A), not whether they
have landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.
Respondent’s argument also gives insufficient weight to
Congress’ decision to bar qui tam actions based on disclo
sures “from the news media.” Ibid. Because there was no
such bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a
jurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion
that the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded
intent to increase the availability of qui tam litigation.
And since the “news media” include a large number of
local newspapers and radio stations, this category likely
describes a multitude of sources that would seldom come
to the attention of the Attorney General.
As for respondent and her amici’s concern that local
governments will insulate themselves from qui tam liabil
ity “through careful, low key ‘disclosures’ ” of potential
fraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as
Amicus Curiae 17, this argument rests not just on specu
lation but indeed on rather strained speculation. Any
such disclosure would not immunize the local government
from FCA liability in an action brought by the United
States, see Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. United States, 549 U. S.
457, 478 (2007)—and to the contrary it could tip off the
Attorney General that such an action might be fruitful. It
seems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view
when they assert that, “[g]iven the fact that the submis
sion of a false claim to the United States subjects a defen
dant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble dam
ages and attorneys’ fees, no rational entity would prepare
a report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of
cutting off qui tam actions.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 19;
see also United States ex rel. Bly-Magee v. Premo, 470
F. 3d 914, 919 (CA9 2006) (“The fear [of self-insulating
disclosures] is unfounded in general because it is unlikely

GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON
Opinion of the Court

that an agency trying to cover up its fraud would reveal
the requisite ‘allegations or transactions’ underlying the
fraud in a public document”).19
Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Congress
carefully preserved the rights of the most deserving qui
tam plaintiffs: those whistle-blowers who qualify as origi
nal sources. Notwithstanding public disclosure of the
allegations made by a qui tam plaintiff, her case may go
forward if she is “an original source of the information.”
§3730(e)(4)(A). It is therefore flat wrong to suggest that a
finding for petitioners will “ ‘in effect return us to the
unduly restrictive “government knowledge” standard’ ”
that prevailed prior to 1986. Brief for United States 31
(quoting Dunleavy, 123 F. 3d, at 746); see Brief for Re
spondent 34 (asserting that “petitioners’ construction
would reimpose a form of the ‘government knowledge’ bar”
(capitalization omitted)). Today’s ruling merely confirms
that disclosures made in one type of context—a state or
local report, audit, or investigation—may trigger the
public disclosure bar. It has no bearing on disclosures
made in other contexts, and it leaves intact the ability of
original sources to prosecute qui tam actions irrespective
of the state of Government knowledge. Whether respon
dent can qualify as an “original source,” as that term is
defined in §3730(e)(4), is one of many issues that remain
open on remand.
——————
19 Petitioners and their amici also counter with public policy argu
ments of their own. Under the Court of Appeals’ reading of the statute,
they allege, there is an increased likelihood that parasitic relators will
beat more deserving relators to the courthouse, Brief for Petitioners 31,
and that state and local governments will find their antifraud investi
gations impeded, or will decline to conduct such investigations in the
first place, on account of “opportunistic potential relators trolling state
records and reports, available to the public,” in search of a qui tam
claim, Brief for State of Pennsylvania et al. as Amici Curiae 11.

Opinion of the Court 


VI 

Respondent and the Solicitor General have given nu
merous reasons why they believe their reading of the FCA
moves it closer to the golden mean between an inadequate
and an excessive scope for private enforcement. Congress
may well have endorsed those views in its recent amend
ment to the public disclosure bar. See n. 1, supra. With
respect to the version of §3730(e)(4)(A) that is before us,
however, we conclude that the term “administrative” in
Category 2 is not limited to federal sources.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
