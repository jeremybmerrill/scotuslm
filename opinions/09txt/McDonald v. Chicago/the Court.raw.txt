OTIS MCDONALD, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. CITY OF 

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 28, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II–A, II–B, II–D, III–A, and III–B, in which THE
CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and
JUSTICE THOMAS join, and an opinion with respect to
Parts II–C, IV, and V, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE KENNEDY join.
Two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554
U. S. ___ (2008), we held that the Second Amendment
protects the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of
self-defense, and we struck down a District of Columbia
law that banned the possession of handguns in the home.
The city of Chicago (City) and the village of Oak Park, a
Chicago suburb, have laws that are similar to the District
of Columbia’s, but Chicago and Oak Park argue that their
laws are constitutional because the Second Amendment
has no application to the States. We have previously held
that most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply with
full force to both the Federal Government and the States.
Applying the standard that is well established in our case
law, we hold that the Second Amendment right is fully

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

applicable to the States.
I
Otis McDonald, Adam Orlov, Colleen Lawson, and
David Lawson (Chicago petitioners) are Chicago residents
who would like to keep handguns in their homes for self
defense but are prohibited from doing so by Chicago’s
firearms laws. A City ordinance provides that “[n]o person
shall . . . possess . . . any firearm unless such person is the
holder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm.”
Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–040(a) (2009). The
Code then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus
effectively banning handgun possession by almost all
private citizens who reside in the City. §8–20–050(c).
Like Chicago, Oak Park makes it “unlawful for any person
to possess . . . any firearm,” a term that includes “pistols,
revolvers, guns and small arms . . . commonly known as
handguns.” Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code §§27–2–1
(2007), 27–1–1 (2009).
Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents
“from the loss of property and injury or death from fire
arms.” See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the
City Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982). The Chicago peti
tioners and their amici, however, argue that the handgun
ban has left them vulnerable to criminals. Chicago Police
Department statistics, we are told, reveal that the City’s
handgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban
was enacted1 and that Chicago residents now face one of
the highest murder rates in the country and rates of other
violent crimes that exceed the average in comparable
cities.2

Opinion of the Court

Several of the Chicago petitioners have been the targets
of threats and violence. For instance, Otis McDonald, who
is in his late seventies, lives in a high-crime neighborhood.
He is a community activist involved with alternative
policing strategies, and his efforts to improve his
neighborhood have subjected him to violent threats from
drug dealers. App. 16–17; Brief for State Firearm Associa
tions as Amici Curiae 20–21; Brief for State of Texas et al.
as Amici Curiae 7–8. Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resi
dent whose home has been targeted by burglars. “In Mrs.
Lawson’s judgment, possessing a handgun in Chicago
would decrease her chances of suffering serious injury or
death should she ever be threatened again in her home.”3
McDonald, Lawson, and the other Chicago petitioners own
handguns that they store outside of the city limits, but
they would like to keep their handguns in their homes for
protection. See App. 16–19, 43–44 (McDonald), 20–24 (C.
Lawson), 19, 36 (Orlov), 20–21, 40 (D. Lawson).
After our decision in Heller, the Chicago petitioners and
two groups4 filed suit against the City in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. They
sought a declaration that the handgun ban and several
related Chicago ordinances violate the Second and Four
teenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
Another action challenging the Oak Park law was filed in
the same District Court by the National Rifle Association
(NRA) and two Oak Park residents. In addition, the NRA
and others filed a third action challenging the Chicago

ordinances. All three cases were assigned to the same
District Judge.
The District Court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the
Chicago and Oak Park laws are unconstitutional. See
App. 83–84; NRA, Inc. v. Oak Park, 617 F. Supp. 2d 752,
754 (ND Ill. 2008). The court noted that the Seventh
Circuit had “squarely upheld the constitutionality of a ban
on handguns a quarter century ago,” id., at 753 (citing
Quilici v. Morton Grove, 695 F. 2d 261 (CA7 1982)), and
that Heller had explicitly refrained from “opin[ing] on the
subject of incorporation vel non of the Second Amend
ment,” NRA, 617 F. Supp. 2d, at 754. The court observed
that a district judge has a “duty to follow established
precedent in the Court of Appeals to which he or she is
beholden, even though the logic of more recent caselaw
may point in a different direction.” Id., at 753.
The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th
century cases—United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542
(1876), Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252 (1886), and Miller
v. Texas, 153 U. S. 535 (1894)—that were decided in the
wake of this Court’s interpretation of the Privileges or
Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the
Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36 (1873). The Seventh
Circuit described the rationale of those cases as “defunct”
and recognized that they did not consider the question
whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause
incorporates the Second Amendment right to keep and
bear arms. NRA, Inc. v. Chicago, 567 F. 3d 856, 857, 858
(2009). Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit observed that it
was obligated to follow Supreme Court precedents that
have “direct application,” and it declined to predict how
the Second Amendment would fare under this Court’s
modern “selective incorporation” approach. Id., at 857–
858 (internal quotation marks omitted).
We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).

Opinion of the Court

II 

A

Petitioners argue that the Chicago and Oak Park laws
violate the right to keep and bear arms for two reasons.
Petitioners’ primary submission is that this right is among
the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States” and that the narrow interpretation of the Privi
leges or Immunities Clause adopted in the SlaughterHouse Cases, supra, should now be rejected. As a secon
dary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth
Amendment’s Due Process Clause “incorporates” the
Second Amendment right.
Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) main
tain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the
States only if that right is an indispensable attribute of
any “ ‘civilized’ ” legal system. Brief for Municipal Respon
dents 9. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that
does not recognize the right, the municipal respondents
tell us, then that right is not protected by due process.
Ibid. And since there are civilized countries that ban or
strictly regulate the private possession of handguns, the
municipal respondents maintain that due process does not
preclude such measures. Id., at 21–23. In light of the
parties’ far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting
this Court’s analysis over the years of the relationship
between the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States.
B
The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment,
originally applied only to the Federal Government. In
Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243
(1833), the Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall,
explained that this question was “of great importance” but
“not of much difficulty.” Id., at 247. In less than four
pages, the Court firmly rejected the proposition that the
first eight Amendments operate as limitations on the


6

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

States, holding that they apply only to the Federal Gov
ernment. See also Lessee of Livingston v. Moore, 7 Pet.
469, 551–552 (1833) (“[I]t is now settled that those amend
ments [in the Bill of Rights] do not extend to the states”).
The constitutional Amendments adopted in the after
math of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country’s
federal system. The provision at issue in this case, §1 of
the Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other
things, that a State may not abridge “the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States” or deprive
“any person of life, liberty, or property, without due proc
ess of law.”
Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment, this Court was asked to interpret the
Amendment’s reference to “the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States.” The Slaughter-House
Cases, supra, involved challenges to a Louisiana law per
mitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the
butchering of animals within the city of New Orleans.
Justice Samuel Miller’s opinion for the Court concluded
that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only
those rights “which owe their existence to the Federal
government, its National character, its Constitution, or its
laws.” Id., at 79. The Court held that other fundamental
rights—rights that predated the creation of the Federal
Government and that “the State governments were cre
ated to establish and secure”—were not protected by the
Clause. Id., at 76.
In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of
federal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two
principal arguments. First, the Court emphasized that
the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities
Clause spoke of “the privileges or immunities of citizens of
the United States,” and the Court contrasted this phrasing
with the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth
Amendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause

7

Opinion of the Court

of Article IV, both of which refer to state citizenship.5
(Emphasis added.) Second, the Court stated that a con
trary reading would “radically chang[e] the whole theory
of the relations of the State and Federal governments to
each other and of both these governments to the people,”
and the Court refused to conclude that such a change had
been made “in the absence of language which expresses
such a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.” Id., at 78.
Finding the phrase “privileges or immunities of citizens of
the United States” lacking by this high standard, the
Court reasoned that the phrase must mean something
more limited.
Under the Court’s narrow reading, the Privileges or
Immunities Clause protects such things as the right
“to come to the seat of government to assert any claim
[a citizen] may have upon that government, to trans
act any business he may have with it, to seek its pro
tection, to share its offices, to engage in administering
its functions . . . [and to] become a citizen of any State
of the Union by a bonâ fide residence therein, with the
same rights as other citizens of that State.” Id., at
79–80 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Finding no constitutional protection against state intru
sion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the
Court upheld the statute. Four Justices dissented. Jus
tice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices
Swayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing
the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities
——————
5 The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment makes “[a]ll per
sons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris
diction thereof . . . citizens of the United States and of the State wherein
they reside.” (Emphasis added.) The Privileges and Immunities Clause
of Article IV provides that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled
to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.”
(Emphasis added.)

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

Clause to “a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished
nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the
people on its passage.” Id., at 96; see also id., at 104.
Justice Field opined that the Privileges or Immunities
Clause protects rights that are “in their nature . . . funda
mental,” including the right of every man to pursue his
profession without the imposition of unequal or discrimi
natory restrictions. Id., at 96–97. Justice Bradley’s dis
sent observed that “we are not bound to resort to implica
tion . . . to find an authoritative declaration of some of the
most important privileges and immunities of citizens of
the United States. It is in the Constitution itself.” Id., at
118. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges
or Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated
in the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights.
Id., at 119. Justice Swayne described the majority’s nar
row reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as
“turn[ing] . . . what was meant for bread into a stone.” Id.,
at 129 (dissenting opinion).
Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of
the narrow Slaughter-House interpretation. See, e.g.,
Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 522, n. 1, 527 (1999) (THOMAS,
J., dissenting) (scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment
agree “that the Clause does not mean what the Court said
it meant in 1873”); Amar, Substance and Method in the
Year 2000, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 601, 631, n. 178 (2001)
(“Virtually no serious modern scholar—left, right, and
center—thinks that this [interpretation] is a plausible
reading of the Amendment”); Brief for Constitutional Law
Professors as Amici Curiae 33 (claiming an “overwhelming
consensus among leading constitutional scholars” that the
opinion is “egregiously wrong”); C. Black, A New Birth of
Freedom 74–75 (1997).
Three years after the decision in the Slaughter-House
Cases, the Court decided Cruikshank, the first of the three
19th-century cases on which the Seventh Circuit relied.

9

Opinion of the Court

92 U. S. 542. In that case, the Court reviewed convictions
stemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisi
ana on Easter Sunday 1873. Dozens of blacks, many
unarmed, were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white
men.6 Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed
African-American prisoners through the streets and then
had them summarily executed.7 Ninety-seven men were
indicted for participating in the massacre, but only nine
went to trial. Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges;
the remaining three were acquitted of murder but con
victed under the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, for
banding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of
various constitutional rights, including the right to bear
arms.8
The Court reversed all of the convictions, including
those relating to the deprivation of the victims’ right to
bear arms. Cruikshank, 92 U. S., at 553, 559. The Court
wrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose
“is not a right granted by the Constitution” and is not “in
any manner dependent upon that instrument for its exis
tence.” Id., at 553. “The second amendment,” the Court
continued, “declares that it shall not be infringed; but this
. . . means no more than that it shall not be infringed by
Congress.” Ibid. “Our later decisions in Presser v. Illinois,
116 U. S. 252, 265 (1886), and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S.
535, 538 (1894), reaffirmed that the Second Amendment
applies only to the Federal Government.” Heller, 554
U. S., at ___, n. 23 (slip op., at 48, n. 23).

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court
Opinion of ALITO, J.

C
As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that
Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners’
claims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue,
however, that we should overrule those decisions and hold
that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the “privi
leges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” In
petitioners’ view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause
protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as
well as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15–21,
but petitioners are unable to identify the Clause’s full
scope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6, 8–11. Nor is there any consen
sus on that question among the scholars who agree that
the Slaughter-House Cases’ interpretation is flawed. See
Saenz, supra, at 522, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).
We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here.
For many decades, the question of the rights protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement
has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that
Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities
Clause. We therefore decline to disturb the SlaughterHouse holding.
At the same time, however, this Court’s decisions in
Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from
considering whether the Due Process Clause of the Four
teenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right
binding on the States. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___, n. 23
(slip op., at 48, n. 23). None of those cases “engage[d] in
the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by
our later cases.” Ibid. As explained more fully below,
Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era in
which the Court began the process of “selective incorpo
ration” under the Due Process Clause, and we have never
previously addressed the question whether the right to
keep and bear arms applies to the States under that
theory.


Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)

11

Opinion of the Court

Indeed, Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding
that other rights that were at issue in that case are bind
ing on the States through the Due Process Clause. In
Cruikshank, the Court held that the general “right of the
people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,” which
is protected by the First Amendment, applied only against
the Federal Government and not against the States. See
92 U. S., at 551–552. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the
Court held that the right of peaceful assembly was a “fun
damental righ[t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.” De Jonge v. Oregon, 299
U. S. 353, 364 (1937). We follow the same path here and
thus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms
applies to the States under the Due Process Clause.
D
1
In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider
whether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from
infringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See Hurtado
v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (due process does not
require grand jury indictment); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v.
Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897) (due process prohibits
States from taking of private property for public use with
out just compensation). Five features of the approach
taken during the ensuing era should be noted.
First, the Court viewed the due process question as
entirely separate from the question whether a right was a
privilege or immunity of national citizenship. See Twin
ing v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99 (1908).
Second, the Court explained that the only rights pro
tected against state infringement by the Due Process
Clause were those rights “of such a nature that they are
included in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid.
See also, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46 (1947);
Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942); Palko v. Connecticut,


12

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

302 U. S. 319 (1937); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297
U. S. 233 (1936); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 (1932).
While it was “possible that some of the personal rights
safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against Na
tional action [might] also be safeguarded against state
action,” the Court stated, this was “not because those
rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments.”
Twining, supra, at 99.
The Court used different formulations in describing the
boundaries of due process. For example, in Twining, the
Court referred to “immutable principles of justice which
inhere in the very idea of free government which no mem
ber of the Union may disregard.” 211 U. S., at 102 (inter
nal quotation marks omitted). In Snyder v. Massachu
setts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934), the Court spoke of rights
that are “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our
people as to be ranked as fundamental.” And in Palko, the
Court famously said that due process protects those rights
that are “the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty”
and essential to “a fair and enlightened system of justice.”
302 U. S., at 325.
Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court
“can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into
whether some particular procedural safeguard was re
quired of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined
that would not accord the particular protection.” Duncan
v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, n. 14 (1968). Thus, in
holding that due process prohibits a State from taking
private property without just compensation, the Court
described the right as “a principle of natural equity, rec
ognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from
a deep and universal sense of its justice.” Chicago, B. &
Q. R. Co., supra, at 238. Similarly, the Court found that
due process did not provide a right against compelled
incrimination in part because this right “has no place in
the jurisprudence of civilized and free countries outside


Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)

13

Opinion of the Court

the domain of the common law.” Twining, supra, at 113.
Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to
hold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to
meet the test for inclusion within the protection of the
Due Process Clause. The Court found that some such
rights qualified. See, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S.
652, 666 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); Near v.
Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931) (same);
Powell, supra (assistance of counsel in capital cases); De
Jonge, supra (freedom of assembly); Cantwell v. Con
necticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940) (free exercise of religion).
But others did not. See, e.g., Hurtado, supra (grand jury
indictment requirement); Twining, supra (privilege
against self-incrimination).
Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights
was held to fall within the conception of due process, the
protection or remedies afforded against state infringement
sometimes differed from the protection or remedies pro
vided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To
give one example, in Betts the Court held that, although
the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of coun
sel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant
was unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause
required appointment of counsel in state criminal proceed
ings only where “want of counsel in [the] particular case
. . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental
fairness.” 316 U. S., at 473. Similarly, in Wolf v. Colo
rado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949), the Court held that the “core of
the Fourth Amendment” was implicit in the concept of
ordered liberty and thus “enforceable against the States
through the Due Process Clause” but that the exclusionary
rule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the
States. Id., at 27–28, 33.
2
An alternative theory regarding the relationship be


14

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

tween the Bill of Rights and §1 of the Fourteenth Amend
ment was championed by Justice Black. This theory held
that §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated
all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g.,
Adamson, supra, at 71–72 (Black, J., dissenting); Duncan,
supra, at 166 (Black, J., concurring). As Justice Black
noted, the chief congressional proponents of the Four
teenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amend
ment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and,
in so doing, overruled this Court’s decision in Barron.9
Adamson, 332 U. S., at 72 (dissenting opinion).10 None
——————
9 Senator Jacob Howard, who spoke on behalf of the Joint Committee
on Reconstruction and sponsored the Amendment in the Senate, stated
that the Amendment protected all of “the personal rights guarantied
and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.” Cong.
Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866) (hereinafter 39th Cong.
Globe). Representative John Bingham, the principal author of the text
of §1, said that the Amendment would “arm the Congress . . . with the
power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution
today.” Id., at 1088; see also id., at 1089–1090; A. Amar, The Bill of
Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 183 (1998) (hereinafter Amar, Bill
of Rights). After ratification of the Amendment, Bingham maintained
the view that the rights guaranteed by §1 of the Fourteenth Amend
ment “are chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Consti
tution of the United States.” Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 84
(1871). Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader
of the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Recon
struction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that “the
Constitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation
on the States. This amendment supplies that defect, and allows Con
gress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.” 39th Cong. Globe
2459; see also M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth
Amendment and the Bill of Rights 112 (1986) (counting at least 30
statements during the debates in Congress interpreting §1 to incorpo
rate the Bill of Rights); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as
Amici Curiae 20 (collecting authorities and stating that “[n]ot a single
senator or representative disputed [the incorporationist] understand
ing” of the Fourteenth Amendment).
10 The municipal respondents and some of their amici dispute the
significance of these statements. They contend that the phrase “privi

theless, the Court never has embraced Justice Black’s
“total incorporation” theory.
3
While Justice Black’s theory was never adopted, the
Court eventually moved in that direction by initiating
what has been called a process of “selective incorporation,”
i.e., the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause
fully incorporates particular rights contained in the first
eight Amendments. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372
U. S. 335, 341 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 5–6

the first eight Amendments, see Brief for Historians et al. as Amici
Curiae 13–16, and that “there is ‘support in the legislative history for
no fewer than four interpretations of the . . . Privileges or Immunities
Clause.’ ” Brief for Municipal Respondents 69 (quoting Currie, The
Reconstruction Congress, 75 U. Chi. L. Rev. 383, 406 (2008); brackets

Scholars have also disputed the total incorporation theory. See, e.g.,
Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of
Rights? 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949); Berger, Incorporation of the Bill of
Rights in the Fourteenth Amendment: A Nine-Lived Cat, 42 Ohio St.
L. J. 435 (1981).
Proponents of the view that §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment makes
all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States re
spond that the terms privileges, immunities, and rights were used
interchangeably at the time, see, e.g., Curtis, supra, at 64–65, and that
the position taken by the leading congressional proponents of the
Amendment was widely publicized and understood, see, e.g., Wilden
thal, supra, at 1564–1565, 1590; Hardy, Original Popular Understand
ing of the Fourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of
1866–1868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695 (2009). A number of scholars have
found support for the total incorporation of the Bill of Rights. See
Curtis, supra, at 57–130; Aynes, On Misreading John Bingham and the
Fourteenth Amendment, 103 Yale L. J. 57, 61 (1993); see also Amar,

Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 18 (1967); Duncan, 391
U. S., at 147–148; Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 794
(1969).
The decisions during this time abandoned three of the
previously noted characteristics of the earlier period.11
The Court made it clear that the governing standard is not
whether any “civilized system [can] be imagined that
would not accord the particular protection.” Duncan, 391
U. S., at 149, n. 14. Instead, the Court inquired whether a
particular Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental to our
scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice. Id., at
149, and n. 14; see also id., at 148 (referring to those
“fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at
the base of all our civil and political institutions” (empha
sis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).
The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights
guaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the requirements for
protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court
eventually incorporated almost all of the provisions of the
Bill of Rights.12 Only a handful of the Bill of Rights pro
——————
11 By contrast, the Court has never retreated from the proposition
that the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause
present different questions. And in recent cases addressing unenumer
ated rights, we have required that a right also be “implicit in the
concept of ordered liberty.” See, e.g., Washington v. Glucksberg, 521
U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).
12 With respect to the First Amendment, see Everson v. Board of Ed.
of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947) (Establishment Clause); Cantwell v.
Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940) (Free Exercise Clause); De Jonge v.
Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937) (freedom of assembly); Gitlow v. New
York, 268 U. S. 652 (1925) (free speech); Near v. Minnesota ex rel.
Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931) (freedom of the press).
With respect to the Fourth Amendment, see Aguilar v. Texas, 378
U. S. 108 (1964) (warrant requirement); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643
(1961) (exclusionary rule); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949) (free
dom from unreasonable searches and seizures).

tections remain unincorporated.13
Finally, the Court abandoned “the notion that the Four
teenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered
down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of
the Bill of Rights,” stating that it would be “incongruous”
to apply different standards “depending on whether the
claim was asserted in a state or federal court.” Malloy,
378 U. S., at 10–11 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Instead, the Court decisively held that incorporated Bill of
——————
U. S. 784 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S.
1 (1964) (privilege against self-incrimination); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co.
v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897) (Just Compensation Clause).
With respect to the Sixth Amendment, see Duncan v. Louisiana, 391
U. S. 145 (1968) (trial by jury in criminal cases); Washington v. Texas,
388 U. S. 14 (1967) (compulsory process); Klopfer v. North Carolina,
386 U. S. 213 (1967) (speedy trial); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400
(1965) (right to confront adverse witness); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372
U. S. 335 (1963) (assistance of counsel); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257
(1948) (right to a public trial).
With respect to the Eighth Amendment, see Robinson v. California,
370 U. S. 660 (1962) (cruel and unusual punishment); Schilb v. Kuebel,
404 U. S. 357 (1971) (prohibition against excessive bail).
13 In addition to the right to keep and bear arms (and the Sixth
Amendment right to a unanimous jury verdict, see n. 14, infra), the
only rights not fully incorporated are (1) the Third Amendment’s
protection against quartering of soldiers; (2) the Fifth Amendment’s
grand jury indictment requirement; (3) the Seventh Amendment right
to a jury trial in civil cases; and (4) the Eighth Amendment’s prohibi
tion on excessive fines.
We never have decided whether the Third Amendment or the Eighth
Amendment’s prohibition of excessive fines applies to the States
through the Due Process Clause. See Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,
Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 276, n. 22 (1989) (declining to
decide whether the excessive-fines protection applies to the States); see
also Engblom v. Carey, 677 F. 2d 957, 961 (CA2 1982) (holding as a
matter of first impression that the “Third Amendment is incorporated
into the Fourteenth Amendment for application to the states”).
Our governing decisions regarding the Grand Jury Clause of the
Fifth Amendment and the Seventh Amendment’s civil jury requirement
long predate the era of selective incorporation.


18

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

Rights protections “are all to be enforced against the
States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the
same standards that protect those personal rights against
federal encroachment.” Id., at 10; see also Mapp v. Ohio,
367 U. S. 643, 655–656 (1961); Ker v. California, 374 U. S.
23, 33–34 (1963); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108, 110
(1964); Pointer, 380 U. S., at 406; Duncan, supra, at 149,
157–158; Benton, 395 U. S., at 794–795; Wallace v. Jaffree,
472 U. S. 38, 48–49 (1985).14
Employing this approach, the Court overruled earlier
decisions in which it had held that particular Bill of Rights
——————
14 There is one exception to this general rule. The Court has held that
although the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury requires a unani
mous jury verdict in federal criminal trials, it does not require a
unanimous jury verdict in state criminal trials. See Apodaca v. Oregon,
406 U. S. 404 (1972); see also Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356
(1972) (holding that the Due Process Clause does not require unani
mous jury verdicts in state criminal trials). But that ruling was the
result of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement
of the two-track approach to incorporation. In Apodaca, eight Justices
agreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the
Federal Government and the States. See Johnson, supra, at 395
(Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, among those eight, four Jus
tices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unani
mous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, Apodaca,
406 U. S., at 406 (plurality opinion), and four other Justices took the
view that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in
federal and state criminal trials, id., at 414–415 (Stewart, J., dissent
ing); Johnson, supra, at 381–382 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Justice
Powell’s concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded
that the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not
state, cases.
Apodaca, therefore, does not undermine the well
established rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply
identically to the States and the Federal Government. See Johnson,
supra, at 395–396 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted) (“In any
event, the affirmance must not obscure that the majority of the Court
remains of the view that, as in the case of every specific of the Bill of
Rights that extends to the States, the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial
guarantee, however it is to be construed, has identical application
against both State and Federal Governments”).

guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States. See,
e.g., Mapp, supra (overruling in part Wolf, 338 U. S. 25);
Gideon, 372 U. S. 335 (overruling Betts, 316 U. S. 455);

Palko, 302 U. S. 319).

With this framework in mind, we now turn directly to
the question whether the Second Amendment right to
keep and bear arms is incorporated in the concept of due
process. In answering that question, as just explained, we
must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is
fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan,
391 U. S., at 149, or as we have said in a related context,
whether this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s his
tory and tradition,” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.
702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Our decision in Heller points unmistakably to the an
swer. Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many
legal systems from ancient times to the present day,15 and
in Heller, we held that individual self-defense is “the
central component” of the Second Amendment right. 554
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see also id., at ___ (slip op., at
56) (stating that the “inherent right of self-defense has
been central to the Second Amendment right”). Explain

is most acute” in the home, ibid., we found that this right
applies to handguns because they are “the most preferred

op., at 56) (noting that handguns are “overwhelmingly
chosen by American society for [the] lawful purpose” of
self-defense); id., at ___ (slip op., at 57) (“[T]he American
people have considered the handgun to be the quintessen
tial self-defense weapon”). Thus, we concluded, citizens
must be permitted “to use [handguns] for the core lawful
purpose of self-defense.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 58).
Heller makes it clear that this right is “deeply rooted in
this Nation’s history and tradition.” Glucksberg, supra, at
721 (internal quotation marks omitted). Heller explored
the right’s origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of
Rights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self
defense, 554 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 19–20), and that
by 1765, Blackstone was able to assert that the right to
keep and bear arms was “one of the fundamental rights of
Englishmen,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 20).
Blackstone’s assessment was shared by the American
colonists. As we noted in Heller, King George III’s attempt
to disarm the colonists in the 1760’s and 1770’s “provoked
polemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as
Englishmen to keep arms.”16 Id., at ___ (slip op., at 21);
see also L. Levy, Origins of the Bill of Rights 137–143
(1999) (hereinafter Levy).

them to be equip’d with arms, &c. are guilty of an illegal act, in calling
upon one another to be provided with them, as the law directs.” Boston

Rights. “During the 1788 ratification debates, the fear
that the federal government would disarm the people in
order to impose rule through a standing army or select
militia was pervasive in Antifederalist rhetoric.” Heller,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25) (citing Letters from the Fed
eral Farmer III (Oct. 10, 1787), in 2 The Complete AntiFederalist 234, 242 (H. Storing ed. 1981)); see also Federal
Farmer: An Additional Number of Letters to the Republi

History of the Ratification of the Constitution 360, 362–
363 (J. Kaminski & G. Saladino eds. 1995); S. Halbrook,
The Founders’ Second Amendment 171–278 (2008). Fed
eralists responded, not by arguing that the right was
insufficiently important to warrant protection but by
contending that the right was adequately protected by the
Constitution’s assignment of only limited powers to the
Federal Government. Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25–
26); cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)
(J. Madison). Thus, Antifederalists and Federalists alike
agreed that the right to bear arms was fundamental to the
newly formed system of government. See Levy 143–149;
J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an
Anglo-American Right 155–164 (1994). But those who
were fearful that the new Federal Government would
infringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and
bear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as
a condition for ratification of the Constitution. See 1 J.
Elliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on
the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327–331 (2d ed.
1854); 3 id., at 657–661; 4 id., at 242–246, 248–249; see
also Levy 26–34; A. Kelly & W. Harbison, The American
Constitution: Its Origins and Development 110, 118 (7th
ed. 1991). This is surely powerful evidence that the right
was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.
This understanding persisted in the years immediately
following the ratification of the Bill of Rights. In addition

to the four States that had adopted Second Amendment
analogues before ratification, nine more States adopted
state constitutional provisions protecting an individual
right to keep and bear arms between 1789 and 1820.
Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 27–30). Founding-era
legal commentators confirmed the importance of the right
to early Americans. St. George Tucker, for example, de
scribed the right to keep and bear arms as “the true palla
dium of liberty” and explained that prohibitions on the
right would place liberty “on the brink of destruction.” 1
Blackstone’s Commentaries, Editor’s App. 300 (S. Tucker
ed. 1803); see also W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of
the United States of America, 125–126 (2d ed. 1829) (re

of the United States §1890, p. 746 (1833) (“The right of the
citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered,
as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it
offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and
arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these
are successful in the first instance, enable the people to
resist and triumph over them”).

By the 1850’s, the perceived threat that had prompted
the inclusion of the Second Amendment in the Bill of
Rights—the fear that the National Government would
disarm the universal militia—had largely faded as a popu
lar concern, but the right to keep and bear arms was
highly valued for purposes of self-defense. See M. Doub
ler, Civilian in Peace, Soldier in War 87–90 (2003); Amar,
Bill of Rights 258–259. Abolitionist authors wrote in
support of the right. See L. Spooner, The Unconstitution

people had been “fraudulently and violently taken from
them” and the “right of the people to keep and bear arms”
had been “infringed.” National Party Platforms 1840–
1972, p. 27 (5th ed. 1973).17
After the Civil War, many of the over 180,000 African
Americans who served in the Union Army returned to the
States of the old Confederacy, where systematic efforts
were made to disarm them and other blacks. See Heller,
554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 42); E. Foner, Reconstruction:
America’s Unfinished Revolution 1863–1877, p. 8 (1988)
(hereinafter Foner). The laws of some States formally
prohibited African Americans from possessing firearms.
For example, a Mississippi law provided that “no freed
man, free negro or mulatto, not in the military service of
the United States government, and not licensed so to do by
the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry
fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie

17 Abolitionists and Republicans were not alone in believing that the
right to keep and bear arms was a fundamental right. The 1864
Democratic Party Platform complained that the confiscation of firearms
by Union troops occupying parts of the South constituted “the interfer

defense.” National Party Platforms 1840–1972, at 34.

Throughout the South, armed parties, often consisting
of ex-Confederate soldiers serving in the state militias,
forcibly took firearms from newly freed slaves. In the first
session of the 39th Congress, Senator Wilson told his
colleagues: “In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who
were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting
the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and
outrages upon them; and the same things are done in

18 In South Carolina, prominent black citizens held a convention to
address the State’s black code. They drafted a memorial to Congress,
in which they included a plea for protection of their constitutional right
to keep and bear arms: “ ‘We ask that, inasmuch as the Constitution of
the United States explicitly declares that the right to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed . . . that the late efforts of the Legislature of
this State to pass an act to deprive us [of] arms be forbidden, as a plain
violation of the Constitution.’ ” S. Halbrook, Freedmen, The Fourteenth
Amendment, and The Right to Bear Arms, 1866–1876, p. 9 (1998)
(hereinafter Halbrook, Freedmen) (quoting 2 Proceedings of the Black
State Conventions, 1840–1865, p. 302 (P. Foner & G. Walker eds.

gress concluded that legislative action was necessary. Its
efforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms
demonstrate that the right was still recognized to be
fundamental.
The most explicit evidence of Congress’ aim appears in
§14 of the Freedmen’s Bureau Act of 1866, which provided
that “the right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws
and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal
security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of
estate, real and personal, including the constitutional
right to bear arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all
the citizens . . . without respect to race or color, or previ
ous condition of slavery.” 14 Stat. 176–177 (emphasis
added).22 Section 14 thus explicitly guaranteed that “all
the citizens,” black and white, would have “the constitu
tional right to bear arms.”
The Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which was
considered at the same time as the Freedmen’s Bureau
Act, similarly sought to protect the right of all citizens to

No. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, p. 140 (1866).
22 The Freedmen’s Bureau bill was amended to include an express
reference to the right to keep and bear arms, see 39th Cong. Globe 654
(Rep. Thomas Eliot), even though at least some Members believed that
the unamended version alone would have protected the right, see id., at
743 (Sen. Lyman Trumbull).
23 There can be do doubt that the principal proponents of the Civil
Rights Act of 1866 meant to end the disarmament of African Americans
in the South. In introducing the bill, Senator Trumbull described its
purpose as securing to blacks the “privileges which are essential to
freemen.” Id., at 474. He then pointed to the previously described
Mississippi law that “prohibit[ed] any negro or mulatto from having
fire-arms” and explained that the bill would “destroy” such laws. Ibid.
Similarly, Representative Sidney Clarke cited disarmament of freed
men in Alabama and Mississippi as a reason to support the Civil Rights
Act and to continue to deny Alabama and Mississippi representation in
Congress: “I regret, sir, that justice compels me to say, to the disgrace

guaranteed the “full and equal benefit of all laws and
proceedings for the security of person and property, as is
enjoyed by white citizens.” Ibid. This language was vir
tually identical to language in §14 of the Freedmen’s
Bureau Act, 14 Stat. 176–177 (“the right . . . to have full
and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning
personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition,
enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal”).
And as noted, the latter provision went on to explain that
one of the “laws and proceedings concerning personal
liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment,
and disposition of estate, real and personal” was “the
constitutional right to bear arms.” Ibid. Representative
Bingham believed that the Civil Rights Act protected the
same rights as enumerated in the Freedmen’s Bureau bill,
which of course explicitly mentioned the right to keep and
bear arms. 39th Cong. Globe 1292. The unavoidable
conclusion is that the Civil Rights Act, like the Freedmen’s
Bureau Act, aimed to protect “the constitutional right to
bear arms” and not simply to prohibit discrimination. See
also Amar, Bill of Rights 264–265 (noting that one of the
“core purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of the
Fourteenth Amendment was to redress the grievances” of
freedmen who had been stripped of their arms and to
“affirm the full and equal right of every citizen to self
defense”).

remedies insufficient. Southern resistance, Presidential
vetoes, and this Court’s pre-Civil-War precedent per
suaded Congress that a constitutional amendment was
necessary to provide full protection for the rights of
blacks.24 Today, it is generally accepted that the Four
teenth Amendment was understood to provide a constitu
tional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil
Rights Act of 1866. See General Building Contractors
Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389 (1982); see
also Amar, Bill of Rights 187; Calabresi, Two Cheers for
Professor Balkin’s Originalism, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 663,
669–670 (2009).
In debating the Fourteenth Amendment, the 39th Con
gress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a
fundamental right deserving of protection. Senator Sam
uel Pomeroy described three “indispensable” “safeguards
of liberty under our form of Government.” 39th Cong.
Globe 1182. One of these, he said, was the right to keep
and bear arms:
“Every man . . . should have the right to bear arms
for the defense of himself and family and his home
stead. And if the cabin door of the freedman is broken
open and the intruder enters for purposes as vile as
were known to slavery, then should a well-loaded
musket be in the hand of the occupant to send the pol
luted wretch to another world, where his wretched
ness will forever remain complete.” Ibid.

right to protection, and to keep and bear arms for self
defense.” Id., at 1073 (Sen. James Nye); see also Foner
258–259.25
Evidence from the period immediately following the
ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment only confirms
that the right to keep and bear arms was considered fun
damental. In an 1868 speech addressing the disarmament
of freedmen, Representative Stevens emphasized the
necessity of the right: “Disarm a community and you rob
them of the means of defending life. Take away their
weapons of defense and you take away the inalienable
right of defending liberty.” “The fourteenth amendment,
now so happily adopted, settles the whole question.”
Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967. And in debating
the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress routinely referred to
the right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued
disarmament of blacks in the South. See Halbrook,
Freedmen 120–131. Finally, legal commentators from the
period emphasized the fundamental nature of the right.
See, e.g., T. Farrar, Manual of the Constitution of the
United States of America §118, p. 145 (1867) (reprint
1993); J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to the Constitutional
Law of the United States §239, pp. 152–153 (3d ed. 1875).
The right to keep and bear arms was also widely pro
tected by state constitutions at the time when the Four
teenth Amendment was ratified. In 1868, 22 of the 37
States in the Union had state constitutional provisions

25 Other Members of the 39th Congress stressed the importance of the
right to keep and bear arms in discussing other measures. In speaking
generally on reconstruction, Representative Roswell Hart listed the
“ ‘right of the people to keep and bear arms’ ” as among those rights
necessary to a “republican form of government.” 39th Cong. Globe
1629. Similarly, in objecting to a bill designed to disarm southern
militias, Senator Willard Saulsbury argued that such a measure would
violate the Second Amendment. Id., at 914–915. Indeed, the bill
“ultimately passed in a form that disbanded militias but maintained
the right of individuals to their private firearms.” Cramer 858.

explicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms. See

tutions when the Fourteenth Amendment was Ratified in
1868: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American His
tory and Tradition? 87 Texas L. Rev. 7, 50 (2008).26 Quite
a few of these state constitutional guarantees, moreover,
explicitly protected the right to keep and bear arms as an
individual right to self-defense. See Ala. Const., Art. I,
§28 (1868); Conn. Const., Art. I, §17 (1818); Ky. Const.,
Art. XIII, §25 (1850); Mich. Const., Art. XVIII, §7 (1850);
Miss. Const., Art. I, §15 (1868); Mo. Const., Art. I, §8

Const., Art. III, §13 (1889); Wash. Const., Art. I, §24
(1889); Wyo. Const., Art. I, §24 (1889); see also State v.
McAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238 (Wyo. 1986). What is
more, state constitutions adopted during the Reconstruc
tion era by former Confederate States included a right to
keep and bear arms. See, e.g., Ark. Const., Art. I, §5
(1868); Miss. Const., Art. I, §15 (1868); Tex. Const., Art. I,
§13 (1869). A clear majority of the States in 1868, there
fore, recognized the right to keep and bear arms as being
among the foundational rights necessary to our system of
Government.27
——————
26 More

generally worded provisions in the constitutions of seven
other States may also have encompassed a right to bear arms. See
Calabresi & Agudo, 87 Texas L. Rev., at 52.
27 These state constitutional protections often reflected a lack of law
enforcement in many sections of the country. In the frontier towns that
did not have an effective police force, law enforcement often could not
pursue criminals beyond the town borders. See Brief for Rocky Moun
tain Gun Owners et al. as Amici Curiae 15. Settlers in the West and

Opinion of the Court

In sum, it is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the
Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and
bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to
our system of ordered liberty.
2
Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents con
tend that Congress, in the years immediately following the
Civil War, merely sought to outlaw “discriminatory meas
ures taken against freedmen, which it addressed by adopt
ing a non-discrimination principle” and that even an
outright ban on the possession of firearms was regarded as
acceptable, “so long as it was not done in a discriminatory
manner.” Brief for Municipal Respondents 7. They argue
that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed §1 of
the Fourteenth Amendment “as an antidiscrimination
rule,” and they cite statements to the effect that the sec
tion would outlaw discriminatory measures. Id., at 64.
This argument is implausible.
First, while §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains
“an antidiscrimination rule,” namely, the Equal Protection
Clause, municipal respondents can hardly mean that §1
does no more than prohibit discrimination. If that were
so, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States,
would not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the
rights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the
Fourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not
prohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only
discriminatory searches and seizures—and so on. We
assume that this is not municipal respondents’ view, so
what they must mean is that the Second Amendment
should be singled out for special—and specially unfavor
able—treatment. We reject that suggestion.
Second, municipal respondents’ argument ignores the
——————

32

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

clear terms of the Freedmen’s Bureau Act of 1866, which
acknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms. If
that law had used language such as “the equal benefit of
laws concerning the bearing of arms,” it would be possible
to interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimina
tion. But §14 speaks of and protects “the constitutional
right to bear arms,” an unmistakable reference to the
right protected by the Second Amendment. And it pro
tects the “full and equal benefit” of this right in the States.
14 Stat. 176–177. It would have been nonsensical for
Congress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a
constitutional right that does not exist.
Third, if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those
laws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous
condition of servitude, African Americans in the South
would likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many
of their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace
officers. In the years immediately following the Civil War,
a law banning the possession of guns by all private citi
zens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the for
mal sense. Any such law—like the Chicago and Oak Park
ordinances challenged here—presumably would have
permitted the possession of guns by those acting under the
authority of the State and would thus have left firearms in
the hands of the militia and local peace officers. And as
the Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction
revealed, see supra, at 24–25, those groups were widely
involved in harassing blacks in the South.
Fourth, municipal respondents’ purely antidiscrimina
tion theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the
plight of whites in the South who opposed the Black
Codes. If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had
simply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the
bearing of arms, opponents of the Black Codes would have
been left without the means of self-defense—as had aboli
tionists in Kansas in the 1850’s.

Fifth, the 39th Congress’ response to proposals to dis
band and disarm the Southern militias is instructive.
Despite recognizing and deploring the abuses of these
militias, the 39th Congress balked at a proposal to disarm
them. See 39th Cong. Globe 914; Halbrook, Freedmen,
supra, 20–21. Disarmament, it was argued, would violate
the members’ right to bear arms, and it was ultimately
decided to disband the militias but not to disarm their
members. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, §6, 14 Stat. 485, 487;
Halbrook, Freedmen 68–69; Cramer 858–861. It cannot
be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a
substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be
ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded
manner.
IV
Municipal respondents’ remaining arguments are at war
with our central holding in Heller: that the Second
Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear
arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense
within the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us
to treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class
right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than
the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be
incorporated into the Due Process Clause.
Municipal respondents’ main argument is nothing less
than a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation prece
dent and return (presumably for this case only) to a by
gone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due
Process Clause protects only those rights “ ‘recognized by
all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and
universal sense of [their] justice.’ ” Brief for Municipal
Respondents 9 (quoting Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S.,
at 238). According to municipal respondents, if it is possi
ble to imagine any civilized legal system that does not
recognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause


34

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court
Opinion of ALITO, J.

does not make that right binding on the States. Brief for
Municipal Respondents 9. Therefore, the municipal re
spondents continue, because such countries as England,
Canada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxem
bourg, and New Zealand either ban or severely limit
handgun ownership, it must follow that no right to possess
such weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Id., at 21–23.
This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the
long-established standard we apply in incorporation cases.
See Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, and n. 14. And the pre
sent-day implications of municipal respondents’ argument
are stunning. For example, many of the rights that our
Bill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal
offenses are virtually unique to this country.28 If our

example, the United States affords criminal jury trials far more
broadly than other countries. See, e.g., Van Kessel, Adversary Excesses
in the American Criminal Trial, 67 Notre Dame L. Rev. 403 (1992);
Leib, A Comparison of Criminal Jury Decision Rules in Democratic
Countries, 5 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 629, 630 (2008); Henderson, The
Wrongs of Victim’s Rights, 37 Stan. L. Rev. 937, 1003, n. 296 (1985); see
also Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 624 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissent
ing) (“In many significant respects the laws of most other countries
differ from our law—including . . . such explicit provisions of our
Constitution as the right to jury trial”). Similarly, our rules governing
pretrial interrogation differ from those in countries sharing a similar
legal heritage. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Legal Policy, Report to the
Attorney General on the Law of Pretrial Interrogation: Truth in Crimi

v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), with rights afforded by England,

United States is the only civilized Nation in the world.
Municipal respondents attempt to salvage their position
by suggesting that their argument applies only to substan
tive as opposed to procedural rights. Brief for Municipal
Respondents 10, n. 3. But even in this trimmed form,
municipal respondents’ argument flies in the face of more
than a half-century of precedent. For example, in Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 8 (1947), the Court
held that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Yet sev
eral of the countries that municipal respondents recognize
as civilized have established state churches.29 If we were
to adopt municipal respondents’ theory, all of this Court’s
Establishment Clause precedents involving actions taken
by state and local governments would go by the boards.

deadly implement and thus has implications for public
safety. Brief for Municipal Respondents 11. And they
note that there is intense disagreement on the question
whether the private possession of guns in the home in
creases or decreases gun deaths and injuries. Id., at 11,
13–17.
The right to keep and bear arms, however, is not the
only constitutional right that has controversial public
safety implications. All of the constitutional provisions
that impose restrictions on law enforcement and on the
prosecution of crimes fall into the same category. See, e.g.,
Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U. S. 586, 591 (2006) (“The
exclusionary rule generates ‘substantial social costs,’
United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 907 (1984), which
sometimes include setting the guilty free and the danger
ous at large”); Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 522 (1972)
(reflecting on the serious consequences of dismissal for a
speedy trial violation, which means “a defendant who may
be guilty of a serious crime will go free”); Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 517 (1966) (Harlan, J., dissenting);
id., at 542 (White, J., dissenting) (objecting that the
Court’s rule “[i]n some unknown number of cases . . . will
return a killer, a rapist or other criminal to the streets . . .
to repeat his crime”); Mapp, 367 U. S., at 659. Municipal
respondents cite no case in which we have refrained from
holding that a provision of the Bill of Rights is binding on
the States on the ground that the right at issue has dis
puted public safety implications.
We likewise reject municipal respondents’ argument
that we should depart from our established incorporation
methodology on the ground that making the Second
Amendment binding on the States and their subdivisions
is inconsistent with principles of federalism and will stifle
experimentation. Municipal respondents point out—quite
correctly—that conditions and problems differ from local
ity to locality and that citizens in different jurisdictions

have divergent views on the issue of gun control. Munici
pal respondents therefore urge us to allow state and local
governments to enact any gun control law that they deem
to be reasonable, including a complete ban on the posses
sion of handguns in the home for self-defense. Brief for
Municipal Respondents 18–20, 23.
There is nothing new in the argument that, in order to
respect federalism and allow useful state experimentation,
a federal constitutional right should not be fully binding
on the States. This argument was made repeatedly and
eloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the
concept of incorporation and urged retention of the two
track approach to incorporation. Throughout the era of
“selective incorporation,” Justice Harlan in particular,
invoking the values of federalism and state experimenta
tion, fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the
two-track approach. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354
U. S. 476, 500–503 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in result
in part and dissenting in part); Mapp, supra, at 678–680
(Harlan, J., dissenting); Gideon, 372 U. S., at 352 (Harlan,
J., concurring); Malloy, 378 U. S., at 14–33 (Harlan, J.,
dissenting); Pointer, 380 U. S., at 408–409 (Harlan, J.,
concurring in result); Washington, 388 U. S., at 23–24
(Harlan, J., concurring in result); Duncan, 391 U. S., at
171–193 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Benton, 395 U. S., at
808–809 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Williams v. Florida, 399
U. S. 78, 117 (1970) (Harlan, J., dissenting in part and
concurring in result in part).
Time and again, however, those pleas failed. Unless we
turn back the clock or adopt a special incorporation test
applicable only to the Second Amendment, municipal
respondents’ argument must be rejected. Under our prece
dents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an
American perspective, then, unless stare decisis counsels

otherwise,30 that guarantee is fully binding on the States
and thus limits (but by no means eliminates) their ability
to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs
and values. As noted by the 38 States that have appeared
in this case as amici supporting petitioners, “[s]tate and
local experimentation with reasonable firearms regula
tions will continue under the Second Amendment.” Brief
for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 23.
Municipal respondents and their amici complain that
incorporation of the Second Amendment right will lead to
extensive and costly litigation, but this argument applies
with even greater force to constitutional rights and reme
dies that have already been held to be binding on the
States. Consider the exclusionary rule. Although the
exclusionary rule “is not an individual right,” Herring v.
United States, 555 U. S. ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5), but a
“judicially created rule,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 4), this
Court made the rule applicable to the States. See Mapp,
supra, at 660. The exclusionary rule is said to result in
“tens of thousands of contested suppression motions each
year.” Stuntz, The Virtues and Vices of the Exclusionary
Rule, 20 Harv. J. Law & Pub. Pol’y, 443, 444 (1997).
——————
30 As noted above, see n. 13, supra, cases that predate the era of selec
tive incorporation held that the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth
Amendment and the Seventh Amendment’s civil jury requirement do
not apply to the States. See Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884)
(indictment); Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211
(1916) (civil jury).
As a result of Hurtado, most States do not require a grand jury
indictment in all felony cases, and many have no grand juries. See
Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statis
tics, State Court Organization 2004, pp. 213, 215–217 (2006) (Table 38),
online at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/sco04.pdf.
As a result of Bombolis, cases that would otherwise fall within the
Seventh Amendment are now tried without a jury in state small claims
courts. See, e.g., Cheung v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 121 Nev. 867,
124 P. 3d 550 (2005) (no right to jury trial in small claims court under
Nevada Constitution).

Opinion of the Court
Opinion of ALITO, J.

Municipal respondents assert that, although most state
constitutions protect firearms rights, state courts have
held that these rights are subject to “interest-balancing”
and have sustained a variety of restrictions. Brief for
Municipal Respondents 23–31. In Heller, however, we
expressly rejected the argument that the scope of the
Second Amendment right should be determined by judicial
interest balancing, 554 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 62–
63), and this Court decades ago abandoned “the notion
that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only
a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guar
antees of the Bill of Rights,” Malloy, supra, at 10–11 (in
ternal quotation marks omitted).
As evidence that the Fourteenth Amendment has not
historically been understood to restrict the authority of the
States to regulate firearms, municipal respondents and
supporting amici cite a variety of state and local firearms
laws that courts have upheld. But what is most striking
about their research is the paucity of precedent sustaining
bans comparable to those at issue here and in Heller.
Municipal respondents cite precisely one case (from the
late 20th century) in which such a ban was sustained. See
Brief for Municipal Respondents 26–27 (citing Kalodimos

(asserting that no other court has ever upheld a complete
ban on the possession of handguns). It is important to
keep in mind that Heller, while striking down a law that
prohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recog
nized that the right to keep and bear arms is not “a right
to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner
whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” 554 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 54). We made it clear in Heller that our hold
ing did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory
measures as “prohibitions on the possession of firearms by
felons and the mentally ill,” “laws forbidding the carrying

of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and gov
ernment buildings, or laws imposing conditions and quali
fications on the commercial sale of arms.” Id., at ___–___
(slip op., at 54–55). We repeat those assurances here.
Despite municipal respondents’ doomsday proclamations,
incorporation does not imperil every law regulating
firearms.
Municipal respondents argue, finally, that the right to
keep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in
the first eight Amendments “because the reason for codify
ing the Second Amendment (to protect the militia) differs
from the purpose (primarily, to use firearms to engage in
self-defense) that is claimed to make the right implicit in
the concept of ordered liberty.” Brief for Municipal Re
spondents 36–37. Municipal respondents suggest that the
Second Amendment right differs from the rights hereto
fore incorporated because the latter were “valued for
[their] own sake.” Id., at 33. But we have never previ
ously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on
whether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value,
and quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorpo
rated—for example the right to counsel and the right to
confront and subpoena witnesses—are clearly instrumen
tal by any measure. Moreover, this contention repackages
one of the chief arguments that we rejected in Heller, i.e.,
that the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined
by the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that
right in the Bill of Rights. In Heller, we recognized that
the codification of this right was prompted by fear that the
Federal Government would disarm and thus disable the
militias, but we rejected the suggestion that the right was
valued only as a means of preserving the militias. 554
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26). On the contrary, we stressed
that the right was also valued because the possession of
firearms was thought to be essential for self-defense. As
we put it, self-defense was “the central component of the

right itself.” Ibid.

We turn, finally, to the two dissenting opinions.
JUSTICE STEVENS’ eloquent opinion covers ground already
addressed, and therefore little need be added in response.
JUSTICE STEVENS would “ ‘ground the prohibitions against
state action squarely on due process, without intermediate
reliance on any of the first eight Amendments.’ ” Post, at 8
(quoting Malloy, 378 U. S., at 24 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).
The question presented in this case, in his view, “is
whether the particular right asserted by petitioners ap
plies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment
itself, standing on its own bottom.” Post, at 27. He would
hold that “[t]he rights protected against state infringe
ment by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause
need not be identical in shape or scope to the rights pro
tected against Federal Government infringement by the
various provisions of the Bill of Rights.” Post, at 9.
As we have explained, the Court, for the past half
century, has moved away from the two-track approach. If
we were now to accept JUSTICE STEVENS’ theory across the
board, decades of decisions would be undermined. We
assume that this is not what is proposed. What is urged
instead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for
the individual right that Heller recognized, over vigorous
dissents.
The relationship between the Bill of Rights’ guarantees
and the States must be governed by a single, neutral
principle. It is far too late to exhume what Justice Bren
nan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as “the
notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the
States only a watered-down, subjective version of the
individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.” Malloy,
supra, at 10–11 (internal quotation marks omitted).

JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent makes several points to which
we briefly respond. To begin, while there is certainly room
for disagreement about Heller’s analysis of the history of
the right to keep and bear arms, nothing written since
Heller persuades us to reopen the question there decided.
Few other questions of original meaning have been as
thoroughly explored.
JUSTICE BREYER’s conclusion that the Fourteenth
Amendment does not incorporate the right to keep and
bear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors: First,
“there is no popular consensus” that the right is funda
mental, post, at 9; second, the right does not protect mi
norities or persons neglected by those holding political
power, post, at 10; third, incorporation of the Second
Amendment right would “amount to a significant incur
sion on a traditional and important area of state concern,
altering the constitutional relationship between the States
and the Federal Government” and preventing local varia
tions, post, at 11; and fourth, determining the scope of the
Second Amendment right in cases involving state and
local laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical
questions regarding matters that are outside their area of
expertise, post, at 11–16. Even if we believed that these
factors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry, none of
these factors undermines the case for incorporation of the
right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.
First, we have never held that a provision of the Bill of
Rights applies to the States only if there is a “popular
consensus” that the right is fundamental, and we see no
basis for such a rule. But in this case, as it turns out,
there is evidence of such a consensus. An amicus brief
submitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members
of the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the
right to keep and bear arms is fundamental. See Brief for
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison et al. as Amici Curiae 4.

Another brief submitted by 38 States takes the same
position. Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 6.
Second, petitioners and many others who live in high
crime areas dispute the proposition that the Second
Amendment right does not protect minorities and those
lacking political clout. The plight of Chicagoans living in
high-crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illi
nois legislators representing Chicago districts called on
the Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to
patrol the City’s streets.31 The legislators noted that the
number of Chicago homicide victims during the current
year equaled the number of American soldiers killed dur
ing that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that
80% of the Chicago victims were black.32 Amici supporting
incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend
that the right is especially important for women and
members of other groups that may be especially vulner
able to violent crime.33 If, as petitioners believe, their
safety and the safety of other law-abiding members of the
community would be enhanced by the possession of hand
guns in the home for self-defense, then the Second
Amendment right protects the rights of minorities and
other residents of high-crime areas whose needs are not
being met by elected public officials.

Third, JUSTICE BREYER is correct that incorporation of
the Second Amendment right will to some extent limit the
legislative freedom of the States, but this is always true
when a Bill of Rights provision is incorporated. Incorpora
tion always restricts experimentation and local variations,
but that has not stopped the Court from incorporating
virtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights. “[T]he
enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes
certain policy choices off the table.” Heller, 554 U. S., at __
(slip op., at 64). This conclusion is no more remarkable
with respect to the Second Amendment than it is with
respect to all the other limitations on state power found in
the Constitution.
Finally, JUSTICE BREYER is incorrect that incorporation
will require judges to assess the costs and benefits of
firearms restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical
judgments in an area in which they lack expertise. As we
have noted, while his opinion in Heller recommended an
interest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that
suggestion. See supra, at 38–39. “The very enumeration
of the right takes out of the hands of government—even
the Third Branch of Government—the power to decide on
a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth
insisting upon.” Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 62–63).

In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects
the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose
of self-defense. Unless considerations of stare decisis
counsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights that
protects a right that is fundamental from an American
perspective applies equally to the Federal Government
and the States. See Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, and n. 14.
We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amend
ment right recognized in Heller. The judgment of the
