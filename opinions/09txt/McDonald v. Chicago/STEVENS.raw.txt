OTIS MCDONALD, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. CITY OF 

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 28, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___
(2008) (slip op., at 1), the Court answered the question
whether a federal enclave’s “prohibition on the possession
of usable handguns in the home violates the Second
Amendment to the Constitution.” The question we should
be answering in this case is whether the Constitution
“guarantees individuals a fundamental right,” enforceable
against the States, “to possess a functional, personal
firearm, including a handgun, within the home.” Com­
plaint ¶34, App. 23. That is a different—and more diffi­
cult—inquiry than asking if the Fourteenth Amendment
“incorporates” the Second Amendment. The so-called
incorporation question was squarely and, in my view,
correctly resolved in the late 19th century.1
Before the District Court, petitioners focused their
pleadings on the special considerations raised by domestic
possession, which they identified as the core of their as­
serted right. In support of their claim that the city of
Chicago’s handgun ban violates the Constitution, they now
rely primarily on the Privileges or Immunities Clause of

the Fourteenth Amendment. See Brief for Petitioners 9–
65. They rely secondarily on the Due Process Clause of
that Amendment. See id., at 66–72. Neither submission
requires the Court to express an opinion on whether the
Fourteenth Amendment places any limit on the power of
States to regulate possession, use, or carriage of firearms
outside the home.
I agree with the plurality’s refusal to accept petitioners’
primary submission. Ante, at 10. Their briefs marshal an
impressive amount of historical evidence for their argu­
ment that the Court interpreted the Privileges or Immuni­
ties Clause too narrowly in the Slaughter-House Cases, 16

not as clear as they suggest2—and not nearly as clear as it
would need to be to dislodge 137 years of precedent. The

burden is severe for those who seek radical change in such
an established body of constitutional doctrine.3 Moreover,
the suggestion that invigorating the Privileges or Immuni­
ties Clause will reduce judicial discretion, see Reply Brief
for Petitioners 22, n. 8, 26; Tr. of Oral Arg. 64–65, strikes
me as implausible, if not exactly backwards. “For the very
reason that it has so long remained a clean slate, a revital­
ized Privileges or Immunities Clause holds special hazards
for judges who are mindful that their proper task is not to
write their personal views of appropriate public policy into
the Constitution.”4
I further agree with the plurality that there are weighty
arguments supporting petitioners’ second submission,
insofar as it concerns the possession of firearms for lawful
self-defense in the home. But these arguments are less
compelling than the plurality suggests; they are much less
compelling when applied outside the home; and their
validity does not depend on the Court’s holding in Heller.
For that holding sheds no light on the meaning of the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Our deci­

guarantees in the Bill of Rights enforceable against the

Clause, 12 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol’y 43, 52 (1989). Judge Wilkinson’s
point is broader than the privileges or immunities debate. As he
observes, “there may be more structure imposed by provisions subject
to generations of elaboration and refinement than by a provision in its
pristine state. The fortuities of uneven constitutional development
must be respected, not cast aside in the illusion of reordering the
landscape anew.” Id., at 51–52; see also Washington v. Glucksberg, 521
U. S. 702, 759, n. 6 (1997) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (ac­
knowledging that, “[t]o a degree,” the Slaughter-House “decision may
have led the Court to look to the Due Process Clause as a source of
substantive rights”).

States likewise tell us little about the meaning of the word
“liberty” in the Clause or about the scope of its protection
of nonprocedural rights.
This is a substantive due process case.
I
Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment decrees that no
State shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.” The Court has filled thou­
sands of pages expounding that spare text. As I read the
vast corpus of substantive due process opinions, they
confirm several important principles that ought to guide
our resolution of this case. The principal opinion’s lengthy
summary of our “incorporation” doctrine, see ante, at 5–9,
11–19 (majority opinion), 10–11 (plurality opinion), and its
implicit (and untenable) effort to wall off that doctrine
from the rest of our substantive due process jurisprudence,
invite a fresh survey of this old terrain.
Substantive Content
The first, and most basic, principle established by our
cases is that the rights protected by the Due Process
Clause are not merely procedural in nature. At first
glance, this proposition might seem surprising, given that
the Clause refers to “process.” But substance and proce­
dure are often deeply entwined. Upon closer inspection,
the text can be read to “impos[e] nothing less than an
obligation to give substantive content to the words ‘liberty’
and ‘due process of law,’ ” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521
U. S. 702, 764 (1997) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment),
lest superficially fair procedures be permitted to “destroy
the enjoyment” of life, liberty, and property, Poe v. Ull­
man, 367 U. S. 497, 541 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting),
and the Clause’s prepositional modifier be permitted to
swallow its primary command. Procedural guarantees are
hollow unless linked to substantive interests; and no

amount of process can legitimize some deprivations.
I have yet to see a persuasive argument that the Fram­
ers of the Fourteenth Amendment thought otherwise. To
the contrary, the historical evidence suggests that, at least
by the time of the Civil War if not much earlier, the
phrase “due process of law” had acquired substantive
content as a term of art within the legal community.5 This
understanding is consonant with the venerable “notion
that governmental authority has implied limits which

that ban as having substantive as well as procedural content, given
that era’s premise that, to qualify as ‘law,’ an enactment would have to
meet substantive requirements of rationality, non-oppressiveness, and
evenhandedness”); see also Stevens, The Third Branch of Liberty, 41 U.

preserve private autonomy,”6 a notion which predates the
founding and which finds reinforcement in the Constitu­
tion’s Ninth Amendment, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U. S. 479, 486–493 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring).7 The
Due Process Clause cannot claim to be the source of our
basic freedoms—no legal document ever could, see
Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 230 (1976) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting)—but it stands as one of their foundational
guarantors in our law.
If text and history are inconclusive on this point, our
precedent leaves no doubt: It has been “settled” for well
over a century that the Due Process Clause “applies to
matters of substantive law as well as to matters of proce­
dure.” Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 373 (1927)
(Brandeis, J., concurring). Time and again, we have rec­
ognized that in the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the
Fifth, the “Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair
process, and the ‘liberty’ it protects includes more than the
absence of physical restraint.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at
719. “The Clause also includes a substantive component
that ‘provides heightened protection against government
interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty
interests.’ ” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U. S. 57, 65 (2000)
(opinion of O’Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and
GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ.) (quoting Glucksberg, 521
U. S., at 720). Some of our most enduring precedents,
accepted today by virtually everyone, were substantive
due process decisions. See, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388
U. S. 1, 12 (1967) (recognizing due-process- as well as
equal-protection-based right to marry person of another
race); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 499–500 (1954)

upbringing and education of their children); Meyer v.
Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399–403 (1923) (striking down
prohibition on teaching of foreign languages).
Liberty
The second principle woven through our cases is that
substantive due process is fundamentally a matter of
personal liberty. For it is the liberty clause of the Four­
teenth Amendment that grounds our most important
holdings in this field. It is the liberty clause that enacts
the Constitution’s “promise” that a measure of dignity and
self-rule will be afforded to all persons. Planned Parent­
hood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 847
(1992). It is the liberty clause that reflects and renews
“the origins of the American heritage of freedom [and] the
abiding interest in individual liberty that makes certain
state intrusions on the citizen’s right to decide how he will
live his own life intolerable.” Fitzgerald v. Porter Memo­
rial Hospital, 523 F. 2d 716, 720 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.).
Our substantive due process cases have episodically in­
voked values such as privacy and equality as well, values
that in certain contexts may intersect with or complement
a subject’s liberty interests in profound ways. But as I
have observed on numerous occasions, “most of the signifi­
cant [20th-century] cases raising Bill of Rights issues
have, in the final analysis, actually interpreted the word
‘liberty’ in the Fourteenth Amendment.”8
It follows that the term “incorporation,” like the term
“unenumerated rights,” is something of a misnomer.

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Whether an asserted substantive due process interest is
explicitly named in one of the first eight Amendments to
the Constitution or is not mentioned, the underlying in­
quiry is the same: We must ask whether the interest is
“comprised within the term liberty.” Whitney, 274 U. S.,
at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring). As the second Justice
Harlan has shown, ever since the Court began considering
the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the States, “the
Court’s usual approach has been to ground the prohibi­
tions against state action squarely on due process, without
intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amend­
ments.” Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 24 (1964) (dissent­
ing opinion); see also Frankfurter, Memorandum on “In­
corporation” of the Bill of Rights into the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 78 Harv. L. Rev.
746, 747–750 (1965). In the pathmarking case of Gitlow v.
New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925), for example, both the
majority and dissent evaluated petitioner’s free speech
claim not under the First Amendment but as an aspect of
“the fundamental personal rights and ‘liberties’ protected
by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
from impairment by the States.”9
——————
9 See also Gitlow, 268 U. S., at 672 (Holmes, J., dissenting) (“The
general principle of free speech, it seems to me, must be taken to be
included in the Fourteenth Amendment, in view of the scope that has
been given to the word ‘liberty’ as there used, although perhaps it may
be accepted with a somewhat larger latitude of interpretation than is
allowed to Congress by the sweeping language that governs or ought to
govern the laws of the United States”). Subsequent decisions repeat­
edly reaffirmed that persons hold free speech rights against the States
on account of the Fourteenth Amendment’s liberty clause, not the First
Amendment per se. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357
U. S. 449, 460, 466 (1958); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303

STEVENS, J., dissenting

In his own classic opinion in Griswold, 381 U. S., at 500
(concurring in judgment), Justice Harlan memorably
distilled these precedents’ lesson: “While the relevant
inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provi­
sions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or
any of their radiations. The Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment stands . . . on its own bottom.”10
Inclusion in the Bill of Rights is neither necessary nor
sufficient for an interest to be judicially enforceable under
the Fourteenth Amendment. This Court’s “ ‘selective
incorporation’ ” doctrine, ante, at 15, is not simply “related”
to substantive due process, ante, at 19; it is a subset
thereof.
Federal/State Divergence
The third precept to emerge from our case law flows from
the second: The rights protected against state infringement
by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause need
not be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected
against Federal Government infringement by the various
provisions of the Bill of Rights. As drafted, the Bill of
——————
same basic approach to “incorporation,” with the Fourteenth Amend­
ment taken as a distinct source of rights independent from the first
eight Amendments. Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 322–328
(1937) (opinion for the Court by Cardozo, J.); Adamson v. California,
332 U. S. 46, 59–68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).
10 See also Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 26 (1949) (“The notion that
the ‘due process of law’ guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is
shorthand for the first eight amendments of the Constitution . . . has
been rejected by this Court again and again, after impressive consid­
eration. . . . The issue is closed”). Wolf’s holding on the exclusionary
rule was overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), but the
principle just quoted has never been disturbed. It is notable that
Mapp, the case that launched the modern “doctrine of ad hoc,” “ ‘jot-for­
jot’ ” incorporation, Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 130–131 (1970)
(Harlan, J., concurring in result), expressly held “that the exclusionary
rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend­
ments.” 367 U. S., at 657 (emphasis added).

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Rights directly constrained only the Federal Government.
See Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet.
243 (1833). Although the enactment of the Fourteenth
Amendment profoundly altered our legal order, it “did not
unstitch the basic federalist pattern woven into our consti­
tutional fabric.” Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 133
(1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Nor, for that
matter, did it expressly alter the Bill of Rights. The Con­
stitution still envisions a system of divided sovereignty,
still “establishes a federal republic where local differences
are to be cherished as elements of liberty” in the vast run
of cases, National Rifle Assn. of Am. Inc. v. Chicago, 567
F. 3d 856, 860 (CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C. J.), still allo­
cates a general “police power . . . to the States and the
States alone,” United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 4) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judg­
ment). Elementary considerations of constitutional text
and structure suggest there may be legitimate reasons to
hold state governments to different standards than the
Federal Government in certain areas.11
It is true, as the Court emphasizes, ante, at 15–19, that
we have made numerous provisions of the Bill of Rights
fully applicable to the States. It is settled, for instance,
that the Governor of Alabama has no more power than the
President of the United States to authorize unreasonable
searches and seizures. Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23
(1963). But we have never accepted a “total incorporation”
theory of the Fourteenth Amendment, whereby the
Amendment is deemed to subsume the provisions of the
Bill of Rights en masse. See ante, at 15. And we have
declined to apply several provisions to the States in any

can hardly improve upon the many passionate defenses of this
position that Justice Harlan penned during his tenure on the Court.

measure. See, e.g., Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v.
Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211 (1916) (Seventh Amendment);
Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (Grand Jury
Clause). We have, moreover, resisted a uniform approach
to the Sixth Amendment’s criminal jury guarantee, de­
manding 12-member panels and unanimous verdicts in
federal trials, yet not in state trials. See Apodaca v. Ore­
gon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972) (plurality opinion); Williams, 399
U. S. 78. In recent years, the Court has repeatedly de­
clined to grant certiorari to review that disparity.12 While
those denials have no precedential significance, they
confirm the proposition that the “incorporation” of a provi­
sion of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment
does not, in itself, mean the provision must have precisely
the same meaning in both contexts.
It is true, as well, that during the 1960’s the Court
decided a number of cases involving procedural rights in
which it treated the Due Process Clause as if it trans­
planted language from the Bill of Rights into the Four­
teenth Amendment. See, e.g., Benton v. Maryland, 395
U. S. 784, 795 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); Pointer v.
Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 406 (1965) (Confrontation Clause).
“Jot-for-jot” incorporation was the norm in this expansion­
ary era. Yet at least one subsequent opinion suggests that
these precedents require perfect state/federal congruence
only on matters “ ‘at the core’ ” of the relevant constitutional
guarantee. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 37 (1978); see also
id., at 52–53 (Powell, J., dissenting). In my judgment, this
line of cases is best understood as having concluded that, to
ensure a criminal trial satisfies essential standards of

fairness, some procedures should be the same in state and
federal courts: The need for certainty and uniformity is
more pressing, and the margin for error slimmer, when
criminal justice is at issue. That principle has little rele­
vance to the question whether a nonprocedural rule set
forth in the Bill of Rights qualifies as an aspect of the lib­
erty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Notwithstanding some overheated dicta in Malloy, 378
U. S., at 10–11, it is therefore an overstatement to say
that the Court has “abandoned,” ante, at 16, 17 (majority
opinion), 39 (plurality opinion), a “two-track approach to
incorporation,” ante, at 37 (plurality opinion). The Court
moved away from that approach in the area of criminal
procedure. But the Second Amendment differs in funda­
mental respects from its neighboring provisions in the Bill
of Rights, as I shall explain in Part V, infra; and if some
1960’s opinions purported to establish a general method of
incorporation, that hardly binds us in this case. The Court
has not hesitated to cut back on perceived Warren Court
excesses in more areas than I can count.
I do not mean to deny that there can be significant
practical, as well as esthetic, benefits from treating rights
symmetrically with regard to the State and Federal Gov­
ernments. Jot-for-jot incorporation of a provision may
entail greater protection of the right at issue and therefore
greater freedom for those who hold it; jot-for-jot incorpora­
tion may also yield greater clarity about the contours of
the legal rule. See Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356,
384–388 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting); Pointer, 380
U. S., at 413–414 (Goldberg, J., concurring). In a federal­
ist system such as ours, however, this approach can carry
substantial costs. When a federal court insists that state
and local authorities follow its dictates on a matter not
critical to personal liberty or procedural justice, the latter
may be prevented from engaging in the kind of beneficent
“experimentation in things social and economic” that

STEVENS, J., dissenting

ultimately redounds to the benefit of all Americans. New
State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932)
(Brandeis, J., dissenting). The costs of federal courts’
imposing a uniform national standard may be especially
high when the relevant regulatory interests vary signifi­
cantly across localities, and when the ruling implicates the
States’ core police powers.
Furthermore, there is a real risk that, by demanding the
provisions of the Bill of Rights apply identically to the
States, federal courts will cause those provisions to “be
watered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.”
Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 182, n. 21 (1968)
(Harlan, J., dissenting). When one legal standard must
prevail across dozens of jurisdictions with disparate needs
and customs, courts will often settle on a relaxed stan­
dard. This watering-down risk is particularly acute when
we move beyond the narrow realm of criminal procedure
and into the relatively vast domain of substantive rights.
So long as the requirements of fundamental fairness are
always and everywhere respected, it is not clear that
greater liberty results from the jot-for-jot application of a
provision of the Bill of Rights to the States. Indeed, it is
far from clear that proponents of an individual right to
keep and bear arms ought to celebrate today’s decision.13
——————
13 The vast majority of States already recognize a right to keep and
bear arms in their own constitutions, see Volokh, State Constitutional
Rights to Keep and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 191 (2006)
(cataloguing provisions); Brief for Petitioners 69 (observing that
“[t]hese Second Amendment analogs are effective and consequential”),
but the States vary widely in their regulatory schemes, their traditions
and cultures of firearm use, and their problems relating to gun vio­
lence. If federal and state courts must harmonize their review of gun­
control laws under the Second Amendment, the resulting jurisprudence
may prove significantly more deferential to those laws than the status
quo ante. Once it has been established that a single legal standard
must govern nationwide, federal courts will face a profound pressure to
reconcile that standard with the diverse interests of the States and

II
So far, I have explained that substantive due process
analysis generally requires us to consider the term “lib­
erty” in the Fourteenth Amendment, and that this inquiry
may be informed by but does not depend upon the content
of the Bill of Rights. How should a court go about the
analysis, then? Our precedents have established, not an
exact methodology, but rather a framework for decision­
making. In this respect, too, the Court’s narrative fails to
capture the continuity and flexibility in our doctrine.
The basic inquiry was described by Justice Cardozo
more than 70 years ago. When confronted with a substan­
tive due process claim, we must ask whether the allegedly
unlawful practice violates values “implicit in the concept
of ordered liberty.” Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319,
325 (1937).14 If the practice in question lacks any “oppres­
sive and arbitrary” character, if judicial enforcement of the
asserted right would not materially contribute to “a fair
and enlightened system of justice,” then the claim is un­

their long history of regulating in this sensitive area. Cf. Williams, 399 

U. S., at 129–130 (Harlan, J., concurring in result) (noting “ ‘backlash’ ”
potential of jot-for-jot incorporation); Grant, Felix Frankfurter: A
Dissenting Opinion, 12 UCLA L. Rev. 1013, 1038 (1965) (“If the Court
will not reduce the requirements of the fourteenth amendment below
the federal gloss that now overlays the Bill of Rights, then it will have
to reduce that gloss to the point where the states can live with it”).
Amici argue persuasively that, post-“incorporation,” federal courts will
have little choice but to fix a highly flexible standard of review if they
are to avoid leaving federalism and the separation of powers—not to
mention gun policy—in shambles. See Brief for Brady Center to
Prevent Gun Violence et al. as Amici Curiae (hereinafter Brady Center
Brief).
14 Justice Cardozo’s test itself built upon an older line of decisions.
See, e.g., Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 237 (1897)
(discussing “limitations on [state] power, which grow out of the essen­
tial nature of all free governments [and] implied reservations of indi­
vidual rights, . . . and which are respected by all governments entitled
to the name” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

suitable for substantive due process protection. Id., at
327, 325. Implicit in Justice Cardozo’s test is a recognition
that the postulates of liberty have a universal character.
Liberty claims that are inseparable from the customs that
prevail in a certain region, the idiosyncratic expectations
of a certain group, or the personal preferences of their
champions, may be valid claims in some sense; but they
are not of constitutional stature. Whether conceptualized
as a “rational continuum” of legal precepts, Poe, 367 U. S.,
at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting), or a seamless web of moral
commitments, the rights embraced by the liberty clause
transcend the local and the particular.
Justice Cardozo’s test undeniably requires judges to
apply their own reasoned judgment, but that does not
mean it involves an exercise in abstract philosophy. In
addition to other constraints I will soon discuss, see Part
III, infra, historical and empirical data of various kinds
ground the analysis. Textual commitments laid down
elsewhere in the Constitution, judicial precedents, English
common law, legislative and social facts, scientific and
professional developments, practices of other civilized
societies,15 and, above all else, the “ ‘traditions and con­
science of our people,’ ” Palko, 302 U. S., at 325 (quoting
Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934)), are
critical variables. They can provide evidence about which
rights really are vital to ordered liberty, as well as a spur
to judicial action.
The Court errs both in its interpretation of Palko and in
its suggestion that later cases rendered Palko’s methodol­
ogy defunct. Echoing Duncan, the Court advises that
Justice Cardozo’s test will not be satisfied “ ‘if a civilized
system could be imagined that would not accord the par­

711, and n. 8.

ticular protection.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting 391 U. S., at 149,
n. 14). Palko does contain some language that could be
read to set an inordinate bar to substantive due process
recognition, reserving it for practices without which “nei­
ther liberty nor justice would exist.” 302 U. S., at 326.
But in view of Justice Cardozo’s broader analysis, as well
as the numerous cases that have upheld liberty claims
under the Palko standard, such readings are plainly over­
readings. We have never applied Palko in such a draco­
nian manner.
Nor, as the Court intimates, see ante, at 16, did Duncan
mark an irreparable break from Palko, swapping out
liberty for history. Duncan limited its discussion to “par­
ticular procedural safeguard[s]” in the Bill of Rights relat­
ing to “criminal processes,” 391 U. S., at 149, n. 14; it did
not purport to set a standard for other types of liberty
interests. Even with regard to procedural safeguards,
Duncan did not jettison the Palko test so much as refine it:
The judge is still tasked with evaluating whether a prac­
tice “is fundamental . . . to ordered liberty,” within the
context of the “Anglo-American” system. Duncan, 391
U. S., at 149–150, n. 14. Several of our most important
recent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive
due process analysis—from which, once again, “incorpora­
tion” analysis derives—must not be wholly backward
looking. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 572
(2003) (“[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but
not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due
process inquiry” (internal quotation marks omitted));

odology that “consult[s] the most specific tradition avail­
able”); see also post, at 6–7 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (ex­
plaining that post-Duncan “incorporation” cases continued

to rely on more than history).16
The Court’s flight from Palko leaves its analysis, careful
and scholarly though it is, much too narrow to provide a
satisfying answer to this case. The Court hinges its entire
decision on one mode of intellectual history, culling se­
lected pronouncements and enactments from the 18th and
19th centuries to ascertain what Americans thought about
firearms. Relying on Duncan and Glucksberg, the plural­
ity suggests that only interests that have proved “funda­
mental from an American perspective,” ante, at 37, 44, or
“ ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,’ ”
ante, at 19 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), to the
Court’s satisfaction, may qualify for incorporation into the
Fourteenth Amendment. To the extent the Court’s opin­
ion could be read to imply that the historical pedigree of a
right is the exclusive or dispositive determinant of its
status under the Due Process Clause, the opinion is seri­
ously mistaken.
A rigid historical test is inappropriate in this case, most
basically, because our substantive due process doctrine
has never evaluated substantive rights in purely, or even
predominantly, historical terms. When the Court applied
many of the procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights to
the States in the 1960’s, it often asked whether the guar­
antee in question was “fundamental in the context of the
criminal processes maintained by the American States.”17
——————
16 I

acknowledge that some have read the Court’s opinion in Glucks­
berg as an attempt to move substantive due process analysis, for all
purposes, toward an exclusively historical methodology—and thereby to
debilitate the doctrine. If that were ever Glucksberg’s aspiration,
Lawrence plainly renounced it. As between Glucksberg and Lawrence, I
have little doubt which will prove the more enduring precedent.
17 The Court almost never asked whether the guarantee in question
was deeply rooted in founding-era practice. See Brief for Respondent
City of Chicago et al. 31, n. 17 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents’
Brief) (noting that only two opinions extensively discussed such his­
tory).

Duncan, 391 U. S., at 150, n. 14. That inquiry could ex­
tend back through time, but it was focused not so much on
historical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional
significance within the States’ regimes. This contextual­
ized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any
given trial-type procedure means little in the abstract. It
is only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes
with other procedures and practices in a criminal justice
system that its relationship to “liberty” and “due process”
can be determined.
Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to
recognize rights distinct from the trial context—rights
relating to the primary conduct of free individuals—
Justice Cardozo’s test has been our guide. The right to
free speech, for instance, has been safeguarded from state
infringement not because the States have always honored
it, but because it is “essential to free government” and “to
the maintenance of democratic institutions”—that is,
because the right to free speech is implicit in the concept
of ordered liberty. Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 95,
96 (1940); see also, e.g., Loving, 388 U. S., at 12 (discuss­
ing right to marry person of another race); Mapp v. Ohio,

free from arbitrary intrusion by police); Schneider v. State
(Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 161 (1939) (discussing
right to distribute printed matter).18 While the verbal
formula has varied, the Court has largely been consistent
in its liberty-based approach to substantive interests

us indisputably concerns such an interest, the answer
cannot be found in a granular inspection of state constitu­
tions or congressional debates.
More fundamentally, a rigid historical methodology is
unfaithful to the Constitution’s command. For if it were
really the case that the Fourteenth Amendment’s guaran­
tee of liberty embraces only those rights “so rooted in our
history, tradition, and practice as to require special protec­
tion,” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721, n. 17, then the guar­
antee would serve little function, save to ratify those
rights that state actors have already been according the
most extensive protection.19 Cf. Duncan, 391 U. S., at 183
(Harlan, J., dissenting) (critiquing “circular[ity]” of his­
toricized test for incorporation). That approach is unfaith­
ful to the expansive principle Americans laid down when
they ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and to the level
of generality they chose when they crafted its language; it
promises an objectivity it cannot deliver and masks the
value judgments that pervade any analysis of what cus­
toms, defined in what manner, are sufficiently “ ‘rooted’ ”;
it countenances the most revolting injustices in the name
of continuity,20 for we must never forget that not only
slavery but also the subjugation of women and other rank
forms of discrimination are part of our history; and it

ment is not merely preservative in nature but rather is a
“dynamic concept.” Stevens, The Bill of Rights: A Century

mism provides a central means through which the Fram­
ers enabled the Constitution to “endure for ages to come,”
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819), a cen­
tral example of how they “wisely spoke in general lan­

environment in which they would live,” Rehnquist, The
Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Tex. L. Rev. 693, 694

interpretation of “liberty” to historical sentiment has
turned his back on a task the Constitution assigned to him
and drained the document of its intended vitality.22

21 JUSTICE

KENNEDY has made the point movingly:
“Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the
Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the compo­

specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times
can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws
once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the
Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its
principles in their own search for greater freedom.” Lawrence, 539
U. S., at 578–579.
22 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion, I emphatically do not
believe that “only we judges” can interpret the Fourteenth Amendment,
ante, at 4, or any other constitutional provision. All Americans can; all
Americans should. I emphatically do believe that we judges must
exercise—indeed, cannot help but exercise—our own reasoned judg­
ment in so doing. JUSTICE SCALIA and I are on common ground in
maintaining that courts should be “guided by what the American

At this point a difficult question arises. In considering
such a majestic term as “liberty” and applying it to present
circumstances, how are we to do justice to its urgent call
and its open texture—and to the grant of interpretive
discretion the latter embodies—without injecting excessive
subjectivity or unduly restricting the States’ “broad lati­
tude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems
of vital local concern,” Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 597
(1977)? One part of the answer, already discussed, is that
we must ground the analysis in historical experience and
reasoned judgment, and never on “merely personal and
private notions.” Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 170
(1952). Our precedents place a number of additional
constraints on the decisional process. Although “guide­
posts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered
area are scarce and open-ended,” Collins v. Harker
Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992), significant guideposts
do exist.23

people throughout our history have thought.” Ibid. Where we part
ways is in his view that courts should be guided only by historical
considerations.
There is, moreover, a tension between JUSTICE SCALIA’s concern that
“courts have the last word” on constitutional questions, ante, at 3, n. 2,
on the one hand, and his touting of the Constitution’s Article V amend­
ment process, ante, at 3, on the other. The American people can of
course reverse this Court’s rulings through that same process.
23 In assessing concerns about the “open-ended[ness]” of this area of
law, Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, one does well to keep in view the malle­
ability not only of the Court’s “deeply rooted”/fundamentality standard
but also of substantive due process’ constitutional cousin, “equal
protection” analysis. Substantive due process is sometimes accused of
entailing an insufficiently “restrained methodology.” Glucksberg, 521
U. S., at 721. Yet “the word ‘liberty’ in the Due Process Clause seems to
provide at least as much meaningful guidance as does the word ‘equal’
in the Equal Protection Clause.” Post, The Supreme Court 2002

The most basic is that we have eschewed attempts to
provide any all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of
“liberty.”24 That project is bound to end in failure or
worse. The Framers did not express a clear understand­
ing of the term to guide us, and the now-repudiated
Lochner line of cases attests to the dangers of judicial
overconfidence in using substantive due process to ad­
vance a broad theory of the right or the good. See, e.g.,
Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). In its most
durable precedents, the Court “has not attempted to define
with exactness the liberty . . . guaranteed” by the Four­
teenth Amendment. Meyer, 262 U. S., at 399; see also,
e.g., Bolling, 347 U. S, at 499. By its very nature, the
meaning of liberty cannot be “reduced to any formula; its
content cannot be determined by reference to any code.”
Poe, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).
Yet while “the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Four­
teenth Amendment” is “perhaps not capable of being fully
clarified,” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 722, it is capable of
being refined and delimited. We have insisted that only
certain types of especially significant personal interests
may qualify for especially heightened protection. Ever
since “the deviant economic due process cases [were]
repudiated,” id., at 761 (Souter, J., concurring in judg­
——————
is that the text of the [Due Process] Clause warrants providing only
protections of process rather than protections of substance,” “it is
striking that even those Justices who are most theoretically opposed to
substantive due process, like Scalia and Rehnquist, are also nonethe­
less enthusiastic about applying the equal protection component of the
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the federal govern­
ment.” Ibid. (citing Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200,
213–231 (1995)).
24 That one eschews a comprehensive theory of liberty does not, pace
JUSTICE SCALIA, mean that one lacks “a coherent theory of the Due
Process Clause,” ante, at 5. It means that one lacks the hubris to adopt
a rigid, context-independent definition of a constitutional guarantee
that was deliberately framed in open-ended terms.

ment), our doctrine has steered away from “laws that
touch economic problems, business affairs, or social condi­
tions,” Griswold, 381 U. S., at 482, and has instead cen­
tered on “matters relating to marriage, procreation, con­
traception, family relationships, and child rearing and
education,” Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 713 (1976).
These categories are not exclusive. Government action
that shocks the conscience, pointlessly infringes settled
expectations, trespasses into sensitive private realms or
life choices without adequate justification, perpetrates
gross injustice, or simply lacks a rational basis will always
be vulnerable to judicial invalidation. Nor does the fact
that an asserted right falls within one of these categories
end the inquiry. More fundamental rights may receive
more robust judicial protection, but the strength of the
individual’s liberty interests and the State’s regulatory
interests must always be assessed and compared. No
right is absolute.
Rather than seek a categorical understanding of the
liberty clause, our precedents have thus elucidated a
conceptual core. The clause safeguards, most basically,
“the ability independently to define one’s identity,” Roberts
v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 619 (1984), “the
individual’s right to make certain unusually important
decisions that will affect his own, or his family’s, destiny,”
Fitzgerald, 523 F. 2d, at 719, and the right to be respected
as a human being. Self-determination, bodily integrity,
freedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political
equality, dignity and respect—these are the central values
we have found implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.
Another key constraint on substantive due process
analysis is respect for the democratic process. If a particu­
lar liberty interest is already being given careful consid­
eration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the
States, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.
When the Court declined to establish a general right to


24

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

physician-assisted suicide, for example, it did so in part
because “the States [were] currently engaged in serious,
thoughtful examinations of physician-assisted suicide and
other similar issues,” rendering judicial intervention both
less necessary and potentially more disruptive. Glucks­
berg, 521 U. S., at 719, 735. Conversely, we have long
appreciated that more “searching” judicial review may be
justified when the rights of “discrete and insular minori­
ties”—groups that may face systematic barriers in the
political system—are at stake. United States v. Carolene
Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). Courts have
a “comparative . . . advantage” over the elected branches
on a limited, but significant, range of legal matters. Post,
at 8.
Recognizing a new liberty right is a momentous step. It
takes that right, to a considerable extent, “outside the
arena of public debate and legislative action.” Glucksberg,
521 U. S., at 720. Sometimes that momentous step must
be taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dig­
nity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and
demand a baseline level of protection. But sensitivity to
the interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and
the practical realities of contemporary society provides an
important tool for guiding judicial discretion.
This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the
need to approach our work with humility and caution.
Because the relevant constitutional language is so “spa­
cious,” Duncan, 391 U. S., at 148, I have emphasized that
“[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to
exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break
new ground in this field.” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125. Many
of my colleagues and predecessors have stressed the same
point, some with great eloquence. See, e.g., Casey, 505
U. S., at 849; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 502–
503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Poe, 367 U. S., at 542–545
(Harlan, J., dissenting); Adamson v. California, 332 U. S.

STEVENS, J., dissenting

46, 68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Historical
study may discipline as well as enrich the analysis. But
the inescapable reality is that no serious theory of Section
1 of the Fourteenth Amendment yields clear answers in
every case, and “[n]o formula could serve as a substitute,
in this area, for judgment and restraint.” Poe, 367 U. S.,
at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).
Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such
restraint. In the substantive due process field as in oth­
ers, the Court has applied both the doctrine of stare de­
cisis—adhering to precedents, respecting reliance inter­
ests, prizing stability and order in the law—and the
common-law method—taking cases and controversies as
they present themselves, proceeding slowly and incremen­
tally, building on what came before. This restrained
methodology was evident even in the heyday of “incorpora­
tion” during the 1960’s. Although it would have been
much easier for the Court simply to declare certain
Amendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States
in toto, the Court took care to parse each Amendment into
its component guarantees, evaluating them one by one.
This piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize
more closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reduc­
ing both the risk and the cost of error.
Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an
abstract plane, the Court has “required in substantive­
due-process cases a ‘careful description’ of the asserted
fundamental liberty interest.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at
721 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993);
Collins, 503 U. S., at 125; Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of
Health, 497 U. S. 261, 277–278 (1990)). And just as we
have required such careful description from the litigants,
we have required of ourselves that we “focus on the allega­
tions in the complaint to determine how petitioner de­
scribes the constitutional right at stake.” Collins, 503
U. S., at 125; see also Stevens, Judicial Restraint, 22 San

Diego L. Rev. 437, 446–448 (1985). This does not mean
that we must define the asserted right at the most specific
level, thereby sapping it of a universal valence and a
moral force it might otherwise have.25 It means, simply,
that we must pay close attention to the precise liberty
interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate.
Our holdings should be similarly tailored. Even if the
most expansive formulation of a claim does not qualify for
substantive due process recognition, particular compo­
nents of the claim might. Just because there may not be a
categorical right to physician-assisted suicide, for exam­
ple, does not “ ‘foreclose the possibility that an individual
plaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose
assistance was sought, could prevail in a more particular­

tutional protection.”
Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 742
(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgments).
As this discussion reflects, to acknowledge that the task
of construing the liberty clause requires judgment is not to
say that it is a license for unbridled judicial lawmaking.
To the contrary, only an honest reckoning with our discre­
tion allows for honest argumentation and meaningful
accountability.

The question in this case, then, is not whether the Sec­
ond Amendment right to keep and bear arms (whatever
that right’s precise contours) applies to the States because
the Amendment has been incorporated into the Four­
teenth Amendment. It has not been. The question,
rather, is whether the particular right asserted by peti­
tioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth
Amendment itself, standing on its own bottom. And to
answer that question, we need to determine, first, the
nature of the right that has been asserted and, second,
whether that right is an aspect of Fourteenth Amendment
“liberty.” Even accepting the Court’s holding in Heller, it
remains entirely possible that the right to keep and bear
arms identified in that opinion is not judicially enforceable
against the States, or that only part of the right is so
enforceable.26 It is likewise possible for the Court to find

26 In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 22),
the Court concluded, over my dissent, that the Second Amendment
confers “an individual right to keep and bear arms” disconnected from
militia service. If that conclusion were wrong, then petitioners’ “incor­
poration” claim clearly would fail, as they would hold no right against
the Federal Government to be free from regulations such as the ones
they challenge. Cf. post, at 8. I do not understand petitioners or any of
their amici to dispute this point. Yet even if Heller had never been
decided—indeed, even if the Second Amendment did not exist—we
would still have an obligation to address petitioners’ Fourteenth

in this case that some part of the Heller right applies to
the States, and then to find in later cases that other parts
of the right also apply, or apply on different terms.
As noted at the outset, the liberty interest petitioners
have asserted is the “right to possess a functional, per­
sonal firearm, including a handgun, within the home.”
Complaint ¶34, App. 23. The city of Chicago allows resi­
dents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are
registered, but it generally prohibits the possession of
handguns, sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and short­
barreled rifles. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–
050 (2009).27 Petitioners’ complaint centered on their
desire to keep a handgun at their domicile—it references
the “home” in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint ¶¶3–
4, 11–30, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19–26—as did
their supporting declarations, see, e.g., App. 34, 36, 40, 43,
49–52, 54–56. Petitioners now frame the question that
confronts us as “[w]hether the Second Amendment right to
keep and bear arms is incorporated as against the States
by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities
or Due Process Clauses.” Brief for Petitioners, p. i. But it
is our duty “to focus on the allegations in the complaint to
determine how petitioner describes the constitutional
right at stake,” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, and the
gravamen of this complaint is plainly an appeal to keep a
handgun or other firearm of one’s choosing in the home.
Petitioners’ framing of their complaint tracks the
Court’s ruling in Heller. The majority opinion contained
some dicta suggesting the possibility of a more expansive

Amendment claim.
27 The village of Oak Park imposes more stringent restrictions that
may raise additional complications. See ante, at 2 (majority opinion)

tional Rifle Association’s challenge to the Oak Park restrictions.

arms-bearing right, one that would travel with the indi­
vidual to an extent into public places, as “in case of con­
frontation.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). But the
Heller plaintiff sought only dispensation to keep an oper­
able firearm in his home for lawful self-defense, see id., at
___ (slip op., at 2, and n. 2), and the Court’s opinion was
bookended by reminders that its holding was limited to
that one issue, id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 64); accord,
ante, at 44 (plurality opinion). The distinction between
the liberty right these petitioners have asserted and the
Second Amendment right identified in Heller is therefore
evanescent. Both are rooted to the home. Moreover, even
if both rights have the logical potential to extend further,
upon “future evaluation,” Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 63), it is incumbent upon us, as federal judges contem­
plating a novel rule that would bind all 50 States, to pro­
ceed cautiously and to decide only what must be decided.
Understood as a plea to keep their preferred type of
firearm in the home, petitioners’ argument has real
force.28 The decision to keep a loaded handgun in the
house is often motivated by the desire to protect life, lib­
erty, and property. It is comparable, in some ways, to
decisions about the education and upbringing of one’s
children. For it is the kind of decision that may have
profound consequences for every member of the family,
and for the world beyond. In considering whether to keep
a handgun, heads of households must ask themselves
whether the desired safety benefits outweigh the risks of
deliberate or accidental misuse that may result in death or
serious injury, not only to residents of the home but to

28 To the extent that petitioners contend the city of Chicago’s registra­
tion requirements for firearm possessors also, and separately, violate
the Constitution, that claim borders on the frivolous. Petitioners make
no effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or
that they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have
asserted.

others as well. Millions of Americans have answered this
question in the affirmative, not infrequently because they
believe they have an inalienable right to do so—because
they consider it an aspect of “the supreme human dignity
of being master of one’s fate rather than a ward of the
State,” Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U. S. 164, 186 (2008)
(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Many such decisions have been
based, in part, on family traditions and deeply held beliefs
that are an aspect of individual autonomy the government
may not control.29
Bolstering petitioners’ claim, our law has long recog­
nized that the home provides a kind of special sanctuary
in modern life. See, e.g., U. S. Const., Amdts. 3, 4; Law­
rence, 539 U. S., at 562, 567; Payton v. New York, 445
U. S. 573, 585–590 (1980); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S.
557, 565–568 (1969); Griswold, 381 U. S., at 484–485.
Consequently, we have long accorded special deference to
the privacy of the home, whether a humble cottage or a
magnificent manse. This veneration of the domestic hark­
ens back to the common law. William Blackstone recog­
nized a “right of habitation,” 4 Commentaries *223, and
opined that “every man’s house is looked upon by the law
to be his castle of defence and asylum,” 3 id., at *288.
Heller carried forward this legacy, observing that “the
need for defense of self, family, and property is most
acute” in one’s abode, and celebrating “the right of law­
abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of
hearth and home.” 554 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 56,
63).
While the individual’s interest in firearm possession is
thus heightened in the home, the State’s corresponding
interest in regulation is somewhat weaker. The State

generally has a lesser basis for regulating private as com­
pared to public acts, and firearms kept inside the home
generally pose a lesser threat to public welfare as com­
pared to firearms taken outside. The historical case for
regulation is likewise stronger outside the home, as many
States have for many years imposed stricter, and less
controversial, restrictions on the carriage of arms than on
their domestic possession. See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at
54) (noting that “the majority of the 19th-century courts to
consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying
concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amend­
ment or state analogues”); English v. State, 35 Tex. 473,
478–479 (1871) (observing that “almost, if not every one of
the States of this Union have [a prohibition on the carry­
ing of deadly weapons] upon their statute books,” and
lambasting claims of a right to carry such weapons as
“little short of ridiculous”); Miller, Guns as Smut: Defend­
ing the Home-Bound Second Amendment, 109 Colum.
L. Rev. 1278, 1321–1336 (2009).
It is significant, as well, that a rule limiting the federal
constitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home
would be less intrusive on state prerogatives and easier to
administer. Having unleashed in Heller a tsunami of legal
uncertainty, and thus litigation,30 and now on the cusp of
imposing a national rule on the States in this area for the
first time in United States history, the Court could at least
moderate the confusion, upheaval, and burden on the
States by adopting a rule that is clearly and tightly

bounded in scope.
In their briefs to this Court, several amici have sought
to bolster petitioners’ claim still further by invoking a
right to individual self-defense.31 As petitioners note, the
Heller majority discussed this subject extensively and
remarked that “[t]he inherent right of self-defense has
been central to the Second Amendment right.” 554 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 56). And it is true that if a State were
to try to deprive its residents of any reasonable means of
defending themselves from imminent physical threats, or
to deny persons any ability to assert self-defense in re­
sponse to criminal prosecution, that might pose a signifi­
cant constitutional problem. The argument that there is a
substantive due process right to be spared such untenable
dilemmas is a serious one.32

Other Fields as Amici Curiae; Brief for International Law Enforcement
Educators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29–45; Brief
for 34 California District Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 12–31.
32 The argument that this Court should establish any such right,
however, faces steep hurdles. All 50 States already recognize self­
defense as a defense to criminal prosecution, see 2 P. Robinson, Crimi­
nal Law Defenses §132, p. 96 (1984 and Supp. 2009), so this is hardly
an interest to which the democratic process has been insensitive. And
the States have always diverged on how exactly to implement this
interest, so there is wide variety across the Nation in the types and
amounts of force that may be used, the necessity of retreat, the rights of
aggressors, the availability of the “castle doctrine,” and so forth. See
Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as Amicus
Curiae 9–21; Brief for American Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 17–19; 2
W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §10.4, pp. 142–160 (2d ed. 2003).
Such variation is presumed to be a healthy part of our federalist
system, as the States and localities select different rules in light of
different priorities, customs, and conditions.
As a historical and theoretical matter, moreover, the legal status of
self-defense is far more complicated than it might first appear. We
have generally understood Fourteenth Amendment “liberty” as some­
thing one holds against direct state interference, whereas a personal
right of self-defense runs primarily against other individuals; absent

STEVENS, J., dissenting

But that is not the case before us. Petitioners have not
asked that we establish a constitutional right to individual
self-defense; neither their pleadings in the District Court
nor their filings in this Court make any such request. Nor
do petitioners contend that the city of Chicago—which,
recall, allows its residents to keep most rifles and shot­
guns, and to keep them loaded—has unduly burdened any
such right. What petitioners have asked is that we “incor­
porate” the Second Amendment and thereby establish a
constitutional entitlement, enforceable against the States,
to keep a handgun in the home.
Of course, owning a handgun may be useful for practic­
ing self-defense. But the right to take a certain type of
action is analytically distinct from the right to acquire and
utilize specific instrumentalities in furtherance of that
action. And while some might favor handguns, it is not
——————
government tyranny, it is only when the state has failed to interfere
with (violent) private conduct that self-help becomes potentially neces­
sary. Moreover, it was a basic tenet of founding-era political philosophy
that, in entering civil society and gaining “the advantages of mutual
commerce” and the protections of the rule of law, one had to relinquish,
to a significant degree, “that wild and savage liberty” one possessed in
the state of nature. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *125; see also, e.g.,
J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §128, pp. 63–64 (J.
Gough ed. 1947) (in state of nature man has power “to do whatever he
thinks fit for the preservation of himself and others,” but this “he gives
up when he joins in a . . . particular political society”); Green v. Biddle,
8 Wheat. 1, 63 (1823) (“It is a trite maxim, that man gives up a part of
his natural liberty when he enters into civil society, as the price of the
blessings of that state: and it may be said, with truth, that this liberty
is well exchanged for the advantages which flow from law and justice”).
Some strains of founding-era thought took a very narrow view of the
right to armed self-defense. See, e.g., Brief of Historians on Early
American Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici
Curiae 6–13 (discussing Whig and Quaker theories). Just because
there may be a natural or common-law right to some measure of self­
defense, it hardly follows that States may not place substantial restric­
tions on its exercise or that this Court should recognize a constitutional
right to the same.


34

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

clear that they are a superior weapon for lawful self­
defense, and nothing in petitioners’ argument turns on
that being the case. The notion that a right of self-defense
implies an auxiliary right to own a certain type of firearm
presupposes not only controversial judgments about the
strength and scope of the (posited) self-defense right, but
also controversial assumptions about the likely effects
of making that type of firearm more broadly available. It
is a very long way from the proposition that the Four­
teenth Amendment protects a basic individual right of
self-defense to the conclusion that a city may not ban
handguns.33
In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in
particular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly
relevant to an assessment of petitioners’ asserted right,
there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case.
The question we must decide is whether the interest in
keeping in the home a firearm of one’s choosing—a hand­
gun, for petitioners—is one that is “comprised within the
term liberty” in the Fourteenth Amendment. Whitney, 274
U. S., at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring).
——————
33 The Second Amendment right identified in Heller is likewise clearly
distinct from a right to protect oneself. In my view, the Court badly
misconstrued the Second Amendment in linking it to the value of
personal self-defense above and beyond the functioning of the state
militias; as enacted, the Second Amendment was concerned with
tyrants and invaders, and paradigmatically with the federal military,
not with criminals and intruders. But even still, the Court made clear
that self-defense plays a limited role in determining the scope and
substance of the Amendment’s guarantee. The Court struck down the
District of Columbia’s handgun ban not because of the utility of hand­
guns for lawful self-defense, but rather because of their popularity for
that purpose. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–58). And the Court’s
common-use gloss on the Second Amendment right, see id., at ___ (slip
op., at 55), as well as its discussion of permissible limitations on the
right, id., at ___ (slip op., at 54–55), had little to do with self-defense.

V
While I agree with the Court that our substantive due
process cases offer a principled basis for holding that
petitioners have a constitutional right to possess a usable
fiream in the home, I am ultimately persuaded that a
better reading of our case law supports the city of Chicago.
I would not foreclose the possibility that a particular
plaintiff—say, an elderly widow who lives in a dangerous
neighborhood and does not have the strength to operate a
long gun—may have a cognizable liberty interest in pos­
sessing a handgun. But I cannot accept petitioners’
broader submission. A number of factors, taken together,
lead me to this conclusion.
First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent rela­
tionship to liberty. Just as they can help homeowners
defend their families and property from intruders, they
can help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent
victims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far
from hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of
our communities. Amici calculate that approximately one
million Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire
in the last decade.34 Urban areas such as Chicago suffer
disproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Hand­
guns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some
homeowners may prefer handguns because of their small
size, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals
will value them for the same reasons. See Heller, 554
U. S., at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 32–33).
In recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more
than four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of

all murders nationwide.35
Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from
particular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides
of the equation. Guns may be useful for self-defense, as
well as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique
potential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to
destabilize ordered liberty. Your interest in keeping and
bearing a certain firearm may diminish my interest in
being and feeling safe from armed violence. And while
granting you the right to own a handgun might make you
safer on any given day—assuming the handgun’s marginal
contribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contri­
bution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mis­
chief—it may make you and the community you live in
less safe overall, owing to the increased number of hand­
guns in circulation. It is at least reasonable for a democ­
ratically elected legislature to take such concerns into
account in considering what sorts of regulations would
best serve the public welfare.
The practical impact of various gun-control measures
may be highly controversial, but this basic insight should
not be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive
threat to the social order—and that reasonable restric­
tions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable bur­
den on one’s personal liberty—is as old as the Republic.
As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a
foundational premise of modern government that the
State holds a monopoly on legitimate violence: “A basic
step in organizing a civilized society is to take [the] sword
out of private hands and turn it over to an organized
government, acting on behalf of all the people.” Robertson

v. United States ex rel. Watson, ante, at ___ (slip op., at 11)
(dissenting opinion). The same holds true for the hand­
gun. The power a man has in the state of nature “of doing
whatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself
and the rest of mankind, he gives up,” to a significant
extent, “to be regulated by laws made by the society.”
J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §129, p. 64
(J. Gough ed. 1947).
Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and
bear arms to the home complicates the analysis but does
not dislodge this conclusion. Even though the Court has
long afforded special solicitude for the privacy of the home,
we have never understood that principle to “infring[e]
upon” the authority of the States to proscribe certain
inherently dangerous items, for “[i]n such cases, compel­
ling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the indi­
vidual to possess those materials.” Stanley, 394 U. S., at
568, n. 11. And, of course, guns that start out in the home
may not stay in the home. Even if the government has a
weaker basis for restricting domestic possession of fire­
arms as compared to public carriage—and even if a blan­
ket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might
therefore be unconstitutional—the line between the two is
a porous one. A state or local legislature may determine
that a prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon
is necessary to police that line.
Second, the right to possess a firearm of one’s choosing
is different in kind from the liberty interests we have
recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the
plethora of substantive due process cases that have been
decided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none
that holds, states, or even suggests that the term “liberty”
encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense
or a right to keep and bear arms. I do not doubt for a
moment that many Americans feel deeply passionate
about firearms, and see them as critical to their way of life

STEVENS, J., dissenting

as well as to their security. Nevertheless, it does not
appear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or
any particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of
autonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace
offers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imper­
fect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their amici
make such a contention. Petitioners’ claim is not the kind
of substantive interest, accordingly, on which a uniform,
judicially enforced national standard is presumptively
appropriate.36
Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue
may be better viewed as a property right. Petitioners wish
to acquire certain types of firearms, or to keep certain
firearms they have previously acquired. Interests in the
possession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as
property interests subject to definition and regulation by
the States. Cf. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v.
Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 560 U. S. ___,

ally speaking, state law defines property interests”).

36 JUSTICE

SCALIA worries that there is no “objective” way to decide
what is essential to a “liberty-filled” existence: Better, then, to ignore
such messy considerations as how an interest actually affects people’s
lives. Ante, at 10. Both the constitutional text and our cases use the
term “liberty,” however, and liberty is not a purely objective concept.
Substantive due process analysis does not require any “political”
judgment, ibid. It does require some amount of practical and norma­
tive judgment. The only way to assess what is essential to fulfilling the
Constitution’s guarantee of “liberty,” in the present day, is to provide
reasons that apply to the present day. I have provided many; JUSTICE
SCALIA and the Court have provided virtually none.
JUSTICE SCALIA also misstates my argument when he refers to “the
right to keep and bear arms,” without qualification. Ante, at 9. That is
what the Second Amendment protects against Federal Government
infringement. I have taken pains to show why the Fourteenth Amend­
ment liberty interest asserted by petitioners—the interest in keeping a
firearm of one’s choosing in the home—is not necessarily coextensive
with the Second Amendment right.

STEVENS, J., dissenting

Under that tradition, Chicago’s ordinance is unexcep­
tional.37
The liberty interest asserted by petitioners is also dis­
similar from those we have recognized in its capacity to
undermine the security of others. To be sure, some of the
Bill of Rights’ procedural guarantees may place “restric­
tions on law enforcement” that have “controversial public
safety implications.” Ante, at 36 (plurality opinion); see
also ante, at 9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But those implica­
tions are generally quite attenuated. A defendant’s invo­
cation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness,
or to exclude certain evidence cannot directly cause any
threat. The defendant’s liberty interest is constrained by
(and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process.
The link between handgun ownership and public safety is
much tighter. The handgun is itself a tool for crime; the
handgun’s bullets are the violence.
Similarly, it is undeniable that some may take profound
offense at a remark made by the soapbox speaker, the
practices of another religion, or a gay couple’s choice to
have intimate relations. But that offense is moral, psycho­

37 It has not escaped my attention that the Due Process Clause refers
to “property” as well as “liberty.” Cf. ante, at 2, n. 1, 9–10, n. 6 (opinion
of SCALIA, J.). Indeed, in Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977)
(plurality opinion), I alone viewed “the critical question” as “whether
East Cleveland’s housing ordinance [was] a permissible restriction on
appellant’s right to use her own property as she sees fit,” id., at 513
(opinion concurring in judgment). In that case, unlike in this case, the
asserted property right was coextensive with a right to organize one’s
family life, and I could find “no precedent” for the ordinance at issue,
which “exclude[d] any of an owner’s relatives from the group of persons
who may occupy his residence on a permanent basis.” Id., at 520. I am
open to property claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. This case
just involves a weak one. And ever since the Court “incorporated” the
more specific property protections of the Takings Clause in 1897, see
Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S. 226, substantive due process doctrine
has focused on liberty.

rights-bearers do not actually threaten the physical safety
of any other person.38 Firearms may be used to kill an­
other person. If a legislature’s response to dangerous
weapons ends up impinging upon the liberty of any indi­
viduals in pursuit of the greater good, it invariably does so
on the basis of more than the majority’s “ ‘own moral
code,’ ” Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 571 (quoting Casey, 505
U. S., at 850). While specific policies may of course be
misguided, gun control is an area in which it “is quite
wrong . . . to assume that regulation and liberty occupy
mutually exclusive zones—that as one expands, the other
must contract.” Stevens, 41 U. Miami L. Rev., at 280.
Third, the experience of other advanced democracies,
including those that share our British heritage, undercuts
the notion that an expansive right to keep and bear arms
is intrinsic to ordered liberty. Many of these countries
place restrictions on the possession, use, and carriage of
firearms far more onerous than the restrictions found in
this Nation. See Municipal Respondents’ Brief 21–23
(discussing laws of England, Canada, Australia, Japan,
Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand). That
the United States is an international outlier in the per­
missiveness of its approach to guns does not suggest that
our laws are bad laws. It does suggest that this Court
may not need to assume responsibility for making our
laws still more permissive.
Admittedly, these other countries differ from ours in
many relevant respects, including their problems with
violent crime and the traditional role that firearms have
played in their societies. But they are not so different
from the United States that we ought to dismiss their
experience entirely. Cf. ante, at 34–35 (plurality opinion);

oldest allies have almost uniformly found it appropriate to
regulate firearms extensively tends to weaken petitioners’
submission that the right to possess a gun of one’s choos­
ing is fundamental to a life of liberty. While the “Ameri­
can perspective” must always be our focus, ante, at 37, 44
(plurality opinion), it is silly—indeed, arrogant—to think
we have nothing to learn about liberty from the billions of
people beyond our borders.
Fourth, the Second Amendment differs in kind from the
Amendments that surround it, with the consequence that
its inclusion in the Bill of Rights is not merely unhelpful
but positively harmful to petitioners’ claim. Generally, the
inclusion of a liberty interest in the Bill of Rights points
toward the conclusion that it is of fundamental significance
and ought to be enforceable against the States. But the
Second Amendment plays a peculiar role within the Bill, as
announced by its peculiar opening clause.39 Even accept­
ing the Heller Court’s view that the Amendment protects
an individual right to keep and bear arms disconnected
from militia service, it remains undeniable that “the pur­
pose for which the right was codified” was “to prevent
elimination of the militia.” Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 26); see also United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174,
178 (1939) (Second Amendment was enacted “[w]ith obvi­
ous purpose to assure the continuation and render possible
the effectiveness of [militia] forces”). It was the States, not
private persons, on whose immediate behalf the Second
Amendment was adopted. Notwithstanding the Heller
Court’s efforts to write the Second Amendment’s preamble
out of the Constitution, the Amendment still serves the
structural function of protecting the States from en­
croachment by an overreaching Federal Government.
——————
39 The Second Amendment provides: “A well regulated Militia, being
necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep
and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

The Second Amendment, in other words, “is a federal­
ism provision,” Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow,
542 U. S. 1, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg­
ment). It is directed at preserving the autonomy of the
sovereign States, and its logic therefore “resists” incorpo­
ration by a federal court against the States. Ibid. No one
suggests that the Tenth Amendment, which provides that
powers not given to the Federal Government remain with
“the States,” applies to the States; such a reading would
border on incoherent, given that the Tenth Amendment
exists (in significant part) to safeguard the vitality of state
governance. The Second Amendment is no different.40
The Court is surely correct that Americans’ conceptions
of the Second Amendment right evolved over time in a
more individualistic direction; that Members of the Recon­
struction Congress were urgently concerned about the
safety of the newly freed slaves; and that some Members
believed that, following ratification of the Fourteenth
Amendment, the Second Amendment would apply to the
States. But it is a giant leap from these data points to the
conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment “incorporated”
the Second Amendment as a matter of original meaning or
postenactment interpretation. Consider, for example, that
the text of the Fourteenth Amendment says nothing about
the Second Amendment or firearms; that there is substan­
tial evidence to suggest that, when the Reconstruction
Congress enacted measures to ensure newly freed slaves

40 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion, this point is perfectly
compatible with my opinion for the Court in Elk Grove Unified School
Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1 (2004). Cf. ante, at 11. Like the Court
itself, I have never agreed with JUSTICE THOMAS’ view that the Estab­
lishment Clause is a federalism provision. But I agree with his under­
lying logic: If a clause in the Bill of Rights exists to safeguard federal­
ism interests, then it makes little sense to “incorporate” it. JUSTICE
SCALIA’s further suggestion that I ought to have revisited the Estab­
lishment Clause debate in this opinion, ibid., is simply bizarre.

and Union sympathizers in the South enjoyed the right to
possess firearms, it was motivated by antidiscrimination
and equality concerns rather than arms-bearing concerns
per se;41 that many contemporaneous courts and commen­
tators did not understand the Fourteenth Amendment to
have had an “incorporating” effect; and that the States
heavily regulated the right to keep and bear arms both
before and after the Amendment’s passage. The Court’s
narrative largely elides these facts. The complications
they raise show why even the most dogged historical
inquiry into the “fundamentality” of the Second Amend­
ment right (or any other) necessarily entails judicial
judgment—and therefore judicial discretion—every step of
the way.
I accept that the evolution in Americans’ understanding
of the Second Amendment may help shed light on the
question whether a right to keep and bear arms is com­
prised within Fourteenth Amendment “liberty.” But the
reasons that motivated the Framers to protect the ability
of militiamen to keep muskets available for military use
when our Nation was in its infancy, or that motivated the
Reconstruction Congress to extend full citizenship to the
freedmen in the wake of the Civil War, have only a limited
bearing on the question that confronts the homeowner in a
crime-infested metropolis today. The many episodes of

the Reconstruction-era evidence shows the right to bear arms was
regarded as “a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be
ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.”
Ante, at 33. That may be so, but it does not resolve the question
whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause was origi­
nally understood to encompass a right to keep and bear arms, or
whether it ought to be so construed now.

brutal violence against African-Americans that blight our
Nation’s history, see ante, at 23–29 (majority opinion);
ante, at 41–44, 53–55 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), do not suggest that every Ameri­
can must be allowed to own whatever type of firearm he or
she desires—just that no group of Americans should be
systematically and discriminatorily disarmed and left to
the mercy of racial terrorists. And the fact that some
Americans may have thought or hoped that the Four­
teenth Amendment would nationalize the Second Amend­
ment hardly suffices to justify the conclusion that it did.
Fifth, although it may be true that Americans’ interest
in firearm possession and state-law recognition of that
interest are “deeply rooted” in some important senses,
ante, at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted), it is
equally true that the States have a long and unbroken
history of regulating firearms. The idea that States may
place substantial restrictions on the right to keep and bear
arms short of complete disarmament is, in fact, far more
entrenched than the notion that the Federal Constitution
protects any such right. Federalism is a far “older and
more deeply rooted tradition than is a right to carry,” or to
own, “any particular kind of weapon.” 567 F. 3d 856, 860
(CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C. J.).
From the early days of the Republic, through the Recon­
struction era, to the present day, States and municipali­
ties have placed extensive licensing requirements on
firearm acquisition, restricted the public carriage of weap­
ons, and banned altogether the possession of especially
dangerous weapons, including handguns. See Heller, 554

forget that this Court did not recognize any non-militia­
related interests under the Second Amendment until two
Terms ago, in Heller. Petitioners do not dispute the city of
Chicago’s observation that “[n]o other substantive Bill of

sively” as the right to keep and bear arms. Municipal

am unclear what the plurality means when it refers to “the pau­
city of precedent sustaining bans comparable to those at issue here.”
Ante, at 39. There is only one ban at issue here—the city of Chicago’s
handgun prohibition—and the municipal respondents cite far more
than “one case,” ibid., from the post-Reconstruction period. See Mu­
nicipal Respondents’ Brief 24–30. The evidence adduced by respon­
dents and their amici easily establishes their contentions that the
“consensus in States that recognize a firearms right is that arms
possession, even in the home, is . . . subject to interest-balancing,” id.,
at 24; and that the practice of “[b]anning weapons routinely used for
self-defense,” when deemed “necessary for the public welfare,” “has
ample historical pedigree,” id., at 28. Petitioners do not even try to
challenge these contentions.
43 I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that a history of regulation hardly
proves a right is not “of fundamental character.” Ante, at 12. An
unbroken history of extremely intensive, carefully considered regula­
tion does, however, tend to suggest that it is not.

core of the States’ police powers. Our precedent is crystal­
clear on this latter point. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon,
546 U. S. 243, 270 (2006) (“[T]he structure and limitations
of federalism . . . allow the States great latitude under
their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the

(internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v.
Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000) (“[W]e can think of no
better example of the police power, which the Founders
denied the National Government and reposed in the

remain that the preamble envisions an active state role in overseeing
how the right to keep and bear arms is utilized, and in ensuring that it
is channeled toward productive ends.

so heavy a toll in terms of state sovereignty.
Finally, even apart from the States’ long history of
firearms regulation and its location at the core of their
police powers, this is a quintessential area in which feder­
alism ought to be allowed to flourish without this Court’s
meddling. Whether or not we can assert a plausible con­
stitutional basis for intervening, there are powerful rea­
sons why we should not do so.
Across the Nation, States and localities vary signifi­
cantly in the patterns and problems of gun violence they
face, as well as in the traditions and cultures of lawful gun
use they claim. Cf. post, at 16–17. The city of Chicago, for
example, faces a pressing challenge in combating criminal
street gangs. Most rural areas do not. The city of Chicago
has a high population density, which increases the poten­
tial for a gunman to inflict mass terror and casualties.
Most rural areas do not.45 The city of Chicago offers little
in the way of hunting opportunities. Residents of rural
communities are, one presumes, much more likely to stock
the dinner table with game they have personally felled.
Given that relevant background conditions diverge so
much across jurisdictions, the Court ought to pay particu­
lar heed to state and local legislatures’ “right to experi­
ment.” New State Ice, 285 U. S., at 311 (Brandeis, J.,
dissenting). So long as the regulatory measures they have
chosen are not “arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable,” we
should be allowing them to “try novel social and economic”
policies. Ibid. It “is more in keeping . . . with our status
as a court in a federal system,” under these circumstances,
“to avoid imposing a single solution . . . from the top
down.” Smith v. Robbins, 528 U. S. 259, 275 (2000).
——————
45 Cf. Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19) (BREYER, J., dissenting)
(detailing evidence showing that a “disproportionate amount of violent
and property crimes occur in urban areas, and urban criminals are
more likely than other offenders to use a firearm during the commis­
sion of a violent crime”).


48

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

It is all the more unwise for this Court to limit experi­
mentation in an area “where the best solution is far from
clear.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 581 (1995)
(KENNEDY, J., concurring). Few issues of public policy are
subject to such intensive and rapidly developing empirical
controversy as gun control. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 20–25) (BREYER, J., dissenting). Chicago’s
handgun ban, in itself, has divided researchers. Compare
Brief for Professors of Criminal Justice as Amici Curiae
(arguing that ordinance has been effective at reducing gun
violence), with Brief for International Law Enforcement
Educators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae
17–26 (arguing that ordinance has been a failure).46 Of
course, on some matters the Constitution requires that we
ignore such pragmatic considerations. But the Constitu­
tion’s text, history, and structure are not so clear on the
matter before us—as evidenced by the groundbreaking
nature of today’s fractured decision—and this Court lacks
both the technical capacity and the localized expertise to
assess “the wisdom, need, and propriety” of most gun­
control measures. Griswold, 381 U. S., at 482.47
——————
46 The fact that Chicago’s handgun murder rate may have “actually
increased since the ban was enacted,” ante, at 2 (majority opinion),
means virtually nothing in itself. Countless factors unrelated to the
policy may have contributed to that trend. Without a sophisticated
regression analysis, we cannot even begin to speculate as to the efficacy
or effects of the handgun ban. Even with such an analysis, we could
never be certain as to the determinants of the city’s murder rate.
47 In some sense, it is no doubt true that the “best” solution is elusive
for many “serious social problems.” Ante, at 12 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).
Yet few social problems have raised such heated empirical controversy
as the problem of gun violence. And few, if any, of the liberty interests
we have recognized under the Due Process Clause have raised as many
complications for judicial oversight as the interest that is recognized
today. See post, at 11–16.
I agree with the plurality that for a right to be eligible for substantive
due process recognition, there need not be “a ‘popular consensus’ that
the right is fundamental.” Ante, at 42. In our remarkably diverse,

STEVENS, J., dissenting

Nor will the Court’s intervention bring any clarity to
this enormously complex area of law. Quite to the con­
trary, today’s decision invites an avalanche of litigation
that could mire the federal courts in fine-grained determi­
nations about which state and local regulations comport
with the Heller right—the precise contours of which are
far from pellucid—under a standard of review we have not
even established. See post, at 12–15. The plurality’s
“assuranc[e]” that “incorporation does not imperil every
law regulating firearms,” ante, at 40, provides only modest
comfort. For it is also an admission of just how many
different types of regulations are potentially implicated by
today’s ruling, and of just how ad hoc the Court’s initial
attempt to draw distinctions among them was in Heller.
The practical significance of the proposition that “the
Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States,”
ante, at 1 (majority opinion), remains to be worked out by
this Court over many, many years.
Furthermore, and critically, the Court’s imposition of a
national standard is still more unwise because the elected
branches have shown themselves to be perfectly capable of
safeguarding the interest in keeping and bearing arms.
The strength of a liberty claim must be assessed in con­
nection with its status in the democratic process. And in
this case, no one disputes “that opponents of [gun] control
have considerable political power and do not seem to be at
a systematic disadvantage in the democratic process,” or
that “the widespread commitment to an individual right to
own guns . . . operates as a safeguard against excessive or

pluralistic society, there will almost never be such uniformity of opin­

with the Court that the amicus brief filed in this case by numerous

is puzzling that so many state lawmakers have asked us to limit their
option to regulate a dangerous item. Cf. post, at 9–10.

Sunstein, Second
Amendment Minimalism: Heller as Griswold, 122 Harv.
L. Rev. 246, 260 (2008). Indeed, there is a good deal of
evidence to suggest that, if anything, American lawmakers
tend to underregulate guns, relative to the policy views
expressed by majorities in opinion polls. See K. Goss,
Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in
America 6 (2006). If a particular State or locality has
enacted some “improvident” gun-control measures, as
petitioners believe Chicago has done, there is no apparent
reason to infer that the mistake will not “eventually be
rectified by the democratic process.” Vance v. Bradley, 440
U. S. 93, 97 (1979).
This is not a case, then, that involves a “special condi­
tion” that “may call for a correspondingly more searching
judicial inquiry.” Carolene Products, 304 U. S., at 153,

ted to their views represent a group or a claim that is
liable to receive unfair treatment at the hands of the
majority. On the contrary, petitioners’ views are sup­
ported by powerful participants in the legislative process.
Petitioners have given us no reason to believe that the
interest in keeping and bearing arms entails any special
need for judicial lawmaking, or that federal judges are
more qualified to craft appropriate rules than the people’s
elected representatives. Having failed to show why their
asserted interest is intrinsic to the concept of ordered
liberty or vulnerable to maltreatment in the political

of Chicago.
Lochner, 198 U. S., at 76 (Holmes, J.,
dissenting).
VI
The preceding sections have already addressed many of
the points made by JUSTICE SCALIA in his concurrence.
But in light of that opinion’s fixation on this one, it is
appropriate to say a few words about JUSTICE SCALIA’s
broader claim: that his preferred method of substantive
due process analysis, a method “that makes the traditions
of our people paramount,” ante, at 1, is both more re­
strained and more facilitative of democracy than the
method I have outlined. Colorful as it is, JUSTICE SCALIA’s
critique does not have nearly as much force as does his
rhetoric. His theory of substantive due process, moreover,
comes with its own profound difficulties.
Although JUSTICE SCALIA aspires to an “objective,”
“neutral” method of substantive due process analysis,
ante, at 10, his actual method is nothing of the sort. Un­
der the “historically focused” approach he advocates, ante,
at 13, numerous threshold questions arise before one ever
gets to the history. At what level of generality should one
frame the liberty interest in question? See n. 25, supra.
What does it mean for a right to be “ ‘deeply rooted in this
Nation’s history and tradition,’ ” ante, at 3 (quoting
Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721)? By what standard will
that proposition be tested? Which types of sources will
count, and how will those sources be weighed and aggre­
gated? There is no objective, neutral answer to these
questions. There is not even a theory—at least, JUSTICE
SCALIA provides none—of how to go about answering
them.
Nor is there any escaping Palko, it seems. To qualify for
substantive due process protection, JUSTICE SCALIA has
stated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply


52

MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

rooted in American tradition, “but it must also be implicit
in the concept of ordered liberty.” Lawrence, 539 U. S., at
593, n. 3 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Applying the latter, Palko-derived half of that
test requires precisely the sort of reasoned judgment—the
same multifaceted evaluation of the right’s contours and
consequences—that JUSTICE SCALIA mocks in his concur­
rence today.
So does applying the first half. It is hardly a novel
insight that history is not an objective science, and that its
use can therefore “point in any direction the judges favor,”
ante, at 14 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet 21 years after the
point was brought to his attention by Justice Brennan,
JUSTICE SCALIA remains “oblivious to the fact that [the
concept of ‘tradition’] can be as malleable and elusive as
‘liberty’ itself.” Michael H., 491 U. S., at 137 (dissenting
opinion). Even when historical analysis is focused on a
discrete proposition, such as the original public meaning of
the Second Amendment, the evidence often points in
different directions. The historian must choose which
pieces to credit and which to discount, and then must try
to assemble them into a coherent whole. In Heller,
JUSTICE SCALIA preferred to rely on sources created much
earlier and later in time than the Second Amendment
itself, see, e.g., 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4–5) (consult­
ing late 19th-century treatises to ascertain how Americans
would have read the Amendment’s preamble in 1791); I
focused more closely on sources contemporaneous with the
Amendment’s drafting and ratification.49 No mechanical

century English Bill of Rights; Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws
of England; postenactment commentary on the Second Amendment;
and post-Civil War legislative history”); see also post, at 2–5 (discussing
professional historians’ criticisms of Heller).

yardstick can measure which of us was correct, either with
respect to the materials we chose to privilege or the in­
sights we gleaned from them.
The malleability and elusiveness of history increase
exponentially when we move from a pure question of
original meaning, as in Heller, to JUSTICE SCALIA’s theory
of substantive due process. At least with the former sort
of question, the judge can focus on a single legal provision;
the temporal scope of the inquiry is (or should be) rela­
tively bounded; and there is substantial agreement on
what sorts of authorities merit consideration.
With
JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach to substantive due process,
these guideposts all fall away. The judge must canvas the
entire landscape of American law as it has evolved
through time, and perhaps older laws as well, see, e.g.,
Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 596 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (dis­
cussing “ ‘ancient roots’ ” of proscriptions against sodomy
(quoting Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186, 192 (1986)),
pursuant to a standard (deeply rootedness) that has never
been defined. In conducting this rudderless, panoramic
tour of American legal history, the judge has more than
ample opportunity to “look over the heads of the crowd
and pick out [his] friends,” Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S.
551, 617 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
My point is not to criticize judges’ use of history in
general or to suggest that it always generates indetermi­
nate answers; I have already emphasized that historical
study can discipline as well as enrich substantive due
process analysis.
My point is simply that JUSTICE
SCALIA’s defense of his method, which holds out objectivity
and restraint as its cardinal—and, it seems, only—virtues,
is unsatisfying on its own terms. For a limitless number
of subjective judgments may be smuggled into his histori­
cal analysis. Worse, they may be buried in the analysis.
At least with my approach, the judge’s cards are laid on
the table for all to see, and to critique. The judge must

exercise judgment, to be sure. When answering a consti­
tutional question to which the text provides no clear an­
swer, there is always some amount of discretion; our
constitutional system has always depended on judges’
filling in the document’s vast open spaces.50 But there is
also transparency.
JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach is even less restrained in
another sense: It would effect a major break from our case
law outside of the “incorporation” area. JUSTICE SCALIA
does not seem troubled by the fact that his method is
largely inconsistent with the Court’s canonical substantive
due process decisions, ranging from Meyer, 262 U. S. 390,
and Pierce, 268 U. S. 510, in the 1920’s, to Griswold, 381
U. S. 479, in the 1960’s, to Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558, in the
2000’s. To the contrary, he seems to embrace this disso­
nance. My method seeks to synthesize dozens of cases on
which the American people have relied for decades.
JUSTICE SCALIA’s method seeks to vaporize them. So I am
left to wonder, which of us is more faithful to this Nation’s
constitutional history? And which of us is more faithful to
the values and commitments of the American people, as
they stand today? In 1967, when the Court held in Lov­
ing, 388 U. S. 1, that adults have a liberty-based as well as
equality-based right to wed persons of another race, inter­
racial marriage was hardly “deeply rooted” in American
tradition. Racial segregation and subordination were
deeply rooted. The Court’s substantive due process hold­
ing was nonetheless correct—and we should be wary of
any interpretive theory that implies, emphatically, that it
was not.
Which leads me to the final set of points I wish to make:
JUSTICE SCALIA’s method invites not only bad history, but
also bad constitutional law. As I have already explained,
in evaluating a claimed liberty interest (or any constitu­

tional claim for that matter), it makes perfect sense to give
history significant weight: JUSTICE SCALIA’s position is
closer to my own than he apparently feels comfortable
acknowledging. But it makes little sense to give history
dispositive weight in every case. And it makes especially
little sense to answer questions like whether the right to
bear arms is “fundamental” by focusing only on the past,
given that both the practical significance and the public
understandings of such a right often change as society
changes. What if the evidence had shown that, whereas at
one time firearm possession contributed substantially to
personal liberty and safety, nowadays it contributes noth­
ing, or even tends to undermine them? Would it still have
been reasonable to constitutionalize the right?
The concern runs still deeper. Not only can historical
views be less than completely clear or informative, but
they can also be wrong. Some notions that many Ameri­
cans deeply believed to be true, at one time, turned out not
to be true. Some practices that many Americans believed
to be consistent with the Constitution’s guarantees of
liberty and equality, at one time, turned out to be incon­
sistent with them. The fact that we have a written Con­
stitution does not consign this Nation to a static legal
existence. Although we should always “pa[y] a decent
regard to the opinions of former times,” it “is not the glory
of the people of America” to have “suffered a blind venera­
tion for antiquity.” The Federalist No. 14, p. 99, 104 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). It is not the role of federal
judges to be amateur historians. And it is not fidelity to
the Constitution to ignore its use of deliberately capacious
language, in an effort to transform foundational legal
commitments into narrow rules of decision.
As for “the democratic process,” ante, at 14, 15, a
method that looks exclusively to history can easily do more
harm than good. Just consider this case. The net result of
JUSTICE SCALIA’s supposedly objective analysis is to vest

federal judges—ultimately a majority of the judges on this
Court—with unprecedented lawmaking powers in an area
in which they have no special qualifications, and in which
the give-and-take of the political process has functioned
effectively for decades. Why this “intrudes much less upon
the democratic process,” ante, at 14, than an approach
that would defer to the democratic process on the regula­
tion of firearms is, to say the least, not self-evident. I
cannot even tell what, under JUSTICE SCALIA’s view, con­
stitutes an “intrusion.”
It is worth pondering, furthermore, the vision of democ­
racy that underlies JUSTICE SCALIA’s critique. Because
very few of us would welcome a system in which majorities
or powerful interest groups always get their way. Under
our constitutional scheme, I would have thought that a
judicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have
outlined—an approach that investigates both the intrinsic
nature of the claimed interest and the practical signifi­
cance of its judicial enforcement, that is transparent in its
reasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate con­
straints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it,
and that is willing to protect some rights even if they have
not already received uniform protection from the elected
branches—has the capacity to improve, rather than
“[im]peril,” ante, at 15, our democracy. It all depends on
judges’ exercising careful, reasoned judgment. As it al­
ways has, and as it always will.
VII
The fact that the right to keep and bear arms appears in
the Constitution should not obscure the novelty of the
Court’s decision to enforce that right against the States.
By its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the
States; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals
outside of the militia context. The Second Amendment
was adopted to protect the States from federal encroach­

ment. And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been
understood by the Court to have “incorporated” the entire
Bill of Rights. There was nothing foreordained about
today’s outcome.
Although the Court’s decision in this case might be seen
as a mere adjunct to its decision in Heller, the conse­
quences could prove far more destructive—quite liter­
ally—to our Nation’s communities and to our constitu­
tional structure. Thankfully, the Second Amendment
right identified in Heller and its newly minted Fourteenth
Amendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the
home. But neither the “assurances” provided by the plu­
rality, ante, at 40, nor the many historical sources cited in
its opinion should obscure the reality that today’s ruling
marks a dramatic change in our law—or that the Justices
who have joined it have brought to bear an awesome
amount of discretion in resolving the legal question pre­
sented by this case.
I would proceed more cautiously. For the reasons set
out at length above, I cannot accept either the methodol­
ogy the Court employs or the conclusions it draws. Al­
though impressively argued, the majority’s decision to
overturn more than a century of Supreme Court precedent
and to unsettle a much longer tradition of state practice is
not, in my judgment, built “upon respect for the teachings
of history, solid recognition of the basic values that under­
lie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles
that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers
have played in establishing and preserving American
freedoms.” Griswold, 381 U. S., at 501 (Harlan, J., con­
curring in judgment).
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
