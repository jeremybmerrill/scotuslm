PETITIONERS v. KENNY A., BY HIS NEXT FRIEND

LINDA WINN, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[April 21, 2010]


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
GINSBURG, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, concurring in
part and dissenting in part.
We granted certiorari in this case to consider “whether
the calculation of an attorney’s fee” that is “based on the
‘lodestar,’ ” ante, at 1 (opinion of the Court), can “ever be
enhanced based solely on [the] quality of [the lawyers’]
performance and [the] results obtained,” Pet. for Cert. i
(emphasis added). The Court answers that question in the
affirmative. See ante, at 1 (“We have stated in previous
cases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary
circumstances, and we reaffirm that rule”); see also ante,
p. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). As our prior precedents
make clear, the lodestar calculation “does not end the [fee]
inquiry” because there “remain other considerations that
may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward.”
Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 434 (1983). For that
reason, “[t]he lodestar method was never intended to be
conclusive in all circumstances.” Ante, at 9. Instead, as
the Court today reaffirms, when “superior attorney per
formance,” ibid., leads to “exceptional success an enhanced
award may be justified,” Hensley supra, at 435; see also
Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for
Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565 (1986); Blum v. Stenson, 465

PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of BREYER, J.

U. S. 886, 896–900 (1984). I agree with that conclusion.
Where the majority and I part ways is with respect to a
question that is not presented, but that the Court
obliquely, and in my view inappropriately, appears to
consider nonetheless—namely, whether the lower courts
correctly determined in this case that exceptional circum
stances justify a lodestar enhancement. See Parts IV–V,
ante; see also ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). I
would not reach that issue, which lies beyond the narrow
question that we agreed to consider. See 556 U. S. __
(2009) (limiting review to the first question presented);
Pet. for Cert. i (stating question); see also Glover v. United
States, 531 U. S. 198, 205 (2001) (“As a general rule . . . we
do not decide issues outside the questions presented . . .”).
Nor do I believe that this Court, which is twice removed
from the litigation underlying the fee determination, is
properly suited to resolve the fact-intensive inquiry that
42 U. S. C. §1988 demands. But even were I to engage in
that inquiry, I would hold that the District Court did not
abuse its discretion in awarding an enhancement. And
I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.
As the Court explains, the basic question that must be
resolved when considering an enhancement to the lodestar
is whether the lodestar calculation “adequately meas
ure[s]” an attorney’s “value,” as “demonstrated” by his
performance “during the litigation.” Ante, at 10. While I
understand the need for answering that question through
the application of standards, I also believe that the answer
inevitably involves an element of judgment. Moreover,
when reviewing a district court’s answer to that question,
an appellate court must inevitably give weight to the fact
that a district court is better situated to provide that
answer. For it is the district judge, and only the district
judge, who will have read all of the motions filed in the

Opinion of BREYER, J.

case, witnessed the proceedings, and been able to evaluate
the attorneys’ overall performance in light of the objec
tives, context, legal difficulty, and practical obstacles
present in the case. In a word, the district judge will have
observed the attorney’s true “value, as demonstrated . . .
during the litigation.” Ibid. (emphasis added). By con
trast, a court of appeals, faced with a cold and perhaps
lengthy record, will inevitably have less time and oppor
tunity to determine whether the lawyers have done an
exceptionally fine job. And this Court is yet less suited to
performing that inquiry.
Accordingly, determining
whether a fee enhancement is warranted in a given case
“is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a
trial judge,” ante, at 13, and the function of appellate
courts is to review that judge’s determination for an abuse
of such discretion. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S.
552, 571 (1988); see also General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522
U. S. 136, 143 (1997) (“[D]eference . . . is the hallmark of
abuse-of-discretion review”).
This case well illustrates why our tiered and function
ally specialized judicial system places the task of deter
mining an attorney’s fee award primarily in the district
court’s hands. The plaintiffs’ lawyers spent eight years
investigating the underlying facts, developing the initial
complaint, conducting court proceedings, and working out
final relief. The District Court’s docket, with over 600
entries, consists of more than 18,000 pages. Transcripts of
hearings and depositions, along with other documents,
have produced a record that fills 20 large boxes. Neither
we, nor an appellate panel, can easily read that entire
record. Nor should we attempt to second-guess a district
judge who is aware of the many intangible matters that
the written page cannot reflect.
My own review of this expansive record cannot possibly
be exhaustive. But those portions of the record I have
reviewed lead me to conclude, like the Court of Appeals,


4

PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of BREYER, J.

that the District Judge did not abuse his discretion when
awarding an enhanced fee. I reach this conclusion based
on four considerations.
First, the record indicates that the lawyers’ objective in
this case was unusually important and fully consistent
with the central objectives of the basic federal civil-rights
statute, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Moreover, the problem the
attorneys faced demanded an exceptionally high degree of
skill and effort. Specifically, these lawyers and their
clients sought to have the State of Georgia reform its
entire foster-care system—a system that much in the
record describes as well below the level of minimal consti
tutional acceptability. The record contains investigative
reports, mostly prepared by Georgia’s own Office of the
Child Advocate, which show, for example, the following:
•	 The State’s foster-care system was unable to provide
essential medical and mental health services; children
consequently and unnecessarily suffered illness and
life long medical disabilities, such as permanent hear
ing loss, due to failures on the part of the State to ad
minister basic care and antibiotics. See, e.g., Doc. 3,
Exh. 3C, pp. 11–13.
•	 Understaffing and improper staffing placed children
in the care of individuals with dangerous criminal re
cords; children were physically assaulted by the staff,
locked outside of the shelters at night as punishment,
and abused in other ways. See, e.g., Doc. 50, pp. 32–
36, 55; Doc. 3, Exh. 3A, pp. 2–6; Doc. 3, Exh. 2, pp. 4–
5; Doc. 52, Exh. 1, pp. 6, 12–15, 34.
•	 The shelters themselves were “unsanitary and dilapi
dated,” “unclean,” infested with rats, “overcrowded,”
unsafe, and “ ‘out of control.’ ” See, e.g., Doc. 3, Exh.
3A, at 1–2; Doc. 3, Exh. 3B, p. 2; Doc. 50, at 29.
•	 Due to improper supervision and other deficiencies at
the shelters, 20% of the children abused drugs; some

5

Opinion of BREYER, J.

also became victims of child prostitution. See id., at
39; Doc. 3, Exh. 3A, at 3.
•	 Systemic failures also caused vulnerable children to
suffer regular beatings and sexual abuse, including
rape, at the hands of more aggressive shelter resi
dents. See, e.g., Doc. 50, at 18–22, 54–55; Doc. 52,
Exh. 1, at 7–10, 26; Doc. 3, Exh. 3B, at 3 (“[A child]
was beaten so badly by eight other [children] that he
suffered severe internal bleeding”); id., at 4 (describ
ing violent sexual assault and rape).
•	 Not surprisingly, many children—upwards of 5 per
day and over 750 per year—tried to escape these con
ditions; others tried to commit suicide. See, e.g., Doc.
50, at 27–28, 54; Doc. 52, Exh. 18, p. 4 (under seal) (at
least 25% of children run away from shelters); Doc.
52, Exh. 18E, pp. 1–11, 18–19 (under seal) (daily logs);
see also Doc. 50, Exh. 1, at 37, 54 (describing suicide
attempts) (all docket entries above and hereinafter re
fer to No. 1:02–cv–1686 (ND Ga.) (case below)).
The State’s Office of the Child Advocate, whose reports
provide much of the basis for the foregoing description,
concluded that the system was “operating in crisis mode”
and that any private operator who ran such a system
“would never be licensed to care for children.” Office of the
Child Advocate for the Protection of Children Ann. Rep.
10, 14 (2001), Record, Doc. 3, Exh. 3C (hereinafter OCA
2001 Report); accord, id., Exh. 3A, at 1. The advocate
noted that neither her investigative reports nor national
news publicity (including a television program that high
lighted a 5-year-old foster child’s death from beatings)
had prompted corrective action by the State. OCA 2001
Report 1, 14.
The advocate further stated that litigation was neces
sary to force reform. Id., at 14–15. And she repeatedly
asked the State to give her office the authority to conduct

that litigation. See Office of the Child Advocate Advisory
Committee, Ann. Effectiveness Rep. 4 (2002), online at
http://www.georgia.gov/vgn/images/portal/cit_1210/7/22/
84622967effectiveness2003.pdf (all Internet materials as
visited Apr. 16, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file) (“[F]or the Office to be truly effective, it must
possess the authority to compel change [and] . . . to initiate
litigation on behalf of children. Such authority is widely
considered by other states’ Child Advocates as crucial to
effecting meaningful change for children”); Office of the Child

cit_1210/31/23/102387685OCA%20Effectiveness%20Report
%202004-2005.doc. But the State did not grant the Child
Advocate’s office the litigating authority she sought. See
2000 Ga. Laws p. 245, as codified, Ga. Code Ann. §15–11–
173 (2008).
The upshot is that the plaintiffs’ attorneys did what the
child advocate could not do: They initiated this lawsuit.
They thereby assumed the role of “a ‘private attorney
general’ ” by filling an enforcement void in the State’s own
legal system, a function “that Congress considered of the
highest priority,” Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.,
390 U. S. 400, 402 (1968) (per curiam), and “meant to
promote in enacting §1988,” Texas State Teachers Assn. v.
Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782, 793
(1989).
Second, the course of the lawsuit was lengthy and ardu
ous. The plaintiffs and their lawyers began with factual
investigations beyond those which the child advocate had
already conducted. See, e.g., Record, Docs. 50–52 (par
tially under seal). They then filed suit. And the State met

7

Opinion of BREYER, J.

the plaintiffs’ efforts with a host of complex procedural, as
well as substantive, objections. The State, for example,
argued that the law forbade the plaintiffs to investigate
the shelters; on the eve of a state-court decision that might
have approved the investigations, the State then removed
the case to federal court; the State then sought protective
orders preventing the attorneys from speaking to the
shelters’ staff; and, after losing its motions, the State
delayed to the point where the District Court “was forced
to admonish [the] State Defendants for ‘relying on techni
cal legal objections to discovery requests in order to delay
and hinder the discovery process.’ ” 454 F. Supp. 2d. 1260,
1268 (ND Ga. 2006) (quoting Record, Doc. 145, p. 4). See
also Doc. 1; Doc. 3, pp. 9–10; Docs. 26, 28–29, 44, 60.
In the meantime, the State moved for dismissal, basing
the motion on complex legal doctrines such as Younger
abstention and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which the
District Court found inapplicable. 218 F. R. D. 277, 284–
290 (ND Ga. 2003). See Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37
(1971); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923),
and District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460
U. S. 462 (1983). The State also opposed the petitioners’
request to certify a class of the 3,000 children in foster
care, but the District Court again rejected the State’s
argument. 218 F. R. D., at 299–302. And, after that, the
State filed a lengthy motion for summary judgment, Re
cord, Docs. 243–245, which plaintiffs’ attorneys opposed in
thorough briefing supported by comprehensive exhibits,
see Docs. 254–258, 260. After losing that motion and
eventually agreeing to mediation, the State forced pro
tracted litigation as to who should be the mediator. See
Docs. 363–364, 366, 369–370, 373, 376, 380. All told, in
opposing the plaintiffs’ efforts to have the foster-care
system reformed, the State spent $2.4 million on outside
counsel (who, because they charge the State reduced rates,
worked significantly more hours than that figure alone

PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of BREYER, J.

indicates) and tapped its own law department for an addi
tional 5,200 hours of work. 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1287.
Third, in the face of this opposition, the results obtained
by the plaintiffs’ attorneys appear to have been excep
tional. The 47-page consent decree negotiated over the
course of the mediation sets forth 31 specific steps that the
State will take in order to address the specific deficiencies
of the sort that I described above. See id., at 1289; see
also App. 92–207 (consent decree). And it establishes a
reporting and oversight mechanism that is backed up by
the District Court’s enforcement authority. See 454
F. Supp. 2d, at 1289. As a result of the decree, the State
agreed to comprehensive reforms of its foster-care system,
to the benefit of children in many different communities.
And informed observers have described the decree as
having brought about significant positive results. See,
e.g., Record, Doc. 632, p. 4 (most recent court-appointed
overseers’ report) (“The State’s overall performance . . .
continues the trend of steady improvement . . .”); id., at 4–
10 (detailing substantial health, safety, and welfare im
provements); see also, Office of the Child Advocate Ann.

cate, to Sonny Perdue, Governor of Georgia (Jan. 16,

Opinion of BREYER, J.

Fourth and finally, the District Judge, who supervised
these proceedings, who saw the plaintiffs amass, process,
compile, and convincingly present vast amounts of factual
information, who witnessed their defeat of numerous state
procedural and substantive motions, and who was in a
position to evaluate the ultimate mediation effort, said:
1. the “mediation effort in this case went far beyond any
thing that this Court has seen in any previous case,”
454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1282;
2. “based on its personal observation of plaintiffs’ coun
sel’s performance throughout this litigation, the Court
finds that . . . counsel brought a higher degree of skill,
commitment, dedication, and professionalism to this
litigation than the Court has seen displayed by the at
torneys in any other case during its 27 years on the
bench,” id., at 1288–1290;
3. the Consent Decree “provided extraordinary benefits
to the plaintiff class . . . .” Id., at 1282. “[T]he settle
ment achieved by plaintiffs’ counsel is comprehensive
in its scope and detailed in its coverage. . . . After 58
years as a practicing attorney and federal judge, the
Court is unaware of any other case in which a plaintiff
class has achieved such a favorable result on such a
comprehensive scale,” id., at 1289–1290.
Based on these observations and on its assessment of the
attorneys’ performance during the course of the litigation,
the District Court concluded that “the evidence establishes
that the quality of service rendered by class counsel . . .
was far superior to what consumers of legal services in the
legal marketplace . . . could reasonably expect to receive
for the rates used in the lodestar calculation.” Id., at
1288.
On the basis of what I have read, I believe that assess
ment was correct. I recognize that the ordinary lodestar
calculation yields a large fee award. But by my assess


10

PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of BREYER, J.

ment, the lodestar calculation in this case translates to an
average hourly fee per attorney of $249. See id., at 1287
(lodestar calculation and attorney hours). (The majority’s
reference to an hourly fee of $866, ante, at 12, refers to the
rate associated with the single highest paid of the 17
attorneys under the enhanced fee, not the average hourly
rate under the lodestar. The lay reader should also bear
in mind that a lawyer’s “fee” is substantially greater than
his “profit,” given that attorneys must sometimes cover
case-specific costs (which in this case exceeded $800,000,
see 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1291) and also must cover routine
overhead expenses, which typically consume 40% of their
fees, see Altman Weil Publications, Inc., Survey of Law
Firm Economics 30 (2007 ed.)).
At $249 per hour, the lodestar would compensate this
group of attorneys—whom the District Court described as
extraordinary—at a rate lower than the average rate
charged by attorneys practicing law in the State of Geor
gia, where the average hourly rate is $268. See id., at 89.
Accordingly, even the majority would seem to acknowledge
that some form of an enhancement is appropriate in this
case. See ante, at 10 (“[A]n enhancement may be appro
priate where the method used in determining the hourly
rate employed in the lodestar calculation does not ade
quately measure the attorney’s true market value, as
demonstrated in part during the litigation”). Indeed, the
fact that these exceptional results were achieved in a case
where “much of the work,” ante, at 13, n. 7, was performed
by relatively inexperienced attorneys (who, accordingly,
would be compensated by the lodestar “below the market
average,” ibid.) is all the more reason to think that their
service rendered their outstanding performance worthy of
an enhancement. By comparison, the District Court’s
enhanced award—a special one-time adjustment unique to
this exceptional case—would compensate these attorneys,
on this one occasion, at an average hourly rate of $435,

11

Opinion of BREYER, J.

which is comparable to the rates charged by the Nation’s
leading law firms on average on every occasion. See Firm
by-Firm Sampling of Billing Rates Nationwide, National
Law Journal, Dec. 11, 2006, p. S2 (listing 13 firms at
which average hourly rate is between $400 and $510); J.
Barnett, Certification Drag: The Opinion Puzzle and
Other Transactional Curiosities, 33 Iowa J. Corp. L. 95,
110, n. 58 (2007) (“These numbers are probably an under
estimate given that many of the highest-billing national
law firms decline to take part in the National Law Journal
Survey”). Thus, it would appear that the enhanced award
is wholly consistent with the purpose of §1988, which was
enacted to ensure that “counsel for prevailing parties [are]
paid as is traditional with attorneys compensated by a fee
paying client.” S. Rep. No. 94–1011, p. 6 (1976); see H. R.
Rep. No. 94–1558, p. 9 (1976) (“[C]ivil rights plaintiffs
should not be singled out for different and less favorable
treatment”); see also Blum, 465 U. S., at 893, 897.
In any event, the circumstances I have listed likely
make this a “rare” or “exceptional” case warranting an
enhanced fee award. And they certainly make clear that it
was neither unreasonable nor an abuse of discretion for
the District Court to reach that conclusion. Indeed, if the
facts and circumstances that I have described are even
roughly correct, then it is fair to ask: If this is not an
exceptional case, what is?
*
*
*
My disagreement with the Court is limited. As I stated
at the outset, we are in complete agreement with respect
to the answer to the question presented: “[A]n increase” to
the lodestar “due to superior performance and results” “is
permitted in extraordinary circumstances.” Ante, at 1.
Unlike JUSTICE THOMAS, I do not read the Court’s opinion
to “advance our attorney’s fees jurisprudence further along
the decisional arc” toward a point where enhancements


12

PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of BREYER, J.

are “virtually” barred in all cases. Ante, at 2 (concurring
opinion). Our prior cases make clear that enhancements
are permitted in “ ‘exceptional’ cases,” Delaware Valley,
478 U. S., at 565, where the attorney achieves “exceptional
success,” Hensley, 461 U. S., at 435; see also Blum, 465
U. S., at 896–901. By definition, such exceptional circum
stances occur only rarely. See ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J.,
concurring). I do not see how the Court could “advance”
our fee enhancement jurisprudence so as to further dis
courage lodestar enhancements without overruling the
precedents I have just cited, which the Court has not done.
To the contrary, today the Court “reaffirm[s]” those prece
dents, which allow enhancements for exceptional perform
ance. Ante, at 1. And with respect to that central holding
we are unanimous.
Nor is my disagreement with the Court absolute with
respect to the proper resolution of the case before us, for
the Court does not purport to prohibit the District Court
from awarding an enhanced fee on remand if that court
provides more detailed reasoning supporting its decision.
Ante, at 12; cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. But the majority and I
do disagree in this respect: I would not disturb the judg
ment below. “A request for attorney’s fees should not
result in a second major litigation.” Hensley, 461 U. S., at
437. Nor should it lead to years of protracted appellate
review. See id., at 455–456 (Brennan, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part). We did not grant certiorari
in this case to consider the fact-intensive dispute over
whether this is, in fact, an exceptional case that merits a
lodestar enhancement. The District Court has already
resolved that question and the Court of Appeals affirmed
its judgment, having found no abuse of discretion. I would
have been content to resolve no more than the question
presented. But, even were I to follow the Court’s inclina
tion to say more, I would hold that the principles upon
which we agree—including the applicability of abuse-of

discretion review to a District Court’s fee determination—
require us to affirm the judgment below.
