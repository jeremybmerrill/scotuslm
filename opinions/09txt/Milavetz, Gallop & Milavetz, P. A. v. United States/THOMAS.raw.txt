MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A., ET AL.
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
[March 8, 2010]

JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I concur in the judgment and join all but Part III–C of
the Court’s opinion. I agree with the Court that 11
U. S. C. §528’s advertising disclosure requirements sur
vive First Amendment scrutiny on the record before us. I
write separately because different reasons lead me to that
conclusion.
I have never been persuaded that there is any basis in
the First Amendment for the relaxed scrutiny this Court
applies to laws that suppress nonmisleading commercial
speech. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S.
484, 522–523 (1996) (opinion concurring in part and con
curring in judgment) (discussing Central Hudson Gas &
Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557
(1980)). In this case, the Court applies a still lower stan
dard of scrutiny to review a law that compels the disclo
sure of commercial speech—i.e., the rule articulated in

STATES

Opinion of THOMAS, J. 


Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626 (1985), that laws that require
the disclosure of factual information in commercial adver
tising may be upheld so long as they are “reasonably
related” to the government’s interest in preventing con
sumer deception, id., at 651.
I am skeptical of the premise on which Zauderer rests—
that, in the commercial-speech context, “the First Amend
ment interests implicated by disclosure requirements are
substantially weaker than those at stake when speech is
actually suppressed,” id., at 652, n. 14; see id., at 650
(citing “material differences between disclosure require
ments and outright prohibitions on speech”). We have
refused in other contexts to attach any “constitutional
significance” to the difference between regulations that
compel protected speech and regulations that restrict it.
See, e.g., Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C.,
Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796–797 (1988). I see no reason why
that difference should acquire constitutional significance
merely because the regulations at issue involve commer
cial speech. See Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott,
Inc., 521 U. S. 457, 480–481 (1997) (Souter, J., dissenting)
(arguing that “commercial speech is . . . subject to [this]
First Amendment principle: that compelling cognizable
speech officially is just as suspect as suppressing it, and is
typically subject to the same level of scrutiny”); id., at 504
(THOMAS, J., dissenting); cf. United States v. United Foods,
Inc., 533 U. S. 405, 419 (2001) (THOMAS, J., concurring)
(stating that regulations that compel funding for commer
cial advertising “must be subjected to the most stringent
First Amendment scrutiny”).
Accordingly, I would be willing to reexamine Zauderer
and its progeny in an appropriate case to determine
whether these precedents provide sufficient First Amend
ment protection against government-mandated disclo

Opinion of THOMAS, J.

sures.1 Because no party asks us to do so here, however, I
agree with the Court that the Zauderer standard governs
our review of the challenge to §528 brought by the Milav
etz law firm and the other plaintiffs in this action (herein
after Milavetz).
Yet even under Zauderer, we “have not presumptively
endorsed” laws requiring the use of “government-scripted
disclaimers” in commercial advertising. See Borgner v.
Florida Bd. of Dentistry, 537 U. S. 1080, 1082 (2002)
(THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Zaud
erer upheld the imposition of sanctions against an attor
ney under a rule of professional conduct that required
advertisements for contingency-fee services to disclose
that losing clients might be responsible for litigation fees
and costs. See 471 U. S., at 650–653. Importantly, how
ever, Zauderer’s advertisement was found to be misleading
on its face, and the regulation in that case did not man
date the specific form or text of the disclosure. Ibid. Thus,
Zauderer does not stand for the proposition that the gov
ernment can constitutionally compel the use of a scripted
disclaimer in any circumstance in which its interest in
——————
1 I have no quarrel with the principle that advertisements that are
false or misleading, or that propose an illegal transaction, may be
proscribed. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 520
(1996) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
Furthermore, I acknowledge this Court’s longstanding assumption that
a consumer-fraud regulation that compels the disclosure of certain
factual information in advertisements may intrude less significantly on
First Amendment interests than an outright prohibition on all adver
tisements that have the potential to mislead. See, e.g., Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,
771–772 (1976); Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, 651–652, n. 14 (1985); Riley v. National
Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796, n. 9 (1988);
Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447
U. S. 557, 565 (1980). But even if that assumption is correct, I doubt
that it justifies an entirely different standard of review for regulations
that compel, rather than suppress, commercial speech.

STATES

Opinion of THOMAS, J. 


preventing consumer deception might plausibly be at
stake. In other words, a bare assertion by the government
that a disclosure requirement is “intended” to prevent
consumer deception, standing alone, is not sufficient to
uphold the requirement as applied to all speech that falls
within its sweep. See ante, at 20.
Instead, our precedents make clear that regulations
aimed at false or misleading advertisements are permissi
ble only where “the particular advertising is inherently
likely to deceive or where the record indicates that a par
ticular form or method of advertising has in fact been
deceptive.” In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 202 (1982) (em
phasis added); see Zauderer, supra, at 651 (“recogniz[ing]
that unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure re
quirements might offend the First Amendment”). There
fore, a disclosure requirement passes constitutional mus
ter only to the extent that it is aimed at advertisements
that, by their nature, possess these traits. See R. M. J.,
supra, at 202; Ibanez v. Florida Dept. of Business and
Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512 U. S.
136, 143, 146–147 (1994).
I do not read the Court’s opinion to hold otherwise. See
ante, at 20. Accordingly, and with that understanding, I
turn to the question whether Milavetz’s challenge to
§528’s disclosure requirements survives Zauderer scrutiny
on the record before us.
As the Court notes, the posture of Milavetz’s challenge
inhibits our review of its First Amendment claim. See
ante, at 19, n. 7. Milavetz challenged §528’s constitution
ality before the statute had ever been enforced against any
of the firm’s advertisements. Although Milavetz purports
to challenge §528 only “ ‘as-applied’ ” to its own advertis
ing, see ante, at 19, it did not introduce any evidence or
exhibits to substantiate its claim. Thus, no court has seen
a sampling of Milavetz’s advertisements or even a declara
tion describing their contents and the media through

which Milavetz seeks to transmit them. As a consequence,
Milavetz’s nominal “as applied” challenge appears strik
ingly similar to a facial challenge.
We generally disapprove of such challenges because
they “often rest on speculation” and require courts to
engage in “ ‘premature interpretation of statutes on the
basis of factually barebones records.’ ” Washington State
Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S.
442, 450 (2008) (quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S.
600, 609 (2004)). Milavetz’s claim invites the same prob
lems. Milavetz alleges that §528’s disclosure require
ments are unconstitutional as applied to its advertise
ments because its advertisements are not misleading and
because the disclaimer required by §528 will create, rather
than reduce, confusion for Milavetz’s potential clients.
That may well be true. But because no record evidence of
Milavetz’s advertisements exists to guide our review, we
can only speculate about the ways in which the statute
might be applied to Milavetz’s speech.
When forced to determine the constitutionality of a
statute based solely on such conjecture, we will uphold the
law if there is any “conceivabl[e]” manner in which it can
be enforced consistent with the First Amendment. Wash
ington State Grange, supra, at 456. In this case, both
parties agree that §528’s disclosure requirements cover, at
a minimum, deceptive advertisements that promise to
“ ‘wipe out’ ” debts without mentioning bankruptcy as the
means of accomplishing this goal.2 Brief for Milavetz 82,

oral argument, Milavetz’s counsel declined to describe Milavetz’s
challenge to §528 as a facial overbreadth claim, Tr. of Oral Arg. 25–26,
and Milavetz’s briefs make no such contention. But even viewing
Milavetz’s argument as a claim that §528 is facially overbroad because
it applies to nonmisleading advertisements for bankruptcy-related
services, such an argument must fail. First, as noted, Milavetz ac
knowledges that §528 can be constitutionally applied to deceptive
bankruptcy-related advertisements and, thus, at least one “set of

86; Brief for United States 60–62. As a result, there is at
least one set of facts on which the statute could be consti
tutionally applied. Thus, I agree with the Court that

circumstances exists under which [§528] would be valid.” United States 

v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). Second, Milavetz does not at
tempt to argue that §528’s unconstitutional applications are “substan
tial” in number when judged in relation to this “plainly legitimate
sweep.” Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican
Party, 552 U. S. 442, 449–450, and n. 6 (2008) (internal quotation
