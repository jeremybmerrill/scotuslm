KAREN L. JERMAN, PETITIONER v. CARLISLE, MC-

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[April 21, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER, concurring.
As respondents point out, the Court’s interpretation of
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act may create a di
lemma for lawyers who regularly engage in debt collection,
including through litigation. See Brief for Respondents
44–48; Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291 (1995). Can those
lawyers act in the best interests of their clients if they face
personal liability when they rely on good-faith interpreta
tions of the Act that are later rejected by a court? Or will
that threat of personal liability lead them to do less than
their best for those clients?
As the majority points out, however, the statute offers a
way out of—though not a panacea for—this dilemma.
Ante, at 13–14, 24–25. Faced with legal uncertainty, a
lawyer can turn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC or
Commission) for an advisory opinion. 16 CFR §§1.1 to 1.4
(2009). And once he receives that opinion and acts upon it
the dilemma disappears: If he fails to follow the opinion,
he has not acted in good faith and can fairly be held liable.
If he follows the opinion, the statute frees him from any
such liability. 15 U. S. C. §1692k(e) (debt collectors im
mune from liability for “any act done or omitted in . . .
conformity with any advisory opinion of the [Federal
Trade] Commission”). See also R. Hobbs et al., National
Consumer Law Center, Fair Debt Collection §§6.12.2, 7.3

BREYER, J., concurring


(6th ed. 2008).
The FTC, of course, may refuse to issue such an opinion.
See, e.g., 16 CFR §1.1 (providing that the Commission will
issue advisory opinions “where practicable” and only when
“[t]he matter involves a substantial or novel question of
fact or law and there is no clear Commission or court
precedent” or “is of significant public interest”). Appar
ently, within the past decade, the FTC has received only
seven requests and issued four opinions. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 27–28; see also Federal Trade Commission,Commission FDCPA Advisory Opinions, online at
http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fdcpajump.shtm (as visited
Apr. 19, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).
Yet, should the dilemma I have described above prove
serious, I would expect the FTC to receive more requests
and to respond to them, thereby reducing the scope of the
problem to the point where other available tools, e.g.,
damages caps and vicarious liability, will prove adequate.
See ante, at 23–27. On this understanding, I agree with
the Court and join its opinion.
