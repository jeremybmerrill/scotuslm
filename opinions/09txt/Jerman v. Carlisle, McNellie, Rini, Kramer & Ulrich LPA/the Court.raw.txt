ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[April 21, 2010]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act)
imposes civil liability on “debt collector[s]” for certain
prohibited debt collection practices. Section 813(c) of the
Act, 15 U. S. C. §1692k(c), provides that a debt collector is
not liable in an action brought under the Act if she can
show “the violation was not intentional and resulted from
a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of
procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.”
This case presents the question whether the “bona fide
error” defense in §1692k(c) applies to a violation resulting
from a debt collector’s mistaken interpretation of the legal
requirements of the FDCPA. We conclude it does not.
I

A

Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, 91 Stat. 874, to
eliminate abusive debt collection practices, to ensure that
debt collectors who abstain from such practices are not
competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent
state action to protect consumers. 15 U. S. C. §1692(e).
The Act regulates interactions between consumer debtors

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


and “debt collector[s],” defined to include any person who
“regularly collects . . . debts owed or due or asserted to be
owed or due another.” §§1692a(5), (6). Among other
things, the Act prohibits debt collectors from making false
representations as to a debt’s character, amount, or legal
status, §1692e(2)(A); communicating with consumers at an
“unusual time or place” likely to be inconvenient to the
consumer, §1692c(a)(1); or using obscene or profane lan
guage or violence or the threat thereof, §§1692d(1), (2).
See generally §§1692b–1692j; Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.
291, 292–293 (1995).
The Act is enforced through administrative action and
private lawsuits. With some exceptions not relevant here,
violations of the FDCPA are deemed to be unfair or decep
tive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission
Act (FTC Act), 15 U. S. C. §41 et seq., and are enforced by
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). See §1692l. As a
result, a debt collector who acts with “actual knowledge or
knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum
stances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]” is
subject to civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day.
§§45(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16
CFR §1.98(d)).
The FDCPA also provides that “any debt collector who
fails to comply with any provision of th[e] [Act] with re
spect to any person is liable to such person.” 15 U. S. C.
§1692k(a). Successful plaintiffs are entitled to “actual
damage[s],” plus costs and “a reasonable attorney’s fee as
determined by the court.” Ibid. A court may also award
“additional damages,” subject to a statutory cap of $1,000
for individual actions, or, for class actions, “the lesser of
$500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt
collector.” §1692k(a)(2). In awarding additional damages,
the court must consider “the frequency and persistence of
[the debt collector’s] noncompliance,” “the nature of such
noncompliance,” and “the extent to which such noncompli

Opinion of the Court

ance was intentional.” §1692k(b).
The Act contains two exceptions to provisions imposing
liability on debt collectors. Section 1692k(c), at issue here,
provides that
“[a] debt collector may not be held liable in any action
brought under [the FDCPA] if the debt collector shows
by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was
not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error
notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures rea
sonably adapted to avoid any such error.”
The Act also states that none of its provisions imposing
liability shall apply to “any act done or omitted in good
faith in conformity with any advisory opinion of the [Fed
eral Trade] Commission.” §1692k(e).
B
Respondents in this case are a law firm, Carlisle,
McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., and one of its
attorneys, Adrienne S. Foster (collectively Carlisle). In
April 2006, Carlisle filed a complaint in Ohio state court
on behalf of a client, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.
Carlisle sought foreclosure of a mortgage held by Coun
trywide in real property owned by petitioner Karen L.
Jerman. The complaint included a “Notice,” later served
on Jerman, stating that the mortgage debt would be as
sumed to be valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing.
Jerman’s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and
Carlisle sought verification from Countrywide. When
Countrywide acknowledged that Jerman had, in fact,
already paid the debt in full, Carlisle withdrew the fore
closure lawsuit.
Jerman then filed her own lawsuit seeking class certifi
cation and damages under the FDCPA, contending that
Carlisle violated §1692g by stating that her debt would be

Opinion of the Court 


assumed valid unless she disputed it in writing.1 While
acknowledging a division of authority on the question, the
District Court held that Carlisle had violated §1692g by
requiring Jerman to dispute the debt in writing. 464
F. Supp. 2d 720, 722–725 (ND Ohio 2006).2 The court
ultimately granted summary judgment to Carlisle, how
ever, concluding that §1692k(c) shielded it from liability
because the violation was not intentional, resulted from a
bona fide error, and occurred despite the maintenance of
procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.
502 F. Supp. 2d 686, 695–697 (ND Ohio 2007). The Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 538 F. 3d 469
(2008). Acknowledging that the Courts of Appeals are
divided regarding the scope of the bona fide error defense,
and that the “majority view is that the defense is available
for clerical and factual errors only,” the Sixth Circuit
nonetheless held that §1692k(c) extends to “mistakes of
law.” Id., at 473–476 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The Court of Appeals found “nothing unusual” about
attorney debt collectors maintaining “procedures” within
the meaning of §1692k(c) to avoid mistakes of law. Id., at
476. Noting that a parallel bona fide error defense in the
——————
1 Section 1692g(a)(3) requires a debt collector, within five days of an
“initial communication” about the collection of a debt, to send the
consumer a written notice containing, inter alia, “a statement that
unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice,
disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be
assumed to be valid by the debt collector.”
2 The District Court distinguished, for instance, Graziano v. Harrison,
950 F. 2d 107, 112 (CA3 1991), which held a consumer’s dispute of a
debt under §1692g must be in writing to be effective. Noting that
district courts within the Sixth Circuit had reached different results,
and distinguishing one unpublished Sixth Circuit decision which
Carlisle suggested approved a form with an in-writing requirement, the
court adopted the reasoning from Camacho v. Bridgeport Financial,
Inc., 430 F. 3d 1078, 1080–1082 (CA9 2005), and held that the plain
language of §1692g does not impose an “in writing” requirement on
consumers. See 464 F. Supp. 2d, at 725.

Opinion of the Court

Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U. S. C. §1640(c), ex
pressly excludes legal errors, the court observed that
Congress has amended the FDCPA several times since
1977 without excluding mistakes of law from §1692k(c).
538 F. 3d, at 476.3
We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict of authority
as to the scope of the FDCPA’s bona fide error defense,4
557 U. S. ___ (2009), and now reverse the judgment of the
Sixth Circuit.

——————
3 Because the question was not raised on appeal, the Court of Appeals
did not address whether Carlisle’s inclusion of the “in writing” re
quirement violated §1692g. 538 F. 3d, at 472, n. 2. We likewise ex
press no view about whether inclusion of an “in writing” requirement in
a notice to a consumer violates §1692g, as that question was not pre
sented in the petition for certiorari. Compare Graziano, supra, at 112
(reading §1692g(a)(3) to require that “any dispute, to be effective, must
be in writing”), with Camacho, supra, at 1082 (under §1692g(a)(3),
“disputes need not be made in writing”).
4 Compare, e.g., 538 F. 3d, at 476 (case below), with Baker v. G. C.
Servs. Corp., 677 F. 2d 775, 779 (CA9 1982), and Hulshizer v. Global
Credit Servs., Inc., 728 F. 2d 1037, 1038 (CA8 1984) (per curiam).
The Courts of Appeals have also expressed different views about
whether 15 U. S. C. §1692k(c) applies to violations of the FDCPA
resulting from a misinterpretation of the requirements of state law.
Compare Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121 (CA10 2002) (con
cluding that §1692k(c) applies where a debt collector’s misinterpreta
tion of a Utah dishonored check statute resulted in a violation of
§1692f(1), which prohibits collection of any amount not “permitted by
law”), with Picht v. Jon R. Hawks, Ltd., 236 F. 3d 446, 451–452 (CA8
2001) (stating that §1692k(c) does not preclude FDCPA liability result
ing from a creditor’s mistaken legal interpretation of a Minnesota
garnishment statute). The parties disagree about whether §1692k(c)
applies when a violation results from a debt collector’s misinterpreta
tion of the legal requirements of state law or federal law other than the
FDCPA. Compare Brief for Petitioner 47–49, with Brief for Respon
dents 60–62. Because this case involves only an alleged misinterpreta
tion of the requirements of the FDCPA, we need not, and do not, reach
those other questions.

JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


II 

A

The parties disagree about whether a “violation” result
ing from a debt collector’s misinterpretation of the legal
requirements of the FDCPA can ever be “not intentional”
under §1692k(c). Jerman contends that when a debt
collector intentionally commits the act giving rise to the
violation (here, sending a notice that included the “in
writing” language), a misunderstanding about what the
Act requires cannot render the violation “not intentional,”
given the general rule that mistake or ignorance of law is
no defense. Carlisle and the dissent, in contrast, argue
that nothing in the statutory text excludes legal errors
from the category of “bona fide error[s]” covered by
§1692k(c) and note that the Act refers not to an uninten
tional “act” but rather an unintentional “violation.” The
latter term, they contend, evinces Congress’ intent to
impose liability only when a party knows its conduct is
unlawful. Carlisle urges us, therefore, to read §1692k(c) to
encompass “all types of error,” including mistakes of law.
Brief for Respondents 7.
We decline to adopt the expansive reading of §1692k(c)
that Carlisle proposes. We have long recognized the
“common maxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of
the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or crimi
nally.” Barlow v. United States, 7 Pet. 404, 411 (1833)
(opinion for the Court by Story, J.); see also Cheek v.
United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991) (“The general rule
that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense
to criminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the American
legal system”).5 Our law is therefore no stranger to the

dissent discounts the relevance of the principle here, on grounds
that this case involves the scope of a statutory exception to liability,
rather than a provision “delineat[ing] a category of prohibited conduct.”

possibility that an act may be “intentional” for purposes of
civil liability, even if the actor lacked actual knowledge
that her conduct violated the law. In Kolstad v. American
Dental Assn., 527 U. S. 526 (1999), for instance, we ad
dressed a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 author
izing compensatory and punitive damages for “intentional

difference, as our precedents have made clear for more than 175 years.
Barlow involved a statute providing for forfeiture of any goods entered
“by a false denomination” in the office of a customs collector “for the
benefit of drawback or bounty upon the exportation”; the statute
included, however, an exception under which “said forfeiture shall not
be incurred, if it shall be made appear . . . that such false denomination
. . . happened by mistake or accident, and not from any intention to
defraud the revenue.” 7 Pet., at 406; see also Act of Mar. 2, 1799, §84, 1
Stat. 694. The Court concluded that the shipment at issue, entered as
“refined sugars,” was mislabeled under the prevailing meaning of that
term and thus was subject to forfeiture “unless the [petitioner] c[ould]
bring himself within the exceptio[n].” 7 Pet., at 409–410. As there had
been no “accident” or “mistake” of fact, the “only mistake, if there ha[d]
been any, [wa]s a mistake of law.” Id., at 410–411. The Court observed
that the shipper’s conduct, even if “entirely compatible with good faith,
[wa]s not wholly free from the suspicion of an intention to overreach . . .
by passing off, as refined sugars, what he well knew were not admitted
to be such.” Id., at 411. But the Court declined to resolve the case on
the ground of the shipper’s intent, instead invoking the “common
maxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of the law will not excuse
any person, either civilly or criminally.” Ibid. Notwithstanding the
existence of a statutory exception—which did not expressly exclude
legal errors from the category of “mistake[s]” made without “intention
to defraud”—the Court saw “not the least reason to suppose that the
legislature, in this enactment, had any intention to supersede the
common principle.” Ibid.
The dissent implies Barlow is too old to be relevant. Post, at 16. But
at least in the context of stare decisis, this Court has suggested prece
dents tend to gain, not lose, respect with age. See Montejo v. Louisi
ana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13). In any event, Justice
Story’s opinion for a unanimous Court in Barlow is hardly a relic. As
recently as 1994 this Court cited it for the “venerable principle” that
ignorance of the law generally is no defense. Ratzlaf v. United States,
510 U. S. 135, 149; see also Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199
(1991) (citing Barlow for a similar proposition).

discrimination,” 42 U. S. C. §1981a, but limiting punitive
damages to conduct undertaken “with malice or with
reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an
aggrieved individual,” §1981a(b)(1). We observed that in
some circumstances “intentional discrimination” could
occur without giving rise to punitive damages liability,
such as where an employer is “unaware of the relevant
federal prohibition” or acts with the “distinct belief that its
discrimination is lawful.” 527 U. S., at 536–537. See also
W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and
Keeton on Law of Torts 110 (5th ed. 1984) (“[I]f one inten
tionally interferes with the interests of others, he is often
subject to liability notwithstanding the invasion was made
under an erroneous belief as to some . . . legal matter that
would have justified the conduct”); Restatement (Second)
of Torts §164, and Comment e (1963–1964) (intentional
tort of trespass can be committed despite the actor’s
mistaken belief that she has a legal right to enter the
property).6
Likely for this reason, when Congress has intended to
provide a mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has
often done so more explicitly than here. In particular, the
FTC Act’s administrative-penalty provisions—which, as
noted above, Congress expressly incorporated into the
FDCPA—apply only when a debt collector acts with “ac
tual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of
objective circumstances” that its action was “prohibited by
——————
6 Different considerations apply, of course, in interpreting criminal
statutes. Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 57–58, n. 9
(2007). But even in that context, we have not consistently required
knowledge that the offending conduct is unlawful. See, e.g., Ellis v.
United States, 206 U. S. 246, 255, 257 (1907) (observing, in the context
of a statute imposing liability for “intentiona[l] violat[ions],” that “[i]f a
man intentionally adopts certain conduct in certain circumstances
known to him, and that conduct is forbidden by the law under those
circumstances, he intentionally breaks the law in the only sense in
which the law ever considers intent”).

Opinion of the Court

[the FDCPA].” 15 U. S. C. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C). Given the
absence of similar language in §1692k(c), it is a fair infer
ence that Congress chose to permit injured consumers to
recover actual damages, costs, fees, and modest statutory
damages for “intentional” conduct, including violations
resulting from mistaken interpretation of the FDCPA,
while reserving the more onerous penalties of the FTC Act
for debt collectors whose intentional actions also reflected
“knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum
stances” that the conduct was prohibited. Cf. 29 U. S. C.
§260 (authorizing courts to reduce liquidated damages
under the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 if an employer
demonstrates that “the act or omission giving rise to such
action was in good faith and that he had reasonable
grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a
violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938”); 17
U. S. C. §1203(c)(5)(A) (provision of Digital Millennium
Copyright Act authorizing court to reduce damages where
“the violator was not aware and had no reason to believe
that its acts constituted a violation”).
Congress also did not confine liability under the FDCPA
to “willful” violations, a term more often understood in the
civil context to excuse mistakes of law. See, e.g., Trans
World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125–126
(1985) (civil damages for “willful violations” of Age Dis
crimination in Employment Act of 1967 require a showing
that the employer “knew or showed reckless disregard for
the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited” (inter
nal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Safeco Ins. Co. of Amer
ica v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 57 (2007) (although “ ‘willfully’ ”
is a “ ‘word of many meanings’ ” dependent on context, “we
have generally taken it [when used as a statutory condi
tion of civil liability] to cover not only knowing violations
of a standard, but reckless ones as well” (quoting Bryan v.
United States, 524 U. S. 184, 191 (1998)). For this reason,
the dissent missteps in relying on Thurston and McLaugh

lin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 133 (1988), as both
cases involved the statutory phrase “willful violation.”
Post, at 3.
The dissent reaches a contrary conclusion based on the
interaction of the words “violation” and “not intentional”
in §1692k(c). Post, at 2–3. But even in the criminal con
text, cf. n. 6, supra, reference to a “knowing” or “inten
tional” “violation” or cognate terms has not necessarily
implied a defense for legal errors. See Bryan v. United
States, 524 U. S. 184, 192 (1998) (“ ‘[T]he knowledge requi
site to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge
as distinguished from knowledge of the law’ ” (quoting
Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 342 U. S. 337,
345 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting)); United States v.
International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402 U. S. 558,
559, 563 (1971) (statute imposing criminal liability on
those who “ ‘knowingly violat[e]’ ” regulations governing
transportation of corrosive chemicals does not require
“proof of [the defendant’s] knowledge of the law”); Ellis v.
United States, 206 U. S. 246, 255, 257 (1907) (rejecting
argument that criminal penalty applicable to those who
“intentionally violate” a statute “requires knowledge of the
law”).
The dissent advances a novel interpretative rule under
which the combination of a “mens rea requirement” and
the word “ ‘violation’ ” (as opposed to language specifying
“the conduct giving rise to the violation”) creates a mis
take-of-law defense. Post, at 2–3. Such a rule would be
remarkable in its breadth, applicable to the many scores of
civil and criminal provisions throughout the U. S. Code
that employ such a combination of terms. The dissent’s
theory draws no distinction between “knowing,” “inten
tional,” or “willful” and would abandon the care we have
traditionally taken to construe such words in their par
ticular statutory context. See, e.g., Safeco, supra, at 57.
More fundamentally, the dissent’s categorical rule is at

Opinion of the Court

odds with precedents such as Bryan, supra, at 192, and
International Minerals, supra, at 559, 563, in which we
rejected a mistake-of-law defense when a statute imposed
liability for a “knowing violation” or on those who “know
ingly violat[e]” the law.7
The dissent posits that the word “intentional,” in the
civil context, requires a higher showing of mens rea than
“willful” and thus that it should be easier to avoid liability
for intentional, rather than willful, violations. Post, at 4.
Even if the dissent is correct that the phrase “intentional
violation,” standing alone in a civil liability statute, might
be read to excuse mistakes of law, the FDCPA juxtaposes
the term “not intentional” “violation” in §1692k(c) with the
more specific language of §45(m)(1)(A), which refers to
——————
7 Indeed,

in International Minerals, the Court faced, and evidently
rejected, the distinction the dissent would draw today between the term
“ ‘violation’ ” and a reference to “the conduct giving rise to the violation.”
Post, at 3. As noted, in International Minerals, the Court rejected a
mistake-of-law defense for a statute that applied to those who “know
ingly violat[e]” certain regulations. 402 U. S., at 559, 563. In so doing,
however, we expressly acknowledged the contrary view adopted by one
lower court opinion that knowledge of the regulations was necessary.
Id., at 562 (citing St. Johnsbury Trucking Co. v. United States, 220
F. 2d 393, 397 (CA1 1955) (Magruder, C. J., concurring)). The dissent
ing opinion in International Minerals quoted extensively portions of the
St. Johnsbury concurrence that reached its result by contrasting a
statute making it an offense “ ‘ “knowingly” to sell adulterated milk’ ”
with one that makes it an offense “ ‘knowingly [to] violat[e] a regula
tion.’ ” 402 U. S., at 566 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (quoting St. Johns
bury, supra, at 398).
Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419 (1985), is also inapposite. Cf.
post, at 3 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Concluding that a mistake-of-law
defense is available under a provision that specifies particular conduct
undertaken while “ ‘knowing’ ” that food stamp coupons had been “ ‘used
in any manner in violation of [law],’ ” 471 U. S., at 428, n. 12, says little
about the meaning of a “not intentional” “violation” in 15 U. S. C.
§1692k(c). Indeed, the statute in Liparota bears a closer resemblance to
the administrative penalty provision in §45(m)(1)(A). See supra, at
8–9.

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


“actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis
of objective circumstances” that particular conduct was
unlawful. The dissent’s reading gives short shrift to that
textual distinction.
We draw additional support for the conclusion that bona
fide errors in §1692k(c) do not include mistaken interpre
tations of the FDCPA, from the requirement that a debt
collector maintain “procedures reasonably adapted to
avoid any such error.” The dictionary defines “procedure”
as “a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite
way.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1807
(1976). In that light, the statutory phrase is more natu
rally read to apply to processes that have mechanical or
other such “regular orderly” steps to avoid mistakes—for
instance, the kind of internal controls a debt collector
might adopt to ensure its employees do not communicate
with consumers at the wrong time of day, §1692c(a)(1), or
make false representations as to the amount of a debt,
§1692e(2). The dissent, like the Court of Appeals, finds
nothing unusual in attorney debt collectors maintaining
procedures to avoid legal error. Post, at 18; 538 F. 3d, at
476. We do not dispute that some entities may maintain
procedures to avoid legal errors. But legal reasoning is
not a mechanical or strictly linear process. For this rea
son, we find force in the suggestion by the Government (as
amicus curiae supporting Jerman) that the broad statu
tory requirement of procedures reasonably designed to
avoid “any” bona fide error indicates that the relevant
procedures are ones that help to avoid errors like clerical
or factual mistakes. Such procedures are more likely to
avoid error than those applicable to legal reasoning, par
ticularly in the context of a comprehensive and complex
federal statute such as the FDCPA that imposes open
ended prohibitions on, inter alia, “false, deceptive,”
§1692e, or “unfair” practices, §1692f. See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 16–18.

Opinion of the Court

Even if the text of §1692k(c), read in isolation, leaves
room for doubt, the context and history of the FDCPA
provide further reinforcement for construing that provi
sion not to shield violations resulting from misinterpreta
tions of the requirements of the Act. See Dada v. Mu
kasey, 554 U. S. 1, __ (2008) (slip op., at 13) (“In reading a
statute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but
consider in connection with it the whole statute” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). As described above, Congress
included in the FDCPA not only the bona fide error de
fense but also a separate protection from liability for “any
act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any
advisory opinion of the [FTC].” §1692k(e). In our view,
the Court of Appeals’ reading is at odds with the role
Congress evidently contemplated for the FTC in resolving
ambiguities in the Act. Debt collectors would rarely need
to consult the FTC if §1692k(c) were read to offer immu
nity for good-faith reliance on advice from private counsel.
Indeed, debt collectors might have an affirmative incentive
not to seek an advisory opinion to resolve ambiguity in the
law, as receipt of such advice would prevent them from
claiming good-faith immunity for violations and would
potentially trigger civil penalties for knowing violations
under the FTC Act.8 More importantly, the existence of a
separate provision that, by its plain terms, is more obvi
ously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil liabil
ity when the Act’s prohibitions are uncertain) weighs
against stretching the language of the bona fide error

defense to accommodate Carlisle’s expansive reading.9
Any remaining doubt about the proper interpretation of
§1692k(c) is dispelled by evidence of the meaning attached
to the language Congress copied into the FDCPA’s bona
fide error defense from a parallel provision in an existing
statute. TILA, 82 Stat. 146, was the first of several stat
utes collectively known as the Consumer Credit Protection
Act (CCPA) that now include the FDCPA. As enacted in
1968, §130(c) of TILA provided an affirmative defense that
was in pertinent part identical to the provision Congress
later enacted into the FDCPA: “A creditor may not be held
liable in any action brought under [TILA] if the creditor
shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation
was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error
notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasona
bly adapted to avoid any such error.” 82 Stat. 157 (codi
fied at 15 U. S. C. §1640(c)).
During the 9-year period between the enactment of
TILA and passage of the FDCPA, the three Federal Courts
of Appeals to consider the question interpreted TILA’s
bona fide error defense as referring to clerical errors; no
such court interpreted TILA to extend to violations result
ing from a mistaken legal interpretation of that Act.10 We

raises concerns about whether, in light of contemporary
administrative practice, the FTC safe harbor is a realistic way for debt
collectors and their lawyers to seek guidance on the numerous time
sensitive legal issues that arise in litigation. These practical concerns,
to which we return below, do not change our understanding of the
statutory text itself or the likely intent of the enacting Congress.

have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provi

1974) (similar).
Carlisle contends the meaning of TILA’s defense was unsettled at the
time of the FDCPA’s enactment, relying first on several District Court
opinions extending the defense to good-faith legal errors. See, e.g.,
Welmaker v. W. T. Grant Co., 365 F. Supp. 531, 544 (ND Ga. 1972).
But even assuming Congress would have looked to district court, rather
than court of appeals, opinions in discerning the meaning of the statu
tory language, applicable Circuit precedent had cast some doubt on
those decisions by the time the FDCPA was enacted. See, e.g., Turner
v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 537 F. 2d 1296, 1298 (CA5 1976) (per
curiam) (referring to §1640(c) as the “so-called clerical error defense”).
Carlisle also relies on the holding in Thrift Funds of Baton Rouge, Inc.
v. Jones, 274 So. 2d 150 (La. 1973). But in that case, the Louisiana
Supreme Court concluded only that a lender’s mistaken interpretation
of state usury law did not “amoun[t] to an intentional violation of
[TILA’s] disclosure requirements.” Id., at 161. The Louisiana court
had no occasion to address the question analogous to the one we con
sider today: whether TILA’s bona fide error defense extended to viola
tions resulting from mistaken interpretation of TILA itself. See n. 4,
supra; see also Starks v. Orleans Motors, Inc., 372 F. Supp. 928, 931
(ED La.) (distinguishing Thrift Funds on this basis), aff’d, 500 F. 2d
1182 (CA5 1974). These precedents therefore do not convince us that
Congress would have ascribed a different meaning to the statutory
language it chose for the FDCPA. Compare post, at 2 (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment), with Herman &
MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 384–386, and n. 21 (1983)
(concluding that Congress had “ratified” the “well-established judicial
interpretation” of a statute by leaving it intact during a comprehensive
revision, notwithstanding “[t]wo early district court decisions,” not
subsequently followed, that had adopted a contrary view).

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


Congress disagreed with those interpretations when it
enacted the FDCPA. Congress copied verbatim the perti
nent portions of TILA’s bona fide error defense into the
FDCPA. Compare 15 U. S. C. §1640(c) (1976 ed.) with
§813(c), 91 Stat. 881. This close textual correspondence
supports an inference that Congress understood the statu
tory formula it chose for the FDCPA consistent with Fed
eral Court of Appeals interpretations of TILA.11
Carlisle and the dissent urge reliance, consistent with
the approach taken by the Court of Appeals, on a 1980
amendment to TILA that added the following sentence to
that statute’s bona fide error defense: “Examples of a bona
fide error include, but are not limited to, clerical, calcula
tion, computer malfunction and program[m]ing, and print
ing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with
respect to a person’s obligations under [TILA] is not a
bona fide error.” See Truth in Lending Simplification and
Reform Act, §615, 94 Stat. 181. The absence of a corre
——————
11 That only three Courts of Appeals had occasion to address the ques
tion by the time the FDCPA was enacted does not render such an
inference unreasonable. Contra, post, at 1–2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).
Whether or not we would take that view when such an inference serves
as a court’s sole interpretative guide, here our conclusion also relies on
common principles of statutory interpretation, as well as the statute’s
text and structure. Moreover, the inference is supported by the fact
that TILA and the FDCPA were enacted as complementary titles of the
CCPA, a comprehensive consumer-protection statute.
While not
necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the legislative record dem
onstrates that some Members of Congress understood the relationship
between the FDCPA and existing provisions of the CCPA. See, e.g., 123
Cong. Rec. 10242 (1977) (remarks of Rep. Annunzio) (civil penalty
provisions in House version of bill were “consistent with those in the
[CCPA]”); Fair Debt Collection Practices Act: Hearings on S. 656 et al.
before the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs of the Senate Committee
on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 51, 707
(1977) (statement of Rep. Wylie) (describing “[c]ivil liability provisions”
in the House bill as “the standard provisions that attach to all the titles
of the [CCPA]”).

Opinion of the Court

sponding amendment to the FDCPA, Carlisle reasons, is
evidence of Congress’ intent to give a more expansive
scope to the FDCPA defense. For several reasons, we
decline to give the 1980 TILA amendment such interpreta
tive weight. For one, it is not obvious that the amendment
changed the scope of TILA’s bona fide error defense in a
way material to our analysis, given the uniform interpre
tations of three Courts of Appeals holding that the TILA
defense does not extend to mistakes of law.12 (Contrary to
——————
12 Although

again not necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the
legislative record suggests some Members of Congress understood the
amendment to “clarif[y]” the meaning of TILA’s bona fide error defense
“to make clear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,
provided they are not the result of erroneous legal judgments as to the
act’s requirements.” S. Rep. No. 96–73, pp. 7–8 (1979); see also Lock
hart, 153 A. L. R. Fed. 211–212, §2[a] (1999) (amendment “was in
tended merely to clarify what was then the prevailing view, that the
bona fide error defense applies to clerical errors, not including errors of
legal judgment”) (relying on S. Rep. No. 96–368, p. 32 (1979)).
The concurring and dissenting opinions perceive an inconsistency
between these references to clerical errors, as well as similar references
in the pre-FDCPA precedents interpreting TILA, n. 10, supra, and
reading the FDCPA’s bona fide error defense to include factual mis
takes. Post, at 2–4, and n. 2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 20
(KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The quoted legislative history sources,
however, while stating expressly that the TILA defense excludes legal
errors, do not discuss a distinction between clerical and factual errors.
Similarly, the cited cases interpreting TILA do not address a distinction
between factual and clerical errors; rather, the courts were presented
with claims that the defense applied to mistakes of law or other nonfac
tual errors that the courts found not to be bona fide. See Ives, 522
F. 2d, at 756–757; Haynes, 503 F. 2d, at 1166–1167; Palmer, 502 F. 2d,
at 861. While factual mistakes might, in some circumstances, consti
tute bona fide errors and give rise to violations that are “not inten
tional” within the meaning of §1692k(c), we need not and do not decide
today the precise distinction between clerical and factual errors, or
what kinds of factual mistakes qualify under the FDCPA’s bona fide
error defense. Cf. generally R. Hobbs, National Consumer Law Center,
Fair Debt Collection §7.2 (6th ed. 2008 and Supp. 2009) (surveying case
law on scope of §1692k(c)).

JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 21, this reading does not
render the 1980 amendment surplusage. Congress may
simply have intended to codify existing judicial interpreta
tions to remove any potential for doubt in jurisdictions
where courts had not yet addressed the issue.) It is also
unclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPA’s
defense to be broader than the one in TILA, which pre
sents at least as significant a set of concerns about impos
ing liability for uncertain legal obligations. See, e.g., Ford
Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980)
(TILA is “ ‘highly technical’ ”). Our reluctance to give
controlling weight to the TILA amendment in construing
the FDCPA is reinforced by the fact that Congress has not
expressly included mistakes of law in any of the numerous
bona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identi
cally to §1692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code. Compare,
e.g., 12 U. S. C. §4010(c)(2) (bona fide error defense in
Expedited Funds Availability Act expressly excluding “an
error of legal judgment with respect to [obligations under
that Act]”) with 15 U. S. C. §§1693m(c), 1693h(c) (bona
fide error provisions in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act
that are silent as to errors of legal judgment).13 Although
——————
13 The Government observes that several federal agencies have con
strued similar bona fide error defenses in statutes they administer to
exclude errors of law. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28–
30. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for instance,
has promulgated regulations specifying that the bona fide error defense
in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U. S. C.
§2607(d)(3), does not apply to “[a]n error of legal judgment,” 24 CFR
§3500.15(b)(1)(ii) (2009). While administrative interpretations of other
statutes do not control our reading of the FDCPA, we find it telling that
no agency has adopted the view of the Court of Appeals. Of course,
nothing in our opinion today addresses the validity of such regulations
or the authority of agencies interpreting bona fide error provisions in
other statutes to adopt a different reading. See National Cable &
Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967,
982–983 (2005).

Opinion of the Court

Carlisle points out that Congress has amended the
FDCPA on several occasions without expressly restricting
the scope of §1692k(c), that does not suggest Congress
viewed the statute as having the expansive reading Car
lisle advances, particularly as not until recently had a
Court of Appeals interpreted the bona fide error defense to
include a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a mistake
of law. See Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121–1124,
and nn. 14–15 (CA10 2002).
Carlisle’s reliance on Heintz, 514 U. S. 291, is also un
availing. We held in that case that the FDCPA’s defini
tion of “debt collector” includes lawyers who regularly,
through litigation, attempt to collect consumer debts. Id.,
at 292. We addressed a concern raised by the petitioner
(as here, a lawyer collecting a debt on behalf of a client)
that our reading would automatically render liable “any
litigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim
against a debtor,” on the ground that §1692e(5) prohibits a
debt collector from making any “ ‘threat to take action that
cannot legally be taken.’ ” Id., at 295. We expressed skep
ticism that §1692e(5) itself demanded such a result. But
even assuming the correctness of petitioner’s reading of
§1692e(5), we suggested that the availability of the bona
fide error defense meant that the prospect of liability for
litigating lawyers was not “so absurd” as to warrant im
plying a categorical exemption unsupported by the statu
tory text. Ibid. We had no occasion in Heintz to address
the overall scope of the bona fide error defense. Our dis
cussion of §1692e(5) did not depend on the premise that a
misinterpretation of the requirements of the Act would fall
under the bona fide error defense. In the mine-run law
suit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful be
cause of factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error.
Lawyers can, of course, invoke §1692k(c) for violations
resulting from qualifying factual errors.
Carlisle’s remaining arguments do not change our view


20

JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


of §1692k(c). Carlisle perceives an inconsistency between
our reading of the term “intentional” in that provision and
the instruction in §1692k(b) that a court look to whether
“noncompliance was intentional” in assessing statutory
additional damages. But assuming §1692k(b) encom
passes errors of law, we see no conflict, only congruence, in
reading the Act to permit a court to adjust statutory dam
ages for a good-faith misinterpretation of law, even where
a debt collector is not entitled to the categorical protection
of the bona fide error defense. Carlisle is also concerned
that under our reading, §1692k(c) would be unavailable to
a debt collector who violates a provision of the FDCPA
applying to acts taken with particular intent because in
such instances the relevant act would not be uninten
tional. See, e.g., §1692d(5) (prohibiting a debt collector
from “[c]ausing a telephone to ring . . . continuously with
intent to annoy, abuse, or harass”). Including mistakes as
to the scope of such a prohibition, Carlisle urges, would
ensure that §1692k(c) applied throughout the FDCPA. We
see no reason, however, why the bona fide error defense
must cover every provision of the Act.
The parties and amici make arguments concerning the
legislative history that we address for the sake of com
pleteness. Carlisle points to a sentence in a Senate Com
mittee Report stating that “[a] debt collector has no liabil
ity . . . if he violates the act in any manner, including with
regard to the act’s coverage, when such violation is unin
tentional and occurred despite procedures designed to
avoid such violations.” S. Rep. No. 95–382, p. 5 (1977); see
also post, at 4–6 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (discussing report).
But by its own terms, the quoted sentence does not unam
biguously support Carlisle’s reading. Even if a bona fide
mistake “with regard to the act’s coverage” could be read
in isolation to contemplate a mistake of law, that reading
does not exclude mistakes of fact. A mistake “with regard
to the act’s coverage” may derive wholly from a debt collec

Opinion of the Court

tor’s factually mistaken belief, for example, that a particu
lar debt arose out of a nonconsumer transaction and was
therefore not “covered” by the Act. There is no reason to
read this passing statement in the Senate Report as con
templating an exemption for legal error that is the product
of an attorney’s erroneous interpretation of the FDCPA—
particularly when attorneys were excluded from the Act’s
definition of “debt collector” until 1986. 100 Stat. 768.
Moreover, the reference to “any manner” of violation is
expressly qualified by the requirements that the violation
be “unintentional” and occur despite maintenance of ap
propriate procedures. In any event, we need not choose
between these possible readings of the Senate Report, as
the legislative record taken as a whole does not lend
strong support to Carlisle’s view.14 We therefore decline to
——————
14 For

instance, an amendment was proposed and rejected during the
Senate Banking Committee’s consideration of the FDCPA that would
have required proof that a debt collector’s violation was “knowin[g].”
Senator Riegle, one of the Act’s primary sponsors, opposed the change,
explaining that the bill reflected the view that “certain things ought not
to happen, period. . . . [W]hether somebody does it knowingly, willfully,
you know, with a good heart, bad heart, is really quite incidental.” See
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Markup
Session: S. 1130—Debt Collection Legislation 60 (July 26, 1977) (here
inafter Markup); see also ibid. (“We have left a way for these disputes
to be adj[u]dicated if they are brought, where somebody can say, I
didn’t know that, or my computer malfunctioned, something happened,
I didn’t intend for the effect to be as it was”). To similar effect, a House
Report on an earlier version of the bill explained the need for new
legislation governing use of the mails for debt collection on grounds
that existing statutes “frequently require[d]” a showing of “specific
intent[,] which is difficult to prove.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–131, p. 3 (1977).
Elsewhere, to be sure, the legislative record contains statements more
supportive of Carlisle’s interpretation. In particular, a concern was
raised in the July 26 markup session that the TILA bona fide error
defense had been interpreted “as only protecting against a mathemati
cal error,” and that the FDCPA defense should “go beyond” TILA to
“allow the courts discretion to dismiss a violation where it was a
technical error.” Markup 20. In response, a staffer explained that the

Carlisle, its amici, and the dissent raise the additional
concern that our reading will have unworkable practical
consequences for debt collecting lawyers. See, e.g., Brief
for Respondents 40–41, 45–48; NARCA Brief 4–16; post, at
5–14. Carlisle claims the FDCPA’s private enforcement
provisions have fostered a “cottage industry” of profes
sional plaintiffs who sue debt collectors for trivial viola
tions of the Act. See Brief for Respondents 40–41. If debt
collecting attorneys can be held personally liable for their
reasonable misinterpretations of the requirements of the
Act, Carlisle and its amici foresee a flood of lawsuits
against creditors’ lawyers by plaintiffs (and their attor
neys) seeking damages and attorney’s fees. The threat of
such liability, in the dissent’s view, creates an irreconcil
able conflict between an attorney’s personal financial
interest and her ethical obligation of zealous advocacy on
behalf of a client: An attorney uncertain about what the
FDCPA requires must choose between, on the one hand,
exposing herself to liability and, on the other, resolving
the legal ambiguity against her client’s interest or advis
ing the client to settle—even where there is substantial
legal authority for a position favoring the client. Post, at

——————
FDCPA defense would “apply to any violation of the act which was
unintentional,” and answered affirmatively when the Chairman asked:
“So it’s not simply a mathematical error but any bona fide error without

may be, we can conclude that this equivocal evidence from legislative
history does not displace the clear textual and contextual authority
discussed above.
15 The dissent also cites several other consumer-protection statutes,
such as TILA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U. S. C. §1681 et

23

Opinion of the Court

We do not believe our holding today portends such grave
consequences. For one, the FDCPA contains several pro
visions that expressly guard against abusive lawsuits,
thereby mitigating the financial risk to creditors’ attor
neys. When an alleged violation is trivial, the “actual
damage[s]” sustained, §1692k(a)(1), will likely be de
minimis or even zero. The Act sets a cap on “additional”
damages, §1692k(a)(2), and vests courts with discretion to
adjust such damages where a violation is based on a good
faith error, §1692k(b). One amicus suggests that attor
ney’s fees may shape financial incentives even where
actual and statutory damages are modest. NARCA Brief
11. The statute does contemplate an award of costs and “a
reasonable attorney’s fee as determined by the court” in
the case of “any successful action to enforce the foregoing
liability.” §1692k(a)(3). But courts have discretion in
calculating reasonable attorney’s fees under this statute,16
——————
perceives to be a “troubling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the
system to spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law into
lucrative litigation.” Post, at 5–6. The dissent’s concern is primarily
with Congress’ policy choice, embodied in statutory text, to authorize
private rights of action and recovery of attorney’s fees, costs, and in
some cases, both actual and statutory damages. As noted, in one of the
statutes the dissent cites, Congress explicitly barred reliance on a
mistake-of-law defense notwithstanding the “highly technical” nature of
the scheme. See 15 U. S. C. §1640(c) (TILA); Ford Motor Credit Co. v.
Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980). Similarly, the plain text of the
FDCPA authorizes a private plaintiff to recover not only “actual dam
age[s]” for harm suffered but also “such additional damages as the
court may allow,” §1692k(a).
16 The Courts of Appeals generally review a District Court’s calcula
tion of an attorney fee award under §1692k for abuse of discretion. See,
e.g., Carroll v. Wolpoff & Abramson, 53 F. 3d 626, 628–629 (CA4 1995);
Emanuel v. American Credit Exchange, 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989).
Many District Courts apply a lodestar method, permitting downward
adjustments in appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., Schlacher v. Law
Offices of Phillip J. Rotche & Assoc., P. C., 574 F. 3d 852 (CA7 2009)
(relying on Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983)); Ferland v.
Conrad Credit Corp., 244 F. 3d 1145, 1148–1151, and n. 4 (CA9 2001)

Opinion of the Court 


and §1692k(a)(3) authorizes courts to award attorney’s
fees to the defendant if a plaintiff’s suit “was brought in
bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.”
Lawyers also have recourse to the affirmative defense in
§1692k(c). Not every uncertainty presented in litigation
stems from interpretation of the requirements of the Act
itself; lawyers may invoke the bona fide error defense, for
instance, where a violation results from a qualifying fac
tual error. Jerman and the Government suggest that
lawyers can entirely avoid the risk of misinterpreting the
Act by obtaining an advisory opinion from the FTC under
§1692k(e). Carlisle fairly observes that the FTC has not
frequently issued such opinions, and that the average
processing time may present practical difficulties. Indeed,
the Government informed us at oral argument that the
FTC has issued only four opinions in the past decade (in
response to seven requests), and the FTC’s response time
——————
(per curiam); see generally Hobbs, Fair Debt Collection §6.8.6. In
Schlacher, for instance, the court affirmed a downward adjustment for
the “unnecessary use of multiple attorneys . . . in a straightforward,
short-lived [FDCPA] case.” 574 F. 3d, at 854–855. In Carroll, the court
found no abuse of discretion in a District Court’s award of a $500
attorney’s fee, rather than the lodestar amount, where the lawsuit had
recovered only $50 in damages for “at most a technical violation” of the
FDCPA. 53 F. 3d, at 629–631.
Lower courts have taken different views about when, and whether,
§1692k requires an award of attorney’s fees. Compare Tolentino v.
Friedman, 46 F. 3d 645 (CA7 1995) (award of fees to a successful
plaintiff “mandatory”), and Emanuel, supra, at 808–809 (same, even
where the plaintiff suffered no actual damages), with Graziano, 950 F.
2d, at 114, and n. 13 (attorney’s fees may be denied for plaintiff’s “bad
faith conduct”), and Johnson v. Eaton, 80 F. 3d 148, 150–152 (CA5
1996) (“attorney’s fees . . . are only available [under §1692k] where the
plaintiff has succeeded in establishing that the defendant is liable for
actual and/or additional damages”; this reading “will deter suits
brought only as a means of generating attorney’s fees”). We need not
resolve these issues today to express doubt that our reading

has typically been three or four months. Tr. of Oral Arg.
27–28, 30. Without disregarding the possibility that the
FTC advisory opinion process might be useful in some
cases, evidence of present administrative practice makes
us reluctant to place significant weight on §1692k(e) as a
practical remedy for the concerns Carlisle has identified.
We are unpersuaded by what seems an implicit premise
of Carlisle’s arguments: that the bona fide error defense is
a debt collector’s sole recourse to avoid potential liability.
We addressed a similar argument in Heintz, in which the
petitioner urged that certain of the Act’s substantive
provisions would generate “ ‘anomalies’ ” if the term “debt
collector” was read to include litigating lawyers. 514
U. S., at 295. Among other things, the petitioner in Heintz
contended that §1692c(c)’s bar on further communication
with a consumer who notifies a debt collector that she is
refusing to pay the debt would prohibit a lawyer from
filing a lawsuit to collect the debt. Id., at 296–297. We
agreed it would be “odd” if the Act interfered in this way
with “an ordinary debt-collecting lawsuit” but suggested
§1692c(c) did not demand such a reading in light of several
exceptions in the text of that provision itself. Ibid. As in
Heintz, we need not authoritatively interpret the Act’s
conduct-regulating provisions to observe that those provi
sions should not be assumed to compel absurd results
when applied to debt collecting attorneys.
To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a
lawyer’s advocacy on behalf of a client, it is hardly unique
in our law. “[A]n attorney’s ethical duty to advance the
interests of his client is limited by an equally solemn duty
to comply with the law and standards of professional
conduct.” Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).
Lawyers face sanctions, among other things, for suits
presented “for any improper purpose, such as to harass,
cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of
litigation.” Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11(b), (c). Model rules of

professional conduct adopted by many States impose outer
bounds on an attorney’s pursuit of a client’s interests.
See, e.g., ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 3.1
(2009) (requiring nonfrivolous basis in law and fact for
claims asserted); 4.1 (truthfulness to third parties). In
some circumstances, lawyers may face personal liability
for conduct undertaken during representation of a client.
See, e.g., Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate
Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 191 (1994) (“Any
person or entity, including a lawyer, . . . who employs a
manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or
omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities
relies may be liable as a primary violator under [Securities
and Exchange Commission Rule] 10b–5”).
Moreover, a lawyer’s interest in avoiding FDCPA liabil
ity may not always be adverse to her client. Some courts
have held clients vicariously liable for their lawyers’ viola
tions of the FDCPA. See, e.g., Fox v. Citicorp Credit
Servs., Inc., 15 F. 3d 1507, 1516 (CA9 1994); see also First
Interstate Bank of Fort Collins, N. A. v. Soucie, 924 P. 2d
1200, 1202 (Colo. App. 1996).
The suggestion that our reading of §1692k(c) will create
unworkable consequences is also undermined by the exis
tence of numerous state consumer protection and debt
collection statutes that contain bona fide error defenses
that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal
errors.17 Several States have enacted debt collection
statutes that contain neither an exemption for attorney
debt collectors nor any bona fide error defense at all. See,
e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93, §49 (West 2008); Md. Com.
Law Code Ann. §14–203 (Lexis 2005); Ore. Rev. Stat.

Opinion of the Court

§646.641 (2007); Wis. Stat. §427.105 (2007–2008). More
generally, a group of 21 States as amici supporting Jer
man inform us they are aware of “no [judicial] decisions
interpreting a parallel state bona fide error provision [in a
civil regulatory statute] to immunize a defendant’s mis
take of law,” except in a minority of statutes that ex
pressly provide to the contrary.18 See Brief for State of
New York et al. as Amici Curiae 11, and n. 6. Neither
Carlisle and its amici nor the dissent demonstrate that
lawyers have suffered drastic consequences under these
state regimes.
In the dissent’s view, these policy concerns are evidence
that “Congress could not have intended” the reading we
adopt today. Post, at 5. But the dissent’s reading raises
concerns of its own. The dissent focuses on the facts of
this case, in which an attorney debt collector, in the dis
sent’s view, “acted reasonably at every step” and commit
ted a “technical violation” resulting in no “actual harm” to
the debtor. Post, at 12, 6, 8. But the dissent’s legal theory
does not limit the defense to attorney debt collectors or
“technical” violations.19 Under that approach, it appears,
nonlawyer debt collectors could obtain blanket immunity
for mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA simply by
seeking the advice of legal counsel. Moreover, many debt
collectors are compensated with a percentage of money
recovered, and so will have a financial incentive to press

Consumer Credit Code providing a defense for a “bona fide error of law

fide error of law or fact” in Indiana Home Loan Practices Act).
19 The dissent also downplays the predicate fact that respondents in
this case brought a foreclosure lawsuit against Jerman for a debt she
had already repaid. Neither the lower courts nor this Court have been
asked to consider, and thus we express no view about, whether Carlisle
could be subject to liability under the FDCPA for that uncontested
error—regardless of how reasonably Carlisle may have acted after the
mistake was pointed out by Jerman’s (privately retained) lawyer.

the boundaries of the Act’s prohibitions on collection tech
niques. It is far from obvious why immunizing debt collec
tors who adopt aggressive but mistaken interpretations of
the law would be consistent with the statute’s broadly
worded prohibitions on debt collector misconduct. Jerman
and her amici express further concern that the dissent’s
reading would give a competitive advantage to debt collec
tors who press the boundaries of lawful conduct. They
foresee a “race to the bottom” driving ethical collectors out
of business. Brief for Petitioner 32; Brief for Public Citi
zen et al. as Amici Curiae 16–18. It is difficult to square
such a result with Congress’ express purpose “to eliminate
abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, [and]
to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using
abusive debt collection practices are not competitively
disadvantaged,” §1692(e).
The dissent’s reading also invites litigation about a debt
collector’s subjective intent to violate the FDCPA and the
adequacy of procedures maintained to avoid legal error.
Cf. Barlow, 7 Pet., at 411 (maxim that ignorance of the
law will not excuse civil or criminal liability “results from
the extreme difficulty of ascertaining what is, bona fide,
the interpretation of the party”).
Courts that read
§1692k(c) to permit a mistake-of-law defense have adopted
varying formulations of what legal procedures are “rea
sonably adapted to avoid any [legal] error.”20 Among other
uncertainties, the dissent does not explain whether it

recent case law, or hav[ing] an individual responsible for continuing
compliance with the FDCPA”), with Johnson v. Riddle, 443 F. 3d 723,
730–731 (CA10 2006) (suggesting that researching case law and filing a
test case might be sufficient, but remanding for a jury determination of
whether the “limited [legal] analysis” undertaken was sufficient and
whether the test case was in fact a “sham”).

Opinion of the Court

would read §1692k(c) to impose a heightened standard for
the procedures attorney debt collectors must maintain, as
compared to nonattorney debt collectors. The increased
cost to prospective plaintiffs in time, fees, and uncertainty
of outcome may chill private suits under the statutory
right of action, undermining the FDCPA’s calibrated
scheme of statutory incentives to encourage self
enforcement. Cf. FTC, Collecting Consumer Debts: The
Challenge of Change 67 (2009) (“Because the Commission
receives more than 70,000 third-party debt collection
complaints per year, it is not feasible for federal govern
ment law enforcement to be the exclusive or primary
means of deterring all possible law violations”). The state
amici predict that, on the dissent’s reading, consumers
will have little incentive to bring enforcement actions
“where the law [i]s at all unsettled, because in such cir
cumstances a debt collector could easily claim bona fide
error of law”; in the States’ view, the resulting “enforce
ment gap” would be “extensive” at both the federal and
State levels. See Brief for State of New York et al. as
Amici Curiae 7–10. In short, the policy concerns identified
by the dissent tell only half the story.21
In sum, we do not foresee that our decision today will
place unmanageable burdens on lawyers practicing in the
debt collection industry. To the extent debt collecting
lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations of the
requirements of the FDCPA, Carlisle, its amici, and the
dissent have not shown that “the result [will be] so absurd
as to warrant” disregarding the weight of textual author

concerns . . . for First Amendment rights.” Post, at 13 (citing Legal

claim was neither raised nor passed upon below, and was mentioned
neither in the certiorari papers nor the parties’ merits briefing to this
Court. We decline to express any view on it. See Cutter v. Wilkinson,
544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005).

ity discussed above. Heintz, 514 U. S., at 295. Absent
such a showing, arguments that the Act strikes an unde
sirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpre
tation are properly addressed to Congress. To the extent
Congress is persuaded that the policy concerns identified
by the dissent require a recalibration of the FDCPA’s
liability scheme, it is, of course, free to amend the statute
accordingly.22 Congress has wide latitude, for instance, to
revise §1692k to excuse some or all mistakes of law or
grant broader discretion to district courts to adjust a
plaintiff’s recovery. This Court may not, however, read
more into §1692k(c) than the statutory language naturally
supports. We therefore hold that the bona fide error de
fense in §1692k(c) does not apply to a violation of the
FDCPA resulting from a debt collector’s incorrect interpre
tation of the requirements of that statute.

For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

22 The FDCPA has been amended some eight times since its enact
ment in 1977; the most recent amendment addressed a concern not
unrelated to the question we consider today, specifying that a pleading
in a civil action is not an “initial communication” triggering obligations
under §1692g requiring a written notice to the consumer. Financial
Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, §802(a), 120 Stat. 2006 (codified
at 15 U. S. C. §1692g(d)).
