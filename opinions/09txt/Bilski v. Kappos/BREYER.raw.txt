BERNARD L. BILSKI AND RAND A. WARSAW, 

PETITIONERS v. DAVID J. KAPPOS, UNDER 

SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTEL- 

LECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, 

PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[June 28, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins as to
Part II, concurring in the judgment.
I
I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that a “general method of
engaging in business transactions” is not a patentable
“process” within the meaning of 35 U. S. C. §101. Ante, at
2 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). This Court has
never before held that so-called “business methods” are
patentable, and, in my view, the text, history, and pur
poses of the Patent Act make clear that they are not.
Ante, at 10–47. I would therefore decide this case on that
ground, and I join JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion in full.
I write separately, however, in order to highlight the
substantial agreement among many Members of the Court
on many of the fundamental issues of patent law raised by
this case. In light of the need for clarity and settled law in
this highly technical area, I think it appropriate to do so.
II
In addition to the Court’s unanimous agreement that
the claims at issue here are unpatentable abstract ideas, it
is my view that the following four points are consistent

BILSKI v. KAPPOS
BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

with both the opinion of the Court and JUSTICE STEVENS’
opinion concurring in the judgment:
First, although the text of §101 is broad, it is not with
out limit. See ante, at 4–5 (opinion of the Court); ante, at
10 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). “[T]he underly
ing policy of the patent system [is] that ‘the things which
are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive
patent,’ . . . must outweigh the restrictive effect of the
limited patent monopoly.” Graham v. John Deere Co. of
Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 10–11 (1966) (quoting Letter
from Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13,
1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washing
ton ed.)). The Court has thus been careful in interpreting
the Patent Act to “determine not only what is protected,
but also what is free for all to use.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v.
Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 151 (1989). In
particular, the Court has long held that “[p]henomena of
nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and
abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable” under
§101, since allowing individuals to patent these funda
mental principles would “wholly pre-empt” the public’s
access to the “basic tools of scientific and technological
work.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67, 72 (1972);
see also, e.g., Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981);
Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980).
Second, in a series of cases that extend back over a
century, the Court has stated that “[t]ransformation and
reduction of an article to a different state or thing is the
clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not
include particular machines.” Diehr, supra, at 184 (em
phasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also,
e.g., Benson, supra, at 70; Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584,
588, n. 9 (1978); Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788
(1877). Application of this test, the so-called “machine-or
transformation test,” has thus repeatedly helped the Court
to determine what is “a patentable ‘process.’ ” Flook, supra,

at 589.
Third, while the machine-or-transformation test has
always been a “useful and important clue,” it has never
been the “sole test” for determining patentability. Ante, at
8; see also ante, at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg
ment); Benson, supra, at 71 (rejecting the argument that
“no process patent could ever qualify” for protection under
§101 “if it did not meet the [machine-or-transformation]
requirements”). Rather, the Court has emphasized that a
process claim meets the requirements of §101 when, “con
sidered as a whole,” it “is performing a function which the
patent laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming or
reducing an article to a different state or thing).” Diehr,
supra, at 192. The machine-or-transformation test is thus
an important example of how a court can determine pat
entability under §101, but the Federal Circuit erred in this
case by treating it as the exclusive test.
Fourth, although the machine-or-transformation test is
not the only test for patentability, this by no means indi
cates that anything which produces a “ ‘useful, concrete,
and tangible result,’ ” State Street Bank & Trust Co. v.
Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA
Fed. 1998), is patentable. “[T]his Court has never made
such a statement and, if taken literally, the statement
would cover instances where this Court has held the con
trary.” Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabo
lite Laboratories, Inc., 548 U. S. 124, 136 (2006) (BREYER,
J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently
granted); see also, e.g., O’Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 117
(1854); Flook, supra, at 590. Indeed, the introduction of
the “useful, concrete, and tangible result” approach to
patentability, associated with the Federal Circuit’s State
Street decision, preceded the granting of patents that
“ranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly ab
surd.” In re Bilski, 545 F. 3d 943, 1004 (CA Fed. 2008)
(Mayer, J., dissenting) (citing patents on, inter alia, a

BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

“method of training janitors to dust and vacuum using
video displays,” a “system for toilet reservations,” and a
“method of using color-coded bracelets to designate dating
status in order to limit ‘the embarrassment of rejection’ ”);
see also Brief for Respondent 40–41, and n. 20 (listing
dubious patents). To the extent that the Federal Circuit’s
decision in this case rejected that approach, nothing in
today’s decision should be taken as disapproving of that
determination. See ante, at 16; ante, at 2, n. 1 (STEVENS,
J., concurring in judgment).
In sum, it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the
“machine-or-transformation” test is not necessarily the
sole test of patentability, the Court intends neither to de
emphasize the test’s usefulness nor to suggest that many
patentable processes lie beyond its reach.
III
With these observations, I concur in the Court’s
judgment.
