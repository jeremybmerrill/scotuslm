ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

[June 28, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
GINSBURG, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.
The Court holds unconstitutional a statute providing
that the Securities and Exchange Commission can remove
members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board from office only for cause. It argues that granting
the “inferior officer[s]” on the Accounting Board “more
than one level of good-cause protection . . . contravenes the
President’s ‘constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful
execution of the laws.’ ” Ante, at 2. I agree that the Ac
counting Board members are inferior officers. See ante, at
28–29. But in my view the statute does not significantly
interfere with the President’s “executive Power.” Art. II,
§1. It violates no separation-of-powers principle. And the
Court’s contrary holding threatens to disrupt severely the
fair and efficient administration of the laws. I conse
quently dissent.

A

The legal question before us arises at the intersection of
two general constitutional principles. On the one hand,
Congress has broad power to enact statutes “necessary
and proper” to the exercise of its specifically enumerated

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


constitutional authority. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. As Chief Jus
tice Marshall wrote for the Court nearly 200 years ago, the
Necessary and Proper Clause reflects the Framers’ efforts
to create a Constitution that would “endure for ages to
come.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).
It embodies their recognition that it would be “unwise” to
prescribe “the means by which government should, in all
future time, execute its powers.” Ibid. Such “immutable
rules” would deprive the Government of the needed flexi
bility to respond to future “exigencies which, if foreseen at
all, must have been seen dimly.” Ibid. Thus the Neces
sary and Proper Clause affords Congress broad authority
to “create” governmental “ ‘offices’ ” and to structure those
offices “as it chooses.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138
(1976) (per curiam); cf. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355
(1903). And Congress has drawn on that power over the
past century to create numerous federal agencies in re
sponse to “various crises of human affairs” as they have
arisen. McCulloch, supra, at 415 (emphasis deleted). Cf.
Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 36–37 (1950).
On the other hand, the opening sections of Articles I, II,
and III of the Constitution separately and respectively
vest “all legislative Powers” in Congress, the “executive
Power” in the President, and the “judicial Power” in the
Supreme Court (and such “inferior Courts as Congress
may from time to time ordain and establish”). In doing so,
these provisions imply a structural separation-of-powers
principle. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 341–
342 (2000). And that principle, along with the instruction
in Article II, §3 that the President “shall take Care that
the Laws be faithfully executed,” limits Congress’ power to
structure the Federal Government. See, e.g., INS v.
Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983); Freytag v. Commis
sioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878 (1991); Northern Pipeline
Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 64
(1982); Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478

BREYER, J., dissenting

U. S. 833, 859–860 (1986). Indeed, this Court has held
that the separation-of-powers principle guarantees the
President the authority to dismiss certain Executive
Branch officials at will. Myers v. United States, 272 U. S.
52 (1926).
But neither of these two principles is absolute in its
application to removal cases. The Necessary and Proper
Clause does not grant Congress power to free all Execu
tive Branch officials from dismissal at the will of the
President. Ibid. Nor does the separation-of-powers prin
ciple grant the President an absolute authority to remove
any and all Executive Branch officials at will. Rather,
depending on, say, the nature of the office, its function, or
its subject matter, Congress sometimes may, consistent
with the Constitution, limit the President’s authority to
remove an officer from his post. See Humphrey’s Executor
v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), overruling in part
Myers, supra; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988).
And we must here decide whether the circumstances
surrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.
In answering the question presented, we cannot look to
more specific constitutional text, such as the text of the
Appointments Clause or the Presentment Clause, upon
which the Court has relied in other separation-of-powers
cases. See, e.g., Chadha, supra, at 946; Buckley, supra, at
124–125. That is because, with the exception of the gen
eral “vesting” and “take care” language, the Constitution
is completely “silent with respect to the power of removal
from office.” Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 258 (1839); see
also Morrison, supra, at 723 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)
(“There is, of course, no provision in the Constitution
stating who may remove executive officers . . . ”).
Nor does history offer significant help. The President’s
power to remove Executive Branch officers “was not dis
cussed in the Constitutional Convention.” Myers, supra,
at 109–110. The First Congress enacted federal statutes


4

FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


that limited the President’s ability to oversee Executive
Branch officials, including the Comptroller of the United
States, federal district attorneys (precursors to today’s
United States Attorneys), and, to a lesser extent, the
Secretary of the Treasury. See, e.g., Lessig, Readings By
Our Unitary Executive, 15 Cardozo L. Rev. 175, 183–184
(1993); Teifer, The Constitutionality of Independent Offi
cers as Checks on Abuses of Executive Power, 63 B. U. L.
Rev. 59, 74–75 (1983); Casper, An Essay in Separation of
Powers: Some Early Versions and Practices, 30 Wm. &
Mary L. Rev. 211, 240–241 (1989) (hereinafter Casper); H.
Bruff, Balance of Forces: Separation of Powers in the
Administrative State 414–417 (2006). But those statutes
did not directly limit the President’s authority to remove
any of those officials—“a subject” that was “much dis
puted” during “the early history of this government,” “and
upon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained.”
Hennen, supra, at 259; see also United States ex rel. Good
rich v. Guthrie, 17 How. 284, 306 (1855) (McLean, J.,
dissenting); Casper 233–237 (recounting the Debate of
1789). Scholars, like Members of this Court, have contin
ued to disagree, not only about the inferences that should
be drawn from the inconclusive historical record, but also
about the nature of the original disagreement. Compare
ante, at 11; Myers, supra, at 114 (majority opinion of Taft,
C. J.); and Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91
Cornell L. Rev. 1021 (2006), with, e.g., Myers, supra, at
194 (McReynolds, J., dissenting); Corwin, Tenure of Office
and the Removal Power Under the Constitution, 27 Colum.
L. Rev. 353, 369 (1927); Lessig & Sunstein, The President
and the Administration, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 25–26 (1994)
(hereinafter Lessig & Sunstein); and L. Fisher, President
and Congress: Power and Policy 86–89 (1972).
Nor does this Court’s precedent fully answer the ques
tion presented. At least it does not clearly invalidate the
provision in dispute. See Part II–C, infra. In Myers,

5

BREYER, J., dissenting

supra, the Court invalidated—for the first and only time—
a congressional statute on the ground that it unduly lim
ited the President’s authority to remove an Executive
Branch official. But soon thereafter the Court expressly
disapproved most of Myers’ broad reasoning. See Hum
phrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 626–627, overruling in part
Myers, supra; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349, 352
(1958) (stating that Humphrey’s Executor “explicitly ‘dis
approved’ ” of much of the reasoning in Myers). Moreover,
the Court has since said that “the essence of the decision
in Myers was the judgment that the Constitution prevents
Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the power to remove
or the right to participate in the exercise of that power.’ ”
Morrison, supra, at 686 (emphasis added). And that fea
ture of the statute—a feature that would aggrandize the
power of Congress—is not present here. Congress has not
granted itself any role in removing the members of the
Accounting Board. Cf. Freytag, 501 U. S., at 878 (“separa
tion-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the
danger of one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the
expense of another branch” (emphasis added)); Buckley,
424 U. S., at 129 (same); Schor, 478 U. S., at 856 (same);
Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 727 (1986) (same). Com
pare Myers, supra, (striking down statute where Congress
granted itself removal authority over Executive Branch
official), with Humphrey’s Executor, supra, (upholding
statute where such aggrandizing was absent); Wiener,
supra (same); Morrison, supra (same).
In short, the question presented lies at the intersection
of two sets of conflicting, broadly framed constitutional
principles. And no text, no history, perhaps no precedent
provides any clear answer. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527
U. S. 41, 106 (1999) (THOMAS, J., joined by Rehnquist,
C. J., and SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that
“this Court” is “most vulnerable” when “it deals with
judge-made constitutional law” that lacks “roots in the

BREYER, J., dissenting 


language” of the Constitution (internal quotation marks
omitted)).
B
When previously deciding this kind of nontextual ques
tion, the Court has emphasized the importance of examin
ing how a particular provision, taken in context, is likely
to function. Thus, in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 53
(1932), a foundational separation-of-powers case, the
Court said that “regard must be had, as in other cases
where constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere mat
ters of form, but to the substance of what is required.”
The Court repeated this injunction in Schor and again in
Morrison. See Schor, supra, at 854 (stating that the Court
must look “ ‘beyond form to the substance of what’ Con
gress has done”); Morrison, 487 U. S., at 689–690 (“The
analysis contained in our removal cases is designed not to
define rigid categories of those officials who may or may
not be removed at will by the President,” but rather asks
whether, given the “functions of the officials in question,”
a removal provision “interfere[s] with the President’s
exercise of the ‘executive power’ ” (emphasis added)). The
Court has thereby written into law Justice Jackson’s wise
perception that “the Constitution . . . contemplates that
practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a worka
ble government.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (opinion concurring in judgment)
(emphasis added). See also ibid. (“The actual art of gov
erning under our Constitution does not and cannot con
form to judicial definitions of the power of any of its
branches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles
torn from context”).
It is not surprising that the Court in these circum
stances has looked to function and context, and not to
bright-line rules. For one thing, that approach embodies
the intent of the Framers. As Chief Justice Marshall long

7

BREYER, J., dissenting

ago observed, our Constitution is fashioned so as to allow
the three coordinate branches, including this Court, to
exercise practical judgment in response to changing condi
tions and “exigencies,” which at the time of the founding
could be seen only “dimly,” and perhaps not at all.
McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415.
For another, a functional approach permits Congress
and the President the flexibility needed to adapt statutory
law to changing circumstances. That is why the “powers
conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitu
tion were phrased in language broad enough to allow for
the expansion of the Federal Government’s role” over time.
New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992).
Indeed, the Federal Government at the time of the found
ing consisted of about 2,000 employees and served a popu
lation of about 4 million. See Kaufman, The Growth of the
Federal Personnel System, in The Federal Government
Service 7, 8 (W. Sayre 2d ed. 1965); Dept. of Commerce,
Census Bureau, Historical Statistics of the United States:
Colonial Times to 1970, pt. 1, p. 8 (1975). Today, however,
the Federal Government employs about 4.4 million work
ers who serve a Nation of more than 310 million people
living in a society characterized by rapid technological,
economic, and social change. See Office of Management
and Budget, Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U. S.
Government, Fiscal Year 2010, p. 368 (2009).
Federal statutes now require or permit Government
officials to provide, regulate, or otherwise administer, not
only foreign affairs and defense, but also a wide variety of
such subjects as taxes, welfare, social security, medicine,
pharmaceutical drugs, education, highways, railroads,
electricity, natural gas, nuclear power, financial instru
ments, banking, medical care, public health and safety,
the environment, fair employment practices, consumer
protection and much else besides. Those statutes create a
host of different organizational structures. Sometimes

BREYER, J., dissenting 


they delegate administrative authority to the President
directly, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §2031(a)(1); 42 U. S. C. §5192(c);
sometimes they place authority in a long-established
Cabinet department, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §1637b(c)(1); 12
U. S. C. §5221(b)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. II); sometimes they
delegate authority to an independent commission or board,
e.g., 15 U. S. C. §4404(b); 28 U. S. C. §994; sometimes they
place authority directly in the hands of a single senior
administrator, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §657d(c)(4); 42 U. S. C.
§421; sometimes they place it in a sub-cabinet bureau,
office, division or other agency, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §4048;
sometimes they vest it in multimember or multiagency
task groups, e.g. 5 U. S. C. §§593–594; 50 U. S. C. §402
(2006 ed. and Supp. II); sometimes they vest it in commis
sions or advisory committees made up of members of more
than one branch, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §42(a); 28 U. S. C.
§991(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 42 U. S. C. §1975; sometimes
they divide it among groups of departments, commissions,
bureaus, divisions, and administrators, e.g., 5 U. S. C.
§9902(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 7 U. S. C. §136i–1(g); and
sometimes they permit state or local governments to
participate as well, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §2009aa–1(a). Statutes
similarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers—
for example, the power to make rules, develop informal
practices, investigate, adjudicate, impose sanctions, grant
licenses, and provide goods, services, advice, and so forth.
See generally 5 U. S. C. §500 et seq.
The upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes gov
erning vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast
numbers of different problems, provide for, or foresee,
their execution or administration through the work of
administrators organized within many different kinds of
administrative structures, exercising different kinds of
administrative authority, to achieve their legislatively
mandated objectives. And, given the nature of the Gov
ernment’s work, it is not surprising that administrative

BREYER, J., dissenting

units come in many different shapes and sizes.
The functional approach required by our precedents
recognizes this administrative complexity and, more im
portantly, recognizes the various ways presidential power
operates within this context—and the various ways in
which a removal provision might affect that power. As
human beings have known ever since Ulysses tied himself
to the mast so as safely to hear the Sirens’ song, some
times it is necessary to disable oneself in order to achieve
a broader objective. Thus, legally enforceable commit
ments—such as contracts, statutes that cannot instantly
be changed, and, as in the case before us, the establish
ment of independent administrative institutions—hold the
potential to empower precisely because of their ability to
constrain. If the President seeks to regulate through
impartial adjudication, then insulation of the adjudicator
from removal at will can help him achieve that goal. And
to free a technical decisionmaker from the fear of removal
without cause can similarly help create legitimacy with
respect to that official’s regulatory actions by helping to
insulate his technical decisions from nontechnical political
pressure.
Neither is power always susceptible to the equations of
elementary arithmetic. A rule that takes power from a
President’s friends and allies may weaken him. But a rule
that takes power from the President’s opponents may
strengthen him. And what if the rule takes power from a
functionally neutral independent authority? In that case,
it is difficult to predict how the President’s power is af
fected in the abstract.
These practical reasons not only support our precedents’
determination that cases such as this should examine the
specific functions and context at issue; they also indicate
that judges should hesitate before second-guessing a “for
cause” decision made by the other branches. See, e.g.,
Chadha, 462 U. S., at 944 (applying a “presumption that

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


the challenged statute is valid”); Bowsher, 478 U. S., at
736 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Compared to
Congress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an
inferior understanding of the realities of administration,
and the manner in which power, including and most espe
cially political power, operates in context.
There is no indication that the two comparatively more
expert branches were divided in their support for the “for
cause” provision at issue here. In this case, the Act em
bodying the provision was passed by a vote of 423 to 3 in
the House of Representatives and a by vote of 99 to 0 in the
Senate. 148 Cong. Rec. 14458, 14505 (2002). The creation
of the Accounting Board was discussed at great length in
both bodies without anyone finding in its structure any
constitutional problem. See id., at 12035–12037, 12112–
12132, 12315–12323, 12372–12377, 12488–12508, 12529–
12534, 12612–12618, 12673–12680, 12734–12751, 12915–
12960, 13347–13354, 14439–14458, 14487–14506. The
President signed the Act. And, when he did so, he issued a
signing statement that critiqued multiple provisions of the
Act but did not express any separation-of-powers concerns.
See President’s Statement on Signing the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, 30 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1286 (2002). Cf.
ABA, Report of Task Force on Presidential Signing State
ments and the Separation of Powers Doctrine 15 (2006),
online at http://www.signingstatementsaba_final_signing_
statements_recommendations-report_7-24-06.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available in
Clerk of Court’s case file) (noting that President Bush
asserted “over 500” “constitutional objections” through
signing statements “in his first term,” including 82 “related
to his theory of the ‘unitary executive’ ”).
Thus, here, as in similar cases, we should decide the
constitutional question in light of the provision’s practical
functioning in context. And our decision should take
account of the Judiciary’s comparative lack of institutional

expertise.

A

To what extent then is the Act’s “for cause” provision
likely, as a practical matter, to limit the President’s exer
cise of executive authority? In practical terms no “for
cause” provision can, in isolation, define the full measure
of executive power. This is because a legislative decision
to place ultimate administrative authority in, say, the
Secretary of Agriculture rather than the President, the
way in which the statute defines the scope of the power
the relevant administrator can exercise, the decision as to
who controls the agency’s budget requests and funding,
the relationships between one agency or department and
another, as well as more purely political factors (including
Congress’ ability to assert influence) are more likely to
affect the President’s power to get something done. That
is why President Truman complained that “ ‘the powers of
the President amount to’ ” bringing “ ‘people in and try[ing]
to persuade them to do what they ought to do without
persuasion.’ ” C. Rossiter, The American Presidency 154
(2d rev. ed. 1960). And that is why scholars have written
that the President “is neither dominant nor powerless” in
his relationships with many Government entities,
“whether denominated executive or independent.” Strauss,
The Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Pow
ers and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 573, 583
(1984) (hereinafter Strauss). Those entities “are all sub
ject to presidential direction in significant aspects of their
functioning, and [are each] able to resist presidential
direction in others.” Ibid. (emphasis added).
Indeed, notwithstanding the majority’s assertion that
the removal authority is “the key” mechanism by which
the President oversees inferior officers in the independent
agencies, ante, at 20, it appears that no President has ever


12

FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


actually sought to exercise that power by testing the scope
of a “for cause” provision. See Bruff, Bringing the Inde
pendent Agencies in from the Cold, 62 Vanderbilt L. Rev.
En Banc 63, 68 (2009), online at http://vanderbiltlawreview.
org/articles/2009/11/Bruff-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-63.pdf
(noting that “Presidents do not test the limits of their
power by removing commissioners . . . ”); Lessig & Sun
stein 110–112 (noting that courts have not had occasion to
define what constitutes “cause” because Presidents rarely
test removal provisions).
But even if we put all these other matters to the side, we
should still conclude that the “for cause” restriction before
us will not restrict presidential power significantly. For
one thing, the restriction directly limits, not the Presi
dent’s power, but the power of an already independent
agency. The Court seems to have forgotten that fact when
it identifies its central constitutional problem: According
to the Court, the President “is powerless to intervene” if he
has determined that the Board members’ “conduct merit[s]
removal” because “[t]hat decision is vested instead in other
tenured officers—the Commissioners—none of whom is
subject to the President’s direct control.” Ante, at 14–15.
But so long as the President is legitimately foreclosed from
removing the Commissioners except for cause (as the
majority assumes), nullifying the Commission’s power to
remove Board members only for cause will not resolve the
problem the Court has identified: The President will still
be “powerless to intervene” by removing the Board mem
bers if the Commission reasonably decides not to do so.
In other words, the Court fails to show why two layers of
“for cause” protection—Layer One insulating the Commis
sioners from the President, and Layer Two insulating the
Board from the Commissioners—impose any more serious
limitation upon the President’s powers than one layer.
Consider the four scenarios that might arise:
1. The President and the Commission both want to


Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)

13

BREYER, J., dissenting

keep a Board member in office. Neither layer is
relevant.
2. The President and the Commission both want to
dismiss a Board member. Layer Two stops them
both from doing so without cause. The President’s
ability to remove the Commission (Layer One) is
irrelevant, for he and the Commission are in
agreement.
3. The President wants to dismiss a Board member,
but the Commission wants to keep the member.
Layer One allows the Commission to make that de
termination notwithstanding the President’s con
trary view. Layer Two is irrelevant because the
Commission does not seek to remove the Board
member.
4. The President wants to keep a Board member, but
the Commission wants to dismiss the Board mem
ber. Here, Layer Two helps the President, for it
hinders the Commission’s ability to dismiss a Board
member whom the President wants to keep in
place.
Thus, the majority’s decision to eliminate only Layer
Two accomplishes virtually nothing. And that is because a
removal restriction’s effect upon presidential power de
pends not on the presence of a “double-layer” of for-cause
removal, as the majority pretends, but rather on the real
world nature of the President’s relationship with the
Commission. If the President confronts a Commission
that seeks to resist his policy preferences—a distinct pos
sibility when, as here, a Commission’s membership must
reflect both political parties, 15 U. S. C. §78d(a)—the
restriction on the Commission’s ability to remove a Board
member is either irrelevant (as in scenario 3) or may
actually help the President (as in scenario 4). And if the
President faces a Commission that seeks to implement his
policy preferences, Layer One is irrelevant, for the Presi

BREYER, J., dissenting 


dent and Commission see eye to eye.
In order to avoid this elementary logic, the Court creates
two alternative scenarios. In the first, the Commission
and the President both want to remove a Board member,
but have varying judgments as to whether they have good
“cause” to do so—i.e., the President and the Commission
both conclude that a Board member should be removed,
but disagree as to whether that conclusion (which they
have both reached) is reasonable. Ante, at 14–15. In the
second, the President wants to remove a Board member
and the Commission disagrees; but, notwithstanding its
freedom to make reasonable decisions independent of the
President (afforded by Layer One), the Commission (while
apparently telling the President that it agrees with him
and would like to remove the Board member) uses Layer
Two as an “excuse” to pursue its actual aims—an excuse
which, given Layer One, it does not need. Ante, at 15, n. 4.
Both of these circumstances seem unusual. I do not
know if they have ever occurred. But I do not deny their
logical possibility. I simply doubt their importance. And
the fact that, with respect to the President’s power, the
double layer of for-cause removal sometimes might help,
sometimes might hurt, leads me to conclude that its over
all effect is at most indeterminate.
But once we leave the realm of hypothetical logic and
view the removal provision at issue in the context of the
entire Act, its lack of practical effect becomes readily
apparent. That is because the statute provides the Com
mission with full authority and virtually comprehensive
control over all of the Board’s functions. Those who cre
ated the Accounting Board modeled it, in terms of struc
ture and authority, upon the semiprivate regulatory bod
ies prevalent in the area of financial regulation, such as

for Former SEC Chairmen). And those organizations—
which rely on private financing and on officers drawn from
the private sector—exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory
authority that is pervasively controlled by, and is indeed
“entirely derivative” of, the SEC. See National Assn. of
Securities Dealers, Inc. v. SEC, 431 F. 3d 803, 806 (CADC
2005).
Adhering to that model, the statute here gives the Ac
counting Board the power to adopt rules and standards
“relating to the preparation of audit reports”; to adjudicate
disciplinary proceedings involving accounting firms that
fail to follow these rules; to impose sanctions; and to en
gage in other related activities, such as conducting inspec
tions of accounting firms registered as the law requires
and investigations to monitor compliance with the rules
and related legal obligations. See 15 U. S. C. §§7211–
7216. But, at the same time,
•	 No Accounting Board rule takes effect unless and
until the Commission approves it, §7217(b)(2);
•	 The Commission may “abrogat[e], delet[e] or ad[d] to”
any rule or any portion of a rule promulgated by the
Accounting Board whenever, in the Commission’s
view, doing so “further[s] the purposes” of the securi
ties and accounting-oversight laws, §7217(b)(5);
•	 The Commission may review any sanction the
Board imposes and “enhance, modify, cancel, re
duce, or require the remission of” that sanction if it
find’s the Board’s action not “appropriate,”
§§7215(e), 7217(c)(3);
•	 The Commission may promulgate rules restricting
or directing the Accounting Board’s conduct of all
inspections
and
investigations,
§§7211(c)(3),
7214(h), 7215(b)(1)–(4);
•	 The Commission may itself initiate any investigation
or promulgate any rule within the Accounting
Board’s purview, §7202, and may also remove any

BREYER, J., dissenting 


Accounting Board member who has unreasonably
“failed to enforce compliance with” the relevant
“rule[s], or any professional standard,” §7217(d)(3)(C)
(emphasis added);
•	 The Commission may at any time “relieve the Board
of any responsibility to enforce compliance with any
provision” of the Act, the rules, or professional stan
dards if, in the Commission’s view, doing so is in
“the public interest,” §7217(d)(1) (emphasis added).
As these statutory provisions make clear, the Court is
simply wrong when it says that “the Act nowhere gives the
Commission effective power to start, stop, or alter” Board
investigations. Ante, at 23–24. On the contrary, the
Commission’s control over the Board’s investigatory and
legal functions is virtually absolute. Moreover, the Com
mission has general supervisory powers over the Account
ing Board itself: It controls the Board’s budget, §§7219(b),
(d)(1); it can assign to the Board any “duties or functions”
that it “determines are necessary or appropriate,”
§7211(c)(5); it has full “oversight and enforcement author
ity over the Board,” §7217(a), including the authority to
inspect the Board’s activities whenever it believes it “ap
propriate” to do so, §7217(d)(2) (emphasis added). And it
can censure the Board or its members, as well as remove
the members from office, if the members, for example, fail
to enforce the Act, violate any provisions of the Act, or
abuse the authority granted to them under the Act,
§7217(d)(3). Cf. Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U. S. 311,
314–319 (1903) (holding that removal authority is not
always “restricted to a removal for th[e] causes” set forth
by statute); Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 729 (rejecting the “ar
guable premis[e]” “that the enumeration of certain speci
fied causes of removal excludes the possibility of removal
for other causes”). Contra, ante, at 22, n. 7. See generally

What is left? The Commission’s inability to remove a
Board member whose perfectly reasonable actions cause
the Commission to overrule him with great frequency?
What is the practical likelihood of that occurring, or, if it
does, of the President’s serious concern about such a mat
ter? Everyone concedes that the President’s control over
the Commission is constitutionally sufficient. See Hum
phrey’s Executor, 295 U. S. 602; Wiener, 357 U. S. 349;
ante, at 1–2. And if the President’s control over the Com
mission is sufficient, and the Commission’s control over
the Board is virtually absolute, then, as a practical matter,
the President’s control over the Board should prove suffi
cient as well.
1

B
At the same time, Congress and the President had good
reason for enacting the challenged “for cause” provision.
First and foremost, the Board adjudicates cases. See 15
U. S. C. §7215. This Court has long recognized the appro
priateness of using “for cause” provisions to protect the
personal independence of those who even only sometimes
engage in adjudicatory functions. Humphrey’s Executor,
supra, at 623–628; see also Wiener, supra, at 355–356;
Morrison, 487 U. S., at 690–691, and n. 30; McAllister v.
United States, 141 U. S. 174, 191–201 (1891) (Field, J.,
dissenting). Indeed, as early as 1789 James Madison
stated that “there may be strong reasons why an” execu
tive “officer” such as the Comptroller of the United States
“should not hold his office at the pleasure of the Executive
branch” if one of his “principal dut[ies]” “partakes strongly
of the judicial character.” 1 Annals of Congress 611–612;
cf. ante, at 19, n. 6 (noting that the statute Congress ulti

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


mately enacted limited Presidential control over the
Comptroller in a different fashion); see supra, at 4. The
Court, however, all but ignores the Board’s adjudicatory
functions when conducting its analysis. See, e.g., ante, at
17–18. And when it finally does address that central
function (in a footnote), it simply asserts that the Board
does not “perform adjudicative . . . functions,” ante, at 26,
n. 10 (emphasis added), an assertion that is inconsistent
with the terms of the statute. See §7215(c)(1) (governing
“proceeding[s] by the Board to determine whether a regis
tered public accounting firm, or an associated person
thereof, should be disciplined”).
Moreover, in addition to their adjudicative functions, the
Accounting Board members supervise, and are themselves,
technical professional experts. See §7211(e)(1) (requiring
that Board members “have a demonstrated” technical
“understanding of the responsibilities” and “obligations of
accountants with respect to the preparation and issuance
of audit reports”). This Court has recognized that the
“difficulties involved in the preparation of” sound auditing
reports require the application of “scientific accounting
principles.” United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 440
(1926). And this Court has recognized the constitutional
legitimacy of a justification that rests agency independ
ence upon the need for technical expertise. See Hum
phrey’s Executor, supra, at 624–626; see also Breger &
Edles, Established by Practice: The Theory and Operation
of Independent Federal Agencies, 52 Admin. L. Rev. 1111,
1131–1133 (2000) (explaining how the need for adminis
trators with “technical competence,” “apolitical expertise,”
and skill in “scientific management” led to original crea
tion of independent agencies) (hereinafter Breger & Ed
les); J. Landis, The Administrative Process 23 (1938)
(similar); Woodrow Wilson, Democracy and Efficiency, 87
Atlantic Monthly 289, 299 (1901) (describing need for
insulation of experts from political influences).

BREYER, J., dissenting

Here, the justification for insulating the “technical
experts” on the Board from fear of losing their jobs due to
political influence is particularly strong. Congress delib
erately sought to provide that kind of protection. See, e.g.,
148 Cong. Rec. 12036, 12115, 13352–13355. It did so for
good reason. See ante, at 3 (noting that the Accounting
Board was created in response to “a series of celebrated
accounting debacles”); H. R. Rep. No. 107–414, pp. 18–19
(2002) (same); Brief for Former SEC Chairmen 8–9. And
historically, this regulatory subject matter—financial
regulation—has been thought to exhibit a particular need
for independence. See e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 8857 (1914)
(remarks of Sen. Morgan upon creation of the Federal
Trade Commission) (“[I]t is unsafe for an . . . administra
tive officer representing a great political party . . . to hold
the power of life and death over the great business inter
ests of this country. . . . That is . . . why I believe in . . .
taking these business matters out of politics”). And Con
gress, by, for example, providing the Board with a revenue
stream independent of the congressional appropriations
process, §7219, helped insulate the Board from congres
sional, as well as other, political influences. See, e.g., 148
Cong. Rec. 12036 (statement of Sen. Stabenow).
In sum, Congress and the President could reasonably
have thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative Board
members from fear of purely politically based removal. Cf.
Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565
(1973) (“[I]t is not only important that the Government
and its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice,
but it is also critical that they appear to the public to be
avoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative
Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent”).
And in a world in which we count on the Federal Govern
ment to regulate matters as complex as, say, nuclear
power production, the Court’s assertion that we should
simply learn to get by “without being” regulated “by ex

perts” is, at best, unrealistic—at worst, dangerously so.
Ante, at 18.
C
Where a “for cause” provision is so unlikely to restrict
presidential power and so likely to further a legitimate
institutional need, precedent strongly supports its consti
tutionality. First, in considering a related issue in Nixon
v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425 (1977),
the Court made clear that when “determining whether the
Act disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate
branches, the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to
which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplish
ing its constitutionally assigned functions.” Id., at 443.
The Court said the same in Morrison, where it upheld a
restriction on the President’s removal power. 487 U. S., at
691 (“[T]he real question is whether the removal restric
tions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s
ability to perform his constitutional duty, and the func
tions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that
light”). Here, the removal restriction may somewhat
diminish the Commission’s ability to control the Board,
but it will have little, if any, negative effect in respect to
the President’s ability to control the Board, let alone to
coordinate the Executive Branch. See Part II–A, supra.
Indeed, given Morrison, where the Court upheld a restric
tion that significantly interfered with the President’s
important historic power to control criminal prosecutions,
a “ ‘purely executive’ ” function, 487 U. S., at 687–689, the
constitutionality of the present restriction would seem to
follow a fortiori.
Second, as previously pointed out, this Court has re
peatedly upheld “for cause” provisions where they restrict
the President’s power to remove an officer with adjudica
tory responsibilities. Compare Humphrey’s Executor, 295
U. S., at 623–628; Wiener, 357 U. S., at 355; Schor, 478

21

BREYER, J., dissenting

U. S., at 854; Morrison, supra, at 691, n. 30, with ante, at
17–18 (ignoring these precedents). And we have also
upheld such restrictions when they relate to officials with
technical responsibilities that warrant a degree of special
independence. E.g., Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 624.
The Accounting Board’s functions involve both kinds of
responsibility. And, accordingly, the Accounting Board’s
adjudicatory responsibilities, the technical nature of its
job, the need to attract experts to that job, and the impor
tance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job
to the public strongly justify a statute that assures that
Board members need not fear for their jobs when compe
tently carrying out their tasks, while still maintaining the
Commission as the ultimate authority over Board policies
and actions. See Part II–B, supra.
Third, consider how several cases fit together in a way
that logically compels a holding of constitutionality here.
In Perkins, 116 U. S., at 483, 484—which was reaffirmed
in Myers, 272 U. S., at 127 and in Morrison, supra, at 689,
n. 27—the Court upheld a removal restriction limiting the
authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove a “cadet
engineer,” whom the Court explicitly defined as an “infe
rior officer.” The Court said,
“We have no doubt that when Congress, by law,
vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads
of Departments it may limit and restrict the power of
removal as it deems best for the public interest. The
constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the
appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and
regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may
enact in relation to the officers so appointed.” Per
kins, supra, at 485 (emphasis added; internal quota
tion marks omitted).
See also Morrison, supra, at 723–724 (SCALIA, J., dissent
ing) (agreeing that the power to remove an “inferior offi

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


cer” who is appointed by a department head can be re
stricted). Cf. ante, at 30–33 (holding that SEC Commis
sioners are “Heads of Departments”).
In Humphrey’s Executor, the Court held that Congress
may constitutionally limit the President’s authority to
remove certain principal officers, including heads of de
partments. 295 U. S., at 627–629. And the Court has
consistently recognized the validity of that holding. See
Wiener, supra; United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706
(1974); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 133–136; Chadha, 462 U. S.,
at 953, n. 16; Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 725–726; Morrison,
supra, at 686–693; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.
361, 410–411 (1989).
And in Freytag, 501 U. S., at 921, JUSTICE SCALIA stated
in a concurring opinion written for four Justices, including
JUSTICE KENNEDY, that “adjusting the remainder of the
Constitution to compensate for Humphrey’s Executor is a
fruitless endeavor.” In these Justices’ view, the Court
should not create a separate constitutional jurisprudence
for the “independent agencies.” That being so, the law
should treat their heads as it treats other Executive
Branch heads of departments. Consequently, as the Court
held in Perkins, Congress may constitutionally “limit and
restrict” the Commission’s power to remove those whom
they appoint (e.g, the Accounting Board members).
Fourth, the Court has said that “[o]ur separation-of
powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of
one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the expense of
another branch.” Freytag, supra, at 878 (emphasis added);
accord, Buckley, supra, at 129; Schor, supra, at 856; Mor
rison, supra, at 686; cf. Bowsher, supra. Indeed, it has
added that “the essence of the decision in Myers,” which is
the only one of our cases to have struck down a “for cause”
removal restriction, “was the judgment that the Constitu
tion prevents Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the
power to remove.’ ” Morrison, supra, at 686 (quoting

23

BREYER, J., dissenting

Myers, supra, at 161; emphasis added). Congress here has
“drawn” no power to itself to remove the Board members.
It has instead sought to limit its own power, by, for exam
ple, providing the Accounting Board with a revenue
stream independent of the congressional appropriations
process. See supra, at 19; see also Brief for Former SEC
Chairmen 16. And this case thereby falls outside the
ambit of the Court’s most serious constitutional concern.
In sum, the Court’s prior cases impose functional
criteria that are readily met here. Once one goes beyond
the Court’s elementary arithmetical logic (i.e., “one plus
one is greater than one”) our precedent virtually dictates
a holding that the challenged “for cause” provision is
constitutional.
D
We should ask one further question. Even if the “for
cause” provision before us does not itself significantly
interfere with the President’s authority or aggrandize
Congress’ power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a
bright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a
series of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable,
Congress might undercut the President’s central constitu
tional role? Cf. Strauss 625–626. The answer to this
question is that no such need has been shown. Moreover,
insofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails.
And in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious
than any imaginable harm this “for cause” provision might
bring about.
The Court fails to create a bright-line rule because of
considerable uncertainty about the scope of its holding—
an uncertainty that the Court’s opinion both reflects and
generates. The Court suggests, for example, that its rule
may not apply where an inferior officer “perform[s] adjudi
cative . . . functions.” Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. But the Ac
counting Board performs adjudicative functions.
See


24

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


supra, at 17–18. What, then, are we to make of the
Court’s potential exception? And would such an exception
apply to an administrative law judge who also has impor
tant administrative duties beyond pure adjudication? See,
e.g., 8 CFR §1003.9, 34 CFR §81.4 (2009). The Court
elsewhere suggests that its rule may be limited to removal
statutes that provide for “judicial review of a[n] effort to
remove” an official for cause. Ante, at 22; ante, at 25. But
we have previously stated that all officers protected by a
for-cause removal provision and later subject to termina
tion are entitled to “notice and [a] hearing” in the “courts,”
as without such review “the appointing power” otherwise
“could remove at pleasure or for such cause as [only] it
deemed sufficient.” Reagan v. United States, 182 U. S.
419, 425 (1901); Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 314; cf. Hum
phrey’s Executor, supra (entertaining civil suit challenging
removal). But cf. Bowsher, supra, at 729. What weight,
then, should be given to this hint of an exception?
The Court further seems to suggest that its holding may
not apply to inferior officers who have a different relation
ship to their appointing agents than the relationship
between the Commission and the Board. See ante, at 22,
24–26. But the only characteristic of the “relationship”
between the Commission and the Board that the Court
apparently deems relevant is that the relationship in
cludes two layers of for-cause removal. See, e.g., ante, at
23 (“Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to
the power to remove Board members”). Why then would
any different relationship that also includes two layers of
for-cause removal survive where this one has not? Cf.
Part II–A, supra (describing the Commission’s near abso
lute control over the Board). In a word, what differences
are relevant? If the Court means to state that its holding
in fact applies only where Congress has “enacted an un
usually high standard” of for-cause removal—and does not
otherwise render two layers of “ ‘ordinary’ ” for-cause re

BREYER, J., dissenting

moval unconstitutional—I should welcome the statement.
Ante, at 22 (emphasis added); see also ante, at 24–25, 15,
22, (underscoring this statute’s “sharply circumscribed
definition of what constitutes ‘good cause’ ” and its “rigor
ous,” “significant and unusual [removal] protections”).
But much of the majority’s opinion appears to avoid so
narrow a holding in favor of a broad, basically mechanical
rule—a rule that, as I have said, is divorced from the
context of the case at hand. Compare Parts III–A, III–B,
III–C, ante, with Parts II–A, II–B, II–C, supra. And such
a mechanical rule cannot be cabined simply by saying
that, perhaps, the rule does not apply to instances that, at
least at first blush, seem highly similar. A judicial holding
by its very nature is not “a restricted railroad ticket, good
for” one “day and train only.” Smith v. Allwright, 321
U. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting).
The Court begins to reveal the practical problems inher
ent in its double for-cause rule when it suggests that its
rule may not apply to “the civil service.” Ante, at 26. The
“civil service” is defined by statute to include “all appoint
ive positions in . . . the Government of the United States,”
excluding the military, but including all civil “officer[s]” up
to and including those who are subject to Senate confirma
tion. 5 U. S. C. §§2101, 2102(a)(1)(B), 2104. The civil
service thus includes many officers indistinguishable from
the members of both the Commission and the Accounting
Board. Indeed, as this Court recognized in Myers, the
“competitive service”—the class within the broader civil
service that enjoys the most robust career protection—
“includes a vast majority of all the civil officers” in the
United States. 272 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added); 5
U. S. C. §2102(c).
But even if I assume that the majority categorically
excludes the competitive service from the scope of its new
rule, cf. ante, at 26 (leaving this question open), the exclu
sion would be insufficient. This is because the Court’s


26

BREYER, J., dissenting

“double for-cause” rule applies to appointees who are
“inferior officer[s].” Ante, at 2. And who are they? Courts
and scholars have struggled for more than a century to
define the constitutional term “inferior officers,” without
much success. See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con
stitution §1536, pp. 397–398 (3d ed. 1858) (“[T]here does
not seem to have been any exact line drawn, who are and
who are not to be deemed inferior officers, in the sense of
the constitution”); Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651,
661 (1997) (“Our cases have not set forth an exclusive
criterion for [defining] inferior officers”); Memorandum
from Steven G. Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney
General, Office of Legal Counsel, to the General Counsels
of the Executive Branch: Officers of the United States
Within the Meaning of the Appointments Clause, p. 3
(Apr. 16, 2007) (hereinafter OLC Memo), online at
http://www.justice.gov/olc/2007/appointmentsclausev10.pdf
(“[T]he Supreme Court has not articulated the precise
scope and application of the [Inferior Officer] Clause’s
requirements”); Konecke, The Appointments Clause and

Office, 5 Seton Hall Const. L. J. 489, 492 (1995) (same);
Burkoff, Appointment and Removal Under the Federal
Constitution: The Impact of Buckley v. Valeo, 22 Wayne
L. Rev. 1335, 1347, 1364 (1976) (describing our early
precedent as “circular” and our later law as “not particu
larly useful”). The Court does not clarify the concept. But
without defining who is an inferior officer, to whom the
majority’s new rule applies, we cannot know the scope or
the coherence of the legal rule that the Court creates. I
understand the virtues of a common-law case-by-case
approach. But here that kind of approach (when applied
without more specificity than I can find in the Court’s
opinion) threatens serious harm.
The problem is not simply that the term “inferior officer”
is indefinite but also that efforts to define it inevitably

BREYER, J., dissenting

conclude that the term’s sweep is unusually broad. Con
sider the Court’s definitions: Inferior officers are, inter
alia, (1) those charged with “the administration and en
forcement of the public law,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 139;
ante, at 2; (2) those granted “significant authority,” 424
U. S., at 126; ante, at 25; (3) those with “responsibility for
conducting civil litigation in the courts of the United
States,” 424 U. S., at 140; and (4) those “who can be said to
hold an office,” United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508,
510 (1879), that has been created either by “regulations”
or by “statute,” United States v. Mouat, 124 U. S. 303,
307–308 (1888).
Consider the definitional conclusion that the Depart
ment of Justice more recently reached: An “inferior officer”
is anyone who holds a “continuing” position and who is
“invested by legal authority with a portion of the sovereign
powers of the federal Government,” including, inter alia,
the power to “arrest criminals,” “seize persons or property,”
“issue regulations,” “issue . . . authoritative legal opin
ions,” “conduc[t] civil litigation,” “collec[t] revenue,” repre
sent “the United States to foreign nations,” “command”
military force, or enter into “contracts” on behalf “of the
nation.” OLC Memo 1, 4, 12–13, 15–16 (internal quotation
marks omitted; emphasis added).
And consider the fact that those whom this Court has
held to be “officers” include: (1) a district court clerk,
Hennen, 13 Pet., at 258; (2) “thousands of clerks in the
Departments of the Treasury, Interior and the othe[r]”
departments, Germaine, supra, at 511, who are responsi
ble for “the records, books, and papers appertaining to the
office,” Hennen, supra, at 259; (3) a clerk to “the assistant
treasurer” stationed “at Boston,” United States v. Hart
well, 6 Wall. 385, 392 (1868); (4 & 5) an “assistant
surgeon” and a “cadet-engineer” appointed by the Secre
tary of the Navy, United States v. Moore, 95 U. S. 760, 762
(1878); Perkins, 116 U. S., at 484; (6) election monitors, Ex

Department of Transportation, Edmond v. United States,
520 U. S. 651 (1997). Individual Members of the Court
would add to the list the Federal Communication Commis
sion’s managing director, the Federal Trade Commission’s
“secretary,” the general counsel of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, and more generally, bureau chiefs,
general counsels, and administrative law judges, see
Freytag, supra, at 918–920 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment), as well as “ordinary commis
sioned military officers,” Weiss, supra, at 182 (Souter, J.,
concurring).
Reading the criteria above as stringently as possible, I
still see no way to avoid sweeping hundreds, perhaps
thousands of high level government officials within the
scope of the Court’s holding, putting their job security and
their administrative actions and decisions constitutionally
at risk. To make even a conservative estimate, one would
have to begin by listing federal departments, offices, bu
reaus and other agencies whose heads are by statute
removable only “for cause.” I have found 48 such agencies,
which I have listed in Appendix A, infra. Then it would be
necessary to identify the senior officials in those agencies
(just below the top) who themselves are removable only
“for cause.” I have identified 573 such high-ranking offi
cials, whom I have listed in Appendix B, infra. They
include most of the leadership of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (including that agency’s executive director as
well as the directors of its Office of Nuclear Reactor Regu
lation and Office of Enforcement), virtually all of the
leadership of the Social Security Administration, the

BREYER, J., dissenting

executive directors of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, as well
as the general counsels of the Chemical Safety Board, the
Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, and
the National Mediation Board.
This list is a conservative estimate because it consists
only of career appointees in the Senior Executive Service
(SES), see 5 U. S. C. §§2101a, 3132(a)(2), a group of high
ranking officials distinct from the “competitive service,” see
§2101(a)(1)(C), who “serve in the key positions just below
the top Presidential appointees,” Office of Personnel Man
agement, About the Senior Executive Service, online at
http://www.opm.gov/ses/about_ses/index.asp; §2102(a)(1)(C),
and who are, without exception, subject to “removal” only for
cause. §§7542–7543; see also §2302(a)(2) (substantially
limiting conditions under which “a career appointee in the
Senior Executive Service” may be “transfer[red], or reas
sign[ed]”). SES officials include, for example, the Director
of the Bureau of Prisons, the Director of the National Drug
Intelligence Center, and the Director of the Office of In
ternational Monetary Policy in the Treasury Department.
See Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Gov
ernment Affairs, United States Government Policy and
Supporting Positions (2008), pp. 99, 103, 129 (hereinafter
Plum Book). And by virtually any definition, essentially
all SES officials qualify as “inferior officers,” for their
duties, as defined by statute, require them to “direc[t] the
work of an organizational unit,” carry out high-level
managerial functions, or “otherwise exercis[e] important
policy-making, policy-determining, or other executive func
tions.” §3132(a)(2) (emphasis added). Cf. ante, at 2 (de
scribing an “inferior officer” as someone who “determines
the policy and enforces the laws of the United States”);
ante, at 26 (acknowledging that career SES appointees in
independent agencies may be rendered unconstitutional in
future cases). Is the SES exempt from today’s rule or is it

BREYER, J., dissenting 


not? The Court, after listing reasons why the SES may be
different, simply says that it will not “addres[s]” the mat
ter. Ante, at 27. Perhaps it does not do so because it cannot
do so without revealing the difficulty of distinguishing the
SES from the Accounting Board and thereby also revealing
the inherent instability of the legal rule it creates.
The potential list of those whom today’s decision affects
is yet larger. As JUSTICE SCALIA has observed, adminis
trative law judges (ALJs) “are all executive officers.”
Freytag, 501 U. S., at 910 (opinion concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted); see also, e.g.,
id., at 881 (majority opinion) (“[A] [tax-court] special trial
judge is an ‘inferior Officer’ ”); Edmond, supra, at 654
(“[M]ilitary trial and appellate judges are [inferior] offi
cers”). But cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. And ALJs are each re
movable “only for good cause established and determined
by the Merit Systems Protection Board,” 5 U. S. C.
§§7521(a)–(b). But the members of the Merit Systems
Protection Board are themselves protected from removal
by the President absent good cause. §1202(d).
My research reflects that the Federal Government relies
on 1,584 ALJs to adjudicate administrative matters in
over 25 agencies. See Appendix C, infra; see also Memo
randum of Juanita Love, Office of Personnel Manage
ment, to Supreme Court Library (May 28, 2010) (avail
able in Clerk of Court’s case file). These ALJs adjudicate
Social Security benefits, employment disputes, and other
matters highly important to individuals. Does every
losing party before an ALJ now have grounds to appeal on
the basis that the decision entered against him is uncon
stitutional? Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10 (“[O]ur holding also does
not address” this question).
And what about the military? Commissioned military
officers “are ‘inferior officers.’ ” Weiss, 510 U. S., at 182
(Souter, J., concurring); id., at 169–170 (majority opinion).
There are over 210,000 active-duty commissioned officers

currently serving in the armed forces. See Dept. of Defense,
Active Duty Military Personnel by Rank (Apr. 30, 2010),
online at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/
rg1004.pdf. Numerous statutory provisions provide that
such officers may not be removed from office except for
cause (at least in peacetime). See, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§629–
632, 804, 1161, 1181–1185. And such officers can gener
ally be so removed only by other commissioned officers, see
§§612, 825, 1187, who themselves enjoy the same career
protections.
The majority might simply say that the military is
different. But it will have to explain how it is different. It
is difficult to see why the Constitution would provide a
President who is the military’s “commander-in-chief,”
Art. II, §2, cl. 1, with less authority to remove “inferior”
military “officers” than to remove comparable civil offi
cials. See Barron & Lederman, The Commander in Chief
at the Lowest Ebb—A Constitutional History, 121 Harv.
L. Rev. 941, 1102–1106 (2008) (describing President’s
“superintendence prerogative” over the military). Cf. ante,
at 26–27 (not “expressing any view whatever” as to
whether military officers’ authority is now unconstitutional).
The majority sees “no reason . . . to address whether”
any of “these positions,” “or any others,” might be deemed
unconstitutional under its new rule, preferring instead to
leave these matters for a future case. Ante, at 27. But
what is to happen in the meantime? Is the work of all
these various officials to be put on hold while the courts of
appeals determine whether today’s ruling applies to them?
Will Congress have to act to remove the “for cause” provi
sions? Cf. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 142–143. Can the Presi
dent then restore them via executive order? And, still,
what about the military? A clearer line would help avoid
these practical difficulties.
The majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the
Government’s ability to function while these many ques

BREYER, J., dissenting 


tions are litigated in the lower courts because the Court’s
holding concerns only “the conditions under which th[e]se
officers might some day be removed.” Ante, at 27. But
this case was not brought by federal officials challenging
their potential removal. It was brought by private indi
viduals who were subject to regulation “ ‘here-and-now’ ”
and who “object to the” very “existence” of the regulators
themselves. Ante, at 33, 8 (emphasis added). And those
private individuals have prevailed. Thus, any person
similarly regulated by a federal official who is potentially
subject to the Court’s amorphous new rule will be able to
bring an “implied private right of action directly under the
Constitution” “seeking . . . a declaratory judgment that”
the official’s actions are “unconstitutional and an injunc
tion preventing the” official “from exercising [his] powers.”
Ante, at 10, n. 2, 6; cf., e.g., Legal Services Corporation v.
Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 546 (2001) (affirming grant of
preliminary injunction to cure, inter alia, a separation-of
powers violation); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U. S.
579 (same). Such a plaintiff need not even first exhaust
his administrative remedies. Ante, at 7–10.
Nor is it clear that courts will always be able to cure
such a constitutional defect merely by severing an offend
ing removal provision. For a court’s “ability to devise
[such] a judicial remedy . . . often depends on how clearly”
the “background constitutional rules at issue” have been
“articulated”; severance will be unavailable “in a murky
constitutional context,” which is precisely the context that
the Court’s new rule creates. Ayotte v. Planned Parent
hood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329, 330 (2006).
Moreover, “the touchstone” of the severability analysis “is
legislative intent,” id., at 330, and Congress has repeat
edly expressed its judgment “over the last century that it
is in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that
federal service should depend upon meritorious perform
ance rather than political service,” Civil Service Comm’n,

33

BREYER, J., dissenting

413 U. S., at 557; see also Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367,
380–388 (1983) (describing the history of “Congressional
attention to the problem of politically-motivated removals”).
And so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the
many questions the majority’s opinion raises will not only
apply the Court’s new rule to its logical conclusion, but will
also determine that the only available remedy to certain
double for-cause problems is to invalidate entire agencies.
Thus, notwithstanding the majority’s assertions to the
contrary, the potential consequences of today’s holding are
worrying. The upshot, I believe, is a legal dilemma. To
interpret the Court’s decision as applicable only in a few
circumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbitrary. To interpret the rule more broadly will make the
rule more rational, but destructive.
III
One last question: How can the Court simply assume
without deciding that the SEC Commissioners themselves
are removable only “for cause”? See ante, at 5 (“[W]e
decide the case with th[e] understanding” “that the Commissioners cannot themselves be removed by the President except” for cause (emphasis added)). Unless the
Commissioners themselves are in fact protected by a “for
cause” requirement, the Accounting Board statute, on the
Court’s own reasoning, is not constitutionally defective. I
am not aware of any other instance in which the Court has
similarly (on its own or through stipulation) created a
constitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that
defect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional. Cf.
Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)
(opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J.) (slip op., at 20) (“We
do not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal statute . . .
especially [if] . . . separation-of-powers concerns . . . would
[thereby] arise”); The Anaconda v. American Sugar Refining Co., 322 U. S. 42, 46 (1944) (describing parties’ inabil-

BREYER, J., dissenting

ity to “stipulate away” what “the legislation declares”).
It is certainly not obvious that the SEC Commissioners
enjoy “for cause” protection. Unlike the statutes establishing the 48 federal agencies listed in Appendix A, infra, the
statute that established the Commission says nothing
about removal. It is silent on the question. As far as its
text is concerned, the President’s authority to remove the
Commissioners is no different from his authority to remove the Secretary of State or the Attorney General. See
Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 315 (“To take away th[e] power of
removal . . . would require very clear and explicit language. It should not be held to be taken away by mere
inference or implication”); see also Memorandum from
David J. Barron, Acting Assistant Attorney General,
Office of Legal Counsel, to the Principal Deputy Counsel
to the President: Removability of the Federal Coordinator
for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, p. 2 (Oct.
23, 2009), online at http://justice.gov/olc/2009/gas-transportproject.pdf (“[Where] Congress did not explicitly provide
tenure protection . . . the President, consistent with . . .
settled principles, may remove . . . without cause”); The
Constitutional Separation of Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. Legal Counsel 124, 170 (1996)
(same).
Nor is the absence of a “for cause” provision in the statute that created the Commission likely to have been inadvertent. Congress created the Commission during the 9year period after this Court decided Myers, and thereby
cast serious doubt on the constitutionality of all “for cause”
removal provisions, but before it decided Humphrey’s
Executor, which removed any doubt in respect to the constitutionality of making commissioners of independent
agencies removable only for cause. In other words, Congress created the SEC at a time when, under this Court’s
precedents, it would have been unconstitutional to make
the Commissioners removable only for cause. And, during

35

BREYER, J., dissenting

that 9-year period, Congress created at least three major
federal agencies without making any of their officers
removable for cause. See 48 Stat. 885, 15 U. S. C. §78d
(Securities and Exchange Commission), 48 Stat. 1066, 47
U. S. C. §154 (Federal Communications Commission); 46
Stat. 797 (Federal Power Commission) (reformed postHumphrey’s Executor as the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission with “for cause” protection, 91 Stat. 582, 42
U. S. C. §7171). By way of contrast, only one month after
Humphrey’s Executor was decided, Congress returned to
its pre-Myers practice of including such provisions in
statutes creating independent commissions. See §3, 49
Stat. 451, 29 U. S. C. §153 (establishing National Labor
Relations Board with an explicit removal limitation).
The fact that Congress did not make the SEC Commis
sioners removable “for cause” does not mean it intended to
create a dependent, rather than an independent agency.
Agency independence is a function of several different
factors, of which “for cause” protection is only one. Those
factors include, inter alia, an agency’s separate (rather
than presidentially dependent) budgeting authority, its
separate litigating authority, its composition as a multi
member bipartisan board, the use of the word “independ
ent” in its authorizing statute, and, above all, a political
environment, reflecting tradition and function, that would
impose a heavy political cost upon any President who tried
to remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.
See generally Breger & Edles 1135–1155.
The absence of a “for cause” provision is thus not fatal to
agency independence. Indeed, a “Congressional Research
Service official suggests that there are at least 13 ‘inde
pendent’ agencies without a removal provision in their
statutes.” Id., at 1143, n. 161 (emphasis added) (citing
congressional testimony). But it does draw the majority’s
rule into further confusion. For not only are we left with
out a definition of an “inferior officer,” but we are also left

BREYER, J., dissenting 


to guess which department heads will be deemed by the
majority to be subject to for-cause removal notwithstand
ing statutes containing no such provision. If any agency
deemed “independent” will be similarly treated, the scope
of the majority’s holding is even broader still. See Appen
dix D, infra (listing agencies potentially affected).
The Court then, by assumption, reads into the statute
books a “for cause removal” phrase that does not appear in
the relevant statute and which Congress probably did not
intend to write. And it does so in order to strike down, not
to uphold, another statute. This is not a statutory con
struction that seeks to avoid a constitutional question, but
its opposite. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347
(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (“It is not the habit of the
Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless
absolutely necessary to a decision of the case” (internal
quotation marks omitted)); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of
Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 500 (1979) (“[A]n Act of Congress
ought not to be construed to violate the Constitution if any
other possible construction remains available”).
I do not need to decide whether the Commissioners are
in fact removable only “for cause” because I would uphold
the Accounting Board’s removal provision as constitu
tional regardless. But were that not so, a determination
that the silent SEC statute means no more than it says
would properly avoid the determination of unconstitution
ality that the Court now makes.
*
*
*
In my view the Court’s decision is wrong—very wrong.
As Parts II–A, II–B, and II–C of this opinion make clear, if
the Court were to look to the proper functional and contex
tual considerations, it would find the Accounting Board
provision constitutional. As Part II–D shows, insofar as
the Court instead tries to create a bright-line rule, it fails
to do so. Its rule of decision is both imprecise and overly

37

BREYER, J., dissenting

broad. In light of the present imprecision, it must either
narrow its rule arbitrarily, leaving it to apply virtually
alone to the Accounting Board, or it will have to leave in
place a broader rule of decision applicable to many other
“inferior officers” as well. In doing the latter, it will un
dermine the President’s authority. And it will create an
obstacle, indeed pose a serious threat, to the proper func
tioning of that workable Government that the Constitu
tion seeks to create—in provisions this Court is sworn to
uphold.
With respect I dissent.

A

There are 24 stand-alone federal agencies (i.e., “depart
ments”) whose heads are, by statute, removable by the
President only “for cause.” Moreover, there are at least 24
additional offices, boards, or bureaus situated within
departments that are similarly subject, by statute, to for
cause removal provisions. The chart below first lists the
24 departments and then lists the 24 additional offices,
boards, and bureaus. I have highlighted those instances
in which a “for-cause” office is situated within a “for
cause” department—i.e., instances of “double for-cause”
removal that are essentially indistinguishable from this
case (with the notable exception that the Accounting
Board may not be statutorily subject to two layers of for
cause removal, cf. Part III, supra). This list does not
include instances of “double for-cause” removal that arise
in Article I courts, although such instances might also be
affected by the majority’s holding, cf. ante, at 26, n. 10.

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.
BREYER J., dissenting
Appendix B to ,opinion of BREYER, J.

B
The table that follows lists the 573 career appointees in
the Senior Executive Service (SES) who constitute the
upper level management of the independent agencies
listed in Appendix A, supra. Each of these officials is,
under any definition—including the Court’s—an inferior
officer, and is, by statute, subject to two layers of for-cause
removal. See supra, at 25–30.
The data are organized into three columns: The first
column lists the “office” to which the corresponding official
is assigned within the respective agency and, where avail
able, the provision of law establishing that office. Cf.
supra, at 27 (citing Mouat, 124 U. S., at 307–308; Ger
maine, 99 U. S., at 510). The second and third columns
respectively list the career appointees in each agency who
occupy “general” and “reserved” SES positions. A “gen
eral” position is one that could be filled by either a career
appointee or by a noncareer appointee were the current
(career) occupant to be replaced.
See 5
U. S. C.
§3132(b)(1). Because 90% of all SES positions must be
filled by career appointees, §3134(b), “most General posi
tions are filled by career appointees,” Plum Book 200. A
“reserved” position, by contrast, must always be filled by a
career appointee. §3132(b)(1). The data for the “general
position” column come from the 2008 Plum Book, a quad
rennial manual prepared by the congressional committees
responsible for government oversight. See supra, at 29.
Positions listed as vacant in that source are not included.
The data for the “reserved position” column come from a
list periodically published by the Office of Personnel Man
agement and last published in 2006. See 72 Fed. Reg.
16154–16251 (2007); §3132(b)(4). Given the Federal Gov
ernment’s size and the temporal lag between the underly
ing sources, the list that follows is intended to be illustra
tive, not exact.

C
According to data provided by the Office of Personnel
Management, reprinted below, there are 1,584 adminis
trative law judges (ALJs) in the Federal Government.
Each of these ALJs is an inferior officer and each is sub
ject, by statute, to two layers of for-cause removal. See
supra, at 30. The table below lists the 28 federal agencies
that rely on ALJs to adjudicate individual administrative
cases. The source is available in the Clerk of Court’s case
file. See ibid.

BREYER J., dissenting
Appendix D to ,opinion of BREYER, J. 


D
The table below lists 29 departments and other agencies
the heads of which are not subject to any statutory for
cause removal provision, but that do bear certain other
indicia of independence.
The table identifies six criteria that may suggest inde
pendence: (1) whether the agency consists of a multi
member commission; (2) whether its members are re
quired, by statute, to be bipartisan (or nonpartisan); (3)
whether eligibility to serve as the agency’s head depends
on statutorily defined qualifications; (4) whether the
agency has independence in submitting budgetary and
other proposals to Congress (thereby bypassing the Office
of Management and Budget); (5) whether the agency has
authority to appear in court independent of the Depart
ment of Justice, cf. 28 U. S. C. §§516–519; and (6) whether
the agency is explicitly classified as “independent” by
statute. See generally Breger & Edles 1135–1155; supra,
at 35–36. Unless otherwise noted, all information refers
to the relevant agency’s organic statute, which is cited in
the first column. The list of agencies is nonexhaustive.
