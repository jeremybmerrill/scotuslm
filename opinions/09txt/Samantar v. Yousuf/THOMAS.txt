No. 08–1555 [June 1, 2010] JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join the Court’s opinion except for those parts relying on the legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immu nities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. §§1330, 1602, et seq. In my view, the Court’s textual analysis is sufficient to resolve this case. See post, at 1–4 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).
