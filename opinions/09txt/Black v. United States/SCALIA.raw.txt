S. KIPNIS, PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I join the Court’s opinion with two exceptions. First, I
do not join in its reliance, ante, at 7, on the Notes of the
Advisory Committee in determining the meaning of Fed
eral Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(d). The Committee’s
view is not authoritative. See Krupski v. Costa Crociere
S. p. A., 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). The
Court accurately quotes the text of the Rule, see ante, at 7,
the meaning of which is obvious. No more should be said.
Second, I agree with the Court, ante, at 5, 8, that the
District Court’s honest-services-fraud instructions to the
jury were erroneous, but for a quite different reason. In
my view, the error lay not in instructing inconsistently
with the theory of honest-services fraud set forth in Skill
ing v. United States, ante, p. ___, but in instructing the
jury on honest-services fraud at all. For the reasons set
forth in my opinion in that case, 18 U. S. C. §1346 is un
constitutionally vague. Skilling, ante, p. ___ (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I join the Court’s opinion except for those parts stating
that 18 U. S. C. §1346 “criminalizes only schemes to de
fraud that involve bribes or kickbacks.” Ante, at 5. For
the reasons set forth in JUSTICE SCALIA’s separate opinion
in Skilling v. United States, ante, p. ___ (opinion concur
ring in part and concurring in judgment), §1346 is uncon
stitutionally vague. To convict a defendant based on an
honest-services-fraud theory, even one limited to bribes or
kickbacks, would violate his or her rights under the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
