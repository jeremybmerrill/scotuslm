No. 08–876 [June 24, 2010]  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join the Court’s opinion with two exceptions. First, I do not join in its reliance, ante, at 7, on the Notes of the Advisory Committee in determining the meaning of Fed eral Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(d). The Committee’s S. p. A., 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). The Court accurately quotes the text of the Rule, see ante, at 7, the meaning of which is obvious. No more should be said. Second, I agree with the Court, ante, at 5, 8, that the District Court’s honest-services-fraud instructions to the jury were erroneous, but for a quite different reason. In my view, the error lay not in instructing inconsistently with the theory of honest-services fraud set forth in Skill jury on honest-services fraud at all. For the reasons set forth in my opinion in that case, 18 U. S. C. §1346 is un constitutionally vague. Skilling, ante, p. ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
No. 08–876 [June 24, 2010]  JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join the Court’s opinion except for those parts stating that 18 U. S. C. §1346 “criminalizes only schemes to de fraud that involve bribes or kickbacks.” Ante, at 5. For the reasons set forth in JUSTICE SCALIA’s separate opinion ring in part and concurring in judgment), §1346 is uncon stitutionally vague. To convict a defendant based on an honest-services-fraud theory, even one limited to bribes or kickbacks, would violate his or her rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
