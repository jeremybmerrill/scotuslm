UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. MARTIN O’BRIEN 

AND ARTHUR BURGESS 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[May 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
In Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002), this
Court held that “ ‘[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,
any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the
prescribed statutory maximum,’ whether the statute calls
it an element or a sentencing factor, ‘must be submitted to
a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,’ ” id., at 550
(quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490
(2000)). I continue to believe that this constitutional
requirement applies to sentencing facts that, like the
machinegun enhancement at issue here, 18 U. S. C.
§924(c)(1)(B)(ii), “alte[r] the [defendant’s] statutorily
mandated sentencing range, by increasing the mandatory
minimum sentence,” regardless of whether they alter the
statutory maximum penalty, Harris, 536 U. S., at 577
(THOMAS, J., dissenting); see id., at 577–578 (“As a matter
of common sense, an increased mandatory minimum
heightens the loss of liberty and represents the increased
stigma society attaches to the offense. Consequently, facts
that trigger an increased mandatory minimum sentence
warrant constitutional safeguards”).
In my view, it makes no difference whether the sentenc
ing fact “vaults a defendant’s mandatory minimum sen
tence” by many years, ante, at 10, or only “ ‘incremental[ly]
changes’ ” it by a few, ibid. (quoting Harris, supra, at 554).

UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

Nor does it make a difference whether the sentencing fact
“involve[s]
characteristics
of
the
offender”
or
“[c]haracteristics of the offense,” ante, at 8, or which direc
tion the other factors in the Court’s five-factor test may
tilt. One question decides the matter: If a sentencing fact
either “raises the floor or raises the ceiling” of the range of
punishments to which a defendant is exposed, it is, “ ‘by
definition [an] “elemen[t].” ’ ” Harris, supra, at 579
(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 483,
n. 10).
Without a finding that a defendant used a machinegun,
the penalty range for a conviction under §924(c)(1)(A)(i) is
five years to life imprisonment. But once that finding is
added, the penalty range becomes harsher—30 years to
life imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii)—thus “expos[ing] a
defendant to greater punishment than what is otherwise
legally prescribed,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 579 (THOMAS, J.,
dissenting). As a consequence, “it is ultimately beside the
point whether as a matter of statutory interpretation [the
machinegun enhancement] is a sentencing factor.” Id., at
576. “[A]s a constitutional matter,” because it establishes
a harsher range of punishments, it must be treated as an
element of a separate, aggravated offense that is submit
ted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid.
Because the Court reaches this same conclusion based
on its analysis of a five-factor test, see ante, at 6–16, I
concur in the judgment.
