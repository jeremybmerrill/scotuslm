CURTIS DARNELL JOHNSON, PETITIONER v.

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[March 2, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
We decide whether the Florida felony offense of battery
by “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another per
son, Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), “has as an element
the use . . . of physical force against the person of an
other,” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a
“violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act,
§924(e)(1).
I
Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing
ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in
violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1).
The Government
sought an enhanced penalty under §924(e), which provides
that a person who violates §922(g) and who “has three
previous convictions” for “a violent felony” “committed on
occasions different from one another” shall be imprisoned
for a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. A
“violent felony” is defined as “any crime punishable by
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year” that:
“(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or
threatened use of physical force against the person of

Opinion of the Court

another; or
“(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of
explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre
sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an
other.” §924(e)(2)(B).
Johnson’s indictment specified five prior felony convic
tions. The Government contended that three of those
convictions—for aggravated battery and for burglary of a
dwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003—
rendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under §924(e)(1).
At the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that
the two 1986 convictions were for “violent felon[ies],” but
he objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction. That
conviction was for simple battery under Florida law, which
ordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat.
§784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant
who (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even
simple battery) before, §784.03(2).
Under §784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person
either “1. [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes
another person against the will of the other,” or
“2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.”
Because the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the
prosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways.
State v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218 (Fla. 2007). It can
prove that the defendant “[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily
harm,” that he “intentionally str[uck]” the victim, or that
he merely “[a]ctually and intentionally touche[d]” the
victim.
Since nothing in the record of Johnson’s 2003 battery
conviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it
rested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see
Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005) (plural
ity opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a
“violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act only

Opinion of the Court

if “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another person
constitutes the use of “physical force” within the meaning
of §924(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Court concluded that it
does, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under §924(e)(1)
to a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.
The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F. 3d 1318 (2008).
We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).
II
Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career
Criminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences
upon “violent career criminal[s],” Fla. Stat. §775.084(4)(d)
(2007), defined to mean persons who have three convic
tions for certain felonies, including any “forcible felony,”
§775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). “[F]orcible felony” is defined to in
clude a list of enumerated felonies—including murder,
manslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated
assault, and aggravated battery—and also “any other
felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or
violence against any individual.” §776.08. In Hearns, the
Florida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of
battery on a law enforcement officer, §784.07(2)(b)—which
requires the same conduct (directed against a law en
forcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under
§784.03(1)(a)—was not a forcible felony. See 961 So. 2d, at
219. It said that since §784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only
the slightest unwanted physical touch, “the use . . . of
physical force” was not an element of the offense. Id., at
219.
Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted
physical touching constitutes “physical force” under 18
U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida
Supreme Court’s conclusion in Hearns that it does not
constitute “physical force.” That is not so. The meaning of
“physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal
law, not state law. And in answering that question we are


4

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

not bound by a state court’s interpretation of a similar—or
even identical—state statute.
We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court’s
interpretation of state law, including its determination of
the elements of Fla. Stat. §784.03(2). See Johnson v.
Fankell, 520 U. S. 911, 916 (1997). The Florida Supreme
Court has held that the element of “actually and inten
tionally touching” under Florida’s battery law is satisfied
by any intentional physical contact, “no matter how
slight.” Hearns, 961 So. 2d, at 218. The most “nominal
contact,” such as a “ta[p] . . . on the shoulder without
consent,” id., at 219, establishes a violation. We apply
“th[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,”
Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324, n. 16 (1979), in
determining whether a felony conviction for battery under
Fla. Stat. §784.03(2) meets the definition of “violent fel
ony” in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i).
III
Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,”
and we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning.
Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144–145 (1995).
The adjective “physical” is clear in meaning but not of
much help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted
by and through concrete bodies—distinguishing physical
force from, for example, intellectual force or emotional
force. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; “force” has a
number of meanings. For present purposes we can ex
clude its specialized meaning in the field of physics: a
cause of the acceleration of mass. Webster’s New Interna
tional Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster’s
Second). In more general usage it means “[s]trength or
energy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of
strength or energy,” “[p]ower to affect strongly in physical
relations,” or “[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint
exerted upon a person.” Id., at 985. Black’s Law Diction


Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)

5

Opinion of the Court

ary 717 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black’s) defines “force”
as “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person
or thing.” And it defines “physical force” as “[f]orce con
sisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against
a robbery victim.” Ibid. All of these definitions suggest a
degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest
touching.
There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the
word “force”: its use in describing one of the elements of
the common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the
intentional application of unlawful force against the per
son of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive
Criminal Law §7.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003);
accord, Black’s 173. The common law held this element of
“force” to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touch
ing. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of
England 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); Lynch v.
Commonwealth, 131 Va. 762, 765, 109 S. E. 427, 428
(1921); see also 2 LaFave & Scott, supra, §7.15(a). The
question is whether the term “force” in 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in
the common-law definition of battery. The Government
asserts that it does. We disagree.
Although a common-law term of art should be given its
established common-law meaning, United States v. Turley,
352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957), we do not assume that a statu
tory word is used as a term of art where that meaning
does not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning,
Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961),
and we “do not force term-of-art definitions into contexts
where they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,”
Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 282 (2006) (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase “physical
force” as used in defining not the crime of battery, but
rather the statutory category of “violent felon[ies],”
§924(e)(2)(B). In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), we


6

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

interpreted the statutory definition of “crime of violence”
in 18 U. S. C. §16. That provision is very similar to
§924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense
which “has as an element the use . . . of physical force
against the person or property of another,” §16(a). We
stated:
“In construing both parts of §16, we cannot forget
that we ultimately are determining the meaning of
the term ‘crime of violence.’ The ordinary meaning of
this term, combined with §16’s emphasis on the use of
physical force against another person (or the risk of
having to use such force in committing a crime), sug
gests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .” 543
U. S., at 11.
Just so here. We think it clear that in the context of a
statutory definition of “violent felony,” the phrase “physi
cal force” means violent force—that is, force capable of
causing physical pain or injury to another person. See
Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easter
brook, J.).
Even by itself, the word “violent” in
§924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Web
ster’s Second 2846 (defining “violent” as “[m]oving, acting,
or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and
sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe;
vehement . . .”); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.
1989) (“[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical
force or strength”); Black’s 1706 (“[o]f, relating to, or char
acterized by strong physical force”). When the adjective
“violent” is attached to the noun “felony,” its connotation
of strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188
(defining “violent felony” as “[a] crime characterized by
extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and
assault and battery with a dangerous weapon”); see also
United States v. Doe, 960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992)
(Breyer, C. J.) (“[T]he term to be defined, ‘violent felony,’

7

Opinion of the Court

. . . calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the
possibility of more closely related, active violence”).
It is significant, moreover, that the meaning of “physical
force” the Government would seek to import into this
definition of “violent felony” is a meaning derived from a
common-law misdemeanor. At common law, battery—all
battery, and not merely battery by the merest touching—
was a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216–
218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave & Scott, supra, §2.1(b), at
90; ALI, Model Penal Code §211.1, Comment, p. 175
(1980). As the dissent points out, post, at 5–6 (opinion of
ALITO, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and
felonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple
battery—whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury
variety—generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.1 See,
e.g., 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §16.1(b) (2d
ed. 2003 and Supp. 2009–2010); Cal. Penal Code Ann.
§§242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(b); Ill.
Comp. Stat., ch. 720, §5/12–3(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal
Code Ann. §22.01(b) (West Supp. 2008). It is unlikely that
Congress would select as a term of art defining “violent
felony” a phrase that the common law gave peculiar mean
ing only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course
“physical force” can be given its common-law misdemeanor
meaning by artful language, but here the only text that
can be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase “physical
force” itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily
——————
1 The dissent notes, post, at 5–6, that, around the time the Armed
Career Criminal Act became law, in “quite a few States” it was a felony
offense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims,
such as police officers. That would be relevant for determining whether
a conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a “felony” conviction. But it has no
bearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses—
making unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of
individuals—involves the use of “force” within the meaning of
§924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.


8

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

(indeed, much more readily) taken to describe violent
force, there is no reason to define “violent felony” by refer
ence to a nonviolent misdemeanor.
The Government argues that we cannot construe 18
U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as
an element the use of violent force, because there is no
modifier in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of
“physical force” required. As we have discussed, however,
the term “physical force” itself normally connotes force
strong enough to constitute “power”—and all the more so
when it is contained in a definition of “violent felony.” Nor
is there any merit to the dissent’s contention, post, at 4,
that the term “force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to
require violent force, because Congress specifically named
“burglary” and “extortion” as “violent felon[ies]” in
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can
be committed without violence. The point would have
force (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in
§924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have “as an element the
use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.”
In fact, however, they are listed in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as
examples of felonies that “presen[t] a serious potential risk
of physical injury to another.” The Government has not
argued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies
under this latter provision. What the dissent’s argument
comes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies
that create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as
violent felonies under subparagraph (B)(ii), felonies that
involve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of
physical force and qualify as violent felonies under sub
paragraph (B)(i). That obviously does not follow. 2
——————
2 Even further afield is the dissent’s argument, post, at 2–3, that since
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires conduct that “presents a serious potential risk
of physical injury to another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i) must not. That is rather
like saying a provision which includes (i) apples and (ii) overripe
oranges must exclude overripe apples. It does not follow.

Opinion of the Court

The Government also asks us to draw a negative infer
ence from the presence of the “bodily injury” specification
added to the phrase “physical force” in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii).
That provision forbids the possession of firearms by a
person subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the
“use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force
against [an] intimate partner or child that would reasona
bly be expected to cause bodily injury.” Ibid. The absence
of such language in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government
contends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a
matter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that
“physical force” must rise to the level of bodily injury does
not suggest that without the qualification “physical force”
would consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for
example, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict
pain—a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is
not a case where Congress has “include[d] particular
language in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in
another section of the same Act,” Russello v. United States,
464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted;
emphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into
law in 1994—eight years after enactment of the language
in §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103–322, §110401,
108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99–570, §1402, 100
Stat. 3207–39 (1986).
IV
The Government contends that interpreting 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its
ability to enforce the firearm disability in §922(g)(9) for
persons who previously have been convicted of a “misde
meanor crime of domestic violence,” which is defined to
include certain misdemeanor offenses that have, “as an
element, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,”
§921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The prediction is unfounded. We have
interpreted the phrase “physical force” only in the context


10

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

of a statutory definition of “violent felony.” We do not
decide that the phrase has the same meaning in the con
text of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
The issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.
In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our
interpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pur
suant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a
“crime of domestic violence.” That phrase is defined to
mean “any crime of violence (as defined in [18 U. S. C.
§16])” committed by certain persons, including spouses,
former spouses, and parents. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Gov
ernment contends it will be harder to obtain removal
based upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida,
do not require the use of violent physical force. The dis
sent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identi
fied, post, at 6–7, and n. 3, as having generic felony
battery statutes that cover both violent force and un
wanted physical contact, our decision will render convic
tions under those statutes “outside the scope of [the
Armed Career Criminal Act],” post, at 8.
This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.
When the law under which the defendant has been con
victed contains statutory phrases that cover several differ
ent generic crimes, some of which require violent force and
some of which do not, the “ ‘modified categorical approach’ ”
that we have approved, Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___,
___ (2009) (slip op., at 10), permits a court to determine
which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by
consulting the trial record—including charging docu
ments, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies,
findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial,
and jury instructions and verdict forms. See Chambers v.
United States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4);
Shepard, 544 U. S., at 26 (plurality opinion); Taylor v.
United States, 495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990). Indeed, the
Government has in the past obtained convictions under


Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)

11

Opinion of the Court

the Armed Career Criminal Act in precisely this manner.
See, e.g., United States v. Simms, 441 F. 3d 313, 316–317
(CA4 2006) (Maryland battery); cf. United States v.
Robledo-Leyva, 307 Fed. Appx. 859, 862 (CA5) (Florida
battery), cert. denied, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); United States
v. Luque-Barahona, 272 Fed. Appx. 521, 524–525 (CA7
2008) (same).
It may well be true, as the Government contends,
that in many cases state and local records from
battery convictions will be incomplete. But absence of
records will often frustrate application of the modified
categorical approach—not just to battery but to many
other crimes as well. See, e.g., Shepard, supra, at 22–23
(burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common
enough consequence with respect to the single crime of
battery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career
Criminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art
that is a comical misfit with the defined term “violent
felony.”
*
*
*
The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh
Circuit for its consideration of whether Johnson’s 2003
battery conviction is a “violent felony” within the meaning
of the so-called “residual clause” in 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We decline to do so. The Government
did not keep this option alive because it disclaimed at
sentencing any reliance upon the residual clause. App.
44–45. Moreover, the parties briefed the §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)
issue to the Eleventh Circuit, which nonetheless reasoned
that if Johnson’s conviction under Fla. Stat. §784.03(2)
satisfied §924(e)(2)(B)(i), then it was a predicate “violent
felony” under §924(e)(1); but “if not, then not.” 528 F. 3d,
at 1320.
We reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit, set
aside Johnson’s sentence, and remand the case for further

proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
