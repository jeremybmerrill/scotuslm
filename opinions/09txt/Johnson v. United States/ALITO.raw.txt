CURTIS DARNELL JOHNSON, PETITIONER v.

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[March 2, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS, joins,
dissenting.
The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) defines a “vio
lent felony” to mean, among other things, “any crime
punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year
. . . that . . . has as an element the use, attempted use, or
threatened use of physical force against the person of
another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).
The classic definition of the crime of battery is the “inten
tional application of unlawful force against the person of
another.” Ante, at 5 (citing 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Sub
stantive Criminal Law §7.15, p. 301 (1986 and Supp.
2003); Black’s Law Dictionary 173 (9th ed. 2009)). Thus,
the crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls
squarely within the plain language of ACCA. Because I
believe that ACCA was meant to incorporate this tradi
tional definition, I would affirm the decision of the Court
of Appeals.
I
The Court starts out in the right direction by noting
that the critical statutory language—“the use, attempted
use, or threatened use of physical force against the person
of another,” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i)—may mean either
(a) the use of violent force or (b) the use of force that is

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

sufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery.
See ante, at 4–5. The Court veers off course, however, by
concluding that the statutory language reaches only vio
lent force.
The term “force,” as the Court correctly notes, had a
well-established meaning at common law that included
even the “slightest offensive touching.” Ante, at 5. See
also Respublica v. De Longchamps, 1 Dall. 111, 114 (O. T.
Phila. 1784) (“[T]hough no great bodily pain is suffered by
a blow on the palm of the hand, or the skirt of the coat, yet
these are clearly within the legal d[e]finition of Assault
and Battery. . .”); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone).
This approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent
touching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be
even more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient
to inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap
in the face).
When Congress selects statutory language with a well
known common-law meaning, we generally presume that
Congress intended to adopt that meaning. See, e.g.,
United States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957) (“We
recognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a
common-law term of established meaning without other
wise defining it, the general practice is to give that term
its common-law meaning”); Morissette v. United States,
342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952); United States v. Carll, 105 U. S.
611, 612–613 (1882). And here, I see nothing to suggest
that Congress meant the phrase “use of physical force” in
ACCA to depart from that phrase’s meaning at common
law.
On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory
interpretation point to the same conclusion. “[W]here
Congress includes particular language in one section of a
statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it
is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally

and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion. ”
Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal
quotation
marks
omitted).
In
18
U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii)—the clause immediately following the
clause at issue in this case—the term “violent felony” is
defined as including any crime that “involves conduct that
presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an
other.” (Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not
include a similar limitation in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should
presume that it did not intend for such a limitation to
apply.
The language used by Congress in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii)
further illustrates this point. This provision criminalizes,
among other things, the possession of a firearm by a per
son who is subject to a court order that “explicitly prohib
its the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical
force against [an] intimate partner or child that would
reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.” (Emphasis
added.) Although §922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until
eight years after §924(e)(2)(B)(i), see ante, at 9, the former
provision is nevertheless instructive. If Congress had
wanted to include in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to
those in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and §922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress
could have easily done so expressly.
II
The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret
18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the com
mon-law understanding, but neither is persuasive.
A
The Court first argues that §924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read
to refer to “violent” force because that provision defines
the term “violent felony.” Ante, at 6. But it is apparent
that ACCA uses “violent felony” as a term of art with a
wider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

usage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and
extortion are “violent felon[ies],” §924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we
have held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted
burglary, James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007).
All of these offenses may be committed without violent
force,1 and it is therefore clear that the use of such force is
not a requirement under ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies
crimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies
because they often lead to violence. As we have put it,
these crimes create “significant risks of . . . confrontation
that might result in bodily injury,” id., at 199, and offen
sive touching creates just such a risk. For example, when
one bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely conse
quence. See United States v. Velazquez-Overa, 100 F. 3d
418, 422 (CA5 1996) (“If burglary, with its tendency to
cause alarm and to provoke physical confrontation, is
considered a violent crime under 18 U. S. C. §16(b), then
surely the same is true of the far greater intrusion that
occurs when a child is sexually molested”); United States
v. Wood, 52 F. 3d 272, 276 (CA9 1995) (same).
——————
1 For the purposes of ACCA, burglary is defined as “an unlawful or
unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure,
with intent to commit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,
598 (1990). See also James, 550 U. S., at 197, 198, 202–203 (attempted
burglary under Florida law requires “overt conduct directed toward
unlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to
commit a felony therein” and that the “defendant fail in the perpetra
tion or be intercepted or prevented in the execution of the underlying
offense” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although we have not
defined extortion under ACCA, the Hobbs Act defines it as “the obtain
ing of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use
of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official
right.” 18 U. S. C. §1951(b)(2) (emphasis added); see also James, supra,
at 223–224 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (defining extortion in ACCA as “the
obtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced
by the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or
property of another” (emphasis added)).

B
The Court’s only other reason for rejecting the common
law definition is the fact that battery at common law was
a misdemeanor. The Court reasons that “[i]t is unlikely
that Congress would select as a term of art defining ‘vio
lent felony’ a phrase that the common law gave peculiar
meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.” Ante, at
7 (citing 4 Blackstone 216–218 (1769), and ALI, Model
Penal Code §211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)). The Court
does not spell out why Congress’ selection of this term
would be unlikely, but I assume that the Court’s point is
that Congress is unlikely to have decided to treat as a
violent felony an offense that was regarded at common law
as a mere misdemeanor. This argument overlooks the
significance of the misdemeanor label at common law, the
subsequent evolution of battery statutes, and the limita
tion imposed by 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B).
At common law, the terms “felony” and “misdemeanor”
did not have the same meaning as they do today. At that
time, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, see
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 480, n. 7 (2000);
most felonies were punishable by death, see Tennessee v.
Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985); and many very serious
crimes, such as kidnaping and assault with the intent to
murder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors. See
United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 439–440 (1976)
(Marshall, J., dissenting). Since that time, however, the
term “felony” has come to mean any offense punishable by
a lengthy term of imprisonment (commonly more than one
year, see Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130
(2008)); the term “misdemeanor” has been reserved for
minor offenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors
at common law have been reclassified as felonies. And
when the relevant language in ACCA was enacted, quite a
few States had felony battery statutes that retained the
common-law definition of “force.” See Fla. Stat.

§784.07(2)(b) (1987) (making simple battery of a police
officer a felony); Idaho Code §18–915(c) (Lexis 1987)
(same); Ill. Crim. Code §12–4(b)(6) (1988) (same); La. Stat.
Ann. §§14:33, 14:43.1 (West 1986) (sexual battery punish
able by more than one year’s imprisonment); N. M. Stat.
Ann. §40A–22–23 (1972) (battery of a police officer a fel
ony); see also Kansas Stat. Ann. §21–3413(b) (Supp. 1994)
(simple battery of corrections officers a felony).2
ACCA’s mechanism for identifying the battery convic
tions that merit treatment as “violent felon[ies]” is con
tained in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), which provides that
an offense committed by an adult is not a “violent felony”
unless it is “punishable by imprisonment for a term ex
ceeding one year.” Consequently, while all convictions
under battery statutes that track the common-law defini
tion of the offense satisfy the requirements of
§924(e)(2)(B)(i)—because they have “as an element the
use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force
against the person of another”—not all battery convictions
qualify as convictions for a violent felony because
§924(e)(2)(B) excludes any battery conviction that was not
regarded by the jurisdiction of conviction as being suffi
ciently serious to be punishable by imprisonment for more
than one year. There is nothing extraordinary or unlikely
about this approach.

The Court’s interpretation will have untoward conse
quences. Almost half of the States have statutes that

“force,” did not adopt a meaning “peculiar . . . [to the] definition of a
misdemeanor,” see ante, at 7, and, therefore, they are relevant in
determining whether touching involves the use of force under ACCA.

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

no doubt, based on the use of violent force, the effect of the
Court’s decision will be to take all these convictions out
side the scope of ACCA—unless the Government is able to
produce documents that may properly be consulted under
the modified categorical approach and that conclusively
show that the offender’s conduct involved the use of vio
lent force, see ante, at 10–11. As the Government notes,
however, this will often be impossible because, in those
States in which the same battery provision governs both
the use of violent force and offensive touching, charging
documents frequently simply track the language of the
statute, and jury instructions often do not require juries to
draw distinctions based on the type of force that the de
fendant employed. See Brief for United States 42–43.
In addition, the Court’s interpretation of the term
“physical force” may hobble at least two federal statutes
that contain this identical term. Under 18 U. S. C.
§922(g)(9), a person convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of
domestic violence” may not lawfully possess a firearm, and
the term “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” is
defined as applying only to crimes that “ha[ve], as an
element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the
threatened use of a deadly weapon.” §921(a)(33)(A) (em
phasis added). As we recently explained, Congress recog
nized that “ ‘many people who engage in serious spousal or
child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of
felonies,’ ” and Congress therefore enacted this provision to
keep firearms out of the hands of such abusers. United
States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10).
Cases of spousal and child abuse are frequently prosecuted
under generally applicable assault and battery statutes,
ibid., and as noted, the assault and battery statutes of
almost half the States apply both to cases involving the
use of violent force and cases involving offensive touching.
As a result, if the Court’s interpretation of the term
“physical force” in ACCA is applied to §922(g)(9), a great

many persons convicted for serious spousal or child abuse
will be allowed to possess firearms.
Under 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a
“crime of domestic violence” is subject to removal, and the
term “crime of domestic violence” is defined as an offense
that, among other things, has “as an element the use [or]
attempted use . . . of physical force.” 18 U. S. C. §16(a).
Accordingly, if the Court’s interpretation of the term
“physical force” is applied to this provision, many con
victed spousal and child abusers will escape removal, a
result that Congress is unlikely to have intended.

For all these reasons, I believe that the Court’s decision
is incorrect, and I therefore respectfully dissent.
