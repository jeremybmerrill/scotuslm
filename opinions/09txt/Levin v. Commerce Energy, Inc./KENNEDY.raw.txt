RICHARD A. LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO,
PETITIONER v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
[June 1, 2010]

JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.
The Court’s rationale in Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88
(2004), seems to me still doubtful. Nothing in the Court’s
opinion today expands Hibbs’ holding further, however,
and on that understanding I join the opinion of the Court.
