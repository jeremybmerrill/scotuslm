HEMI GROUP, LLC AND KAI GACHUPIN, 

PETITIONERS v. CITY OF NEW YORK, 

NEW YORK

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[January 25, 2010] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
As the Court points out, this is a case “about the RICO
liability of a company for lost taxes it had no obligation to
collect, remit, or pay.” Ante, at 15. New York City (or
City) cannot, consistent with the Commerce Clause, com
pel Hemi Group, an out-of-state seller, to collect a City
sales or use tax. See Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504
U. S. 298, 301 (1992); National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. De
partment of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 753, 758 (1967).
Unable to impose its tax on Hemi Group, or to require
Hemi Group to collect its tax, New York City is attempting
to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Act (RICO),
18 U. S. C. §1964(c), in combination with the Jenkins Act,
15 U. S. C. §§375–378, to overcome that disability.
Hemi Group committed fraud only insofar as it violated
the Jenkins Act by failing to report the names and ad
dresses of New York purchasers to New York State. There
is no other grounding for the City’s charge that it was
defrauded by Hemi Group. “Absent the Jenkins Act,
[Hemi Group] would have owed no duty to disclose [its]
sales to anyone, and [its] failure to disclose could not
conceivably be deemed fraud of any kind.” City of New
York v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc., 541 F. 3d 425, 460 (CA2

HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK
Opinion of GINSBURG, J.,

2008) (Winter, J., dissenting in part and concurring in
part).
Because “the alleged fraud is based on violations of . . .
the Jenkins Act, . . . the nature and consequences of the
fraud are [properly] determined solely by the scope of that
Act.” Id., at 459. But “conspicuously absent from the
City’s pleadings is any claim brought pursuant to the
Jenkins Act itself, rather than RICO, seeking enforcement
of the Jenkins Act.” Id., at 460. The City thus effectively
admits that its claim is outside the scope of the very stat
ute on which it builds its RICO suit.
I resist reading RICO to allow the City to end-run its
lack of authority to collect tobacco taxes from Hemi Group
or to reshape the “quite limited remedies” Congress has
provided for violations of the Jenkins Act, see ante, at 13,
n. 2. Without subscribing to the broader range of the
Court’s proximate cause analysis, I join the Court’s opin
ion to the extent it is consistent with the above-stated
view, and I concur in the Court’s judgment.
