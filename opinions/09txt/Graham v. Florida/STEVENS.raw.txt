TERRANCE JAMAR GRAHAM, PETITIONER v.

FLORIDA 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL
OF FLORIDA, FIRST DISTRICT
[May 17, 2010]

JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, concurring.
In his dissenting opinion, JUSTICE THOMAS argues that
today’s holding is not entirely consistent with the control
ling opinions in Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63 (2003),
Ewing v. California, 538 U. S. 11 (2003), Harmelin v.
Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), and Rummel v. Estelle,
445 U. S. 263 (1980). Post, at 7–9. Given that “evolving
standards of decency” have played a central role in our
Eighth Amendment jurisprudence for at least a century,
see Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 373–378 (1910),
this argument suggests the dissenting opinions in those
cases more accurately describe the law today than does
JUSTICE THOMAS’ rigid interpretation of the Amendment.
Society changes. Knowledge accumulates. We learn,
sometimes, from our mistakes. Punishments that did not
seem cruel and unusual at one time may, in the light of
reason and experience, be found cruel and unusual at a
later time; unless we are to abandon the moral commit
ment embodied in the Eighth Amendment, proportionality
review must never become effectively obsolete, post, at
8–9, and n. 2.
While JUSTICE THOMAS would apparently not rule out a
death sentence for a $50 theft by a 7-year-old, see post, at
4, 10, n. 3, the Court wisely rejects his static approach to

the law. Standards of decency have evolved since 1980.
They will never stop doing so.
