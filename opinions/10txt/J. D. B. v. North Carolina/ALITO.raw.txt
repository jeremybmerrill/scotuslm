J. D. B., PETITIONER v. NORTH CAROLINA
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

NORTH CAROLINA

[June 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE
SCALIA, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.
The Court’s decision in this case may seem on first
consideration to be modest and sensible, but in truth it
is neither. It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the
main justifications for the Miranda1 rule: the perceived
need for a clear rule that can be easily applied in all cases.
And today’s holding is not needed to protect the constitu­
tional rights of minors who are questioned by the police.
Miranda’s prophylactic regime places a high value on
clarity and certainty. Dissatisfied with the highly fact­
specific constitutional rule against the admission of involuntary confessions, the Miranda Court set down rigid
standards that often require courts to ignore personal
characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular
suspect’s actual susceptibility to police pressure. This
rigidity, however, has brought with it one of Miranda’s
principal strengths—“the ease and clarity of its applica­
tion” by law enforcement officials and courts. See Moran
v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 425–426 (1986). A key contribu­
tor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been
Miranda’s objective reasonable-person test for determin­
ing custody.
Miranda’s custody requirement is based on the proposi­
——————

Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).

J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
ALITO, J., dissenting

tion that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is height­
ened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is
subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on
freedom of movement. When this custodial threshold is
reached, Miranda warnings must precede police question­
ing. But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis
considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypo­
thetical reasonable person would consider himself to be
confined.
Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypotheti­
cal reasonable person. Some, including those who have
been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need
for Miranda warnings at all. And for other suspects—
those who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of
police questioning—Miranda warnings may come too late
to be of any use. That is a necessary consequence of
Miranda’s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the
constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects
are left unprotected. A vulnerable defendant can still turn
to the constitutional rule against actual coercion and
contend that that his confession was extracted against his
will.
Today’s decision shifts the Miranda custody determina­
tion from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an
inquiry that must account for at least one individualized
characteristic—age—that is thought to correlate with sus­
ceptibility to coercive pressures. Age, however, is in no
way the only personal characteristic that may correlate
with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced
to choose between two unpalatable alternatives. It may
choose to limit today’s decision by arbitrarily distinguish­
ing a suspect’s age from other personal characteristics—
such as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior ex­
perience with law enforcement—that may also correlate
with susceptibility to coercive pressures. Or, if the Court
is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced

ALITO, J., dissenting

to effect a fundamental transformation of the Miranda
custody test—from a clear, easily applied prophylactic
rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the
voluntariness test that the Miranda Court found to be
unsatisfactory.
For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down
this road. First, many minors subjected to police interro­
gation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects
the one-size-fits-all Miranda custody rule may not be a
bad fit. Second, many of the difficulties in applying the
Miranda custody rule to minors arise because of the
unique circumstances present when the police conduct
interrogations at school. The Miranda custody rule has
always taken into account the setting in which question­
ing occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such
cases will address many of these problems. Third, in cases
like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially
young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness
standard can take special care to ensure that incriminat­
ing statements were not obtained through coercion.
Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does
not require the extreme makeover of Miranda that today’s
decision may portend.
I
In the days before Miranda, this Court’s sole metric for
evaluating the admissibility of confessions was a volun­
tariness standard rooted in both the Fifth Amendment’s
Self-Incrimination Clause and the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bram v. United States,
168 U. S. 532, 542 (1897) (Self-Incrimination Clause);
Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936) (due process).
The question in these voluntariness cases was whether the
particular “defendant’s will” had been “overborne.”
Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528, 534 (1963). Courts took
into account both “the details of the interrogation” and


4

J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
ALITO, J., dissenting

“the characteristics of the accused,” Schneckloth v. Busta
monte, 412 U. S. 218, 226 (1973), and then “weigh[ed] . . .
the circumstances of pressure against the power of resis­
tance of the person confessing.” Stein v. New York, 346
U. S. 156, 185 (1953).
All manner of individualized, personal characteristics
were relevant in this voluntariness inquiry. Among the
most frequently mentioned factors were the defendant’s
education, physical condition, intelligence, and mental
health. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 693 (1993);
see Clewis v. Texas, 386 U. S. 707, 712 (1967) (“only a
fifth-grade education”); Greenwald v. Wisconsin, 390 U. S.
519, 520–521 (1968) (per curiam) (had not taken blood­
pressure medication); Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560,
562, n. 4, 567 (1958) (“mentally dull” and “ ‘slow to learn’ ”);
Fikes v. Alabama, 352 U. S. 191, 193, 196, 198 (1957) (“low
mentality, if not mentally ill”). The suspect’s age also
received prominent attention in several cases, e.g.,
Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49, 54 (1962), especially
when the suspect was a “mere child.” Haley v. Ohio, 332
U. S. 596, 599 (1948) (plurality opinion). The weight
assigned to any one consideration varied from case to case.
But all of these factors, along with anything else that
might have affected the “individual’s . . . capacity for
effective choice,” were relevant in determining whether
the confession was coerced or compelled. See Miranda
v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 506–507 (1966) (Harlan, J.,
dissenting).
The all-encompassing nature of the voluntariness in­
quiry had its benefits. It allowed courts to accommodate a
“complex of values,” Schneckloth, supra, at 223, 224, and
to make a careful, highly individualized determination as
to whether the police had wrung “a confession out of [the]
accused against his will.” Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S.
199, 206–207 (1960). But with this flexibility came a
decrease in both certainty and predictability, and the

ALITO, J., dissenting

voluntariness standard proved difficult “for law enforce­
ment officers to conform to, and for courts to apply in a
consistent manner.” Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S.
428, 444 (2000).
In Miranda, the Court supplemented the voluntariness
inquiry with a “set of prophylactic measures” designed to
ward off the “ ‘inherently compelling pressures’ of custodial
interrogation.” See Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. __, __
(2010) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467).
Miranda greatly simplified matters by requiring police to
give suspects standard warnings before commencing any
custodial interrogation. See id., at 479. Its requirements
are no doubt “rigid,” see Fare v. Michael C., 439 U. S.
1310, 1314 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers), and they
often require courts to suppress “trustworthy and highly
probative” statements that may be perfectly “voluntary
under [a] traditional Fifth Amendment analysis.” Fare v.
Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 718 (1979). But with this rigid­
ity comes increased clarity. Miranda provides “a worka­
ble rule to guide police officers,” New York v. Quarles, 467
U. S. 649, 658 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted),
and an administrable standard for the courts. As has
often been recognized, this gain in clarity and administra­
bility is one of Miranda’s “principal advantages.” Berke
mer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 430 (1984); see also Mis
souri v. Seibert, 542 U. S. 600, 622 (2004) (KENNEDY, J., con­
curring in judgment).
No less than other facets of Miranda, the threshold
requirement that the suspect be in “custody” is “designed
to give clear guidance to the police.” Yarborough v. Alva
rado, 541 U. S. 652, 668, 669 (2004). Custody under
Miranda attaches where there is a “formal arrest” or a
“restraint on freedom of movement” akin to formal arrest.
California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1125 (1983) (per
curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). This stan­
dard is “objective” and turns on how a hypothetical “rea­

ALITO, J., dissenting

sonable person in the position of the individual being
questioned would gauge the breadth of his or her freedom
of action.” Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322–
323, 325 (1994) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
Until today, the Court’s cases applying this test have
focused solely on the “objective circumstances of the inter­
rogation,” id., at 323, not the personal characteristics of
the interrogated. E.g., Berkemer, supra, at 442, and n. 35;
but cf. Schneckloth, 412 U. S., at 226 (voluntariness in­
quiry requires consideration of “the details of the interro­
gation” and “the characteristics of the accused”). Relevant
factors have included such things as where the question­
ing occurred,2 how long it lasted,3 what was said,4
any physical restraints placed on the suspect’s movement,5
and whether the suspect was allowed to leave when
the questioning was through.6 The totality of these
circumstances—the external circumstances, that is, of the
interrogation itself—is what has mattered in this Court’s
cases. Personal characteristics of suspects have consis­
tently been rejected or ignored as irrelevant under a one­
size-fits-all reasonable-person standard. Stansbury, supra,
at 323 (“[C]ustody depends on the objective circumstances
of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored
by either the interrogating officers or the person being
questioned”).
For example, in Berkemer v. McCarty, supra, police
officers conducting a traffic stop questioned a man who
had been drinking and smoking marijuana before he was
pulled over. Id., at 423. Although the suspect’s inebria­

tion was readily apparent to the officers at the scene, ibid.,
the Court’s analysis did not advert to this or any other
individualized consideration. Instead, the Court focused
only on the external circumstances of the interrogation
itself. The opinion concluded that a typical “traffic stop” is
akin to a “Terry stop”7 and does not qualify as the equiva­
lent of “formal arrest.” Id., at 439.
California v. Beheler, supra, is another useful example.
There, the circumstances of the interrogation were “re­
markably similar” to the facts of the Court’s earlier deci­
sion in Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492 (1977) (per
curiam)—the suspect was “not placed under arrest,” he
“voluntarily [came] to the police station,” and he was
“allowed to leave unhindered by police after a brief inter­
view.” 463 U. S., at 1123, 1121. A California court in
Beheler had nonetheless distinguished Mathiason because
the police knew that Beheler “had been drinking earlier in
the day” and was “emotionally distraught.” 463 U. S., at
1124–1125. In a summary reversal, this Court explained
that the fact “[t]hat the police knew more” personal infor­
mation about Beheler than they did about Mathiason was
“irrelevant.” Id., at 1125. Neither one of them was in
custody under the objective reasonable-person standard.
Ibid.; see also Alvarado, supra, at 668, 669 (experience
with law enforcement irrelevant to Miranda custody
analysis “as a de novo matter”).8
The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteris­
——————

Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968).
Court claims that “[n]ot once” have any of our cases “excluded
from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was
relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial
and noncustodial ‘brighter.’ ” Ante, at 17. Surely this is incorrect. The
very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all
sorts of “relevant and objective” circumstances—for example, all the
objective circumstances of a suspect’s life history—that might otherwise
bear on a custody determination.
8 The

ALITO, J., dissenting

tics in these and other custody cases should come as no
surprise. To account for such individualized considera­
tions would be to contradict Miranda’s central premise.
The Miranda Court’s decision to adopt its inflexible pro­
phylactic requirements was expressly based on the notion
that “[a]ssessments of the knowledge the defendant pos­
sessed, based on information as to his age, education,
intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be
more than speculation.” 384 U. S., at 468–469.
II
In light of this established practice, there is no denying
that, by incorporating age into its analysis, the Court is
embarking on a new expansion of the established custody
standard. And since Miranda is this Court’s rule, “not a
constitutional command,” it is up to the Court “to justify
its expansion.” Cf. Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 688
(1988) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). This the Court fails to
do.
In its present form, Miranda’s prophylactic regime
already imposes “high cost[s]” by requiring suppression of
confessions that are often “highly probative” and “volun­
tary” by any traditional standard. Oregon v. Elstad, 470
U. S. 298, 312 (1985); see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 444
(under Miranda “statements which may be by no means
involuntary, made by a defendant who is aware of his
‘rights,’ may nonetheless be excluded and a guilty defen­
dant go free as a result”). Nonetheless, a “core virtue” of
Miranda has been the clarity and precision of its guidance
to “police and courts.” Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680,
694 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Moran,
475 U. S., at 425 (“[O]ne of the principal advantages of
Miranda is the ease and clarity of its application” (inter­
nal quotation marks omitted)). This increased clarity “has
been thought to outweigh the burdens” that Miranda
imposes. Fare, 442 U. S., at 718. The Court has, however,

9

ALITO, J., dissenting

repeatedly cautioned against upsetting the careful “bal­
ance” that Miranda struck, Moran, supra, at 424, and it
has “refused to sanction attempts to expand [the] Miranda
holding” in ways that would reduce its “clarity.” See
Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658 (citing cases). Given this prac­
tice, there should be a “strong presumption” against the
Court’s new departure from the established custody test.
See United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630, 640 (2004)
(plurality opinion). In my judgment, that presumption
cannot be overcome here.
A
The Court’s rationale for importing age into the custody
standard is that minors tend to lack adults’ “capacity to
exercise mature judgment” and that failing to account for
that “reality” will leave some minors unprotected under
Miranda in situations where they perceive themselves to
be confined. See ante, at 10, 8. I do not dispute that many
suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to
police pressure than the average adult. As the Court
notes, our pre-Miranda cases were particularly attuned to
this “reality” in applying the constitutional requirement of
voluntariness in fact. Ante, at 9 (relying on Haley, 332
U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and Gallegos, 370 U. S.,
at 54). It is no less a “reality,” however, that many per­
sons over the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police
pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person. See
Payne, 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a “men­
tally dull 19-year-old youth” relevant in voluntariness
inquiry). Yet the Miranda custody standard has never
accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any
other individual defendants.
Indeed, it has always been the case under Miranda that
the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same
fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as
those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.

J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
ALITO, J., dissenting

Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 442, and n. 35 (“[O]nly relevant
inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect’s position
would have understood his situation”). Miranda’s rigid
standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.
They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a
windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who
often have no need for Miranda’s protections. Compare
Miranda, supra, at 471–472 (“[N]o amount of circumstan­
tial evidence that the person may have been aware of ” his
rights can overcome Miranda’s requirements), with Orozco
v. Texas, 394 U. S. 324, 329 (1969) (White, J., dissenting)
(“Where the defendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman,
professional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of
what his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that
his answer to every question asked him is compelled
unless he is advised of those rights with which he is al­
ready intimately familiar”). And Miranda’s requirements
are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account
for “frailties,” “idiosyncrasies,” and other individualized
considerations that might cause a person to bend more
easily during a confrontation with the police. See Alva
rado, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major
weakness in Miranda’s “code of rules for confessions.” See
384 U. S., at 504 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Fare, 439 U. S.,
at 1314 (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (“[T]he rigidity of
[Miranda’s] prophylactic rules was a principal weakness
in the view of dissenters and critics outside the Court”).
But if it is, then the weakness is an inescapable conse­
quence of the Miranda Court’s decision to supplement the
more holistic voluntariness requirement with a one-size­
fits-all prophylactic rule.
That is undoubtedly why this Court’s Miranda cases
have never before mentioned “the suspect’s age” or any
other individualized consideration in applying the custody
standard. See Alvarado, supra, at 666. And unless the

ALITO, J., dissenting

Miranda custody rule is now to be radically transformed
into one that takes into account the wide range of individ­
ual characteristics that are relevant in determining
whether a confession is voluntary, the Court must shoul­
der the burden of explaining why age is different from
these other personal characteristics.
Why, for example, is age different from intelligence?
Suppose that an officer, upon going to a school to question
a student, is told by the principal that the student has an
I. Q. of 75 and is in a special-education class. Cf. In re
J. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 666, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 136–137
(2009). Are those facts more or less important than the
student’s age in determining whether he or she “felt . . . at
liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave”? See
Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995). An I. Q.
score, like age, is more than just a number. Ante, at 8
(“[A]ge is far ‘more than a chronological fact’ ”). And an
individual’s intelligence can also yield “conclusions” simi­
lar to those “we have drawn ourselves” in cases far afield
of Miranda. Ante, at 12. Compare ibid. (relying on Ed
dings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), and Roper v.
Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005)), with Smith v. Texas, 543
U. S. 37, 44–45 (2004) (per curiam).
How about the suspect’s cultural background? Suppose
the police learn (or should have learned, see ante, at 11)
that a suspect they wish to question is a recent immigrant
from a country in which dire consequences often befall any
person who dares to attempt to cut short any meeting with
the police.9 Is this really less relevant than the fact that a
suspect is a month or so away from his 18th birthday?
The defendant’s education is another personal charac­

United States v. Chalan, 812 F. 2d 1302, 1307 (CA10 1987) (re­
jecting claim that Native American suspect was “in custody” for
Miranda purposes because, by custom, obedience to tribal authorities
was “expected of all tribal members”).

teristic that may generate “conclusions about behavior and
perception.” Ante, at 9 (internal quotation marks omit­
ted). Under today’s decision, why should police officers
and courts “blind themselves,” ante, at 1, to the fact that a
suspect has “only a fifth-grade education”? See Clewis,
386 U. S., at 712 (voluntariness case). Alternatively, what
if the police know or should know that the suspect is “a
college-educated man with law school training”? See
Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 440 (1958), overruled
by Miranda, supra, at 479, and n. 48. How are these
individual considerations meaningfully different from age
in their “relationship to a reasonable person’s understand­
ing of his freedom of action”? Ante, at 11. The Court
proclaims that “[a] child’s age . . . is different,” ante, at 12,
but the basis for this ipse dixit is dubious.
I have little doubt that today’s decision will soon be cited
by defendants—and perhaps by prosecutors as well—for
the proposition that all manner of other individual charac­
teristics should be treated like age and taken into account
in the Miranda custody calculus. Indeed, there are al­
ready lower court decisions that take this approach. See
United States v. Beraun-Panez, 812 F. 2d 578, 581, modi­
fied 830 F. 2d 127 (CA9 1987) (“reasonable person who
was an alien”); In re Jorge D., 202 Ariz. 277, 280, 43
P. 3d 605, 608 (App. 2002) (age, maturity, and experience);
State v. Doe, 130 Idaho 811, 818, 948 P. 2d 166, 173
(1997) (same); In re Joshua David C., 116 Md. App. 580,
594, 698 A. 2d 1155, 1162 (1997) (“education, age, and
intelligence”).
In time, the Court will have to confront these issues,
and it will be faced with a difficult choice. It may choose
to distinguish today’s decision and adhere to the arbitrary
proclamation that “age . . . is different.” Ante, at 12. Or it
may choose to extend today’s holding and, in doing so,
further undermine the very rationale for the Miranda
regime.

B
If the Court chooses the latter course, then a core virtue
of Miranda—the “ease and clarity of its application”—will
be lost. Moran, 475 U. S., at 425; see Fare, 442 U. S., at
718 (noting that the clarity of Miranda’s requirements
“has been thought to outweigh the burdens that the deci­
sion . . . imposes”). However, even today’s more limited
departure from Miranda’s one-size-fits-all reasonable­
person test will produce the very consequences that
prompted the Miranda Court to abandon exclusive reli­
ance on the voluntariness test in the first place: The
Court’s test will be hard for the police to follow, and it will
be hard for judges to apply. See Dickerson v. United
States, 530 U. S. 428, 444 (2000).
The Court holds that age must be taken into account
when it “was known to the officer at the time of the inter­
view,” or when it “would have been objectively apparent”
to a reasonable officer. Ante, at 11. The first half of this
test overturns the rule that the “initial determination of
custody” does not depend on the “subjective views har­
bored by . . . interrogating officers.” Stansbury, 511 U. S.,
at 323. The second half will generate time-consuming
satellite litigation over a reasonable officer’s perceptions.
When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the
inquiry may be relatively simple. But not all police ques­
tioning of minors takes place in schools. In many cases,
courts will presumably have to make findings as to
whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful
look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the
suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer
would have recognized that a suspect’s I. D. was a fake.
The inquiry will be both “time-consuming and disruptive”
for the police and the courts. See Berkemer, 468 U. S., at
432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar
considerations). It will also be made all the more compli­
cated by the fact that a suspect’s dress and manner will


14

J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
ALITO, J., dissenting

often be different when the issue is litigated in court than
it was at the time of the interrogation.
Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further prob­
lems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put them­
selves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year­
old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be. Consider, for
example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a cus­
tody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical,
average 15-year-old. Forty-five years of personal experi­
ence and societal change separate this judge from the days
when he or she was 15 years old. And this judge may or
may not have been an average 15-year-old. The Court’s
answer to these difficulties is to state that “no imaginative
powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or]
training in cognitive science” will be necessary. Ante, at
17. Judges “simply need the common sense,” the Court
assures, “to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old
and neither is an adult.” Ante, at 17. It is obvious, how­
ever, that application of the Court’s new rule demands
much more than this.
Take a fairly typical case in which today’s holding may
make a difference. A 16½-year-old moves to suppress
incriminating statements made prior to the administra­
tion of Miranda warnings. The circumstances are such
that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not
find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant
argues that a reasonable 16½-year-old would view the
situation differently. The judge will not have the luxury of
merely saying: “It is common sense that a 16½-year-old is
not an 18-year-old. Motion granted.” Rather, the judge
will be required to determine whether the differences
between a typical 16½-year-old and a typical 18-year-old
with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interroga­
tion are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody
determination. Today’s opinion contains not a word of
actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about

making that determination.
C
Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task
is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into
account in other legal contexts. In particular, the Court
relies on the fact that the age of a defendant is a relevant
factor under the reasonable-person standard applicable in
negligence suits. Ante, at 11 (citing Restatement (Third)
of Torts §10, Comment b, p. 117 (2005)). But negligence is
generally a question for the jury, the members of which
can draw on their varied experiences with persons of
different ages. It also involves a post hoc determination,
in the reflective atmosphere of a deliberation room, about
whether the defendant conformed to a standard of care.
The Miranda custody determination, by contrast, must be
made in the first instance by police officers in the course of
an investigation that may require quick decisionmaking.
See Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658 (noting “the importance”
under Miranda of providing “a workable rule ‘to guide
police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to
reflect on and balance the social and individual interests
involved in the specific circumstances they confront’ ”);
Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 668, 669 (“[T]he custody inquiry
states an objective rule designed to give clear guidance to
the police”).
Equally inapposite are the Eighth Amendment cases the
Court cites in support of its new rule. Ante, at 9, 11, 12
(citing Eddings, 455 U. S. 104, Roper, 543 U. S. 551, and
Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010)). Those decisions
involve the “judicial exercise of independent judgment”
about the constitutionality of certain punishments. E.g.,
id., at ___ (slip op., at 16). Like the negligence standard,
they do not require on-the-spot judgments by the police.
Nor do state laws affording extra protection for juveniles
during custodial interrogation provide any support for

petitioner’s arguments. See Brief for Petitioner 16–17.
States are free to enact additional restrictions on the
police over and above those demanded by the Constitution
or Miranda. In addition, these state statutes generally
create clear, workable rules to guide police conduct. See
Brief for Petitioner 16–17 (citing statutes that require or
permit parents to be present during custodial interroga­
tion of a minor, that require minors to be advised of a
statutory right to communicate with a parent or guardian,
and that require parental consent to custodial interroga­
tion). Today’s decision, by contrast, injects a new, compli­
cating factor into what had been a clear, easily applied
prophylactic rule. See Alvarado, supra, at 668–669.10
III
The Court’s decision greatly diminishes the clarity and
administrability that have long been recognized as “prin­
cipal advantages” of Miranda’s prophylactic requirements.
See, e.g., Moran, 475 U. S., at 425. But what is worse, the
Court takes this step unnecessarily, as there are other,
less disruptive tools available to ensure that minors are
not coerced into confessing.
As an initial matter, the difficulties that the Court’s
standard introduces will likely yield little added protection
——————
10 The

Court also relies on North Carolina’s concession at oral argu­
ment that a court could take into account a suspect’s blindness as a
factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination. Ante, at 15, and
n. 9. This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor
their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.
Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind
defendant was given “a typed document advising him that he [was] free
to leave.” See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23. In
such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelli­
gible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the
advice at all. And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to
leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the
conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in
making the Miranda custody determination.

for most juvenile defendants. Most juveniles who are
subjected to police interrogation are teenagers nearing the
age of majority.11 These defendants’ reactions to police
pressure are unlikely to be much different from the reac­
tion of a typical 18-year-old in similar circumstances. A
one-size-fits-all Miranda custody rule thus provides a
roughly reasonable fit for these defendants.
In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises
regarding the application of the Miranda custody rule to
minors can be accommodated by considering the unique
circumstances present when minors are questioned in
school. See Brief for Petitioner 10–11 (reciting at length
the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody
determination here, including the fact that petitioner was
removed from class by a police officer, that the interview
took place in a school conference room, and that a uni­
formed officer and a vice principal were present). The
Miranda custody rule has always taken into account the
setting in which questioning occurs, restrictions on a
suspect’s freedom of movement, and the presence of police
officers or other authority figures. See Alvarado, supra, at
665; Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip
op., at 14). It can do so here as well.12
Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the
suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defen­
dant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to

12 The Court thinks it would be “absur[d]” to consider the school set­

the Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable
minor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that
Miranda demands.

ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained
involuntarily. The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and
accommodating by nature, see Schneckloth, 412 U. S., at
224, and the Court’s precedents already make clear that
“special care” must be exercised in applying the voluntari­
ness test where the confession of a “mere child” is at issue.
Haley, 332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion). If Miranda’s
rigid, one-size-fits-all standards fail to account for the
unique needs of juveniles, the response should be to rigor­
ously apply the constitutional rule against coercion to
ensure that the rights of minors are protected. There is no
need to run Miranda off the rails.

The Court rests its decision to inject personal character­
istics into the Miranda custody inquiry on the principle
that judges applying Miranda cannot “blind themselves to
. . . commonsense reality.” Ante, at 1, 8, 10–11, 14. But
the Court’s shift is fundamentally at odds with the clear
prophylactic rules that Miranda has long enforced.
Miranda frequently requires judges to blind themselves to
the reality that many un-Mirandized custodial confessions
are “by no means involuntary” or coerced. Dickerson, 530
U. S., at 444. It also requires police to provide a rote
recitation of Miranda warnings that many suspects al­
ready know and could likely recite from memory.13 Under
today’s new, “reality”-based approach to the doctrine,
perhaps these and other principles of our Miranda juris­
prudence will, like the custody standard, now be ripe for

one of its chief justifications.
