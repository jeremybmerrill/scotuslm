ROBERT M. NELSON ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 19, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
In two cases decided more than 30 years ago, this Court
referred broadly to a constitutional privacy “interest in
avoiding disclosure of personal matters.” Whalen v. Roe,
429 U. S. 589, 599–600 (1977); Nixon v. Administrator of
General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457 (1977). Respondents
in this case, federal contract employees at a Government
laboratory, claim that two parts of a standard employment
background investigation violate their rights under
Whalen and Nixon. Respondents challenge a section of a
form questionnaire that asks employees about treatment
or counseling for recent illegal-drug use. They also object
to certain open-ended questions on a form sent to employ
ees’ designated references.
We assume, without deciding, that the Constitution
protects a privacy right of the sort mentioned in Whalen
and Nixon. We hold, however, that the challenged por
tions of the Government’s background check do not violate
this right in the present case. The Government’s interests
as employer and proprietor in managing its internal op

erations, combined with the protections against public
dissemination provided by the Privacy Act of 1974, 5
U. S. C. §552a, satisfy any “interest in avoiding disclosure”
that may “arguably ha[ve] its roots in the Constitution.”
Whalen, supra, at 599, 605.

A

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) is an independent federal agency charged with
planning and conducting the Government’s “space activi
ties.” Pub. L. 111–314, §3, 124 Stat. 3333, 51 U. S. C.
§20112(a)(1). NASA’s workforce numbers in the tens of
thousands of employees. While many of these workers are
federal civil servants, a substantial majority are employed
directly by Government contractors. Contract employees
play an important role in NASA’s mission, and their du
ties are functionally equivalent to those performed by civil
servants.
One NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
in Pasadena, California, is staffed exclusively by contract
employees. NASA owns JPL, but the California Institute
of Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility under a
Government contract. JPL is the lead NASA center for
deep-space robotics and communications. Most of this
country’s unmanned space missions—from the Explorer 1
satellite in 1958 to the Mars Rovers of today—have been
developed and run by JPL. JPL scientists contribute to
NASA earth-observation and technology-development
projects. Many JPL employees also engage in pure scien
tific research on topics like “the star formation history of
the universe” and “the fundamental properties of quantum
fluids.” App. 64–65, 68.
Twenty-eight JPL employees are respondents here.
Many of them have worked at the lab for decades, and
none has ever been the subject of a Government back

Opinion of the Court

ground investigation. At the time when respondents were
hired, background checks were standard only for federal
civil servants. See Exec. Order No. 10450, 3 CFR 936
(1949–1953 Comp.). In some instances, individual con
tracts required background checks for the employees of
federal contractors, but no blanket policy was in place.
The Government has recently taken steps to eliminate
this two-track approach to background investigations.
In 2004, a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission
prompted the President to order new, uniform identifica
tion standards for “[f]ederal employees,” including “con
tractor employees.”
Homeland Security Presidential
Directive/HSPD–12—Policy for a Common Identification
Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Public
Papers of the President, George W. Bush, Vol. 2, Aug. 27,
p. 1765 (2007) (hereinafter HSPD–12), App. 127. The
Department of Commerce implemented this directive by
mandating that contract employees with long-term access
to federal facilities complete a standard background check,
typically the National Agency Check with Inquiries
(NACI). National Inst. of Standards and Technology,
Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees &
Contractors, pp. iii–vi, 1–8, 6 (FIPS PUB 201–1, Mar.

144–145.1
An October 2007 deadline was set for completion of
these investigations. Memorandum from Joshua B. Bol
ten, Director, OMB, to the Heads of all Departments and
Agencies (Aug. 5, 2005), App. 112. In January 2007,
NASA modified its contract with Cal Tech to reflect the
new background-check requirement. JPL management

also authorized federal agencies to use another “Office of Personnel
Management . . . or National Security community investigation re

NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

informed employees that anyone failing to complete the
NACI process by October 2007 would be denied access to
JPL and would face termination by Cal Tech.
B
The NACI process has long been the standard back
ground investigation for prospective civil servants. The
process begins when the applicant or employee fills out a
form questionnaire.
Employees who work in “non
sensitive” positions (as all respondents here do) complete
Standard Form 85 (SF–85). Office of Personnel Manage
ment (OPM), Standard Form 85, Questionnaire for NonSensitive Positions, App. 88–95.2
Most of the questions on SF–85 seek basic biographical
information: name, address, prior residences, education,
employment history, and personal and professional refer
ences. The form also asks about citizenship, selective
service registration, and military service. The last ques
tion asks whether the employee has “used, possessed,
supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs” in the last year.
Id., at 94. If the answer is yes, the employee must provide
details, including information about “any treatment or
counseling received.” Ibid. A “truthful response,” the
form notes, cannot be used as evidence against the em
ployee in a criminal proceeding. Ibid. The employee must
certify that all responses on the form are true and must
sign a release authorizing the Government to obtain per
sonal information from schools, employers, and others
during its investigation.
——————
2 For public-trust and national-security positions, more detailed forms
are required. See OPM, Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public
Trust Positions, online at http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf;

Opinion of the Court

Once a completed SF–85 is on file, the “agency check”
and “inquiries” begin. 75 Fed. Reg. 5359 (2010). The
Government runs the information provided by the em
ployee through FBI and other federal-agency databases.
It also sends out form questionnaires to the former em
ployers, schools, landlords, and references listed on SF–85.
The particular form at issue in this case—the Investiga
tive Request for Personal Information, Form 42—goes to
the employee’s former landlords and references. Ibid.3
Form 42 is a two-page document that takes about five
minutes to complete. See ibid. It explains to the reference
that “[y]our name has been provided by” a particular
employee or applicant to help the Government determine
that person’s “suitability for employment or a security
clearance.” App. 96–97. After several preliminary ques
tions about the extent of the reference’s associations with
the employee, the form asks if the reference has “any
reason to question” the employee’s “honesty or trustwor
thiness.” Id., at 97. It also asks if the reference knows of
any “adverse information” concerning the employee’s
“violations of the law,” “financial integrity,” “abuse of
alcohol and/or drugs,” “mental or emotional stability,”
“general behavior or conduct,” or “other matters.” Ibid. If
“yes” is checked for any of these categories, the form calls
for an explanation in the space below. That space is also
available for providing “additional information” (“deroga
tory” or “favorable”) that may bear on “suitability for
government employment or a security clearance.” Ibid.
All responses to SF–85 and Form 42 are subject to the
protections of the Privacy Act. The Act authorizes the
Government to keep records pertaining to an individual
——————

Government sends separate forms to employers (Form 41), edu
cational institutions (Form 43), record repositories (Form 40), and law
enforcement agencies (Form 44). 75 Fed. Reg. 5359. None of these
forms are at issue here.

only when they are “relevant and necessary” to an end

to

§§552a(d)(1),(2). Subject to certain exceptions, the Gov
ernment may not disclose records pertaining to an indi
vidual without that individual’s written consent. §552a(b).
C
About two months before the October 2007 deadline for
completing the NACI, respondents brought this suit,
claiming, as relevant here, that the background-check
process violates a constitutional right to informational
privacy. App. 82 (Complaint for Injunctive and Declara
tory Relief).4 The District Court denied respondents’
motion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit
granted an injunction pending appeal, 506 F. 3d 713
(2007), and later reversed the District Court’s order. The
court held that portions of both SF–85 and Form 42 are
likely unconstitutional and should be preliminarily en
joined. 512 F. 3d 1134, vacated and superseded, 530 F. 3d
865 (2008).
Turning first to SF–85, the Court of Appeals noted
respondents’ concession “that most of the questions” on the
form are “unproblematic” and do not “implicate the consti
tutional right to informational privacy.” 530 F. 3d, at 878.
But the court determined that the “group of questions
concerning illegal drugs” required closer scrutiny. Ibid.
Applying Circuit precedent, the court upheld SF–85’s
inquiries into recent involvement with drugs as “necessary
to further the government’s legitimate interest” in combat
ing illegal-drug use. Id., at 879. The court went on to
hold, however, that the portion of the form requiring

sensitive positions.” App. 79. No class has been certified.

Opinion of the Court

disclosure of drug “treatment or counseling” furthered no
legitimate interest and was thus likely to be held uncon
stitutional. Ibid.
Form 42, in the Court of Appeals’ estimation, was even
“more problematic.” Ibid. The form’s “open-ended and
highly private” questions, the court concluded, were not
“narrowly tailored” to meet the Government’s interests in
verifying contractors’ identities and “ensuring the security
of the JPL.” Id., at 881, 880. As a result, the court held,
these “open-ended” questions, like the drug-treatment
question on SF–85, likely violate respondents’ informa
tional-privacy rights.5
Over the dissents of five judges, the Ninth Circuit
denied rehearing en banc. 568 F. 3d 1028 (2009). We
granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).
——————
5 In the Ninth Circuit, respondents also challenged the criteria that
they believe the Government will use to determine their “suitability”
for employment at JPL. Respondents relied on a document, which had
been temporarily posted on the JPL intranet, that listed factors pur
portedly bearing on suitability for federal employment. App. 98–104.
Among the listed factors were a failure to “mee[t] financial obligations,”
“health issues,” and “mental, emotional, psychological, or psychiatric
issues.” Id., at 98, 102. Other factors, which were listed under the
heading “Criminal or Immoral Conduct,” included “indecent exposure,”
“voyeurism,” “indecent proposal[s],” and “carnal knowledge.” Id., at 98.
The document also stated that while “homosexuality,” “adultery,” and
“illegitimate children” were not “suitability” issues in and of them
selves, they might pose “security issue[s]” if circumstances indicated a
“susceptibility to coercion or blackmail.” Id., at 102. The Court of
Appeals rejected respondents’ “challenges to . . . suitability determina
tion[s]” as unripe. 530 F. 3d, at 873. Although respondents did not file
a cross-petition from that portion of the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, they
nonetheless discuss these suitability criteria at some length in their
brief before this Court. Respondents’ challenge to these criteria is not
before us. We note, however, the Acting Solicitor General’s statement
at oral argument that “NASA will not and does not use” the document
to which respondents object “to make contractor credentialing deci
sions.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.

Opinion of the Court

As noted, respondents contend that portions of SF–85
and Form 42 violate their “right to informational privacy.”
Brief for Respondents 15. This Court considered a similar
claim in Whalen, 429 U. S. 589, which concerned New
York’s practice of collecting “the names and addresses of
all persons” prescribed dangerous drugs with both “legiti
mate and illegitimate uses.” Id., at 591. In discussing
that claim, the Court said that “[t]he cases sometimes
characterized as protecting ‘privacy’ ” actually involved “at
least two different kinds of interests”: one, an “interest in
avoiding disclosure of personal matters”;6 the other, an
interest in “making certain kinds of important decisions”
free from government interference.7 The patients who
brought suit in Whalen argued that New York’s statute
“threaten[ed] to impair” both their “nondisclosure” inter
ests and their interests in making healthcare decisions
independently. Id., at 600. The Court, however, upheld
the statute as a “reasonable exercise of New York’s broad
police powers.” Id., at 598.
Whalen acknowledged that the disclosure of “private
information” to the State was an “unpleasant invasion of
privacy,” id., at 602, but the Court pointed out that the
New York statute contained “security provisions” that

Opinion of the Court

protected against “public disclosure” of patients’ informa
tion, id., at 600–601. This sort of “statutory or regulatory
duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures” of “accumulated
private data” was sufficient, in the Court’s view, to protect
a privacy interest that “arguably ha[d] its roots in the
Constitution.” Id., at 605–606. The Court thus concluded
that the statute did not violate “any right or liberty pro
tected by the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id., at 606.
Four months later, the Court referred again to a consti
tutional “interest in avoiding disclosure.” Nixon, 433
U. S., at 457 (internal quotation marks omitted). Former
President Nixon brought a challenge to the Presidential
Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, 88 Stat. 1695,
note following 44 U. S. C. §2111, a statute that required
him to turn over his presidential papers and tape re
cordings for archival review and screening. 433 U. S., at
455–465. In a section of the opinion entitled “Privacy,” the
Court addressed a combination of claims that the review
required by this Act violated the former President’s
“Fourth and Fifth Amendmen[t]” rights. Id., at 455, and
n. 18, 458–459. The Court rejected those challenges after
concluding that the Act at issue, like the statute in
Whalen, contained protections against “undue dissemina
tion of private materials.” 433 U. S., at 458. Indeed, the
Court observed that the former President’s claim was
“weaker” than the one “found wanting . . . in Whalen,” as
the Government was required to return immediately all
“purely private papers and recordings” identified by the
archivists. Id., at 458–459. Citing Fourth Amendment
precedent, the Court also stated that the public interest in
preserving presidential papers outweighed any “legitimate
expectation of privacy” that the former President may
have enjoyed. Id., at 458 (citing Katz v. United States, 389
U. S. 347 (1967); Camara v. Municipal Court of City and
County of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523 (1967); and Terry

NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968)).8
The Court announced the decision in Nixon in the wan
ing days of October Term 1976. Since then, the Court has
said little else on the subject of an “individual interest in
avoiding disclosure of personal matters.” Whalen, supra,
at 599; Nixon, supra, at 457. A few opinions have men
tioned the concept in passing and in other contexts. See
Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of
Press, 489 U. S. 749, 762–763 (1989); New York v. Ferber,
458 U. S. 747, 759, n. 10 (1982). But no other decision has
squarely addressed a constitutional right to informational
privacy.9
——————
8 The Court continued its discussion of Fourth Amendment principles
throughout the “Privacy” section of the opinion. See 433 U. S., at 459
(citing United States v. Miller, 425 U. S. 435 (1976), United States v.
Dionisio, 410 U. S. 1 (1973), and Katz, 389 U. S. 347)); 433 U. S., at
460–462 (addressing the former President’s claim that the Act was
“tantamount to a general warrant” under Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S.
476 (1965)); 433 U. S., at 463–465, and n. 26 (concluding that the
challenged law was analogous to the wiretapping provisions of Title III
of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, notwith
standing the lack of a “warrant requirement”).
9 State and lower federal courts have offered a number of different
interpretations of Whalen and Nixon over the years. Many courts hold
that disclosure of at least some kinds of personal information should be
subject to a test that balances the government’s interests against the
individual’s interest in avoiding disclosure. E.g., Barry v. New York,
712 F. 2d 1554, 1559 (CA2 1983); Fraternal Order of Police v. Philadel
phia, 812 F. 2d 105, 110 (CA3 1987); Woodland v. Houston, 940 F. 2d
134, 138 (CA5 1991) (per curiam); In re Crawford, 194 F. 3d 954, 959
(CA9 1999); State v. Russo, 259 Conn. 436, 459–464, 790 A. 2d 1132,
1147–1150 (2002). The Sixth Circuit has held that the right to infor
mational privacy protects only intrusions upon interests “that can be
deemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” J. P.
v. DeSanti, 653 F. 2d 1080, 1090 (1981) (internal quotation marks
omitted). The D. C. Circuit has expressed “grave doubts” about the
existence of a constitutional right to informational privacy. American
Federation of Govt. Employees v. HUD, 118 F. 3d 786, 791 (1997).

Opinion of the Court

III
As was our approach in Whalen, we will assume for
present purposes that the Government’s challenged in
quiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional sig
nificance. 429 U. S., at 599, 605.10 We hold, however,
——————
10 The opinions concurring in the judgment disagree with this ap
proach and would instead provide a definitive answer to the question
whether there is a constitutional right to informational privacy. Post,
at 6–7 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 1 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). One of
these opinions expresses concern that our failure to do so will “har[m]
our image, if not our self-respect,” post, at 7 (SCALIA, J.), and will cause
practical problems, post, at 8–9. There are sound reasons for eschewing
the concurring opinions’ recommended course.
“The premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not
sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially
as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties
before them.” Carducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983)
(opinion for the court by Scalia, J.). In this case, petitioners did not ask
us to hold that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy,
and respondents and their amici thus understandably refrained from
addressing that issue in detail. It is undesirable for us to decide a
matter of this importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit
of briefing by the parties and in which potential amici had little notice
that the matter might be decided. See Pet. for Cert. 15 (“no need in
this case” for broad decision on “the scope of a constitutionally-based
right to privacy for certain information”). Particularly in cases like this
one, where we have only the “scarce and open-ended” guideposts of
substantive due process to show us the way, see Collins v. Harker
Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992), the Court has repeatedly recognized
the benefits of proceeding with caution. E.g., Herrera v. Collins, 506
U. S. 390, 417 (1993) (joined by SCALIA, J.) (assuming “for the sake of
argument . . . that in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of
‘actual innocence’ ” made after conviction would render execution
unconstitutional); Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S.
261, 279 (1990) (joined by SCALIA, J.) (“[W]e assume that the United
States Constitution would grant a competent person a constitutionally
protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition”); Regents of
Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 222–223 (1985) (“assum[ing],
without deciding, that federal courts can review an academic decision of
a public educational institution under a substantive due process stan
dard”); Board of Curators of Univ. of Mo. v. Horowitz, 435 U. S. 78, 91–

Opinion of the Court

that, whatever the scope of this interest, it does not pre
vent the Government from asking reasonable questions of
the sort included on SF–85 and Form 42 in an employ
ment background investigation that is subject to the Pri
vacy Act’s safeguards against public disclosure.
A
1
As an initial matter, judicial review of the Government’s
challenged inquiries must take into account the context in
which they arise. When the Government asks respon
dents and their references to fill out SF–85 and Form 42,
it does not exercise its sovereign power “to regulate or
license.” Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367
U. S. 886, 896 (1961). Rather, the Government conducts
the challenged background checks in its capacity “as pro
prietor” and manager of its “internal operation.” Ibid.
Time and again our cases have recognized that the Gov
ernment has a much freer hand in dealing “with citizen
employees than it does when it brings its sovereign power
to bear on citizens at large.” Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of
Agriculture, 553 U. S. 591, 598 (2008); Waters v. Churchill,
511 U. S. 661, 674 (1994) (plurality opinion). This distinc
tion is grounded on the “common-sense realization” that if

92 (1978) (same); see also New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of
New York, 487 U. S. 1, 20 (1988) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (joining the Court’s opinion on the understand
ing that it “assumes for purposes of its analysis, but does not hold, the
existence of a constitutional right of private association for other than
expressive or religious purposes”).
Justice SCALIA provides no support for his claim that our approach in
this case will “dramatically increase the number of lawsuits claiming
violations of the right to informational privacy,” post, at 9, and will
leave the lower courts at sea. We take the same approach here that the
Court took more than three decades ago in Whalen and Nixon, and
there is no evidence that those decisions have caused the sky to fall.
We therefore decide the case before us and leave broader issues for
another day.

Opinion of the Court

every “employment decision became a constitutional mat
ter,” the Government could not function. See Connick v.
Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 143 (1983); see also Bishop v. Wood,
426 U. S. 341, 350 (1976) (“The Due Process Clause . . . is
not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel
decisions”).
An assessment of the constitutionality of the challenged
portions of SF–85 and Form 42 must account for this
distinction. The questions challenged by respondents are
part of a standard employment background check of the
sort used by millions of private employers. See Brief for
Consumer Data Indus. Assn. et al. as Amici Curiae 2
(hereinafter CDIA Brief) (“[M]ore than 88% of U. S.
companies . . . perform background checks on their em
ployees”). The Government itself has been conducting
employment investigations since the earliest days of the
Republic. L. White, The Federalists: A Study in Adminis
trative History 262–263 (1948); see OPM, Biography of An
Ideal: History of the Federal Civil Service 8 (2002) (noting
that President Washington “set a high standard” for fed
eral office and finalized appointments only after “investi
gating [candidates’] capabilities and reputations”). Since
1871, the President has enjoyed statutory authority to
“ascertain the fitness of applicants” for the civil service “as
to age, health, character, knowledge and ability for the
employment sought,” Act of Mar. 3, 1871, Rev. Stat. §1753,
as amended, 5 U. S. C. §3301(2), and that Act appears to
have been regarded as a codification of established prac
tice.11 Standard background investigations similar to those

“Mr. PETERS: Has he not that power [to conduct the proposed investi

at issue here became mandatory for all candidates for the
federal civil service in 1953. Exec. Order No. 10450, 3
CFR 936. And the particular investigations challenged in
this case arose from a decision to extend that requirement
to federal contract employees requiring long-term access to
federal facilities. See HSPD–12, at 1765, App. 127; FIPS
PUB 201–1, at iii–vi, 1–8, App. 131–150.
As this long history suggests, the Government has an
interest in conducting basic employment background
checks. Reasonable investigations of applicants and em
ployees aid the Government in ensuring the security of its
facilities and in employing a competent, reliable work
force. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599. Courts must keep
those interests in mind when asked to go line-by-line
through the Government’s employment forms and to
scrutinize the choice and wording of the questions they
contain.
Respondents argue that, because they are contract
employees and not civil servants, the Government’s broad
authority in managing its affairs should apply with dimin
ished force. But the Government’s interest as “proprietor”
in managing its operations, Cafeteria & Restaurant Work
ers, supra, at 896, does not turn on such formalities. See
Board of Comm’rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U. S.
668, 678, 679 (1996) (formal distinctions such as whether
a “service provider” has a “contract of employment or a
contract for services” with the government is a “very poor
proxy” for constitutional interests at stake). The fact that
respondents’ direct employment relationship is with Cal
Tech—which operates JPL under a Government con
tract—says very little about the interests at stake in this
case. The record shows that, as a “practical matter,” there
are no “[r]elevant distinctions” between the duties per

formed by NASA’s civil-service workforce and its contrac
tor workforce. App. 221. The two classes of employees
perform “functionally equivalent duties,” and the extent of
employees’ “access to NASA . . . facilities” turns not on
formal status but on the nature of “the jobs they perform.”
Ibid.
At JPL, in particular, the work that contract employees
perform is critical to NASA’s mission. Respondents in this
case include “the lead trouble-shooter for . . . th[e] $568
[million]” Kepler space observatory, 7 Record 396; the
leader of the program that “tests . . . all new technology
that NASA will use in space,” App. 60; and one of the lead
“trajectory designers for . . . the Galileo Project and the
Apollo Moon landings,” id., at 62. This is important work,
and all of it is funded with a multibillion dollar investment
from the American taxpayer. See NASA, Jet Propulsion
Laboratory Annual Report 09, p. 35 (2010), online at
http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2009-report.pdf. The
Government has a strong interest in conducting basic
background checks into the contract employees minding
the store at JPL.12
——————
12 In their brief, respondents also rely on the fact that many of them
have been working at JPL for years and that Cal Tech previously
vetted them through standard “employment reference checks.” Brief
for Respondents 52–53. The record indicates that this may be wrong as
a factual matter. E.g., 7 Record 391 (“I have not been required to
undergo any type of background investigation to maintain my position
with JPL”); id., at 397 (“I have never been required to undergo any type
of background investigation to maintain my position with JPL other
than . . . [one] which required that I provide my name, social security
number, and current address” to facilitate a “check for outstanding
warrants, arrests, or convictions”); id., at 356, 367, 386–387 (similar).
Even if it were correct, the fact that Cal Tech once conducted a back
ground check on respondents does not diminish the Government’s
interests in conducting its own standard background check to satisfy
itself that contract employees should be granted continued access to the
Government’s facility. In any event, counsel abandoned this position at
oral argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.

NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

With these interests in view, we conclude that the chal
lenged portions of both SF–85 and Form 42 consist of
reasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the
Government’s interests in managing its internal opera
tions. See Engquist, 553 U. S., at 598–599; Whalen, 429
U. S., at 597–598. As to SF–85, the only part of the form
challenged here is its request for information about “any
treatment or counseling received” for illegal-drug use
within the previous year. The “treatment or counseling”
question, however, must be considered in context. It is a
followup to SF–85’s inquiry into whether the employee has
“used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs”
during the past year. The Government has good reason to
ask employees about their recent illegal-drug use. Like
any employer, the Government is entitled to have its
projects staffed by reliable, law-abiding persons who will
“ ‘efficiently and effectively’ ” discharge their duties. See
Engquist, supra, at 598–599. Questions about illegal-drug
use are a useful way of figuring out which persons have
these characteristics. See, e.g., Breen & Matusitz, An
Updated Examination of the Effects of Illegal Drug Use in
the Workplace, 19 J. Human Behavior in the Social Envi
ronment, 434 (2009) (illicit drug use negatively correlated
with workplace productivity).
In context, the follow-up question on “treatment or
counseling” for recent illegal-drug use is also a reasonable,
employment-related inquiry. The Government, recogniz
ing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and a medical
issue, seeks to separate out those illegal-drug users who
are taking steps to address and overcome their problems.
The Government thus uses responses to the “treatment or
counseling” question as a mitigating factor in determining
whether to grant contract employees long-term access to

Opinion of the Court

federal facilities.13
This is a reasonable, and indeed a humane, approach,
and respondents do not dispute the legitimacy of the
Government’s decision to use drug treatment as a mitigat
ing factor in its contractor credentialing decisions. Re
spondents’ argument is that, if drug treatment is only
used to mitigate, then the Government should change the
mandatory phrasing of SF–85—“Include [in your answer]
any treatment or counseling received”—so as to make a
response optional. App. 94. As it stands, the mandatory
“treatment or counseling” question is unconstitutional, in
respondents’ view, because it is “more intrusive than
necessary to satisfy the government’s objective.” Brief for
Respondents 26; 530 F. 3d, at 879 (holding that “treat
ment or counseling” question should be enjoined because
the form “appears to compel disclosure”).
We reject the argument that the Government, when it
requests job-related personal information in an employ
ment background check, has a constitutional burden to
demonstrate that its questions are “necessary” or the least
restrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a
standard runs directly contrary to Whalen. The patients
in Whalen, much like respondents here, argued that New
York’s statute was unconstitutional because the State
could not “demonstrate the necessity” of its program. 429
U. S., at 596. The Court quickly rejected that argument,
concluding that New York’s collection of patients’ prescrip
tion information could “not be held unconstitutional sim
ply because” a court viewed it as “unnecessary, in whole or
——————
13 Asking about treatment or counseling could also help the Govern
ment identify chronic drug abusers for whom, “despite counseling and
rehabilitation programs, there is little chance for effective rehabilita
tion.” 38 Fed. Reg. 33315 (1973). At oral argument, however, the
Acting Solicitor General explained that NASA views treatment or
counseling solely as a “mitigat[ing]” factor that ameliorates concerns
about recent illegal drug use. Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.

in part.” Id., at 596–597.
That analysis applies with even greater force where the
Government acts, not as a regulator, but as the manager
of its internal affairs. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599.
SF–85’s “treatment or counseling” question reasonably
seeks to identify a subset of acknowledged drug users who
are attempting to overcome their problems. The Govern
ment’s considered position is that phrasing the question in
more permissive terms would result in a lower response
rate, and the question’s effectiveness in identifying illegal
drug users who are suitable for employment would be
“materially reduced.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 19. That
is a reasonable position, falling within the “ ‘wide lati
tude’ ” granted the Government in its dealings with em
ployees. See Engquist, supra, at 600.
3
The Court of Appeals also held that the broad, “open
ended questions” on Form 42 likely violate respondents’
informational-privacy rights. Form 42 asks applicants’
designated references and landlords for “information”
bearing on “suitability for government employment or a
security clearance.” App. 97. In a series of questions, the
Government asks if the reference has any “adverse infor
mation” about the applicant’s “honesty or trustworthi
ness,” “violations of the law,” “financial integrity,” “abuse
of alcohol and/or drugs,” “mental or emotional stability,”
“general behavior or conduct,” or “other matters.” Ibid.
These open-ended inquiries, like the drug-treatment
question on SF–85, are reasonably aimed at identifying
capable employees who will faithfully conduct the Gov
ernment’s business. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599.
Asking an applicant’s designated references broad, open
ended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool
for separating strong candidates from weak ones. It would
be a truly daunting task to catalog all the reasons why a

Opinion of the Court

person might not be suitable for a particular job, and
references do not have all day to answer a laundry list of
specific questions. See CDIA Brief 6–7 (references “typi
cally have limited time to answer questions from potential
employers,” and “open-ended questions” yield more rele
vant information than narrow inquiries). Form 42, by
contrast, takes just five minutes to complete. 75 Fed. Reg.
5359.
The reasonableness of such open-ended questions is
illustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and private
sectors. Form 42 alone is sent out by the Government over
1.8 million times annually. Ibid. In addition, the use of
open-ended questions in employment background checks
appears to be equally commonplace in the private sector.
See, e.g., S. Bock et al., Mandated Benefits 2008 Compli
ance Guide, Exh. 20.1, A Sample Policy on Reference
Checks on Job Applicants (“Following are the guidelines
for conducting a telephone reference check: . . . Ask open
ended questions, then wait for the respondent to answer”);
M. Zweig, Human Resources Management 87 (1991) (“Also
ask, ‘Is there anything else I need to know about [candi
date’s name]?’ This kind of open-ended question may turn
up all kinds of information you wouldn’t have gotten any
other way”). The use of similar open-ended questions by
the Government is reasonable and furthers its interests in
managing its operations.
B

Not only are SF–85 and Form 42 reasonable in light of
the Government interests at stake, they are also subject to
substantial protections against disclosure to the public.
Both Whalen and Nixon recognized that government
“accumulation” of “personal information” for “public pur
poses” may pose a threat to privacy. Whalen, 429 U. S., at
605; see Nixon 433 U. S., at 457–458, 462. But both deci


20

NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

sions also stated that a “statutory or regulatory duty to
avoid unwarranted disclosures” generally allays these
privacy concerns. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at
458–459. The Court in Whalen, relying on New York’s
“security provisions” prohibiting public disclosure, turned
aside a challenge to the collection of patients’ prescription
information. 429 U. S., at 594, and n. 12, 600–601, 605.
In Nixon, the Court rejected what it regarded as an even
“weaker” claim by the former President because the Presi
dential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act “[n]ot
only . . . mandate[d] regulations” against “undue dissemi
nation,” but also required immediate return of any “purely
private” materials flagged by the Government’s archivists.
433 U. S., at 458–459.
Respondents in this case, like the patients in Whalen
and former President Nixon, attack only the Government’s
collection of information on SF–85 and Form 42. And
here, no less than in Whalen and Nixon, the information
collected is shielded by statute from “unwarranted disclo
sur[e].” See Whalen, supra, at 605. The Privacy Act,
which covers all information collected during the back
ground-check process, allows the Government to maintain
records “about an individual” only to the extent the re
cords are “relevant and necessary to accomplish” a pur
pose authorized by law. 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(1). The Act
requires written consent before the Government may
disclose records pertaining to any individual. §552a(b).
And the Act imposes criminal liability for willful violations
of its nondisclosure obligations. §552a(i)(1). These re
quirements, as we have noted, give “forceful recognition”
to a Government employee’s interest in maintaining the
“confidentiality of sensitive information . . . in his person
nel files.” Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB, 440 U. S. 301, 318,
n. 16 (1979). Like the protections against disclosure in
Whalen and Nixon, they “evidence a proper concern” for
individual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra,

Opinion of the Court

at 458–459.

Notwithstanding these safeguards, respondents argue
that statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act’s disclosure
bar, see §§552a(b)(1)–(12), leave its protections too porous
to supply a meaningful check against “unwarranted dis
closures,” Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents point in
particular to what they describe as a “broad” exception
for “routine use[s],” defined as uses that are “compatible
with the purpose for which the record was collected.”
§§552a(b)(3), (a)(7).
Respondents’ reliance on these exceptions rests on an
incorrect reading of both our precedents and the terms of
the Privacy Act. As to our cases, the Court in Whalen and
Nixon referred approvingly to statutory or regulatory
protections against “unwarranted disclosures” and “undue
dissemination” of personal information collected by the
Government. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458.
Neither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is
needed to satisfy privacy interests that may be “root[ed] in
the Constitution.” Whalen, supra, at 605. In Whalen, the
New York statute prohibiting “[p]ublic disclosure of the
identity of patients” was itself subject to several excep
tions. 429 U. S., at 594–595, and n. 12. In Nixon, the
protections against “undue dissemination” mentioned in
the opinion were not even before the Court, but were to be
included in forthcoming regulations “mandate[d]” by the
challenged Act. 433 U. S., at 458; see id., at 437–439
(explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the
Act’s “facial validity” and was not considering the Admin
istrator’s forthcoming regulations). Thus, the mere fact
that the Privacy Act’s nondisclosure requirement is sub
ject to exceptions does not show that the statute provides
insufficient protection against public disclosure.
Nor does the substance of the “routine use” exception


22

NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

relied on by respondents create any undue risk of public
dissemination. None of the authorized “routine use[s]” of
respondents’ background-check information allows for
release to the public. 71 Fed. Reg. 45859–45860, 45862
(2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084 (1995), as amended, 75 Fed.
Reg. 28307 (2010).
Rather, the established “routine
use[s]” consist of limited, reasonable steps designed to
complete the background-check process in an efficient and
orderly manner. See Whalen, supra, at 602 (approving
disclosures to authorized New York Department of Health
employees that were not “meaningfully distinguishable”
from routine disclosures “associated with many facets of
health care”). One routine use, for example, involves a
limited disclosure to persons filling out Form 42 so that
designated references can “identify the individual” at issue
and can understand the “nature and purpose of the inves
tigation.” App. 89. Authorized JPL employees also review
each completed SF–85 to verify that all requested infor
mation has been provided. Id., at 211. These designated
JPL employees may not “disclose any information con
tained in the form to anyone else,” ibid., and Cal Tech is
not given access to adverse information uncovered during
the Government’s background check, id., at 207–208. The
“remote possibility” of public disclosure created by these
narrow “routine use[s]” does not undermine the Privacy
Act’s substantial protections. See Whalen, 429 U. S., at
601–602 (“remote possibility” that statutory security
provisions will “provide inadequate protection against
unwarranted disclosures” not a sufficient basis for striking
down statute).

Opinion of the Court

note that it is possible that their personal information
could be disclosed as a result of a similar breach. But data
breaches are a possibility any time the Government stores
information. As the Court recognized in Whalen, the mere
possibility that security measures will fail provides no
“proper ground” for a broad-based attack on government
information-collection practices. Ibid. Respondents also
cite a portion of SF–85 that warns of possible disclosure
“[t]o the news media or the general public.” App. 89. By
its terms, this exception allows public disclosure only
where release is “in the public interest” and would not
result in “an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
Ibid. Respondents have not cited any example of such a
disclosure, nor have they identified any plausible scenario
in which their information might be unduly disclosed
under this exception.15
In light of the protection provided by the Privacy Act’s
nondisclosure requirement, and because the challenged
portions of the forms consist of reasonable inquiries in an
employment background check, we conclude that the
Government’s inquiries do not violate a constitutional
right to informational privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605.
*
*

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceed
ings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
——————
15 Respondents

further contend that the Privacy Act’s ability to deter
unauthorized release of private information is significantly hampered
by the fact that the statute provides only “an ex post money-damages
action,” not injunctive relief. Brief for Respondents 44 (citing Doe v.
Chao, 540 U. S. 614, 635 (2004) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting)). Nothing in
Whalen or Nixon suggests that any private right of action—for money
damages or injunctive relief—is needed in order to provide sufficient
protection against public disclosure.
