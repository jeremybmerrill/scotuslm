ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 27, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.
California imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon any
person who distributes a violent video game in California
without labeling it “18,” or who sells or rents a labeled
violent video game to a person under the age of 18. Representatives of the video game and software industries,
claiming that the statute violates the First Amendment on
its face, seek an injunction against its enforcement. Ap­
plying traditional First Amendment analysis, I would
uphold the statute as constitutional on its face and would
consequently reject the industries’ facial challenge.
I

A

California’s statute defines a violent video game as: A
game in which a player “kill[s], maim[s], dismember[s], or
sexually assault[s] an image of a human being,”
and
“[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a
whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or
morbid interest of minors,”
and
“[the game] is patently offensive to prevailing standards
in the community as to what is suitable for minors,”

BREYER, J., dissenting

and
“the game, as a whole, . . . lack[s] serious literary, ar­
tistic, political, or scientific value for minors.” Cal.
Civ. Code Ann. §1746(d)(1) (West 2009).
The statute in effect forbids the sale of such a game to
minors unless they are accompanied by a parent; it re­
quires the makers of the game to affix a label identifying
it as a game suitable only for those aged 18 and over; it
exempts retailers from liability unless such a label is
properly affixed to the game; and it imposes a civil fine of
up to $1,000 upon a violator. See §§1746.1–1746.3.
B
A facial challenge to this statute based on the First
Amendment can succeed only if “a substantial number of
its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to
the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” United States v.
Stevens, 559 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 10) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Moreover, it is more difficult to
mount a facial First Amendment attack on a statute that
seeks to regulate activity that involves action as well as
speech. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 614–
615 (1973). Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within
which I believe the State can legitimately apply its stat­
ute, namely sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age
cutoff used by the industry’s own ratings system), of
highly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable
game maker would know meet the Act’s criteria. That
area lies at the heart of the statute. I shall assume that
the number of instances in which the State will enforce
the statute within that area is comparatively large, and
that the number outside that area (for example, sales to
17-year-olds) is comparatively small. And the activity the
statute regulates combines speech with action (a virtual
form of target practice).

C
In determining whether the statute is unconstitutional,
I would apply both this Court’s “vagueness” precedents and
a strict form of First Amendment scrutiny. In doing so,
the special First Amendment category I find relevant is
not (as the Court claims) the category of “depictions of
violence,” ante, at 8, but rather the category of “protection
of children.” This Court has held that the “power of the
state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the
scope of its authority over adults.” Prince v. Massachu
setts, 321 U. S. 158, 170 (1944). And the “ ‘regulatio[n] of
communication addressed to [children] need not conform
to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the
same way as those applicable to adults.’ ” Ginsberg v. New
York, 390 U. S. 629, 638, n. 6 (1968) (quoting Emerson,
Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, 72
Yale L. J. 877, 939 (1963)).
The majority’s claim that the California statute, if up­
held, would create a “new categor[y] of unprotected
speech,” ante, at 3, 6, is overstated. No one here argues
that depictions of violence, even extreme violence, auto
matically fall outside the First Amendment’s protective
scope as, for example, do obscenity and depictions of child
pornography. We properly speak of categories of expres­
sion that lack protection when, like “child pornography,”
the category is broad, when it applies automatically, and
when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults,
from obtaining access to the material within it. But
where, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower
judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of
“fire” in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terror­
ist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations),
we do not normally describe the result as creating a “new
category of unprotected speech.” See Schenck v. United
States, 249 U. S. 47, 52 (1919); Holder v. Humanitarian
Law Project, 561 U. S. __ (2010).

BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
BREYER, J., dissenting

Thus, in Stevens, after rejecting the claim that all de­
pictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside the
First Amendment’s protective scope, we went on to decide
whether the particular statute at issue violates the First
Amendment under traditional standards; and we held
that, because the statute was overly broad, it was invalid.
Similarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional
First Amendment standards, this statute does, or does
not, pass muster.
II
In my view, California’s statute provides “fair notice of
what is prohibited,” and consequently it is not impermis­
sibly vague. United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304
(2008). Ginsberg explains why that is so. The Court there
considered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors
of a
“picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion pic­
ture film, or similar visual representation or image of
a person or portion of the human body which depicts
nudity . . . ,”
that
“predominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or
morbid interest of minors,”
and
“is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the
adult community as a whole with respect to what is
suitable material for minors,”
and
“is utterly without redeeming social importance for
minors.” 390 U. S., at 646–647.
This Court upheld the New York statute in Ginsberg
(which is sometimes unfortunately confused with a very

BREYER, J., dissenting

different, earlier case, Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U. S.
463 (1966)). The five-Justice majority, in an opinion writ­
ten by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was sufficiently clear. 390 U. S., at 643–645. No Member of the
Court voiced any vagueness objection. See id., at 648–650
(Stewart, J., concurring in result); id., at 650–671 (Doug­
las, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); id., at 671–675
(Fortas, J., dissenting).
Comparing the language of California’s statute (set
forth supra, at 1–2) with the language of New York’s
statute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find
any vagueness-related difference. Why are the words
“kill,” “maim,” and “dismember” any more difficult to
understand than the word “nudity?” JUSTICE ALITO ob­
jects that these words do “not perform the narrowing
function” that this Court has required in adult obscenity
cases, where statutes can only cover “ ‘hard core’ ” depic­
tions. Ante, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment). But
the relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but
to Ginsberg, which dealt with “nudity,” a category no more
“narrow” than killing and maiming. And in any event,
narrowness and vagueness do not necessarily have any­
thing to do with one another. All that is required for
vagueness purposes is that the terms “kill,” “maim,” and
“dismember” give fair notice as to what they cover, which
they do.
The remainder of California’s definition copies, almost
word for word, the language this Court used in Miller v.
California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), in permitting a total ban
on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with
criminal penalties). The California law’s reliance on
“community standards” adheres to Miller, and in Fort
Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, 57–58 (1989),
this Court specifically upheld the use of Miller’s language
against charges of vagueness. California only departed
from the Miller formulation in two significant respects: It


6

BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
BREYER, J., dissenting

substituted the word “deviant” for the words “prurient”
and “shameful,” and it three times added the words “for
minors.” The word “deviant” differs from “prurient” and
“shameful,” but it would seem no less suited to defining
and narrowing the reach of the statute. And the addition
of “for minors” to a version of the Miller standard was
approved in Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 643, even though the
New York law “dr[ew] no distinction between young chil­
dren and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,”
ante, at 8 (opinion of ALITO, J.).
Both the Miller standard and the law upheld in Gins
berg lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the dif­
ficulty of the Court’s long search for words capable of
protecting expression without depriving the State of a
legitimate constitutional power to regulate. As is well
known, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do
no better in defining obscenity than, “I know it when I see
it.” Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 197 (1964) (concur­
ring opinion). And Justice Douglas dissented from Miller’s
standard, which he thought was still too vague. 413 U. S.,
at 39–40. Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the
“community standards” tests used in Miller and Ginsberg.
They reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise
standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify
instances that fall within a legitimate regulation. And
they seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free ex­
pression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the
words necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional
objective. Cf. Williams, supra, at 304 (the Constitution
does not always require “ ‘perfect clarity and precise guid­
ance,’ ” even when “ ‘expressive activity’ ” is involved).
What, then, is the difference between Ginsberg and
Miller on the one hand and the California law on the
other? It will often be easy to pick out cases at which
California’s statute directly aims, involving, say, a charac­
ter who shoots out a police officer’s knee, douses him with

BREYER, J., dissenting

gasoline, lights him on fire, urinates on his burning body,
and finally kills him with a gunshot to the head. (Footage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the
record.) See also ante, at 14–15 (ALITO, J., concurring in
judgment). As in Miller and Ginsberg, the California law
clearly protects even the most violent games that possess
serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
§1746(d)(1)(A)(iii). And it is easier here than in Miller
or Ginsberg to separate the sheep from the goats at the
statute’s border. That is because here the industry itself has promulgated standards and created a review
process, in which adults who “typically have experience
with children” assess what games are inappropriate for
minors. See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating
Process, online at http://www.esrb.org/ratings/&ratings_
process.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24,
2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).
There is, of course, one obvious difference: The Ginsberg
statute concerned depictions of “nudity,” while California’s
statute concerns extremely violent video games. But for
purposes of vagueness, why should that matter? JUSTICE
ALITO argues that the Miller standard sufficed because
there are “certain generally accepted norms concerning
expression related to sex,” whereas there are no similarly
“accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent
entertainment.” Ante, at 7–8. But there is no evidence
that is so. The Court relied on “community standards” in
Miller precisely because of the difficulty of articulating
“accepted norms” about depictions of sex. I can find no
difference—historical or otherwise—that is relevant to the
vagueness question. Indeed, the majority’s examples of
literary descriptions of violence, on which JUSTICE ALITO
relies, do not show anything relevant at all.
After all, one can find in literature as many (if not more)
descriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence.
Indeed, sex “has been a theme in art and literature

throughout the ages.” Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,
535 U. S. 234, 246 (2002). For every Homer, there is a
Titian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the
teenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm’s
Fairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story
of Lady Godiva.
Thus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related dif­
ferences between California’s law and the New York law
upheld in Ginsberg. And if there remain any vagueness
problems, the state courts can cure them through inter­
pretation. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,
216 (1975) (“[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially
invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing
construction by the state courts”). Cf. Ginsberg, supra, at
644 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals
would read a knowledge requirement into the statute);
Berry v. Santa Barbara, 40 Cal. App. 4th 1075, 1088–
1089, 47 Cal. Rptr. 2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowl­
edge requirement into a statute). Consequently, for pur­
poses of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute
unconstitutionally vague.
III
Video games combine physical action with expression.
Were physical activity to predominate in a game, govern­
ment could appropriately intervene, say by requiring
parents to accompany children when playing a game in­
volving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of
toys presenting physical dangers to children. See gener­
ally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008,
122 Stat. 3016 (“Title I—Children’s Product Safety”). But
because video games also embody important expressive
and artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First
Amendment significantly limits the State’s power to regu­
late. And I would determine whether the State has ex­
ceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.

BREYER, J., dissenting

Like the majority, I believe that the California law must
be “narrowly tailored” to further a “compelling interest,”
without there being a “less restrictive” alternative that
would be “at least as effective.” Reno v. American Civil
Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 874, 875, 879 (1997). I
would not apply this strict standard “mechanically.”
United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529
U. S. 803, 841 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist,
C. J., and O’Connor and SCALIA, JJ., dissenting). Rather,
in applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the
statute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the
potentially-justifying “compelling interests,” the degree to
which the statute furthers that interest, the nature and
effectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this
evaluation, whether, overall, “the statute works speech­
related harm . . . out of proportion to the benefits that the
statute seeks to provide.” Ibid. See also Burson v. Free
man, 504 U. S. 191, 210 (1992) (plurality opinion) (apply­
ing strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a
“significant impingement” on speech).
First Amendment standards applied in this way are
difficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying “strict
scrutiny” the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that,
for example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolu­
tion to a group on the State Department’s list of terrorist
organizations, Holder, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22–34);
but cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 1 ) (BREYER, J., dissenting),
and limit speech near polling places, Burson, supra, at
210–211 (plurality opinion). And applying less clearly
defined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed
States to require disclosure of petition signers, Doe v.
Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and to impose campaign con­
tribution limits that were “ ‘closely drawn’ to match a
‘sufficiently important interest,’ ” Nixon v. Shrink Missouri
Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 387–388 (2000).
Moreover, although the Court did not specify the “level


10

BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
BREYER, J., dissenting

of scrutiny” it applied in Ginsberg, we have subsequently
described that case as finding a “compelling interest” in
protecting children from harm sufficient to justify limita­
tions on speech. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.
FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989). Since the Court in Gins
berg specified that the statute’s prohibition applied to
material that was not obscene, 390 U. S., at 634, I cannot
dismiss Ginsberg on the ground that it concerned obscen­
ity. But cf. ante, at 6 (majority opinion). Nor need I de­
pend upon the fact that the Court in Ginsberg insisted
only that the legislature have a “rational” basis for finding
the depictions there at issue harmful to children. 390
U. S., at 639. For in this case, California has substan­
tiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger
evidence.
A
California’s law imposes no more than a modest restric­
tion on expression. The statute prevents no one from
playing a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a
video game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from
obtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help.
§1746.1(c). All it prevents is a child or adolescent from
buying, without a parent’s assistance, a gruesomely vio­
lent video game of a kind that the industry itself tells us it
wants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of
17. See Brief for Respondents 8.
Nor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a precedent that would adversely affect other media, say films, or
videos, or books. A typical video game involves a signifi­
cant amount of physical activity. See ante, at 13–14
(ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (citing examples of the
increasing interactivity of video game controllers). And
pushing buttons that achieve an interactive, virtual form
of target practice (using images of human beings as tar­
gets), while containing an expressive component, is not

11

BREYER, J., dissenting

just like watching a typical movie. See infra, at 14.
B
The interest that California advances in support of the
statute is compelling. As this Court has previously de­
scribed that interest, it consists of both (1) the “basic”
parental claim “to authority in their own household to
direct the rearing of their children,” which makes it proper
to enact “laws designed to aid discharge of [parental]
responsibility,” and (2) the State’s “independent interest in
the well-being of its youth.” Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 639–
640. Cf. id., at 639, n. 7 (“ ‘[O]ne can well distinguish laws
which do not impose a morality on children, but which
support the right of parents to deal with the morals of
their children as they see fit’ ” (quoting Henkin, Morals
and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum.
L. Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))). And where these interests
work in tandem, it is not fatally “underinclusive” for a
State to advance its interests in protecting children
against the special harms present in an interactive video
game medium through a default rule that still allows
parents to provide their children with what their parents
wish.
Both interests are present here. As to the need to help
parents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968
that “ ‘parental control or guidance cannot always be
provided.’ ” 390 U. S., at 640. Today, 5.3 million grade­
school-age children of working parents are routinely
home alone. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau,
Who’s Minding the Kids? Child Care Arrangements:
Spring 2005/Summer 2006, p. 12 (2010), online at http://
www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p70-121.pdf. Thus, it has,
if anything, become more important to supplement par­
ents’ authority to guide their children’s development.
As to the State’s independent interest, we have pointed
out that juveniles are more likely to show a “ ‘lack of ma­


12

BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
BREYER, J., dissenting

turity’ ” and are “more vulnerable or susceptible to nega­
tive influences and outside pressures,” and that their
“character . . . is not as well formed as that of an adult.”
Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569–570 (2005). And we
have therefore recognized “a compelling interest in pro­
tecting the physical and psychological well-being of mi­
nors.” Sable Communications, supra, at 126.
At the same time, there is considerable evidence that
California’s statute significantly furthers this compelling
interest. That is, in part, because video games are excel­
lent teaching tools. Learning a practical task often means
developing habits, becoming accustomed to performing the
task, and receiving positive reinforcement when perform­
ing that task well. Video games can help develop habits,
accustom the player to performance of the task, and
reward the player for performing that task well. Why
else would the Armed Forces incorporate video games
into its training? See CNN, War Games: Military Train­
ing Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), online at
http://articles.cnn.com/2001–11–2 / tech / war.games_1_ictbill-swartout-real-world-training?_s=PM:TECH.
When the military uses video games to help soldiers
train for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial
purpose. But California argues that when the teaching
features of video games are put to less desirable ends,
harm can ensue. In particular, extremely violent games
can harm children by rewarding them for being violently
aggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be
violently aggressive in life. And video games can cause
more harm in this respect than can typically passive
media, such as books or films or television programs.
There are many scientific studies that support Califor­
nia’s views. Social scientists, for example, have found
causal evidence that playing these games results in harm.
Longitudinal studies, which measure changes over time,
have found that increased exposure to violent video games
2

causes an increase in aggression over the same period.

Experimental studies in laboratories have found that
subjects randomly assigned to play a violent video game
subsequently displayed more characteristics of aggression
than those who played nonviolent games. See, e.g., Ander­
son et al., Violent Video Games: Specific Effects of Violent
Content on Aggressive Thoughts and Behavior, 36 Ad­
vances in Experimental Soc. Psychology 199 (2004).
Surveys of 8th and 9th grade students have found a
correlation between playing violent video games and
aggression. See, e.g., Gentile, Lynch, Linder, & Walsh,
The Effects of Violent Video Game Habits On Adolescent
Hostility, Aggressive Behaviors, and School Performance,
27 J. Adolescence 5 (2004).

And “meta-analyses,” i.e., studies of all the studies, have
concluded that exposure to violent video games “was posi­

outcomes.” Anderson et al., Violent Video Game Effects on

Some of these studies take care to explain in a commonsense way why video games are potentially more harmful
than, say, films or books or television. In essence, they
say that the closer a child’s behavior comes, not to watch­
ing, but to acting out horrific violence, the greater the
potential psychological harm. See Bushman & Hues­
mann, Aggression, in 2 Handbook of Social Pscyhology
833, 851 (S. Fiske, D. Gilbert, & G. Lindzey eds., 5th ed.
2010) (video games stimulate more aggression because
“[p]eople learn better when they are actively involved,”
players are “more likely to identify with violent charac­
ters,” and “violent games directly reward violent behav­
ior”); Polman, de Castro, & van Aken, Experimental Study
of the Differential Effects of Playing Versus Watching
Violent Video Games on Children’s Aggressive Behavior,

gression resulting from playing, as opposed to watching, a
violent game); C. Anderson, D. Gentile, & K. Buckley,
Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents
136–137 (2007) (three studies finding greater effects from
games as opposed to television). See also infra, at 15–16
(statements of expert public health associations agreeing
that interactive games can be more harmful than “passive”
media like television); ante, at 12–17 (ALITO, J., concur­
ring in judgment).
Experts debate the conclusions of all these studies. Like
many, perhaps most, studies of human behavior, each
study has its critics, and some of those critics have pro­
duced studies of their own in which they reach different

conclusions. (I list both sets of research in the appen­
dixes.) I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise
to say definitively who is right. But associations of public
health professionals who do possess that expertise have
reviewed many of these studies and found a significant
risk that violent video games, when compared with more
passive media, are particularly likely to cause children
harm.
Eleven years ago, for example, the American Academy
of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child & Adoles­
cent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association,
the American Medical Association, the American Academy
of Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Asso­
ciation released a joint statement, which said:
“[O]ver 1000 studies . . . point overwhelmingly to a
causal connection between media violence and aggres­
sive behavior in some children . . . [and, though less
research had been done at that time, preliminary
studies indicated that] the impact of violent interac­
tive entertainment (video games and other interactive
media) on young people . . . may be significantly more
severe than that wrought by television, movies, or mu­
sic.” Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment
Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online
at http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.
Five years later, after more research had been done, the
American Psychological Association adopted a resolution
that said:
“[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive
video game research suggests such exposure . . .
increases aggressive behavior, . . . increases aggres­
sive thoughts, . . . increases angry feelings, . . . de­
creases helpful behavior, and . . . increases physiological arousal.” Resolution on Violence in Video

The Association added:
“[T]he practice, repetition, and rewards for acts of vio­
lence may be more conducive to increasing aggressive
behavior among children and youth than passively
watching violence on TV and in films.” Ibid. (empha­
sis added).
Four years after that, in 2009, the American Academy of
Pediatrics issued a statement in significant part about
interactive media. It said:
“Studies of these rapidly growing and ever-more­
sophisticated types of media have indicated that the
effects of child-initiated virtual violence may be even
more profound than those of passive media such as
television. In many games the child or teenager is
‘embedded’ in the game and uses a ‘joystick’ (handheld
controller) that enhances both the experience and the
aggressive feelings.” Policy Statement—Media Vio­
lence, 124 Pediatrics 1495, 1498 (2009) (emphasis
added).
It added:
“Correlational and experimental studies have re­
vealed that violent video games lead to increases in
aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and de­
creases in prosocial behavior. Recent longitudinal
studies . . . have revealed that in as little as 3 months,
high exposure to violent video games increased physi­
cal aggression. Other recent longitudinal studies . . .
have revealed similar effects across 2 years.” Ibid.
(footnotes omitted).
Unlike the majority, I would find sufficient grounds in
these studies and expert opinions for this Court to defer to

17

BREYER, J., dissenting

an elected legislature’s conclusion that the video games in
question are particularly likely to harm children. This
Court has always thought it owed an elected legislature
some degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of
this kind, particularly when they involve technical mat­
ters that are beyond our competence, and even in First
Amendment cases. See Holder, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 28–29) (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the
Government’s national security judgments); Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180, 195–196
(1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to
the Government’s technological judgments). The majority,
in reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity
of the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference
at all. Compare ante, at 12–13 (stating that the studies do
not provide evidence that violent video games “cause”
harm (emphasis deleted)), with supra, at 12–13 (citing
longitudinal studies finding causation).
C
I can find no “less restrictive” alternative to California’s
law that would be “at least as effective.” See Reno, 521
U. S., at 874. The majority points to a voluntary alterna­
tive: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from
buying extremely violent games by labeling those games
with an “M” (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict
their sales to those 17 and older. See ante, at 15–16. But
this voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps.
When California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Com­
mission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unac­
companied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated
video games. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to
Children 27 (2004), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2004/
07/040708kidsviolencerpt.pdf. Subsequently the voluntary program has become more effective. But as of
the FTC’s most recent update to Congress, 20% of those


18

BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
BREYER, J., dissenting

under 17 are still able to buy M-rated video games, and,
breaking down sales by store, one finds that this number rises to nearly 50% in the case of one large national
chain. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 28 (2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/
P994511violententertainment.pdf. And the industry could
easily revert back to the substantial noncompliance that
existed in 2004, particularly after today’s broad ruling
reduces the industry’s incentive to police itself.
The industry also argues for an alternative technological
solution, namely “filtering at the console level.” Brief
for Respondents 53. But it takes only a quick search of
the Internet to find guides explaining how to circum­
vent any such technological controls. YouTube viewers,
for example, have watched one of those guides (called
“How to bypass parental controls on the Xbox 360”) more
than 47,000 times. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=
CFlVfVmvN6k.
IV
The upshot is that California’s statute, as applied to its
heartland of applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely
violent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on
speech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified
by a compelling interest (supplementing parents’ efforts to
prevent their children from purchasing potentially harm­
ful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally
effective, less restrictive alternative. California’s statute
is consequently constitutional on its face—though litigants
remain free to challenge the statute as applied in particu­
lar instances, including any effort by the State to apply it
to minors aged 17.
I add that the majority’s different conclusion creates a
serious anomaly in First Amendment law. Ginsberg
makes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of
depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a

19

BREYER, J., dissenting

State cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most vio­
lent interactive video games. But what sense does it make
to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an
image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13­
year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively,
but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures
and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would
permit the government to protect children by restricting sales of that extremely violent video game only when
the woman—bound, gagged, tortured, and killed—is also
topless?
This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment.
It disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence,
where interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar
justification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to
children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is
more than adequate to support such a view. That is why I
believe that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori.
And it is why I believe California’s law is constitutional on
its face.
This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is
about education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in
securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can
raise future generations committed cooperatively to mak­
ing our system of government work. Education, however,
is about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by
making choices for themselves. Other times, choices are
made for children—by their parents, by their teachers,
and by the people acting democratically through their
governments. In my view, the First Amendment does not
disable government from helping parents make such a
choice here—a choice not to have their children buy ex­
tremely violent, interactive video games, which they more
than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those
children.
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

APPENDIXES
With the assistance of the Supreme Court Library, I
have compiled these two appendixes listing peer-reviewed
academic journal articles on the topic of psychological
harm resulting from playing violent video games. The
library conducted a search for relevant articles on the
following databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Academic
Search Premier, ArticleFirst (OCLC), and Dialog (files 1,
7, 34, 98, 121, 142, 144, 149). The following search terms
were used: “(video* or computer or arcade or online) and
(game*) and (attack* or fight* or aggress* or violen* or
hostil* or ang* or arous* or prosocial or help* or desens*
or empathy).” After eliminating irrelevant matches based
on title or abstract, I categorized these articles as either
supporting the hypothesis that violent video games are
harmful (listed in Appendix A), or not supporting/rejecting
the hypothesis that violent video games are harmful
(listed in Appendix B).
Many, but not all, of these articles were available to the
California Legislature or the parties in briefing this case.
I list them because they suggest that there is substantial
(though controverted) evidence supporting the expert
associations of public health professionals that have con­
cluded that violent video games can cause children psycho­
logical harm. See supra, at 15–16. And consequently,
these studies help to substantiate the validity of the origi­
nal judgment of the California Legislature, as well as that
judgment’s continuing validity.
