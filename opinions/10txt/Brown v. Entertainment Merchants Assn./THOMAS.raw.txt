ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 27, 2011]


JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.
The Court’s decision today does not comport with the
original public understanding of the First Amendment.
The majority strikes down, as facially unconstitutional, a
state law that prohibits the direct sale or rental of certain
video games to minors because the law “abridg[es] the
freedom of speech.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. But I do not
think the First Amendment stretches that far. The prac
tices and beliefs of the founding generation establish that
“the freedom of speech,” as originally understood, does not
include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to
access speech) without going through the minors’ parents
or guardians. I would hold that the law at issue is not
facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and
reverse and remand for further proceedings.1

——————
1 JUSTICE ALITO concludes that the law is too vague to satisfy due
process, but neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals ad
dressed that question. Ante, at 2–9 (opinion concurring in judgment).
As we have often said, this Court is “one of final review, ‘not of first
view.’ ” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)

(2005)).

BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
THOMAS, J., dissenting

I
When interpreting a constitutional provision, “the goal
is to discern the most likely public understanding of [that]
provision at the time it was adopted.” McDonald v. Chi
cago, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (THOMAS, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because
the Constitution is a written instrument, “its meaning
does not alter.” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514
U. S. 334, 359 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)
(internal quotation marks omitted). “That which it meant
when adopted, it means now.” Ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted).
As originally understood, the First Amendment’s protec
tion against laws “abridging the freedom of speech” did
not extend to all speech. “There are certain well-defined
and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and
punishment of which have never been thought to raise any
Constitutional problem.” Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U. S. 568, 571–572 (1942); see also United States v.
Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5–6). Laws
regulating such speech do not “abridg[e] the freedom of
speech” because such speech is understood to fall outside
“the freedom of speech.” See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coa
lition, 535 U. S. 234, 245–246 (2002).
In my view, the “practices and beliefs held by the Foun
ders” reveal another category of excluded speech: speech to
minor children bypassing their parents. McIntyre, supra,
at 360. The historical evidence shows that the founding
generation believed parents had absolute authority over
their minor children and expected parents to use that
authority to direct the proper development of their chil
dren. It would be absurd to suggest that such a society
understood “the freedom of speech” to include a right to
speak to minors (or a corresponding right of minors to
access speech) without going through the minors’ parents.

15. The founding generation would not have considered
it an abridgment of “the freedom of speech” to support
parental authority by restricting speech that bypasses
minors’ parents.
A
Attitudes toward children were in a state of transition
around the time that the States ratified the Bill of Rights.
A complete understanding of the founding generation’s
views on children and the parent-child relationship must
therefore begin roughly a century earlier, in colonial New
England.
In the Puritan tradition common in the New England
Colonies, fathers ruled families with absolute authority.
“The patriarchal family was the basic building block of
Puritan society.” S. Mintz, Huck’s Raft 13 (2004) (herein
after Mintz); see also R. MacDonald, Literature for Chil
dren in England and America from 1646 to 1774, p. 7
(1982) (hereinafter MacDonald). The Puritans rejected
many customs, such as godparenthood, that they consid
ered inconsistent with the patriarchal structure. Mintz
13.
Part of the father’s absolute power was the right and
duty “to fill his children’s minds with knowledge and . . .
make them apply their knowledge in right action.” E.
Morgan, The Puritan Family 97 (rev. ed. 1966) (herein
after Morgan). Puritans thought children were “innately
sinful and that parents’ primary task was to suppress
their children’s natural depravity.” S. Mintz & S. Kellogg,
Domestic Revolutions 2 (1988) (hereinafter Mintz & Kel
logg); see also B. Wadsworth, The Well-Ordered Family 55
(1712) (“Children should not be left to themselves . . . to do
as they please; . . . not being fit to govern themselves”); C.
Mather, A Family Well-Ordered 38 (1699). Accordingly,
parents were not to let their children read “vain Books,
profane Ballads, and filthy Songs” or “fond and amorous

THOMAS, J., dissenting

Romances, . . . fabulous Histories of Giants, the bombast Achievements of Knight Errantry, and the like.” The
History of Genesis, pp. vi–vii (3d ed. corrected 1708).
This conception of parental authority was reflected in
laws at that time. In the Massachusetts Colony, for
example, it was unlawful for tavern keepers (or anyone
else) to entertain children without their parents’ consent.
2 Records and Files of the Quarterly Courts of Essex
County, Massachusetts, p. 180 (1912); 4 id., at 237, 275
(1914); 5 id., at 143 (1916); see also Morgan 146. And a
“stubborn or rebellious son” of 16 years or more committed
a capital offense if he disobeyed “the voice of his Father, or
the voice of his Mother.” The Laws and Liberties of Mas
sachusetts 6 (1648) (reprint M. Farrand ed. 1929); see also
J. Kamensky, Governing the Tongue 102, n. 14 (1997)
(citing similar laws in the Connecticut, New Haven, Ply
mouth, and New Hampshire Colonies in the late 1600’s).
B
In the decades leading up to and following the Revolu
tion, attitudes towards children changed. See, e.g., J.
Reinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood,
1775–1850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier). Children
came to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank
slates requiring careful and deliberate development. But
the same overarching principles remained. Parents con
tinued to have both the right and duty to ensure the
proper development of their children. They exercised
significant authority over their children, including control
over the books that children read. And laws at the time
continued to reflect strong support for parental authority and the sense that children were not fit to govern
themselves.

The works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau

THOMAS, J., dissenting

were a driving force behind the changed understanding of
children and childhood. See Reinier 2–5; H. Brewer, By
Birth or Consent 97 (2005) (hereinafter Brewer); K. Cal
vert, Children in the House 59–60 (1992) (hereinafter
Calvert). Locke taught that children’s minds were blank
slates and that parents therefore had to be careful and
deliberate about what their children were told and ob
served. Parents had only themselves to blame if, “by hu
mouring and cockering” their children, they “poison’d
the fountain” and later “taste[d] the bitter waters.” Some
Thoughts Concerning Education (1692), in 37 English
Philosophers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries
27–28 (C. Eliot ed. 1910). All vices, he explained, were
sowed by parents and “those about children.” Id., at 29.
Significantly, Locke did not suggest circumscribing paren
tal authority but rather articulated a new basis for it.
Rousseau disagreed with Locke in important respects, but
his philosophy was similarly premised on parental control
over a child’s development. Although Rousseau advocated
that children should be allowed to develop naturally, he
instructed that the environment be directed by “a tutor
who is given total control over the child and who removes
him from society, from all competing sources of authority
and influence.” J. Fliegelman, Prodigals and Pilgrims 30
(1982) (hereinafter Fliegelman); see also Reinier 15.
These writings received considerable attention in Amer
ica. Locke’s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding
and his Some Thoughts Concerning Education were sig
nificantly more popular than his Two Treatises of Gov
ernment, according to a study of 92 colonial libraries
between 1700 and 1776. Lundberg & May, The Enlight
ened Reader in America, 28 American Quarterly 262, 273
(1976) (hereinafter Lundberg). And Rousseau’s Emile, a
treatise on education, was more widely advertised and
distributed than his political work, The Social Contract.
Fliegelman 29; see also Lundberg 285. In general, the

THOMAS, J., dissenting

most popular books in the Colonies on the eve of the
American Revolution were not political discourses but
ones concerned with child rearing. See Mintz & Kellogg
45.
2
Locke’s and Rousseau’s writings fostered a new concep
tion of childhood. Children were increasingly viewed as
malleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an
important period of growth, development, and preparation
for adulthood. See Mintz & Kellogg 17, 21, 47; M. Gross
berg, Governing the Hearth 8 (1985) (hereinafter Gross
berg). Noah Webster, called the father of American educa
tion, wrote that “[t]he impressions received in early life
usually form the characters of individuals.” On the Edu
cation of Youth in America (1790) (hereinafter Webster),
in Essays on Education in the Early Republic 43 (F. Ru
dolph ed. 1965) (hereinafter Rudolph); cf. Slater, Noah
Webster: Founding Father of American Scholarship and
Education, in Noah Webster’s First Edition of an Ameri
can Dictionary of the English Language (1967). Elizabeth
Smith, sister-in-law to John Adams, similarly wrote: “The
Infant Mind, I beleive[,] is a blank, that eassily receives
any impression.” M. Norton, Liberty’s Daughters 101
(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter
Norton); see also S. Doggett, A Discourse on Education
(1796) (hereinafter Doggett), in Rudolph 151 (“[I]n early
youth, . . . every power and capacity is pliable and suscep
tible of any direction or impression”); J. Abbott, The
Mother at Home 2 (1834) (hereinafter Abbott) (“What
impressions can be more strong, and more lasting, than
those received upon the mind in the freshness and the
susceptibility of youth”).
Children lacked reason and decisionmaking ability.
They “have not Judgment or Will of their own,” John
Adams noted. Letter to James Sullivan (May 26, 1776), in

THOMAS, J., dissenting

4 Papers of John Adams 210 (R. Taylor ed. 1979); see also
Vol. 1 1787: Drafting the Constitution, p. 229 (W. Benton
ed. 1986) (quoting Gouvernor Morris in James Madison’s
notes from the Constitutional Convention explaining that
children do not vote because they “want prudence” and
“have no will of their own”). Children’s “utter incapacity”
rendered them “almost wholly at the mercy of their Par
ents or Instructors for a set of habits to regulate their
whole conduct through life.” J. Burgh, Thoughts on Edu
cation 7 (1749) (hereinafter Burgh).
This conception of childhood led to great concern about
influences on children. “Youth are ever learning to do
what they see others around them doing, and these imita
tions grow into habits.” Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also
B. Rush, A Plan for the Establishment of Public Schools
(1786) (hereinafter Rush), in Rudolph 16 (“The vices of
young people are generally learned from each other”);
Webster, in Rudolph 58 (“[C]hildren, artless and unsus
pecting, resign their hearts to any person whose manners
are agreeable and whose conduct is respectable”). Books
therefore advised parents “not to put children in the way
of those whom you dare not trust.” L. Child, The Mother’s
Book 149 (1831) (hereinafter Child); see also S. Coontz,
The Social Origins of Private Life 149–150 (1988) (noting
that it was “considered dangerous to leave children to the
supervision of servants or apprentices”).
As a result, it was widely accepted that children needed
close monitoring and carefully planned development. See
B. Wishy, The Child and the Republic 24–25, 32 (1968)
(hereinafter Wishy); Grossberg 8. Managing the young
mind was considered “infinitely important.” Doggett, in
Rudolph 151; see also A. MacLeod, A Moral Tale 72–73
(1975) (hereinafter MacLeod). In an essay on the educa
tion of youth in America, Noah Webster described the
human mind as “a rich field, which, without constant care,
will ever be covered with a luxuriant growth of weeds.”

THOMAS, J., dissenting

Rudolph 54. He advocated sheltering children from “every
low-bred, drunken, immoral character” and keeping their
minds “untainted till their reasoning faculties have ac
quired strength and the good principles which may be
planted in their minds have taken deep root.” Id., at 63;
see also Rush, in id., at 16 (“[T]he most useful citizens
have been formed from those youth who have never known
or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years
of age”); Burgh 7 (“[T]he souls of Youth are more immedi
ately committed to the care of Parents and Instructors
than even those of a People are to their Pastor”).
The Revolution only amplified these concerns. The Re
public would require virtuous citizens, which necessitated proper training from childhood. See Mintz 54, 71;
MacLeod 40; Saxton, French and American Childhoods, in
Children and Youth in a New Nation 69 (J. Marten ed.
2009) (hereinafter Marten); see also W. Cardell, Story of
Jack Halyard, pp. xv–xvi (30th ed. 1834) (hereinafter
Cardell) (“[T]he glory and efficacy of our institutions will
soon rest with those who are growing up to succede us”).
Children were “the pivot of the moral world,” and their
proper development was “a subject of as high interest, as
any to which the human mind ha[d] ever been called.” Id.,
at xvi.
3
Based on these views of childhood, the founding genera
tion understood parents to have a right and duty to govern
their children’s growth. Parents were expected to direct
the development and education of their children and en
sure that bad habits did not take root. See Calvert 58–59;
MacLeod 72; Mintz & Kellogg 23. They were responsible
for instilling “moral prohibitions, behavioral standards,
and a capacity for self-government that would prepare
a child for the outside world.” Mintz & Kellogg 58; see
also Youth’s Companion, Apr. 16, 1827, p. 1 (hereinafter

9

THOMAS, J., dissenting

Youth’s Companion) (“Let [children’s] minds be formed,
their hearts prepared, and their characters moulded for
the scenes and the duties of a brighter day”). In short,
“[h]ome and family bore the major responsibility for the
moral training of children and thus, by implication, for the
moral health of the nation.” MacLeod 29; see also Intro
duction, in Marten 6; Reinier, p. xi; Smith, Autonomy and
Affection: Parents and Children in Eighteenth-Century
Chesapeake Families, in Growing up in America 54
(N. Hiner & J. Hawes eds. 1985).
This conception of parental rights and duties was exem
plified by Thomas Jefferson’s approach to raising children.
He wrote letters to his daughters constantly and often
gave specific instructions about what the children should
do. See, e.g., Letter to Martha Jefferson (Nov. 28, 1783),
in S. Randolph, The Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson 44
(1939) (dictating her daily schedule of music, dancing,
drawing, and studying); Letter to Martha Jefferson (Dec.
22, 1783), in id., at 45–46 (“I do not wish you to be gaily
clothed at this time of life . . . . [A]bove all things and at
all times let your clothes be neat, whole, and properly put
on”). Jefferson expected his daughter, Martha, to write
“by every post” and instructed her, “Inform me what books
you read [and] what tunes you learn.” Letter (Nov. 28,
1783), in id., at 44. He took the same approach with his
nephew, Peter Carr, after Carr’s father died. See Letter
(Aug. 19, 1785), in 8 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 405–
408 (J. Boyd ed. 1953) (detailing a course of reading and
exercise, and asking for monthly progress reports describ
ing “in what manner you employ every hour in the day”);
see also 3 Dictionary of Virginia Biography 29 (2006).
Jefferson’s rigorous management of his charges was not
uncommon. “[M]uch evidence indicates that mothers and
fathers both believed in giving their children a strict up
bringing, enforcing obedience to their commands and
stressing continued subjection to the parental will.” Nor

THOMAS, J., dissenting

ton 96. Two parenting books published in the 1830’s gave
prototypical advice. In The Mother’s Book, Lydia Child
advised that “[t]he first and most important step in man
agement is, that whatever a mother says, always must be
done.” Child 26. John Abbott, the author of The Mother
at Home, likewise advised that “[o]bedience is absolutely
essential to proper family government.” Abbott 18. Echo
ing Locke, Abbott warned that parents who indulged a
child’s “foolish and unreasonable wishes” would doom that
child to be indulgent in adulthood. Id., at 16.
The concept of total parental control over children’s lives
extended into the schools. “The government both of fami
lies and schools should be absolute,” declared Noah Web
ster. Rudolph 57–58. Dr. Benjamin Rush concurred: “In
the education of youth, let the authority of our masters be
as absolute as possible.” Id., at 16. Through the doctrine
of in loco parentis, teachers assumed the “ ‘sacred dut[y] of
parents . . . to train up and qualify their children’ ” and
exercised the same authority “ ‘to command obedience, to
control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform
bad habits.’ ” Morse v. Frederick, 551 U. S. 393, 413–414
(2007) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (quoting State v. Pender
grass, 19 N. C. 365, 365–366 (1837)); see also Wishy 73.
Thus, the quality of teachers and schools had to “be
watched with the most scrupulous attention.” Webster, in
Rudolph 64.
For their part, children were expected to be dutiful and
obedient. Mintz & Kellogg 53; Wishy 31; cf. J. Kett, Rites
of Passage 45 (1977). Schoolbooks instructed children to
do so and frequently featured vignettes illustrating the
consequences of disobedience. See Adams, “Pictures of the
Vicious ultimately overcome by misery and shame”: The
Cultural Work of Early National Schoolbooks (hereinafter
Adams), in Marten 156. One oft-related example was the
hangings of 19 alleged witches in 1692, which, the school
books noted, likely began with false complaints by two

THOMAS, J., dissenting

young girls. See J. Morse, The American Geography 191
(1789); see also Adams, in Marten 164.
An entire genre of books, “loosely termed ‘advice to
youth,’ ” taught similar lessons well into the 1800’s. J.
Demos, Circles and Lines: The Shape of Life in Early
America 73 (2004); cf. Wishy 54. “Next to your duty to
God,” advised one book, “is your duty to your parents”
even if the child did not “understand the reason of their
commands.” L. Sigourney, The Girl’s Reading Book 44
(14th ed. 1843); see also Filial Duty Recommended and
Enforced, Introduction, p. iii (c. 1798); The Parent’s Pre
sent 44 (3d ed. 1841). “Disobedience is generally punished
in some way or other,” warned another, “and often very
severely.” S. Goodrich, Peter Parley’s Book of Fables 43
(1836); see also The Country School-House 27 (1848)
(“[T]he number of children who die from the effects of
disobedience to their parents is very large”).
4
Society’s concern with children’s development extended
to the books they read. “Vice always spreads by being
published,” Noah Webster observed. Rudolph 62. “[Y]oung
people are taught many vices by fiction, books, or public exhibitions, vices which they never would have known
had they never read such books or attended such public places.” Ibid.; see also Cardell, p. xii (cautioning par
ents that “[t]he first reading lessons for children have
an extensive influence on the acquisitions and habits of
future years”); Youth’s Companion 1 (“[T]he capacities of
children, and the peculiar situation and duties of youth,
require select and appropriate reading”).
Prominent
children’s authors harshly criticized fairy tales and the
use of anthropomorphic animals. See, e.g., S. Goodrich, 2
Recollections of a Lifetime 320, n.* (1856) (describing fairy
tales as “calculated to familiarize the mind with things
shocking and monstrous; to cultivate a taste for tales of


12

THOMAS, J., dissenting

bloodshed and violence; to teach the young to use coarse
language, and cherish vulgar ideas; . . . and to fill [the
youthful mind] with the horrors of a debased and de
bauched fancy”); 1 id., at 167 (recalling that children’s
books were “full of nonsense” and “lies”); Cardell, p. xiv
(“The fancy of converting inferior animals into ‘teachers of
children,’ has been carried to ridiculous extravagance”);
see also MacDonald 83, 103 (noting that fables and works
of fantasy were not popular in America in the 1700’s).
Adults carefully controlled what they published for
children. Stories written for children were dedicated to
moral instruction and were relatively austere, lacking
details that might titillate children’s minds. See MacLeod
24–25, 42–48; see also id., at 42 (“The authors of juvenile
fiction imposed the constraints upon themselves in the
name of duty, and for the sake of giving children what
they thought children should have, although they were
often well aware that children might prefer more excit
ing fare”); Francis, American Children’s Literature,
1646–1880, in American Childhood 208–209 (J. Hawes &
N. Hiner eds. 1985). John Newbery, the publisher often
credited with creating the genre of children’s literature,
removed traditional folk characters, like Tom Thumb,
from their original stories and placed them in new moral
ity tales in which good children were rewarded and dis
obedient children punished. Reinier 12.
Parents had total authority over what their children
read. See A. MacLeod, American Childhood 177 (1994)
(“Ideally, if not always actually, nineteenth-century par
ents regulated their children’s lives fully, certainly includ
ing their reading”). Lydia Child put it bluntly in The
Mother’s Book: “Children . . . should not read anything
without a mother’s knowledge and sanction; this is par
ticularly necessary between the ages of twelve and six
teen.” Child 92; see also id., at 143 (“[P]arents, or some
guardian friends, should carefully examine every volume

THOMAS, J., dissenting

they put into the hands of young people”); E. Monaghan,
Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America 337
(2005) (reviewing a 12-year-old girl’s journal from the
early 1770’s and noting that the child’s aunts monitored
and guided her reading).
5
The law at the time reflected the founding generation’s
understanding of parent-child relations. According to Sir
William Blackstone, parents were responsible for main
taining, protecting, and education their children, and
therefore had “power” over their children. 1 Commentar
ies on the Laws of England 434, 440 (1765); cf. Washington
v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 712 (1997) (Blackstone’s
Commentaries was “a primary legal authority for 18thand 19th-century American lawyers”). Chancellor James
Kent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189–
*207. The law entitled parents to “the custody of their
[children],” “the value of th[e] [children’s] labor and ser
vices,” and the “right to the exercise of such discipline as
may be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust.”
Id., at *193, *203. Children, in turn, were charged with
“obedience and assistance during their own minority, and
gratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives.” Id.,
at *207.
Thus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents
had a right to the child’s labor and services until the child
reached majority. In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts explained, “There is no question but that a
father, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and
for whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common
law, assign those services to others, for a consideration to
enure to himself.” Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145, 147; see
also Benson v. Remington, 2 Mass. 113, 115 (1806) (opin
ion of Parsons, C. J.) (“The law is very well settled, that
parents are under obligations to support their children,


14

BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
THOMAS, J., dissenting

and that they are entitled to their earnings”). Similarly,
the Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted
that the right of parents to recover for the services of their
child, while a minor, “cannot be contested.” Gale v. Parrot,
1 N. H. 28, 29 (1817). And parents could bring tort suits
against those who knowingly enticed a minor away from
them. See, e.g., Kirkpatrick v. Lockhart, 2 Brev. 276 (S. C.
Constitutional Ct. 1809); Jones v. Tevis, 4 Litt. 25 (Ky.
App. 1823).
Relatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without
parental consent. Many of those who did so during the
Revolutionary War found, afterwards, that their fathers
were entitled to their military wages. See Cox, Boy Sol
diers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21–24. And
after the war, minors who enlisted without parental con
sent in violation of federal law could find themselves
returned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their
parents’ request. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 24
F. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); Commonwealth
v. Callan, 6 Binn. 255 (Pa. 1814) (per curiam).
Laws also set age limits restricting marriage without
parental consent. For example, from 1730 until at least
1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the
marriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at
Large of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell & H. Flanders eds.
1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of
Pennsylvania 82–83 (J. Dunlop 2d ed. 1849) (including the
1730 marriage law with no amendments); see also Perpet
ual Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 253
(1788), in The First Laws of the Commonwealth of Massa
chusetts (J. Cushing ed. 1981).
In general, “[p]ostRevolutionary marriage law assumed that below a certain
age, children could . . . no[t] intellectually understand its
significance.” Grossberg 105.
Indeed, the law imposed age limits on all manner of
activities that required judgment and reason. Children

THOMAS, J., dissenting

could not vote, could not serve on juries, and generally
could not be witnesses in criminal cases unless they were
older than 14. See Brewer 43, 145, 148, 159. Nor could
they swear loyalty to a State. See, e.g., 9 Pa. Stats. at
Large 111 (1903 ed.). Early federal laws granting aliens
the ability to become citizens provided that those under 21
were deemed citizens if their fathers chose to naturalize.
See, e.g., Act of Mar. 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Jan. 29,
1795, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 415.

The history clearly shows a founding generation that
believed parents to have complete authority over their
minor children and expected parents to direct the devel
opment of those children. The Puritan tradition in New
England laid the foundation of American parental author
ity and duty. See MacDonald 6 (“The Puritans are virtu
ally the inventors of the family as we know it today”). In
the decades leading up to and following the Revolution,
the conception of the child’s mind evolved but the duty and
authority of parents remained. Indeed, society paid closer
attention to potential influences on children than before.
See Mintz 72 (“By weakening earlier forms of patriarchal
authority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of
childrearing and education in ensuring social stability”).
Teachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children’s
reading material was carefully supervised. Laws reflected
these concerns and often supported parental authority
with the coercive power of the state.

In light of this history, the Framers could not possibly
have understood “the freedom of speech” to include an
unqualified right to speak to minors. Specifically, I am
sure that the founding generation would not have under

stood “the freedom of speech” to include a right to speak to
children without going through their parents. As a conse
quence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech—
for example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a
minor—“abridg[e] the freedom of speech” within the origi
nal meaning of the First Amendment.
We have recently noted that this Court does not have
“freewheeling authority to declare new categories of
speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.” Ste
vens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). But we also recog
nized that there may be “some categories of speech that
have been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been
specifically identified or discussed as such in our case
law.” Ibid. In my opinion, the historical evidence here
plainly reveals one such category.2
B
Admittedly, the original public understanding of a
constitutional provision does not always comport with
modern sensibilities.
See Morse, 551 U. S., at 419
(THOMAS, J., concurring) (treating students “as though it
——————
2 The majority responds that “it does not follow” from the historical
evidence “that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing
. . . anything without their parents’ prior consent.” Ante, at 7, n. 3.
Such a conclusion, the majority asserts, would lead to laws that, in its
view, would be undesirable and “obviously” unconstitutional. Ibid.
The majority’s circular argument misses the point. The question is
not whether certain laws might make sense to judges or legislators
today, but rather what the public likely understood “the freedom of
speech” to mean when the First Amendment was adopted. See District
of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 634–635 (2008). I believe it is
clear that the founding public would not have understood “the freedom
of speech” to include speech to minor children bypassing their parents.
It follows that the First Amendment imposes no restriction on state
regulation of such speech. To note that there may not be “precedent for
[such] state control,” ante, at 8, n. 3, “is not to establish that [there] is a
constitutional right,” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334,
373 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).

were still the 19th century would find little support to
day”). It may also be inconsistent with precedent. See
McDonald, 561 U. S., at ___–___ (THOMAS, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 48–
52) (rejecting the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36
(1873), as inconsistent with the original public meaning
of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment).
This, however, is not such a case. Although much has
changed in this country since the Revolution, the notion
that parents have authority over their children and that
the law can support that authority persists today. For
example, at least some States make it a crime to lure or
entice a minor away from the minor’s parent. See, e.g.,
Cal. Penal Code Ann. §272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat.
§787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes
a minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial
consent. Cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 558 (Ap
pendix D to opinion of Court) (2005). Individuals less than
18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental
consent. 10 U. S. C. §505(a). And minors remain subject
to curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana
et al. as Amici Curiae 16, and cannot unilaterally consent
to most medical procedures, id., at 15.
Moreover, there are many things minors today cannot
do at all, whether they have parental consent or not.
State laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty.
See Roper, supra, at 581–585 (Appendixes B and C to
opinion of Court). In California (the State at issue here),
minors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal.
Veh. Code Ann. §§12515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase
tobacco, Cal. Penal Code Ann. §308(b) (West 2008), play
bingo for money, §326.5(e), or execute a will, Cal. Probate
Code Ann. §6220 (West 2009).
My understanding of “the freedom of speech” is also
consistent with this Court’s precedents. To be sure, the


18

BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Court has held that children are entitled to the protection
of the First Amendment, see, e.g., Erznoznik v. Jackson
ville, 422 U. S. 205, 212–213 (1975), and the government
may not unilaterally dictate what children can say or
hear, see id., at 213–214; Tinker v. Des Moines Independ
ent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 511 (1969).
But this Court has never held, until today, that “the free
dom of speech” includes a right to speak to minors (or a
right of minors to access speech) without going through
the minors’ parents. To the contrary, “[i]t is well settled
that a State or municipality can adopt more stringent
controls on communicative materials available to youths
than on those available to adults.” Erznoznik, supra, at
212; cf. post, at 3 (BREYER, J., dissenting).
The Court’s constitutional jurisprudence “historically
has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as
a unit with broad parental authority over minor children.”
Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602 (1979). Under that
case law, “legislature[s] [can] properly conclude that par
ents and others, teachers for example, who have . . . pri
mary responsibility for children’s well-being are entitled to
the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that re
sponsibility.” Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 639
(1968); see also Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 635 (1979)
(opinion of Powell, J.) (“[T]he State is entitled to adjust its
legal system to account for children’s vulnerability and
their needs for concern, . . . sympathy, and . . . paternal
attention” (internal quotation marks omitted)). This is
because “the tradition of parental authority is not incon
sistent with our tradition of individual liberty; rather, the
former is one of the basic presuppositions of the latter.”
Id., at 638; id., at 638–639 (“Legal restrictions on minors,
especially those supportive of the parental role, may be
important to the child’s chances for the full growth and
maturity that make eventual participation in a free soci
ety meaningful and rewarding”).

The California law at issue here prohibits the sale or
rental of “violent video game[s]” to minors, defined as
anyone “under 18 years of age.” Cal. Civ. Code Ann.
§§1746.1(a), 1746 (West 2009). A violation of the law is
punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. §1746.3. Criti
cally, the law does not prohibit adults from buying or
renting violent video games for a minor or prohibit minors
from playing such games. Cf. ante, at 10 (ALITO, J., con
curring in judgment); post, at 10 (BREYER, J., dissenting).
The law also does not restrict a “minor’s parent, grandpar
ent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian” from selling or renting
him a violent video game. §1746.1(c).
Respondents, associations of companies in the video
game industry, brought a preenforcement challenge to
California’s law, claiming that on its face the law violates
the free speech rights of their members. The Court holds
that video games are speech for purposes of the First
Amendment and finds the statute facially unconstitu
tional. See ante, at 2–3, 11–17. I disagree.
Under any of this Court’s standards for a facial First
Amendment challenge, this one must fail. The video game
associations cannot show “that no set of circumstances
exists under which [the law] would be valid,” “that
the statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,” or that
“a substantial number of its applications are unconstitu
tional, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate
sweep.” Stevens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Even assuming that video
games are speech, in most applications the California law
does not implicate the First Amendment. All that the law
does is prohibit the direct sale or rental of a violent video
game to a minor by someone other than the minor’s par
ent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian. Where a
minor has a parent or guardian, as is usually true, the law
does not prevent that minor from obtaining a violent video

game with his parent’s or guardian’s help. In the typical
case, the only speech affected is speech that bypasses a
minor’s parent or guardian. Because such speech does not
fall within “the freedom of speech” as originally under
stood, California’s law does not ordinarily implicate the
First Amendment and is not facially unconstitutional.3

“The freedom of speech,” as originally understood, does
not include a right to speak to minors without going
through the minors’ parents or guardians. Therefore, I
cannot agree that the statute at issue is facially unconsti
tutional under the First Amendment.
I respectfully dissent.

the statute would survive an as-applied challenge in the
unusual case of an emancipated minor is a question for another day.
To decide this case, it is enough that the statute is not unconstitutional
on its face.
