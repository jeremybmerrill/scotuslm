CAROL ANNE BOND, PETITIONER v. 

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[June 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion and write separately to make
the following observation. Bond, like any other defendant,
has a personal right not to be convicted under a constitu
tionally invalid law. See Fallon, As-Applied and Facial
Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev.
1321, 1331–1333 (2000); Monaghan, Overbreadth, 1981
Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 3. See also North Carolina v. Pearce, 395
U. S. 711, 739 (1969) (Black, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (“Due process . . . is a guarantee that a
man should be tried and convicted only in accordance with
valid laws of the land.”).
In this case, Bond argues that the statute under which
she was charged, 18 U. S. C. §229, exceeds Congress’
enumerated powers and violates the Tenth Amendment.
Other defendants might assert that a law exceeds Con
gress’ power because it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,
or the Establishment Clause, or the Due Process Clause.
Whatever the claim, success on the merits would require
reversal of the conviction. “An offence created by [an
unconstitutional law],” the Court has held, “is not a
crime.” Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 376 (1880). “A
conviction under [such a law] is not merely erroneous, but
is illegal and void, and cannot be a legal cause of impris

onment.” Id., at 376–377. If a law is invalid as applied to
the criminal defendant’s conduct, the defendant is entitled
to go free.
For this reason, a court has no “prudential” license to
decline to consider whether the statute under which the
defendant has been charged lacks constitutional applica
tion to her conduct. And that is so even where the consti
tutional provision that would render the conviction void is
directed at protecting a party not before the Court. Our
decisions concerning criminal laws infected with discrimi
nation are illustrative. The Court must entertain the
objection—and reverse the conviction—even if the right to
equal treatment resides in someone other than the de
fendant. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 452–455
(1972) (reversing conviction for distributing contraceptives
because the law banning distribution violated the recipi
ent’s right to equal protection); cf. Craig v. Boren, 429
U. S. 190, 192, 210, and n. 24 (1976) (law penalizing sale
of beer to males but not females aged 18 to 20 could not
be enforced against vendor). See also Grayned v. City of
Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 107, n. 2 (1972); Welsh v. United
States, 398 U. S. 333, 361–362 (1970) (Harlan, J., concur
ring in result) (reversal required even if, going forward,
Congress would cure the unequal treatment by extending
rather than invalidating the criminal proscription).
In short, a law “beyond the power of Congress,” for any
reason, is “no law at all.” Nigro v. United States, 276 U. S.
332, 341 (1928). The validity of Bond’s conviction depends
upon whether the Constitution permits Congress to enact
§229. Her claim that it does not must be considered and
decided on the merits.
