GLEN SCOTT MILNER, PETITIONER v. DEPARTMENT
OF THE NAVY
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[March 7, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.
Justice Stevens has explained that, once “a statute has
been construed, either by this Court or by a consistent
course of decision by other federal judges and agencies,” it
can acquire a clear meaning that this Court should hesi
tate to change. See Shearson/American Express Inc. v.
McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 268 (1987) (opinion concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added). See also
Commissioner v. Fink, 483 U. S. 89, 104 (1987) (Stevens,
J., dissenting); B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial
Process 149 (1921). I would apply that principle to this
case and accept the 30-year-old decision by the D. C. Cir
cuit in Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms,
670 F. 2d 1051 (1981) (en banc), as properly stating the
law.
For one thing, the Crooker decision, joined by 9 of the 10
sitting Circuit Judges, has been consistently followed, or
favorably cited, by every Court of Appeals to have consid
ered the matter during the past 30 years. See ibid. (writ
ten by Judge Edwards, and joined by Chief Judge Robin
son and Judges Wright, MacKinnon, Robb, Wald, Mikva,
and then-Judge Ginsburg, with Judge Tamm concurring
in the result and Judge Wilkey dissenting); Massey v. FBI,
3 F. 3d 620, 622 (CA2 1993); Kaganove v. EPA, 856 F. 2d
884, 889 (CA7 1988), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 1011 (1989);

MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
BREYER, J., dissenting

Dirksen v. HHS, 803 F. 2d 1456, 1458 (CA9 1986). Three
Circuits adopted a different approach in the 1970’s before
Crooker was decided, see ante, at 3–4, n. 2, but I read
subsequent decisions in two of those Circuits as not adher
ing to their early positions. See Abraham & Rose, PLC v.
United States, 138 F. 3d 1075, 1080–1081 (CA6 1998)
(finding Crooker’s textual analysis “sound and persuasive,”
and noting that FBI symbols “used internally to identify
confidential sources” may be withheld); Sladek v.
Bensinger, 605 F. 2d 899, 902 (CA5 1979) (expressly re
serving judgment on the Crooker issue). As for the re
maining Circuit, its district courts understand Crooker
now to apply. See, e.g., Gavin v. SEC, No. 04–4522, 2007
WL 2454156, *5–*6 (D Minn., Aug. 23, 2007); see also
McQueen v. United States, 264 F. Supp. 2d 502, 528 (SD
Tex. 2003), aff’d, 100 Fed. Appx. 964 (CA5 2004) (per
curiam); Tickel v. IRS, No. 1–85–709, 1986 WL 14436, *2–
*3 (ED Tenn., Aug. 22, 1986). I recognize that there is
reasonable ground for disagreement over the precise
status of certain pre-Crooker precedents, but the Crooker
interpretation of Exemption 2 has guided nearly every
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case decided over the
last 30 years. See generally Dept. of Justice, Guide to
Freedom of Information Act, pp. 184–206 (2009) (FOIA
Guide) (identifying over 100 district court decisions apply
ing the Crooker approach, and one appearing to reject it).
Congress, moreover, well aware of Crooker, left Exemp
tion 2, 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(2), untouched when it amended
the FOIA five years later. See S. Rep. No. 98–221, p. 25
(1983) (discussing Crooker); Freedom of Information Re
form Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207–48 (amending Exemption
7, 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7)).
This Court has found that circumstances of this kind
offer significant support for retaining an interpretation of
a statute that has been settled by the lower courts. See
General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S.

(1962). See generally W. Eskridge, P. Frickey, & E. Garrett,
Cases and Materials on Legislation 1048 (4th ed. 2007)
(“[T]he acquiescence rule can also support implicit con
gressional ratification of a uniform line of federal appel
late interpretations . . .”).
For another thing, even if the majority’s analysis would
have persuaded me if written on a blank slate, Crooker’s
analysis was careful and its holding reasonable. The
Circuit Court examined the statute’s language, the legisla
tive history, and the precedent. It recognized that the
exemption’s words (“related solely to the internal person
nel rules and practices of an agency”) could easily be read,
as the Court reads them today, to refer only to human
resources rules and practices. See 670 F. 2d, at 1056–
1057. But it also thought that those words could be read
more broadly as referring to internal rules or practices
that set forth criteria or guidelines for agency personnel to
follow in respect to purely internal matters (as long as the
information at issue was “not of legitimate public inter
est”). Id., at 1056, 1057.
The D. C. Circuit agreed with today’s Court that the
Senate Report described the exemption as referring to
“ ‘internal personnel’ ” matters, giving as examples “ ‘per
sonnel’s use of parking facilities, . . . sick leave, and the
like.’ ” Id., at 1058–1059 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th

MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
BREYER, J., dissenting

Cong., 1st Sess., p. 8 (1965)). But it also noted that the
House Report described the exemption as protecting from
disclosure “ ‘[o]perating rules, guidelines, and manuals of
procedure for Government investigators or examiners.’ ”
670 F. 2d, at 1060 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th
Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10 (1966)). “[U]pon reflection,” it
thought the views of the two Houses “reconcilable” if one
understood both sets of examples as referring to internal
staff information (both minor personnel matters and staff
instruction matters) that the public had no legitimate
interest in learning about. 670 F. 2d, at 1065. And it
accepted this view in light of its hesitation to “apply indi
vidual provisions of the statute woodenly, oblivious to
Congress’ intention that FOIA not frustrate law enforce
ment efforts.” Id., at 1066. At the same time it found no
other exemption that would protect internal documents in
which there is no legitimate public interest in disclosure—
a category that includes, say, building plans, safe combi
nations, computer passwords, evacuation plans, and the
like.
After examining in depth the legislative history and
relevant precedent, the court adopted an approach based
on a prior opinion by Circuit Judge Leventhal, as well as
language used by this Court in Department of Air Force v.
Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 369 (1976). The D. C. Circuit held
that a document fits within the literal language of Exemp
tion 2 and is exempt from disclosure if (1) it “meets the
test of ‘predominant internality,’ ” i.e., the document is
“not of legitimate public interest,” and (2) “disclosure
significantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or
statutes.” Crooker, supra, at 1056, 1074; see also Rose,
supra, at 369 (suggesting that Exemption 2 might apply
where “disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regu
lation”). This test, based upon Congress’ broader FOIA
objectives and a “common sense” view of what information
Congress did and did not want to make available, Crooker,

BREYER, J., dissenting

supra, at 1074, takes the “practical approach” that this
Court has “consistently . . . taken” when interpreting the
FOIA, John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U. S. 146,
157 (1989).
I would not underestimate the importance of this “prac
tical approach.” It reflects this Court’s longstanding rec
ognition that it cannot interpret the FOIA (and the Ad
ministrative Procedure Act (APA) of which it is a part)
with the linguistic literalism fit for interpretations of the
tax code. See generally 1 R. Pierce, Administrative Law
Treatise §7.1, p. 413 (4th ed. 2002) (“Judicial interpreta
tion of the malleable language of the APA has produced
changes in the rulemaking procedure that could be charac
terized as revolutionary if they had been affected in a day
or a year rather than gradually over a period of decades”);
cf. Sunstein & Vermeule, Interpretation and Institutions,
101 Mich. L. Rev. 885, 917–918, and n. 111 (2003) (observ
ing that Congress “appears to rely on courts for long peri
ods of time” to give meaning to the APA, which justifies
interpreting it less formalistically than statutes like “the
Internal Revenue Code”). That in large part is because
the FOIA (like the APA but unlike the tax code) must
govern the affairs of a vast Executive Branch with numer
ous different agencies, bureaus, and departments, per
forming numerous tasks of many different kinds. Too
narrow an interpretation, while working well in the case
of one agency, may seriously interfere with congressional
objectives when applied to another. The D. C. Circuit’s
answer to this legal problem here was to interpret Exemp
tion 2 in light of Congress’ basic effort to achieve a
“workable balance between the interests of the public in
greater access to information and the needs of the Gov
ernment to protect certain kinds of information from
disclosure.” John Doe Agency, supra, at 157. See also
S. Rep. No. 1219, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 8, 11 (1964) (em
phasizing this “workable” balance); S. Rep. No. 813, at 3, 5

(same); H. R. Rep. No. 1497, at 2, 6 (same).
Further, 30 years of experience with Crooker’s holding
suggests that it has not seriously interfered with the
FOIA’s informational objectives, while at the same time it
has permitted agencies to withhold much information
which, in my view, Congress would not have wanted to
force into the public realm. To focus only on the case law,
courts have held that that information protected by Ex
emption 2 includes blueprints for Department of Agricul
ture buildings that store biological agents, Elliot v. De
partment of Agriculture, 518 F. Supp. 2d 217 (DC 2007);

BREYER, J., dissenting

In other Exemption 2 cases, where withholding may
seem less reasonable, the courts have ordered disclosure.
Cf. ante, at 16, n. 9 (citing Audubon Society v. Forest Serv.,
104 F. 3d 1201, 1203 (CA10 1997), and Maricopa Audubon
Soc. v. Forest Serv., 108 F. 3d 1082, 1084 (CA9 1997)). See
generally FOIA Guide 201, and n. 106 (citing nine deci
sions applying the Crooker approach but nonetheless
requiring disclosure).
The majority acknowledges that “our decision today
upsets three decades of agency practice relying on Crooker,
and therefore may force considerable adjustments.” Ante,
at 18. But how are these adjustments to be made? Should
the Government rely upon other exemptions to provide the
protection it believes necessary? As JUSTICE ALITO notes,
Exemption 7 applies where the documents consist of “re
cords or information compiled for law enforcement pur
poses” and release would, e.g., “disclose techniques and
procedures for law enforcement investigations,” or “could
reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical
safety of any individual.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7). But what
about information that is not compiled for law enforce
ment purposes, such as building plans, computer pass
words, credit card numbers, or safe deposit combinations?
The Government, which has much experience litigating
FOIA cases, warns us that Exemption 7 “targets only a
subset of the important agency functions that may be
circumvented.” Brief for Respondent 52–53. Today’s
decision only confirms this point, as the Court’s insistence
on narrow construction might persuade judges to avoid
reading Exemption 7 broadly enough to provide Crooker
type protection.
The majority suggests that the Government can classify
documents that should remain private. Ante, at 18. See 5
U. S. C. §552(b)(1) (permitting withholding of material
“properly classified” as authorized to be “kept secret in the
interest of national defense or foreign policy”). But classi

fication is at best a partial solution. It takes time. It is
subject to its own rules. As the Government points out, it
would hinder the sharing of information about Govern
ment buildings with “first responders,” such as local fire
and police departments. Brief for Respondent 53–54. And
both Congress and the President believe the Nation cur
rently faces a problem of too much, not too little, classified
material. See Reducing Over-Classification Act, 124 Stat.
2648; Exec. Order No. 13526, §§1.3(d), 2.1(d), 5.4(d)(10), 3
CFR 298, 299–300, 304, 321 (2009 Comp.). Indeed, Con
gress recently found:
“The 9/11 Commission and others have observed that
the over-classification of information interferes with
accurate, actionable, and timely information sharing,
increases the cost of information security, and need
lessly limits stakeholder and public access to informa
tion.
“Over-classification of information causes consider
able confusion regarding what information may be
shared with whom, and negatively affects the dis
semination of information within the Federal Gov
ernment and with State, local, and tribal entities, and
with the private sector.” Reducing Over-Classification
Act, §§2(2), (3), 124 Stat. 2648.
These legislative findings suggest that it is “over
classification,” not Crooker, that poses the more serious
threat to the FOIA’s public information objectives.
That leaves congressional action. As the Court points
out, Congress remains free to correct whatever problems it
finds in today’s narrowing of Exemption 2. But legislative
action takes time; Congress has much to do; and other
matters, when compared with a FOIA revision, may war
rant higher legislative priority. In my view, it is for the
courts, through appropriate interpretation, to turn Con
gress’ public information objectives into workable agency

BREYER, J., dissenting

practice, and to adhere to such interpretations once they
are settled.
That is why: Where the courts have already interpreted
Exemption 2, where that interpretation has been consis
tently relied upon and followed for 30 years, where Con
gress has taken note of that interpretation in amending
other parts of the statute, where that interpretation is
reasonable, where it has proved practically helpful and
achieved commonsense results, where it is consistent with
the FOIA’s overall statutory goals, where a new and dif
ferent interpretation raises serious problems of its own,
and where that new interpretation would require Con
gress to act just to preserve a decades-long status quo,
I would let sleeping legal dogs lie.
For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.
