VINCENT CULLEN, ACTING WARDEN, PETITIONER
v. SCOTT LYNN PINHOLSTER
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 4, 2011]


JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
I join Parts I and II of the Court’s opinion. I do not join
Part III, for I would send this case back to the Court of
Appeals so that it can apply the legal standards that Part
II announces to the complex facts of this case. Compare
ante, at 14–31 (majority opinion), with post, at 17–42
(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).
Like the Court, I believe that its understanding of
28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) does not leave AEDPA’s hearing
section, §2254(e), without work to do. An offender who
believes he is entitled to habeas relief must first present a
claim (including his evidence) to the state courts. If the
state courts reject the claim, then a federal habeas court
may review that rejection on the basis of the materials
considered by the state court. If the federal habeas court
finds that the state-court decision fails (d)’s test (or if (d)
does not apply), then an (e) hearing may be needed.
For example, if the state-court rejection assumed the
habeas petitioner’s facts (deciding that, even if those facts
were true, federal law was not violated), then (after find
ing the state court wrong on a (d) ground) an (e) hearing
might be needed to determine whether the facts alleged
were indeed true. Or if the state-court rejection rested on
a state ground, which a federal habeas court found inade

Opinion of BREYER, J.

quate, then an (e) hearing might be needed to consider the
petitioner’s (now unblocked) substantive federal claim. Or
if the state-court rejection rested on only one of several
related federal grounds (e.g., that counsel’s assistance was
not “inadequate”), then, if the federal court found that the
state court’s decision in respect to the ground it decided
violated (d), an (e) hearing might be needed to consider
other related parts of the whole constitutional claim (e.g.,
whether the counsel’s “inadequate” assistance was also
prejudicial). There may be other situations in which an (e)
hearing is needed as well.
In this case, however, we cannot say whether an (e)
hearing is needed until we know whether the state court,
in rejecting Pinholster’s claim on the basis presented to
that state court, violated (d). (In my view, the lower
courts’ analysis in respect to this matter is inadequate.)
There is no role in (d) analysis for a habeas petitioner to
introduce evidence that was not first presented to the
state courts. But that does not mean that Pinholster is
without recourse to present new evidence. He can always
return to state court presenting new evidence not previ
ously presented. If the state court again denies relief, he
might be able to return to federal court to make claims
related to the latest rejection, subject to AEDPA’s limita
tions on successive petitions. See §2244.
I am not trying to predict the future course of these
proceedings. I point out only that, in my view, AEDPA is
not designed to take necessary remedies from a habeas
petitioner but to give the State a first opportunity to con
sider most matters and to insist that federal courts prop
erly respect state-court determinations.
