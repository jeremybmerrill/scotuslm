VINCENT CULLEN, ACTING WARDEN, PETITIONER
v. SCOTT LYNN PINHOLSTER
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 4, 2011]


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.
Although I concur in the Court’s judgment, I agree with
the conclusion reached in Part I of the dissent, namely,
that, when an evidentiary hearing is properly held in
federal court, review under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) must
take into account the evidence admitted at that hearing.
As the dissent points out, refusing to consider the evidence
received in the hearing in federal court gives §2254(e)(2)
an implausibly narrow scope and will lead either to results
that Congress surely did not intend or to the distortion of
other provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and the law
on “cause and prejudice.” See post, at 9–12 (opinion of
SOTOMAYOR, J.).
Under AEDPA evidentiary hearings in federal court
should be rare. The petitioner generally must have made
a diligent effort to produce in state court the new evidence
on which he seeks to rely. See §2254(e)(2); Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 433–434 (2000). If that requirement
is not satisfied, the petitioner may establish the factual
predicate for a claim in a federal-court hearing only if,
among other things, “the facts underlying the claim would
be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence
that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder

Opinion of ALITO, J.

would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying
offense.” §2254(e)(2)(B).
Even when the petitioner does satisfy the diligence
standard adopted in Williams v. Taylor, supra, a hearing
should not be held in federal court unless the new evi
dence that the petitioner seeks to introduce was not and
could not have been offered in the state-court proceeding.
Section 2254(e)(2) bars a hearing in certain situations, but
it does not mean that a hearing is allowed in all other
situations. See Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473–
474 (2007). The whole thrust of AEDPA is essentially to
reserve federal habeas relief for those cases in which the
state courts acted unreasonably. See §§2254(d)(1), (2),
(e)(1). Permitting a petitioner to obtain federal habeas
relief on the basis of evidence that could have been but
was not offered in state court would upset this scheme.
In this case, for essentially the reasons set out in the
dissent from the Court of Appeals’ en banc decision, see
Pinholster v. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 688–691 (CA9 2009)
(opinion of Kozinski, J.), I would hold that the federal
court hearing should not have been held because respon
dent did not diligently present his new evidence to the
California courts. And I join all but Part II of the opinion
of the Court, as I agree that the decision of the state court
represented a reasonable application of clearly established
Supreme Court precedent in light of the state-court record.
