KEVIN KASTEN, PETITIONER v. SAINT-GOBAIN 

PERFORMANCE PLASTICS CORPORATION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[March 22, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (Act) sets forth
employment rules concerning minimum wages, maximum
hours, and overtime pay. 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U. S. C. §201 et
seq. The Act contains an antiretaliation provision that
forbids employers
“to discharge or in any other manner discriminate
against any employee because such employee has filed
any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted
any proceeding under or related to [the Act], or has
testified or is about to testify in such proceeding, or
has served or is about to serve on an industry commit­
tee.” §215(a)(3) (emphasis added).
We must decide whether the statutory term “filed any
complaint” includes oral as well as written complaints
within its scope. We conclude that it does.
I
The petitioner, Kevin Kasten, brought this antiretalia­
tion lawsuit against his former employer, Saint-Gobain
Performance Plastics Corporation.
Kasten says that

KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


Saint-Gobain located its timeclocks between the area
where Kasten and other workers put on (and take off)
their work-related protective gear and the area where they
carry out their assigned tasks. That location prevented
workers from receiving credit for the time they spent
putting on and taking off their work clothes—contrary to
the Act’s requirements. In a related suit the District
Court agreed with Kasten, finding that Saint-Gobain’s
“practice of not compensating . . . for time spent donning
and doffing certain required protective gear and walking
to work areas” violated the Act. Kasten v. Saint-Gobain
Performance Plastics Corp., 556 F. Supp. 2d 941, 954 (WD
Wis. 2008). In this suit Kasten claims unlawful retalia­
tion. He says that Saint-Gobain discharged him because
he orally complained to Saint-Gobain officials about the
timeclocks.
In particular, Kasten says that he repeatedly called the
unlawful timeclock location to Saint-Gobain’s attention—
in accordance with Saint-Gobain’s internal grievance­
resolution procedure. See Brief for Petitioner 4 (quoting
Saint-Gobain’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct as
imposing upon every employee “the responsibility to report
. . . suspected violations of . . . any applicable law of which
he or she becomes aware”); id., at 4–5 (quoting SaintGobain’s Employee Policy Handbook as instructing em­
ployees with “questions, complaints, and problems” to
“[c]ontact” their “supervisor[s] immediately” and if neces­
sary “take the issue to the next level of management,”
then to the “local Human Resources Manager,” then to
“Human Resources” personnel at the “Regional” or “Head­
quarters” level).
Kasten adds that he “raised a concern” with his shift
supervisor that “it was illegal for the time clocks to be
where they were” because of Saint-Gobain’s exclusion of
“the time you come in and start doing stuff”; he told a
human resources employee that “if they were to get chal­

Opinion of the Court

lenged on” the location in court, “they would lose”; he told
his lead operator that the location was illegal and that he
“was thinking about starting a lawsuit about the place­
ment of the time clocks”; and he told the human resources
manager and the operations manager that he thought the
location was illegal and that the company would “lose” in
court. Record in No. 3:07–cv–00686–bbc (WD Wis.), Doc.
87–3, pp. 31–34 (deposition of Kevin Kasten). This activ­
ity, Kasten concludes, led the company to discipline him
and, in December 2006, to dismiss him.
Saint-Gobain presents a different version of events. It
denies that Kasten made any significant complaint about
the timeclock location. And it says that it dismissed Kas­
ten simply because Kasten, after being repeatedly warned,
failed to record his comings and goings on the timeclock.
For present purposes we accept Kasten’s version of
these contested events as valid. See Scott v. Harris, 550
U. S. 372, 380 (2007). That is because the District Court
entered summary judgment in Saint-Gobain’s favor. 619
F. Supp. 2d 608, 610 (WD Wis. 2008). And it did so, not
because it doubted Kasten’s ability to prove the facts he
alleged, but because it thought the Act did not protect oral
complaints. Id., at 611–613. On appeal, the Seventh
Circuit agreed with the District Court that the Act’s an­
tiretaliation provision does not cover oral complaints. 570
F. 3d 834, 838–840 (2009).
Kasten sought certiorari. And in light of conflict among
the Circuits as to whether an oral complaint is protected,
we granted Kasten’s petition. Compare Hagan v. Echostar
Satellite, L. L. C., 529 F. 3d 617, 625–626 (CA5 2008)
(antiretaliation provision covers oral complaints); Lambert
v. Ackerley, 180 F. 3d 997, 1007 (CA9 1999) (en banc)
(same); with Lambert v. Genesee Hospital, 10 F. 3d 46, 55–
56 (CA2 1993) (antiretaliation provision does not cover
informal complaints to supervisors). See also Pacheco v.
Whiting Farms, Inc., 365 F. 3d 1199, 1206 (CA10 2004)

II
The sole question presented is whether “an oral com­
plaint of a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act” is
“protected conduct under the [Act’s] anti-retaliation provi­
sion.” Pet. for Cert. i. The Act protects employees who
have “filed any complaint,” 29 U. S. C. §215(a)(3), and
interpretation of this phrase “depends upon reading the
whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context
of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authori­
ties that inform the analysis,” Dolan v. Postal Service, 546
U. S. 481, 486 (2006). This analysis leads us to conclude
that the language of the provision, considered in isolation,
may be open to competing interpretations. But consider­
ing the provision in conjunction with the purpose and
context leads us to conclude that only one interpretation is
permissible.
A
We begin with the text of the statute. The word “filed”
has different relevant meanings in different contexts.
Some dictionary definitions of the word contemplate a
writing. See, e.g., Webster’s New International Dictionary
945 (2d ed. 1934) (def. 4(a)) (to file is to “deliver (a paper or
instrument) to the proper officer so that it is received by
him to be kept on file, or among the records of his office”
(emphasis added)); Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dic­
tionary 462 (1983) (def. 2(a)) (one definition of “file” is “to
place among official records as prescribed by law”).
But other dictionaries provide different definitions that


Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)

5

Opinion of the Court

permit the use of the word “file” in conjunction with oral
material. One can, for example, file an oral statement
that enters a matter “into the order of business.” 1 Funk
& Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English
Language 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (def. 2) (to file is to “present
in the regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body, so
that it shall go upon the records or into the order of busi­
ness”). This possibility is significant because it means
that dictionary meanings, even if considered alone, do not
necessarily limit the scope of the statutory phrase to writ­
ten complaints. Cf. Crawford v. Metropolitan Government
of Nashville and Davidson Cty., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(slip op., at 5) (looking for the “limits” of a linguistic
phrase rather than what “exemplif[ies]” its application).
In addition to the dictionary definitions, we have found
that legislators, administrators, and judges have all some­
times used the word “file” in conjunction with oral state­
ments. Thus state statutes sometimes contemplate oral
filings. See, e.g., Alaska Stat. §47.32.090(a) (2008) (“file a
verbal or written complaint”); Cal. Health & Safety
Code Ann. §17055(a) (West 2006) (“file an administrative complaint orally or in writing”); D. C. Code §7–
1231.12(a)(2)(B) (2001) (“filing his or her grievance, orally
or in writing”); Ga. Code Ann. §§31–8–124(a), (c), 31–8–
134(b) (2009) (“to file a grievance,” a person may “submit
an oral or written complaint”); Ind. Code §27–8–28–14(a)
(2009) (“file a grievance orally or in writing”); Me. Rev.
Stat. Ann., Tit. 34–B, §5604(3)(B) (2009) (“filed through an
oral request”); Miss. Code Ann. §69–47–23(4) (2005) (“file
a written or oral complaint”); Mo. Rev. Stat. §198.088.3(3)
(2009) (to have a complaint “filed,” a person “shall write or
cause to be written his grievance or shall state it orally”);
Nev. Rev. Stat. §§618.336(2)(a), 618.341(1)(a) (2009) (“oral
or written complaint filed”); N. J. Stat. Ann. §30:4C–12
(West 2008) (“written or oral complaint may be filed”);
N. Y. Ins. Law Ann. §§3217–a(a)(7), 4324(a)(7) (West

Opinion of the Court 


2006) (“file a grievance orally”); N. Y. Pub. Health Law
Ann. §§4408(1)(g) (West Supp. 2010) (“file a grievance
orally”); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 40, §§991.2141(a)–(b) (Purdon
1999) (“file a . . . written or oral complaint”); Tex. Ins.
Code Ann. §§1305.401(a)–(b) (West 2009) (“oral or written
complaint” must be “file[d]”); Wash. Rev. Code
§§90.64.030(3), (5) (2008) (“complaints have been filed . . .
as the result of either an oral or a written complaint”).
Regulations promulgated by various federal agencies
sometimes permit complaints to be filed orally. See, e.g.,
32 CFR §842.20 (2010) (“[f]iling a claim” may proceed
“orally or in writing”); 42 CFR §422.564(d)(1) (2009) (“file
a grievance . . . either orally or in writing”); §423.564(d)(1)
(same); §438.402(b)(3)(i) (“file a grievance either orally or
in writing”); §494.180(e) (“file an oral or written griev­
ance”); 49 CFR §1503.629(c) (2009) (“[f]iling of motions . . .
must be in writing or orally on the record” (italics omit­
ted)); 42 CFR §438.402(b)(3)(ii) (2009) (“file an appeal
either orally or in writing”).
And a review of contemporaneous judicial usage, cf.
Utah v. Evans, 536 U. S. 452, 475 (2002), shows that oral
filings were a known phenomenon when the Act was
passed. See, e.g., Reed Oil Co. v. Cain, 169 Ark. 309, 312,
275 S. W. 333, 334 (1925) (“appellee filed . . . an oral com­
plaint”); Tingler v. Lahti, 87 W. Va. 499, 503, 105 S. E.
810, 812 (1921) (“complaint subsequently filed, either oral
or written”); Ex parte Mosgrove, 47 Okla. Cr. 40, 287 P.
795 (1930) (only “complaint . . . filed against him” was
“oral complaint of the town marshal”); Indian Fred v.
State, 36 Ariz. 48, 52–53, 282 P. 930, 932 (1929) (“filed an
oral motion to quash”); Dunn v. State, 60 Okla. Cr. 201,
203, 63 P. 2d 772, 773 (1936) (“filed an oral demurrer”);
Morrison v. Lewis, 58 Ga. App. 677, 199 S. E. 782 (1938)
(“filed an oral motion” demurring); Brock v. Cullum Bros.,
263 S. W. 335 (Tex. Civ. App. 1924) (“filed an oral motion
to quash”); Fike v. Allen, 269 S. W. 179, 180 (Tex. Civ.

Opinion of the Court

App. 1925) (“filed oral pleadings”).
Filings may more often be made in writing. See, e.g.,
Ritter v. United States, 28 F. 2d 265, 267 (CA3 1928)
(finding words “file a claim for refund” to require a written
request in context of tax code). But we are interested in
the filing of “any complaint.” So even if the word “filed,”
considered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation
limited to writings, the phrase “any complaint” suggests a
broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.
See, e.g., Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 7). The upshot is that the three-word
phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive
question.
We can look further to other appearances of the word
“filed” in the Act. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 226
(1994) (examining “contextual indications” of the meaning
of a term). That word (or a variant) appears in numerous
other provisions. But its appearance elsewhere in the Act
does not resolve the linguistic question before us. Some of
those other provisions (1) involve filed material that,
unlike a complaint, is of a kind that is virtually always in
writing. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §203(l) (employers must
“have on file an unexpired certificate” (emphasis added));
§210(a) (Secretary must “file in the court the record of
the industry committee” (emphasis added)); ibid. (industry
committee must “file” its findings and recommendations).
Others (2) specifically require a writing, see, e.g.,
§214(c)(5)(A) (requiring employee’s “consent in writing” to
join collective action to be “filed” (emphasis added));
§216(b) (same). And the remainder (3) leave the oral/
written question unresolved—just as does the provision
before us. See, e.g., §210(b) (prohibiting a stay unless
movant “file[s] in court an undertaking” (emphasis
added)); §214(c)(5)(A) (employee “may file . . . a petition”
for review of a special wage rate (emphasis added)).

KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


Looking beyond the Act, we find other statutes that
contain antiretaliation provisions. Those statutes, how­
ever, use somewhat different language.
See, e.g.,
§158(a)(4) (protecting an employee who has “filed charges
or given testimony”); §623(d) (protecting those who
“opposed any [unlawful] practice” (emphasis added));
42 U. S. C. §§2000e–3(a), 12203(a) (same); 29 U. S. C.
§2615(a)(2) (similar). See also, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §2087(a)(1)
(2006 ed., Supp. III) (“provided . . . to the employer . . .
information relating to any violation” (emphasis added));
§2651(a) (similar); 30 U. S. C. §815(c)(1) (“filed or made a
complaint” (emphasis added)); 42 U. S. C. §5851(a)(1)(A)
(“notified his employer” (emphasis added)); 49 U. S. C.
§42121(a)(1) (“provided . . . information” (emphasis
added)); §60129(a)(1) (same). Some of this language is
broader than the phrase before us, but, given the fact that
the phrase before us lends itself linguistically to the
broader, “oral” interpretation, the use of broader language
elsewhere may mean (1) that Congress wanted to limit the
scope of the phrase before us to writings, or (2) that Con­
gress did not believe the different phraseology made a
significant difference in this respect. The language alone
does not tell us whether Congress, if intending to protect
orally expressed grievances elsewhere, did or did not
intend to leave those oral grievances unprotected here.
The bottom line is that the text, taken alone, cannot
provide a conclusive answer to our interpretive question.
The phrase “filed any complaint” might, or might not,
encompass oral complaints. We must look further.
B
1
Several functional considerations indicate that Congress
intended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well
as written, “complaint[s].” First, an interpretation that
limited the provision’s coverage to written complaints

9

Opinion of the Court

would undermine the Act’s basic objectives. The Act seeks
to prohibit “labor conditions detrimental to the mainte­
nance of the minimum standard of living necessary for
health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.” 29
U. S. C. §202(a). It does so in part by setting forth sub­
stantive wage, hour, and overtime standards. It relies for
enforcement of these standards, not upon “continuing
detailed federal supervision or inspection of payrolls,” but
upon “information and complaints received from employ­
ees seeking to vindicate rights claimed to have been de­
nied.” Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S.
288, 292 (1960). And its antiretaliation provision makes
this enforcement scheme effective by preventing “fear of
economic retaliation” from inducing workers “quietly to
accept substandard conditions.” Ibid.
Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement
scheme’s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act’s com­
plaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to
reduce their complaints to writing, particularly illiterate,
less educated, or overworked workers? President Franklin
Roosevelt pointed out at the time that these were the
workers most in need of the Act’s help. See Message to
Congress, May 24, 1937, H. R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong.,
1st Sess., 4 (seeking a bill to help the poorest of “those who
toil in factory”).
In the years prior to the passage of the Act, illiteracy
rates were particularly high among the poor. See E.
Gordon & E. Gordon, Literacy in America 273 (2003) (one­
quarter of World War I conscripts were illiterate); Dept. of
Commerce, Bureau of Census, Sixteenth Census of the
United States, 1940, Population: The Labor Force (Sample
Statistics): Occupational Characteristics 60 (1943) (20.8%
of manufacturing laborers in 1940 had less than five years
of schooling). Those rates remained high in certain indus­
tries for many years after the Act’s passage. In 1948, for
example, the National War Labor Board wrote:


10

KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


“In many plants where there is a high degree of illit­
eracy, the writing of grievances by employees works a
substantial hardship. In other plants where there is
considerable dirt and special clothes must be worn, it
is often not practicable to write up grievances during
work hours.” 1 The Termination Report of the Na­
tional War Labor Board, p. 122.
To limit the scope of the antiretaliation provision to the
filing of written complaints would also take needed flexi­
bility from those charged with the Act’s enforcement. It
could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines,
interviews, and other oral methods of receiving com­
plaints. And insofar as the antiretaliation provision cov­
ers complaints made to employers (a matter we need not
decide, see infra, at 14–15), it would discourage the use of
desirable informal workplace grievance procedures to
secure compliance with the Act. Cf. Burlington Industries,
Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 764 (1998) (reading Title VII
to encourage the development of effective grievance proce­
dures to deter misconduct); D. McPherson, C. Gates, & K.
Rogers, Resolving Grievances: A Practical Approach 38–40
(1983) (describing the significant benefits of unwritten
complaints).
Given the need for effective enforcement of the National
Labor Relations Act (NLRA), this Court has broadly inter­
preted the language of the NLRA’s antiretaliation provi­
sion—“filed charges or given testimony,” 29 U. S. C.
§158(a)(4)—as protecting workers who neither filed
charges nor were “called formally to testify” but simply
“participate[d] in a [National Labor Relations] Board
investigation.” NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123
(1972) (emphasis added). The similar enforcement needs
of this related statute argue for an interpretation of the
word “complaint” that would provide “broad rather than
narrow protection to the employee,” id., at 122 (and would

11

Opinion of the Court

do so here without pressing statutory language to its
limit). See also Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda
Local No. 123, 321 U. S. 590, 597 (1944) (the Act’s “reme­
dial and humanitarian . . . purpose” cautions against
“narrow, grudging” interpretations of its language).
Saint-Gobain replies that worker protection is not the
only relevant statutory objective. The Act also seeks to
establish an enforcement system that is fair to employers.
To do so, the employer must have fair notice that an em­
ployee is making a complaint that could subject the em­
ployer to a later claim of retaliation. If oral complaints
suffice, Saint-Gobain adds, employers too often will be left
in a state of uncertainty about whether an employee (par­
ticularly an employee who seems unusually angry at the
moment) is in fact making a complaint about an Act viola­
tion or just letting off steam.
We agree with Saint-Gobain that the statute requires
fair notice. Although the dictionary definitions, statutes,
regulations, and judicial opinions we considered, see su
pra, at 4–7, do not distinguish between writings and oral
statements, they do suggest that a “filing” is a serious
occasion, rather than a triviality. As such, the phrase
“filed any complaint” contemplates some degree of formal­
ity, certainly to the point where the recipient has been
given fair notice that a grievance has been lodged and
does, or should, reasonably understand the matter as part
of its business concerns.
Moreover, the statute prohibits employers from dis­
criminating against an employee “because such employee
has filed any complaint.” §215(a)(3) (emphasis added).
And it is difficult to see how an employer who does not (or
should not) know an employee has made a complaint could
discriminate because of that complaint. But we also be­
lieve that a fair notice requirement does not necessarily
mean that notice must be in writing.
At oral argument, the Government said that a complaint


12

KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


is “filed” when “a reasonable, objective person would have
understood the employee” to have “put the employer on
notice that [the] employee is asserting statutory rights
under the [Act].” Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26. We agree. To
fall within the scope of the antiretaliation provision, a
complaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a
reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both
content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by
the statute and a call for their protection. This standard
can be met, however, by oral complaints, as well as by
written ones.
2
Second, given Congress’ delegation of enforcement pow­
ers to federal administrative agencies, we also give a
degree of weight to their views about the meaning of this
enforcement language. See 29 U. S. C. §216(c) (vesting
enforcement power in Secretary of Labor); Reorganization
Plan No. 1 of 1978, 5 U. S. C. App. §1, p. 664 (transferring
to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
enforcement of this antiretaliation provision as part of its
Equal Pay Act enforcement responsibilities); Skidmore v.
Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944) (giving weight to a
persuasive articulation of views within an agency’s area of
expertise).
The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view
that the words “filed any complaint” cover oral, as well as
written, complaints. The Department of Labor articulated
that view in an enforcement action filed many years ago,
Goldberg v. Zenger, 43 CCH LC ¶31,155, pp. 40,985,
40,986 (D Utah 1961). It has subsequently reaffirmed
that view in briefs. See, e.g., Brief for Secretary of Labor
as Amicus Curiae Supporting Petition for Rehearing with
Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in Lambert v. Ackerley,
No. 96–36017 etc. (CA9), pp. 6–7. And more recently it
has acted in accordance with that view by creating a hot­

line to receive oral complaints, see Dept. of Labor, Compli­
ance Assistance By Law—The Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA), http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-flsa.htm
(as visited Mar. 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file) (directing participants who wish to “file a com­
plaint” to contact a local office “or call the Department’s
Toll-Free Wage and Hour Help Line at 1–866–4–US–
WAGE”).
The EEOC has set forth a similar view in its Compli­
ance Manual, Vol. 2, §8–II(B)(1), p. 8–3, and n. 12 (1998),
and in multiple briefs, see, e.g., Brief for EEOC as Amicus
Curiae in Support of Petition for Rehearing with Sugges­
tion for Rehearing En Banc in Lambert v. Ackerley, No.
96–36017 etc. (CA9), pp. 8–13; Brief for Appellee in EEOC
v. White & Son Enterprises, Inc., No. 88–7658 (CA11),
pp. 29–30.
These agency views are reasonable. They are consistent
with the Act. The length of time the agencies have held
them suggests that they reflect careful consideration, not
“post hoc rationalizatio[n].” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of
United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,
463 U. S. 29, 50 (1983). And they consequently add force
to our conclusion. Skidmore, supra, at 140; cf. United
States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229, 234–235 (2001)
(Court sometimes finds judicial deference intended even in
absence of rulemaking authority); Babbitt v. Sweet Home
Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 703–
704, and n. 18 (1995) (agency views, where the law coun­
sels deference, can clarify otherwise ambiguous statutory
provisions).

Finally, we note that Saint-Gobain invokes the “rule of
lenity” in support of its “written complaint” interpretation.
That rule applies primarily to the interpretation of crimi­
nal statutes. It leads us to favor a more lenient interpre­

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


tation of a criminal statute “when, after consulting tradi­
tional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an
ambiguous statute.” United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S.
10, 17 (1994). We agree with Saint-Gobain that those who
violate the antiretaliation provision before us are subject
to criminal sanction, 29 U. S. C. §216(a). And we have
said that the rule of lenity can apply when a statute with
criminal sanctions is applied in a noncriminal context.
See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11, n. 8 (2004). But
after engaging in traditional methods of statutory inter­
pretation, we cannot find that the statute remains suffi­
ciently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of
lenity here.

Alternatively, Saint-Gobain claims that it should prevail
because Kasten complained to a private employer, not to
the Government; and, in Saint-Gobain’s view, the antire­
taliation provision applies only to complaints filed with
the Government. Saint-Gobain advanced this claim in the
lower courts, which held to the contrary. 570 F. 3d, at
837–838; 619 F. Supp. 2d, at 613. But Saint-Gobain said
nothing about it in response to Kasten’s petition for certio­
rari. Indeed, it did not mention the claim in this Court
until it filed its brief on the merits.
We do not normally consider a separate legal question
not raised in the certiorari briefs. See this Court’s Rule
15.2; Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13
(1996). We see no reason to make an exception here.
Resolution of the Government/private employer question
is not a “ ‘ “predicate to an intelligent resolution” ’ ” of the
oral/written question that we granted certiorari to decide.
See ibid. (quoting Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38
(1996)). That is to say, we can decide the oral/written
question separately—on its own. And we have done so.
Thus, we state no view on the merits of Saint-Gobain’s

alternative claim. Cf. post, at 1–5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).

We conclude that the Seventh Circuit erred in determin­
ing that oral complaints cannot fall within the scope of the
phrase “filed any complaint” in the Act’s antiretaliation
provision. We leave it to the lower courts to decide
whether Kasten will be able to satisfy the Act’s notice
requirement. We vacate the Circuit’s judgment and re­
mand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
