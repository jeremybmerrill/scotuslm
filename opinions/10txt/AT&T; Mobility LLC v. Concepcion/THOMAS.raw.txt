AT&T MOBILITY LLC, PETITIONER v. VINCENT 

CONCEPCION ET UX. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 27, 2011] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.
Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) provides
that an arbitration provision “shall be valid, irrevocable,
and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or
in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2.
The question here is whether California’s Discover Bank
rule, see Discover Bank v. Superior Ct., 36 Cal. 4th 148,
113 P. 3d 1100 (2005), is a “groun[d] . . . for the revocation
of any contract.”
It would be absurd to suggest that §2 requires only that
a defense apply to “any contract.” If §2 means anything,
it is that courts cannot refuse to enforce arbitration agree
ments because of a state public policy against arbitration,
even if the policy nominally applies to “any contract.”
There must be some additional limit on the contract de
fenses permitted by §2. Cf. ante, at 17 (opinion of the
Court) (state law may not require procedures that are “not
arbitration as envisioned by the FAA” and “lac[k] its bene
fits”); post, at 5 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (state law may
require only procedures that are “consistent with the use
of arbitration”).
I write separately to explain how I would find that limit
in the FAA’s text. As I would read it, the FAA requires
that an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party
successfully challenges the formation of the arbitration

agreement, such as by proving fraud or duress. 9 U. S. C.
§§2, 4. Under this reading, I would reverse the Court of
Appeals because a district court cannot follow both the
FAA and the Discover Bank rule, which does not relate to
defects in the making of an agreement.
This reading of the text, however, has not been fully
developed by any party, cf. Brief for Petitioner 41, n. 12,
and could benefit from briefing and argument in an ap
propriate case. Moreover, I think that the Court’s test will
often lead to the same outcome as my textual interpreta
tion and that, when possible, it is important in interpret
ing statutes to give lower courts guidance from a majority
of the Court. See US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535
U. S. 391, 411 (2002) (O’Connor, J., concurring). Therefore,
although I adhere to my views on purposes-and-objectives
pre-emption, see Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, ___ (2009)
(opinion concurring in judgment), I reluctantly join the
Court’s opinion.
I
The FAA generally requires courts to enforce arbitration
agreements as written. Section 2 provides that “[a] writ
ten provision in . . . a contract . . . to settle by arbitration a
controversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . .
shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon
such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation
of any contract.” Significantly, the statute does not paral
lel the words “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable” by refer
encing the grounds as exist for the “invalidation, revoca
tion, or nonenforcement” of any contract. Nor does the
statute use a different word or phrase entirely that might
arguably encompass validity, revocability, and enforce
ability. The use of only “revocation” and the conspicuous
omission of “invalidation” and “nonenforcement” suggest
that the exception does not include all defenses applicable
to any contract but rather some subset of those defenses.

THOMAS, J., concurring

See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (“It is our
duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of
a statute” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Concededly, the difference between revocability, on the
one hand, and validity and enforceability, on the other, is
not obvious. The statute does not define the terms, and
their ordinary meanings arguably overlap. Indeed, this
Court and others have referred to the concepts of revoca
bility, validity, and enforceability interchangeably. But
this ambiguity alone cannot justify ignoring Congress’
clear decision in §2 to repeat only one of the three
concepts.
To clarify the meaning of §2, it would be natural to look
to other portions of the FAA. Statutory interpretation
focuses on “the language itself, the specific context in
which that language is used, and the broader context of
the statute as a whole.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519
U. S. 337, 341 (1997). “A provision that may seem am
biguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of
the statutory scheme . . . because only one of the permissi
ble meanings produces a substantive effect that is com
patible with the rest of the law.” United Sav. Assn. of Tex.
v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S.
365, 371 (1988).
Examining the broader statutory scheme, §4 can be read
to clarify the scope of §2’s exception to the enforcement of
arbitration agreements. When a party seeks to enforce an
arbitration agreement in federal court, §4 requires that
“upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for
arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in
issue,” the court must order arbitration “in accordance
with the terms of the agreement.”
Reading §§2 and 4 harmoniously, the “grounds . . . for
the revocation” preserved in §2 would mean grounds re
lated to the making of the agreement. This would require
enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate unless a party

THOMAS, J., concurring

successfully asserts a defense concerning the formation of
the agreement to arbitrate, such as fraud, duress, or mu
tual mistake. See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin
Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403–404 (1967) (interpreting §4 to
permit federal courts to adjudicate claims of “fraud in the
inducement of the arbitration clause itself” because such
claims “g[o] to the ‘making’ of the agreement to arbitrate”).
Contract defenses unrelated to the making of the agree
ment—such as public policy—could not be the basis for
declining to enforce an arbitration clause.*
——————
* The interpretation I suggest would be consistent with our prece
dent. Contract formation is based on the consent of the parties, and we
have emphasized that “[a]rbitration under the Act is a matter of con
sent.” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989).
The statement in Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483 (1987), suggesting
that §2 preserves all state-law defenses that “arose to govern issues
concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts
generally,” id., at 493, n. 9, is dicta. This statement is found in a
footnote concerning a claim that the Court “decline[d] to address.” Id.,
at 392, n. 9. Similarly, to the extent that statements in Rent-A-Center,
West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ___, ___ n. 1 (2010) (slip op. at ___, n. 1),
can be read to suggest anything about the scope of state-law defenses
under §2, those statements are dicta, as well. This Court has never
addressed the question whether the state-law “grounds” referred to in
§2 are narrower than those applicable to any contract.
Moreover, every specific contract defense that the Court has ac
knowledged is applicable under §2 relates to contract formation. In
Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996), this
Court said that fraud, duress, and unconscionability “may be applied to
invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening §2.” All three
defenses historically concern the making of an agreement. See Morgan
Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty.,
554 U. S. 527, 547 (2008) (describing fraud and duress as “traditional
grounds for the abrogation of [a] contract” that speak to “unfair dealing
at the contract formation stage”); Hume v. United States, 132 U. S. 406,
411, 414 (1889) (describing an unconscionable contract as one “such as
no man in his senses and not under delusion would make” and suggest
ing that there may be “contracts so extortionate and unconscionable on
their face as to raise the presumption of fraud in their inception”
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

Under this reading, the question here would be whether
California’s Discover Bank rule relates to the making of an
agreement. I think it does not.
In Discover Bank, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P. 3d 1100, the
California Supreme Court held that “class action waivers
are, under certain circumstances, unconscionable as unlaw
fully exculpatory.” Id., at 65, 113 P. 3d, at 1112; see
also id., at 161, 113 P. 3d, at 1108 (“[C]lass action waivers
[may be] substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they
may operate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses
that are contrary to public policy”). The court concluded
that where a class-action waiver is found in an arbitration
agreement in certain consumer contracts of adhesion, such
waivers “should not be enforced.” Id., at 163, 113 P. 3d, at
1110. In practice, the court explained, such agreements
“operate to insulate a party from liability that otherwise
would be imposed under California law.” Id., at 161, 113
P. 3d, at 1108, 1109. The court did not conclude that a
customer would sign such an agreement only if under the
influence of fraud, duress, or delusion.
The court’s analysis and conclusion that the arbitration
agreement was exculpatory reveals that the Discover Bank
rule does not concern the making of the arbitration
agreement. Exculpatory contracts are a paradigmatic ex
ample of contracts that will not be enforced because of
public policy. 15 G. Giesel, Corbin on Contracts §§85.1,
85.17, 85.18 (rev. ed. 2003). Indeed, the court explained
that it would not enforce the agreements because they are
“ ‘against the policy of the law.’ ” 36 Cal. 4th, at 161, 113
P. 3d, at 1108 (quoting Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §1668); see
also 36 Cal. 4th, at 166, 113 P. 3d, at 1112 (“Agreements
to arbitrate may not be used to harbor terms, conditions
and practices that undermine public policy” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Refusal to enforce a contract
for public-policy reasons does not concern whether the

THOMAS, J., concurring

contract was properly made.
Accordingly, the Discover Bank rule is not a “groun[d]
. . . for the revocation of any contract” as I would read §2 of
the FAA in light of §4. Under this reading, the FAA dic
tates that the arbitration agreement here be enforced and
the Discover Bank rule is pre-empted.
