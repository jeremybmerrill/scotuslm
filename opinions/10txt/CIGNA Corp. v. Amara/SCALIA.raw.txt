CIGNA CORPORATION, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

JANICE C. AMARA, ET AL., INDIVIDUALLY

AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS

SIMILARLY SITUATED

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[May 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that §502(a)(1)(B) of the Em
ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),
29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), does not authorize relief for
misrepresentations in a summary plan description (SPD).
I do not join the Court’s opinion because I see no need and
no justification for saying anything more than that.
Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA states that a plan partici
pant or beneficiary may bring a civil action “to recover
benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce
his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his
rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.”
ERISA defines the word “plan” as “an employee welfare
benefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or a plan
which is both,” 29 U. S. C. §1002(3), and it requires that
a “plan” “be established and maintained pursuant to a
written instrument,” §1102(a)(1). An SPD, in contrast, is
a disclosure meant “to reasonably apprise [plan] partici
pants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations
under the plan.” §1022(a). It would be peculiar for a doc
ument meant to “apprise” participants of their rights
“under the plan” to be itself part of the “plan.” Any doubt

that it is not is eliminated by ERISA’s repeated differen
tiation of SPDs from the “written instruments” that con
stitute a plan, see, e.g., §§1029(c), 1024(b)(2), and ERISA’s
assignment to different entities of responsibility for draft
ing and amending SPDs on the one hand and plans on the
other, see §§1002(1), (2)(A); 1021(a) (2006 ed. and Supp.
III), 1024(b)(1); Beck v. PACE Int’l Union, 551 U. S. 96,
101 (2007). An SPD, moreover, would not fulfill its pur
pose of providing an easily accessible summary of the plan
if it were an authoritative part of the plan itself; the minor
omissions appropriate for a summary would risk revising
the plan.
Nothing else needs to be said to dispose of this case.
The District Court based the relief it awarded upon
ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), and that provision alone. It thought
that the “benefits” due “under the terms of the plan,” 29
U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), could derive from an SPD, either
because the SPD is part of the plan or because it is capable
of somehow modifying the plan. Under either justifica
tion, that conclusion is wrong. An SPD is separate from a
plan, and cannot amend a plan unless the plan so pro
vides. See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514
U. S. 73, 79, 85 (1995). I would go no further.
The Court, however, ventures on to address a different
question: whether respondents may recover under
§502(a)(3) of ERISA, which allows plan participants “to
obtain other appropriate equitable relief.” 29 U. S. C.
§1132(a)(3). The District Court expressly declined to
answer this question, stating that it “need not consider
whether any relief ordered under §502(a)(1)(B) would also
be available under §502(a)(3).” 559 F. Supp. 2d 192, 205
(Conn. 2008). It did note that §502(a)(3) might not help
respondents because that provision authorizes only relief
that was “ ‘typically available in equity.’ ” Ibid. (quoting
Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S.
204, 210 (2002)). But it described this question as “par

ticularly complicated,” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205, and said
that “in view of these knotty issues . . . the Court need not,
and does not, decide whether Plaintiffs could obtain relief
under §502(a)(3),” id., at 206.
It is assuredly not our normal practice to decide issues
that a lower court “need not, and does not, decide,” see
Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S.
157, 168–169 (2004), and this case presents no exceptional
reason to do so. To the contrary, it presents additional
reasons not to do so. Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508
U. S. 248 (1993), the case the District Court feared had
“severely curtailed the kinds of relief . . . available under
§502(a)(3),” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205, is cited exactly one
time in the parties’ briefs—by the CIGNA petitioners for
the utterly unrelated proposition that ERISA contains
a “ ‘carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme.’ ”
Brief for Petitioners 2. And there is no discussion whatso
ever of contract reformation or surcharge in the briefs of
the parties or even amici.1
The opinion for the Court states that the District Court
“strongly implied . . . that it would base its relief upon
[§502(a)(3)] were it not for (1) the fact that . . .
§502(a)(1)(B) . . . provided sufficient authority; and (2)
certain cases from this Court that narrowed the applica
tion of the term ‘appropriate equitable relief.’ ” Ante, at 16.
I find no such implication whatever—not even a weak one.
The District Court simply said that §502(a)(1)(B) provided
relief, and that under our cases §502(a)(3) might not do so.
While some Members of this Court have sought to divine
what legislators would have prescribed beyond what they
did prescribe, none to my knowledge has hitherto sought
to guess what district judges would have decided beyond

Amicus Curiae 30, n. 9. This cameo hardly qualifies as “discussion.”

what they did decide. And this, bear in mind, is not just a
guess as to what the District Court would have done if it
had known that its §502(a)(1)(B) relief was (as we today
hold) improper. The apparent answer to that is that it
would have denied relief, since it thought itself con
strained by “certain cases from this Court that [have]
narrowed [§502(a)(3)],” ante, at 16. No, the course the
Court guesses about is what the District Court would have
done if it had known both that §502(a)(1)(B) denies relief
and that §502(a)(3) provides it. This speculation upon
speculation hardly renders our discussion of §502(a)(3)
relevant to the decision below; it is utterly irrelevant.
Why the Court embarks on this peculiar path is beyond
me. It cannot even be explained by an eagerness to
demonstrate—by blatant dictum, if necessary—that, by
George, plan members misled by an SPD will be compen
sated. That they will normally be compensated is not in
doubt. As the opinion for the Court notes, ante, at 10, the
Second Circuit has interpreted ERISA as permitting the
invalidation of plan amendments not preceded by proper
notice, by reason of §204(h), which reads:
“An applicable pension plan may not be amended so
as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of
future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator
provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each
applicable individual . . . .” 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)(1).
This provision appears a natural fit to respondents’ claim,
which is not that CIGNA was prohibited from changing its
plan, but that CIGNA “failed to give them proper notice of
changes to their benefits.” Ante, at 1. It was inapplicable
here only because of the peculiar facts of this case and the
manner in which respondents chose to argue the case. 2
——————
2 The District Court found that §204(h) was unhelpful because
CIGNA had provided a valid notice of its decision to freeze benefits
under the old plan. If the new plan were invalidated because of a

Rather than attempting to read the District Judge’s
palm, I would simply remand. If the District Court dis
misses the case based on an incorrect reading of Mertens,
the Second Circuit can correct its error, and if the Second
Circuit does not do so this Court can grant certiorari. The
Court’s discussion of the relief available under §502(a)(3)
and Mertens is purely dicta, binding upon neither us nor
the District Court. The District Court need not read any
of it—and, indeed, if it takes our suggestions to heart, we
may very well reverse. Even if we adhere to our dicta that
contract reformation, estoppel, and surcharge are “ ‘dis
tinctively equitable’ remedies,” ante, at 18, it is far from
clear that they are available remedies in this case. The
opinion for the Court does not say (much less hold) that
they are and disclaims the implication, see ante, at 20.
Contract reformation is a standard remedy for altering
the terms of a writing that fails to express the agreement
of the parties “owing to the fraud of one of the parties and
mistake of the other.” 27 Williston on Contracts §69:55,
p. 160 (4th ed. 2010). But here, the Court would be em
ploying that doctrine to alter the terms of a contract in
response to a third party’s misrepresentations—not those
of a party to the contract. The SPD is not part of the
ERISA plan, and it was not written by the plan’s sponsor.
Although in this case CIGNA wrote both the plan and the
SPD, it did so in different capacities: as sponsor when
writing the plan, and as administrator when preparing the
SPD. ERISA “carefully distinguishes these roles,” ante, at
15; see also Beck, 551 U. S., at 101, and nothing the Court
cites suggests that they blend together when performed by
——————
defective §204(h) notice, the freeze would return to force, and respon
dents would be worse off. Respondents might (and likely should) have
argued that the notice for the freeze was itself void, but they “argued
none of these things,” and the District Court declined to “make these
arguments now on [their] behalf.” 559 F. Supp. 2d 192, 208 (Conn.
2008).

the same entity.
Admittedly, reformation might be available if the third
party was an agent of a contracting party and its misrep
resentations could thus be attributed to it under agency
law. But such a relationship has not been alleged and is
unlikely here. An ERISA administrator’s duty to provide
employees with an SPD arises by statute, 29 U. S. C.
§1024(b)(1), and not by reason of its relationship to the
sponsor. The administrator is a legally distinct entity.
Moreover, it is incoherent to think of the administrator as
agent and the sponsor as principal. Were this the case,
and were the administrator contracting with employees as
an agent of the sponsor in producing the SPD, then the
SPD would be part of the plan or would amend it—exactly
what the opinion for the Court rejects in Part II–A, ante,
at 13–15. And, in any event, SPDs may be furnished
months after an employee accepts a pension or benefit
plan. §1024(b)(1). Reformation is meant to effectuate
mutual intent at the time of contracting, and that intent is
not retroactively revised by subsequent misstatements.
Equitable estoppel and surcharge are perhaps better
suited to the facts of this case. CIGNA admits that re
spondents might be able to recover under §502(a)(3) pur
suant to an equitable estoppel theory, but it presumably
makes this concession only because questions of reliance
would be individualized and potentially inappropriate for
class-action treatment. Surcharge (which CIGNA does not
concede and which is not briefed) may encounter the same
problem. The amount for which an administrator may
be surcharged is, as the opinion for the Court notes, the
“actual harm” suffered by an employee, ante, at 22—that
is, harm stemming from reliance on the SPD or the lost
opportunity to contest or react to the switch. Cf. 3 A. Scott
& W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts §205, pp. 237–243 (4th ed.
1988). A remedy relating only to that harm would of course

be far different from what the District Court imposed.3
*
*

I agree with the Court that an SPD is not part of
an ERISA plan, and that, as a result, a plan participant
or beneficiary may not recover for misrepresentations in
an SPD under §502(a)(1)(B). Because this is the only
question properly presented for our review, and the only
question briefed and argued before us, I concur only in the
judgment.

——————
3 It is also not obvious that the relief sought in this case would consti
tute an equitable surcharge allowable under Mertens v. Hewitt Associ
ates, 508 U. S. 248 (1993). Cf. Knieriem v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 434
F. 3d 1058, 1063–1064 (CA8 2006). This question, however, like the
Court’s entire discussion of §502(a)(3), is best left for a case in which
the issue is raised and briefed.
