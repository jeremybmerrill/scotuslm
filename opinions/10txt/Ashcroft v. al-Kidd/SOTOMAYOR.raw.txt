JOHN D. ASHCROFT, PETITIONER v. ABDULLAH 

AL-KIDD 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[May 31, 2011] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing the Court of
Appeals because I agree with the majority’s conclusion
that Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law. I
cannot join the majority’s opinion, however, because it
unnecessarily “resolve[s] [a] difficult and novel questio[n]
of constitutional . . . interpretation that will ‘have no effect
on the outcome of the case.’ ” Ante, at 3 (quoting Pearson
v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 237 (2009)).
Whether the Fourth Amendment permits the pretextual
use of a material witness warrant for preventive detention
of an individual whom the Government has no intention
of using at trial is, in my view, a closer question than
the majority’s opinion suggests. Although the majority
is correct that a government official’s subjective intent is
generally “irrelevant in determining whether that officer’s
actions violate the Fourth Amendment,” Bond v. United
States, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000), none of our prior
cases recognizing that principle involved prolonged deten­
tion of an individual without probable cause to believe he
had committed any criminal offense. We have never
considered whether an official’s subjective intent matters
for purposes of the Fourth Amendment in that novel con­
text, and we need not and should not resolve that question

ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

in this case. All Members of the Court agree that, what­
ever the merits of the underlying Fourth Amendment
question, Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law.
The majority’s constitutional ruling is a narrow one pre­
mised on the existence of a “valid material-witness war­
ran[t],” ante, at 1—a premise that, at the very least, is
questionable in light of the allegations set forth in alKidd’s complaint. Based on those allegations, it is not at
all clear that it would have been “impracticable to secure
[al-Kidd’s] presence . . . by subpoena” or that his testimony
could not “adequately be secured by deposition.” 18
U. S. C. §3144; see First Amended Complaint in No. 05–
093–EJL, ¶55, App. 26 (“Mr. al-Kidd would have complied
with a subpoena had he been issued one or agreed to a
deposition”). Nor is it clear that the affidavit supporting
the warrant was sufficient; its failure to disclose that the
Government had no intention of using al-Kidd as a wit­
ness at trial may very well have rendered the affidavit
deliberately false and misleading. Cf. Franks v. Delaware,
438 U. S. 154, 155–156 (1978). The majority assumes
away these factual difficulties, but in my view, they point
to the artificiality of the way the Fourth Amendment
question has been presented to this Court and provide
further reason to avoid rendering an unnecessary holding
on the constitutional question.
I also join Part I of JUSTICE KENNEDY’s concurring
opinion. As that opinion makes clear, this case does not
present an occasion to address the proper scope of the
material witness statute or its constitutionality as applied
in this case. Indeed, nothing in the majority’s opinion
today should be read as placing this Court’s imprimatur
on the actions taken by the Government against al-Kidd.
Ante, at 1 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“The Court’s holding
is limited to the arguments presented by the parties and
leaves unresolved whether the Government’s use of the
Material Witness Statute in this case was lawful”).
