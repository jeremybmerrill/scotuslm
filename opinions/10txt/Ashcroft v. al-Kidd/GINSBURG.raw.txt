JOHN D. ASHCROFT, PETITIONER v. ABDULLAH 

AL-KIDD 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[May 31, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER and
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, concurring in the judgment.
Is a former U. S. Attorney General subject to a suit for
damages on a claim that he instructed subordinates to
use the Material Witness Statute, 18 U. S. C. §3144, as a
pretext to detain terrorist suspects preventively? Given
Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806 (1996), I agree with
the Court that no “clearly established law” renders
Ashcroft answerable in damages for the abuse of authority
al-Kidd charged. Ante, at 12. But I join JUSTICE
SOTOMAYOR in objecting to the Court’s disposition of alKidd’s Fourth Amendment claim on the merits; as she
observes, post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), that
claim involves novel and trying questions that will “have
no effect on the outcome of th[is] case.” Pearson v. Calla
han, 555 U. S. 223, 236–237 (2009).
In addressing al-Kidd’s Fourth Amendment claim
against Ashcroft, the Court assumes at the outset the
existence of a validly obtained material witness warrant.
Ante, at 1, 12. That characterization is puzzling. See post,
at 2 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).1 Is a warrant “validly

1 Nowhere in al-Kidd’s complaint is there any concession that the
warrant gained by the FBI agents was validly obtained. But cf. ante, at
8, n. 3 (majority opinion).

obtained” when the affidavit on which it is based fails to
inform the issuing Magistrate Judge that “the Govern
ment has no intention of using [al-Kidd as a witness] at
[another’s] trial,” post, at 1, and does not disclose that alKidd had cooperated with FBI agents each of the several
times they had asked to interview him, App. 26?
Casting further doubt on the assumption that the war
rant was validly obtained, the Magistrate Judge was not
told that al-Kidd’s parents, wife, and children were all
citizens and residents of the United States. In addition,
the affidavit misrepresented that al-Kidd was about to
take a one-way flight to Saudi Arabia, with a first-class
ticket costing approximately $5,000; in fact, al-Kidd had a
round-trip, coach-class ticket that cost $1,700.2 Given
these omissions and misrepresentations, there is strong
cause to question the Court’s opening assumption—a valid
material-witness warrant—and equally strong reason to
conclude that a merits determination was neither neces
sary nor proper.3
——————
2 Judicial officers asked to issue material witness warrants must
determine whether the affidavit supporting the application shows that
“the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding” and
that “it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person
by subpoena.” 18 U. S. C. §3144. Even if these conditions are met,
issuance of the warrant is discretionary. Ibid. (“judicial officer may
order the arrest of the person” (emphasis added)). Al-Kidd’s experience
illustrates the importance of vigilant exercise of this checking role by
the judicial officer to whom the warrant application is presented.
The affidavit used to secure al-Kidd’s detention was spare; it did not
state with particularity the information al-Kidd purportedly possessed,
nor did it specify how al-Kidd’s knowledge would be material to Sami
Omar al-Hussayen’s prosecution. As to impracticability, the affidavit
contained only this unelaborated statement: “It is believed that if AlKidd travels to Saudi Arabia, the United States Government will be
unable to secure his presence at trial via subpoena.” App. 64. Had the
Magistrate Judge insisted on more concrete showings of materiality
and impracticability, al-Kidd might have been spared the entire ordeal.

Kidd’s arrest was “based on individualized suspicion.” Ante, at 6, 8.
The word “suspicion,” however, ordinarily indicates that the person
suspected has engaged in wrongdoing. See Black’s Law Dictionary
1585 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “reasonable suspicion” to mean “[a] par
ticularized and objective basis, supported by specific and articulable
facts, for suspecting a person of criminal activity”). Material witness
status does not “involv[e] suspicion, or lack of suspicion,” of the individ
ual so identified. See Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U. S. 419, 424–425 (2004).
This Court’s decisions, until today, have uniformly used the term
“individualized suspicion” to mean “individualized suspicion of wrong
doing.” See Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, 37 (2000) (emphasis
added); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U. S. 305, 313 (1997) (same). See also,
e.g., Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 405 (2006) (referring to
“programmatic searches conducted without individualized suspicion—
such as checkpoints to combat drunk driving or drug trafficking”);
Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v.
Earls, 536 U. S. 822, 830 (2002) (“finding of individualized suspicion
may not be necessary when a school conducts drug testing”); Whren v.
United States, 517 U. S. 806, 817–818 (1996) (observed traffic violations
give rise to individualized suspicion); Michigan Dept. of State Police v.
Sitz, 496 U. S. 444, 451 (1990) (“Detention of particular motorists for
more extensive field sobriety testing may require satisfaction of an
individualized suspicion standard.”); Maryland v. Buie, 494 U. S. 325,
334–335, n. 2 (1990) (“Terry [v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968)] requires
reasonable, individualized suspicion before a frisk for weapons can be
conducted.”); Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 668
(1989) (“[I]n certain limited circumstances, the Government’s need to
discover . . . latent or hidden conditions, or to prevent their develop
ment, is sufficiently compelling to justify [search that intrudes] on
privacy . . . without any measure of individualized suspicion.”);
O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 726 (1987) (“petitioners had an
‘individualized suspicion’ of misconduct by Dr. Ortega”); United States
v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531, 538 (1985) (“Automotive
travelers may be stopped at fixed checkpoints near the border without
individualized suspicion . . .”); New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325,
342, n. 8 (1985) (“the search of T. L. O.’s purse was based upon
an individualized suspicion that she had violated school rules”); Michi
gan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 699, n. 9 (1981) (“police executing a
search warrant at a tavern could not . . . frisk a patron unless the
officers had individualized suspicion that the patron might be armed or
dangerous”).
The Court’s suggestion that the term “individualized suspicion” is
more commonly associated with “know[ing] something about [a] crime”

I also agree with JUSTICE KENNEDY that al-Kidd’s
treatment presents serious questions, unaddressed by the
Court, concerning “the [legality of] the Government’s use
of the Material Witness Statute in this case.” Ante, at 1
(concurring opinion). In addition to the questions JUSTICE
KENNEDY poses, and even if the initial material witness
classification had been proper, what even arguably legiti
mate basis could there be for the harsh custodial condi
tions to which al-Kidd was subjected: Ostensibly held only
to secure his testimony, al-Kidd was confined in three
different detention centers during his 16 days’ incarcera
tion, kept in high-security cells lit 24 hours a day, strip
searched and subjected to body-cavity inspections on more
than one occasion, and handcuffed and shackled about his
wrists, legs, and waist. App. 29–36; cf. Bell v. Wolfish, 441
U. S. 520, 539, n. 20 (1979) (“[L]oading a detainee with
chains and shackles and throwing him in a dungeon may
ensure his presence at trial and preserve the security of
the institution. But it would be difficult to conceive of a
situation where conditions so harsh, employed to achieve
objectives that could be accomplished in so many alterna
tive and less harsh methods, would not support a conclu
sion that the purpose for which they were imposed was to
punish.”).
However circumscribed al-Kidd’s Bivens claim against
Ashcroft may have been, see Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.
Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971); ante, at 8 (majority
opinion); ante, at 1 (KENNEDY, J., concurring), his remain

or “throwing . . . a surprise birthday party” than with criminal suspects,
ante, at 6, n. 2 (internal quotation marks omitted), is hardly credible.
The import of the term in legal argot is not genuinely debatable. When
the evening news reports that a murder “suspect” is on the loose, the
viewer is meant to be on the lookout for the perpetrator, not the wit
ness. Ashcroft understood the term as lawyers commonly do: He spoke
of detaining material witnesses as a means to “tak[e] suspected terror
ists off the street.” App. 41 (internal quotation marks omitted).

ing claims against the FBI agents who apprehended him
invite consideration of the issues JUSTICE KENNEDY iden
tified.4 His challenges to the brutal conditions of his
confinement have been settled. But his ordeal is a grim
reminder of the need to install safeguards against disre
spect for human dignity, constraints that will control
officialdom even in perilous times.

——————
4 The District Court determined that al-Kidd’s factual allegations
against FBI agents regarding their “misrepresentations and omissions
in the warrant application, if true, would negate the possibility of
qualified immunity [for those agents].” Memorandum Order in No.
cv:05–093 (D Idaho, Sept. 27, 2006), p. 18. The agents took no appeal
from this threshold denial of their qualified immunity plea.
