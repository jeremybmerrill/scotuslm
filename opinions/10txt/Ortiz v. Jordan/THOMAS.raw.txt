MICHELLE ORTIZ, PETITIONER v. PAULA JORDAN 

ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[January 24, 2011] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA and
JUSTICE KENNEDY join, concurring in the judgment.
We granted certiorari to decide the narrow question
whether a party may appeal an order denying summary
judgment after a full trial on the merits. I agree with the
Court that the answer is no. See ante, at 2–3. The Court
also reaches beyond that question, however, to address the
effect of Jordan and Bright’s failure to renew their motion
for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 50(b). I would limit our decision to the
question presented and remand for consideration of any
additional issues.
As the Court concludes, a party ordinarily cannot appeal
an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on
the merits. See ante, at 7–8. Most such orders are not
appealable at all, because they neither qualify as “final
decisions” capable of appeal under 28 U. S. C. §1291 nor
come within the narrow class of appealable interlocutory
orders under §1292(a)(1). And for those that are appeal
able,* the time for filing an appeal will usually have run by
the conclusion of the trial. See §2107(a) (providing that a

some orders denying summary judgment constitute “ ‘final decisions’ ”
under the collateral order doctrine).

notice of appeal in a civil case generally must be filed
“within thirty days” after entry of the relevant judgment
or order); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A).
This case is the ordinary case. Even if the order deny
ing summary judgment qualified under the collateral
order doctrine as an appealable “final decision” under
§1291, the time for filing that appeal expired long before
trial. Ante, at 7–8. The Court of Appeals therefore lacked
jurisdiction to review the order. I would reverse the
judgment on that ground alone and remand for further
proceedings.
The majority proceeds to consider the additional ques
tion whether Jordan and Bright’s failure to file a Rule
50(b) motion deprived the Court of Appeals of the
“ ‘powe[r]’ ” to review the sufficiency of the trial evidence.
See ante, at 3–4, 8 (quoting Unitherm Food Systems, Inc.
v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U. S. 394, 405 (2006)). The
Court does so because it concludes that the Court of
Appeals did not confine itself to the pretrial record and
instead reviewed the trial evidence. Ante, at 3.
I do not think it necessary to reach beyond the question
presented. It is clear from the opinion that the appeals
court reviewed the order denying summary judgment, and
that was error. The Court of Appeals explained that
“[a]lthough courts normally do not review the denial of a
summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits,”
this case “is an exception to th[at] rule.” 316 Fed. Appx.
449, 453 (CA6 2009). And to support that conclusion, the
court cited Goff v. Bise, 173 F. 3d 1068 (1999), in which
the Eighth Circuit reviewed an order denying summary
judgment. Finally, the Court of Appeals equated its re
view in this case to the review of an “interlocutory appea[l]
of qualified immunity,” which suggests that the court saw
itself as reviewing the interlocutory order denying sum
mary judgment. 316 Fed. Appx., at 453. Whether, in
erroneously reviewing the order denying summary judg

ment, the Court of Appeals considered the pretrial or full
trial record is beside the point.
I also think it unwise to reach the Rule 50 issue and the
questions that follow. Ortiz’s opening brief at the merits
stage focused on the question presented—whether the
Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review an order
denying summary judgment. It was not until Jordan and
Bright’s response brief in this Court, in which they argued
that they had not actually appealed the order denying
summary judgment, that the Rule 50 issues were ad
dressed at any length. This Court normally proceeds
more cautiously. Moreover, the Court of Appeals did not
address these issues at all, and we are ordinarily “a court
of final review and not first view.” Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110 (2001) (per curiam)
(internal quotation marks omitted). This seems a good
rule to follow in a case like this, which raises difficult and
far-reaching questions of civil procedure.
For these reasons, I would resolve only the question on
which we granted certiorari. I concur in the judgment.
