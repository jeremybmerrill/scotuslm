FRANTZ DEPIERRE, PETITIONER v. 

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[June 9, 2011]


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I concur in the Court’s judgment and in all of its opinion
except for Part III–A, which needlessly contradicts DePierre’s version of legislative history. Our holding today
is that the statutory term “cocaine base” refers to cocaine
base, rather than, as DePierre contends, one particular
type of cocaine base. This holding is in my view obvious,
and the Court does not disagree. It begins its discussion of
the legislative history by saying that DePierre’s position
“is not supported by the statutory text,” ante, at 13; and
ends the discussion by saying that “[i]n the absence of any
indication in the statutory text that Congress intended
only to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penal
ties, we cannot adopt DePierre’s narrow construction,”
ante, at 15.
Everything in-between could and should have been
omitted. Even if Dr. Byck had not lectured an undetermined number of likely somnolent Congressmen on “the
damaging effects of cocaine smoking on people in Peru,”
ante, at 14, we would still hold that the words “cocaine
base” mean cocaine base. And here, as always, the need
less detour into legislative history is not harmless. It con
veys the mistaken impression that legislative history
could modify the text of a criminal statute as clear as this.

DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

In fact, however, even a hypothetical House Report ex
pressing the Committee’s misunderstanding (or perhaps
just the Committee staff’s misunderstanding, who knows?)
that “cocaine base means crack cocaine” could not have
changed the outcome of today’s opinion.
