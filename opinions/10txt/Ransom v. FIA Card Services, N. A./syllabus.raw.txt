RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A., FKA MBNA 

AMERICA BANK, N. A. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 09–907.

Argued October 4, 2010—Decided January 11, 2011

Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code uses a statutory formula known as
the “means test” to help ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do
pay them. The means test instructs a debtor to determine his “dis
posable income”—the amount he has available to reimburse credi
tors—by deducting from his current monthly income “amounts rea
sonably necessary to be expended” for, inter alia, “maintenance or
support.” 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(2)(A)(i). For a debtor whose income is
above the median for his State, the means test indentifies which ex
penses qualify as “amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.” As
relevant here, the statute provides that “[t]he debtor’s monthly ex
penses shall be the debtor’s applicable monthly expense amounts
specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the
debtor’s actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other
Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for
the area in which the debtor resides.” §707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).
The Standards are tables listing standardized expense amounts for
basic necessities, which the IRS prepares to help calculate taxpayers’
ability to pay overdue taxes. The IRS also creates supplemental
guidelines known as the “Collection Financial Standards,” which de
scribe how to use the tables and what the amounts listed in them
mean. The Local Standards include an allowance for transportation
expenses, divided into vehicle “Ownership Costs” and vehicle “Oper
ating Costs.” The Collection Financial Standards explain that “Own
ership Costs” cover monthly loan or lease payments on an automo
bile; the expense amounts listed are based on nationwide car
financing data. The Collection Financial Standards further state
that a taxpayer who has no car payment may not claim an allowance

Syllabus
for ownership costs.
When petitioner Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief, he
listed respondent (FIA) as an unsecured creditor. Among his assets,
Ransom reported a car that he owns free of any debt. In determining
his monthly expenses, he nonetheless claimed a car-ownership deduc
tion of $471, the full amount specified in the “Ownership Costs” table,
as well as a separate $388 deduction for car-operating costs. Based
on his means-test calculations, Ransom proposed a bankruptcy plan
that would result in repayment of approximately 25% of his unse
cured debt. FIA objected on the ground that the plan did not direct
all of Ransom’s disposable income to unsecured creditors. FIA con
tended that Ransom should not have claimed the car-ownership al
lowance because he does not make loan or lease payments on his car.
Agreeing, the Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of the plan.
The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit
affirmed.

Held: A debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take
the car-ownership deduction. Pp. 6–18.
(a) This Court’s interpretation begins with the language of the
Bankruptcy Code, which provides that a debtor may claim only “ap
plicable” expense amounts listed in the Standards. Because the Code
does not define the key word “applicable,” the term carries its ordi
nary meaning of appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit. What makes
an expense amount “applicable” in this sense is most naturally un
derstood to be its correspondence to an individual debtor’s financial
circumstances. Congress established a filter, permitting a debtor to
claim a deduction from a National or Local Standard table only if
that deduction is appropriate for him. And a deduction is so appro
priate only if the debtor will incur the kind of expense covered by the
table during the life of the plan. Had Congress not wanted to sepa
rate debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not, it
could have omitted the term “applicable” altogether. Without that
word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each cate
gory listed in the Standards. Interpreting the statute to require a
threshold eligibility determination thus ensures that “applicable”
carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.
This reading draws support from the statute’s context and purpose.
The Code initially defines a debtor’s disposable income as his “cur
rent monthly income . . . less amounts reasonably necessary to be ex
pended.” §1325(b)(2). It then instructs that such reasonably neces
sary amounts “shall be determined in accordance with” the means
test. §1325(b)(3). Because Congress intended the means test to ap
proximate the debtor’s reasonable expenditures on essential items, a
debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incur

ring an expense in the relevant category. Further, the statute’s pur
pose—to ensure that debtors pay creditors the maximum they can af
ford—is best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with
the statutory text, to reflect a debtor’s ability to afford repayment.
Pp. 6–9.
(b) The vehicle-ownership category covers only the costs of a car
loan or lease. The expense amount listed ($471) is the average
monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide; it is not intended
to estimate other conceivable expenses associated with maintaining a
car. Maintenance expenses are the province of the separate “Operat
ing Costs” deduction. A person who owns a car free and clear is enti
tled to the “Operating Costs” deduction for all driving-related ex
penses. But such a person may not claim the “Ownership Costs”
deduction, because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car
loan or lease. The IRS’ Collection Financial Standards reinforce this
conclusion by making clear that individuals who have a car but make
no loan or lease payments may take only the operating-costs deduc
tion. Because Ransom owns his vehicle outright, he incurs no ex
pense in the “Ownership Costs” category, and that expense amount is
therefore not “applicable” to him. Pp. 9–11.
(c) Ransom’s arguments to the contrary—an alternative interpreta
tion of the key word “applicable,” an objection to the Court’s view of
the scope of the “Ownership Costs” category, and a criticism of the
policy implications of the Court’s approach—are unpersuasive.
Pp. 11–18.
577 F. 3d 1026, affirmed.
