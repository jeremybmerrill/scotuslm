Nos. 09–987 and 09–991 09–987 09–991 [April 4, 2011] JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring. Taxpayers ordinarily do not have standing to challenge federal or state expenditures that allegedly violate the (1968), we created a narrow exception for taxpayers rais ing Establishment Clause challenges to government ex penditures. Today’s majority and dissent struggle with whether respondents’ challenge to the Arizona tuition tax credit falls within that narrow exception. Under a princi pled reading of Article III, their struggles are unnecessary. Flast is an anomaly in our jurisprudence, irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal judicial power that our opinions have established. I would repudiate that misguided decision and enforce the Constitution. See
587, 618 (2007) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). I nevertheless join the Court’s opinion because it finds respondents lack standing by applying Flast rather than distinguishing it away on unprincipled grounds. Cf. Hein, supra, at 628–631.
