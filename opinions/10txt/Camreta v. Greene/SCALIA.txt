Nos. 09–1454 and 09–1478 09–1454 09–1478 [May 26, 2011] JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring. I join the Court’s opinion, which reasonably applies our precedents, strange though they may be. The alternative solution, as JUSTICE KENNEDY suggests, see post, at 13 (dissenting opinion), is to end the extraordinary practice of ruling upon constitutional questions unnecessarily when the defendant possesses qualified immunity. See Saucier us to adopt that approach, but I would be willing to con sider it in an appropriate case.
