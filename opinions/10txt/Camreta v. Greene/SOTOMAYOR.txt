SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment Nos. 09–1454 and 09–1478 09–1454 09–1478 [May 26, 2011] JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins, concurring in the judgment. I agree with the Court’s conclusion that this case is moot and that vacatur is the appropriate disposition; unlike the majority, however, I would go no further. As the exchange between the majority and JUSTICE KENNEDY demon strates, the question whether Camreta, as a prevailing party, can obtain our review of the Ninth Circuit’s consti tutional ruling is a difficult one. There is no warrant for reaching this question when there is clearly no longer a genuine case or controversy between the parties before us. 549 U. S. 422, 436 (2007) (noting that when a court can “readily” dispose of a case on one threshold ground, it should not reach another one that “is difficult to deter mine”). Indeed, it is improper for us to do so. Cf. U. S.
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment U. S. 18, 21 (1994) (“[A] federal court [may not] decide the merits of a legal question not posed in an Article III case or controversy”). The majority suggests that we must decide whether Camreta has a “right to appeal” in order to vacate the 340 U. S. 36 (1950). See ante, at 17, n. 10; see also ante, at 14, n. 8. But that view does not accord with our past 520 U. S. 43, 66, 70, 74–75 (1997) (ordering vacatur of a district court judgment without “resolv[ing]” our “grave doubts” about the petitioners’ appellate standing or decid ing whether the state Attorney General had a right to intervene as a party, and concluding only that he had statutory authority to “present argument” on appeal). Nor is it consistent with the principles underlying our moot 321 U. S. 671, 677 (1944) (“If a judgment has become moot, this Court . . . may make such disposition of the whole case as justice may require”). In accordance with our normal procedure for disposing of cases that have become moot through no fault of the party seeking review, see Bancorp, 513 U. S., at 22–23; Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 39–40, and n. 2, we should simply vacate the portion of the Ninth Circuit’s opinion Camreta sought to challenge and remand with instructions to dismiss, see, e.g., Indiana (2009) (per curiam).
