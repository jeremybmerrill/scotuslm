JAMES ALFORD, DEPUTY SHERIFF, DESCHUTES
COUNTY, OREGON, PETITIONER

v.
SARAH GREENE, PERSONALLY AND AS NEXT FRIEND OF
S. G., A MINOR, AND K. G., A MINOR
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[May 26, 2011]

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court’s conclusion that this case is moot
and that vacatur is the appropriate disposition; unlike the
majority, however, I would go no further. As the exchange
between the majority and JUSTICE KENNEDY demon
strates, the question whether Camreta, as a prevailing
party, can obtain our review of the Ninth Circuit’s consti
tutional ruling is a difficult one. There is no warrant for
reaching this question when there is clearly no longer a
genuine case or controversy between the parties before us.
See Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp.,
549 U. S. 422, 436 (2007) (noting that when a court can
“readily” dispose of a case on one threshold ground, it
should not reach another one that “is difficult to deter
mine”). Indeed, it is improper for us to do so. Cf. U. S.

CAMRETA v. GREENE
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513
U. S. 18, 21 (1994) (“[A] federal court [may not] decide the
merits of a legal question not posed in an Article III case
or controversy”).
The majority suggests that we must decide whether
Camreta has a “right to appeal” in order to vacate the
judgment below under United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.,
340 U. S. 36 (1950). See ante, at 17, n. 10; see also ante, at
14, n. 8. But that view does not accord with our past
practice. See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,
520 U. S. 43, 66, 70, 74–75 (1997) (ordering vacatur of
a district court judgment without “resolv[ing]” our “grave
doubts” about the petitioners’ appellate standing or decid
ing whether the state Attorney General had a right to
intervene as a party, and concluding only that he had
statutory authority to “present argument” on appeal). Nor
is it consistent with the principles underlying our moot
ness jurisprudence. See Walling v. James V. Reuter, Inc.,
321 U. S. 671, 677 (1944) (“If a judgment has become
moot, this Court . . . may make such disposition of the
whole case as justice may require”). In accordance with
our normal procedure for disposing of cases that have
become moot through no fault of the party seeking review,
see Bancorp, 513 U. S., at 22–23; Munsingwear, 340 U. S.,
at 39–40, and n. 2, we should simply vacate the portion of
the Ninth Circuit’s opinion Camreta sought to challenge
and remand with instructions to dismiss, see, e.g., Indiana
State Police Pension Trust v. Chrysler LLC, 556 U. S. ___
(2009) (per curiam).
