BOROUGH OF DURYEA, PENNSYLVANIA, ET AL., 

PETITIONERS v. CHARLES J. GUARNIERI 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[June 20, 2011]


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
For the reasons set forth by JUSTICE SCALIA, I seriously
doubt that lawsuits are “petitions” within the original
meaning of the Petition Clause of the First Amendment.
See post, at 2–3 (opinion concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part). Unreasoned statements to the
contrary in this Court’s prior decisions do not convince me
otherwise. Like the Court, however, I need not decide that
question today because “[t]he parties litigated the case on
the premise that Guarnieri’s grievances and lawsuit are
petitions protected by the Petition Clause.” Ante, at 6.
I also largely agree with JUSTICE SCALIA about the
framework for assessing public employees’ retaliation
claims under the Petition Clause. The “public concern”
doctrine of Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983), is
rooted in the First Amendment’s core protection of speech
on matters of public concern and has no relation to the
right to petition. See post, at 3–7. I would not import that
test into the Petition Clause. Rather, like JUSTICE SCALIA,
I would hold that “the Petition Clause protects public
employees against retaliation for filing petitions unless
those petitions are addressed to the government in its
capacity as the petitioners’ employer, rather than its ca
pacity as their sovereign.” Post, at 7.
But I would not end the analysis after determining that

a petition was addressed to the government as sovereign.
Recognizing “the realities of the employment context,” we
have held that “government has significantly greater lee
way in its dealings with citizen employees than it does
when it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at
large.” Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U. S.
591, 600, 599 (2008). Even where a public employee peti
tions the government in its capacity as sovereign, I would
balance the employee’s right to petition the sovereign
against the government’s interest as an employer in the effective and efficient management of its internal affairs.
Cf. Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 419 (2006) (noting
that employees “speaking as citizens about matters of pub
lic concern” still must “face . . . speech restrictions that
are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and
effectively”); United States v. Treasury Employees, 513
U. S. 454, 492 (1995) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (“In
conducting this balance [in the Speech Clause context],
we consistently have given substantial weight to govern
ment employers’ reasonable predictions of disruption, even
when the speech involved was on a matter of public con
cern”); O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 721–722 (1987)
(plurality opinion) (balancing the “the realities of the
workplace” against the “legitimate privacy interests of
public employees” to conclude that a warrant requirement
would “seriously disrupt the routine conduct of business”
and “be unduly burdensome”). In assessing a retaliation
claim under the Petition Clause, courts should be able to
conclude that, in instances when the petition is especially
disruptive, as some lawsuits might be, the balance of
interests may weigh in favor of the government employer.
Applying this framework, I would vacate the judgment
and remand. The Court of Appeals erred with respect to
both Guarnieri’s union grievance and his 42 U. S. C. §1983
suit. First, even assuming the grievance was a petition, it
was addressed to the local government in its capacity as

Guarnieri’s employer. See post, at 8 (opinion of SCALIA,
J.). Second, Guarnieri addressed his §1983 suit to the
Federal Government in its capacity as sovereign, not to
the local government as his employer. See ibid. But the
Court of Appeals did not consider whether the local gov
ernment’s interest as an employer “in achieving its goals
as effectively and efficiently as possible” nevertheless
outweighs Guarnieri’s interest in petitioning the Federal
Government regarding his local employment. Engquist,
supra, at 598 (internal quotation marks omitted). I would
vacate and remand for the Court of Appeals to conduct
that analysis in the first instance.
