DONALD BULLCOMING, PETITIONER v. NEW 

MEXICO 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

NEW MEXICO

[June 23, 2011]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring in part.
I agree with the Court that the trial court erred by
admitting the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) report. I
write separately first to highlight why I view the report at
issue to be testimonial—specifically because its “primary
purpose” is evidentiary—and second to emphasize the
limited reach of the Court’s opinion.
I

A

Under our precedents, the New Mexico Supreme Court
was correct to hold that the certified BAC report in this
case is testimonial. 2010–NMSC–007, ¶18, 226 P. 3d 1, 8.
To determine if a statement is testimonial, we must
decide whether it has “a primary purpose of creating an
out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.” Michigan v.
Bryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11). When
the “primary purpose” of a statement is “not to create a
record for trial,” ibid., “the admissibility of [the] statement
is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not
the Confrontation Clause,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).
This is not the first time the Court has faced the ques­
tion of whether a scientific report is testimonial. As the
Court explains, ante, at 14–15, in Melendez-Diaz v. Mas
sachusetts, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), we held that “certificates

of analysis,” completed by employees of the State Labora­
tory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health, id., at ___ (slip op., at 2), were testimonial because
they were “incontrovertibly . . . ‘ “solemn declaration[s] or
affirmation[s] made for the purpose of establishing or
proving some fact,” ’ ” id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting
Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 51 (2004), in turn
quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the
English Language (1828)).
As we explained earlier this Term in Michigan v. Bry
ant, 562 U. S. ___ (2010), “[i]n making the primary pur­
pose determination, standard rules of hearsay . . . will be
relevant.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11–12).1 As applied to a
scientific report, Melendez-Diaz explained that pursuant
to Federal Rule of Evidence 803, “[d]ocuments kept in the
regular course of business may ordinarily be admitted at
trial despite their hearsay status,” except “if the regularly
conducted business activity is the production of evidence
for use at trial.” 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15–16)
(citing Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6)). In that circumstance, the
hearsay rules bar admission of even business records. Re­
latedly, in the Confrontation Clause context, business
and public records “are generally admissible absent con­
frontation . . . because—having been created for the ad­
ministration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose
of establishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not
testimonial.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
18). We concluded, therefore, that because the purpose of
the certificates of analysis was use at trial, they were not
——————
1 Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, Bryant deemed reliabil­
ity, as reflected in the hearsay rules, to be “relevant,” 562 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 11–12), not “essential,” post, at 5 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).
The rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause, are designed
primarily to police reliability; the purpose of the Confrontation Clause
is to determine whether statements are testimonial and therefore re­
quire confrontation.

properly admissible as business or public records under
the hearsay rules, id., at ___ (slip op., at 15–16), nor were
they admissible under the Confrontation Clause, id., at
___ (slip op., at 18). The hearsay rule’s recognition of the
certificates’ evidentiary purpose thus confirmed our deci­
sion that the certificates were testimonial under the pri­
mary purpose analysis required by the Confrontation
Clause. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (explaining that
under Massachusetts law not just the purpose but the
“sole purpose of the affidavits was to provide” evidence).
Similarly, in this case, for the reasons the Court sets
forth the BAC report and Caylor’s certification on it
clearly have a “primary purpose of creating an out-of-court
substitute for trial testimony.” Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 11). The Court also explains why the BAC
report is not materially distinguishable from the certifi­
cates we held testimonial in Melendez-Diaz. See 557 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 2, 4–5). 2
The formality inherent in the certification further sug­
gests its evidentiary purpose. Although “[f]ormality is not
the sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry,” a
statement’s formality or informality can shed light on
whether a particular statement has a primary purpose
of use at trial. Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). 3
——————
2 This is not to say, however, that every person noted on the BAC
report must testify. As we explained in Melendez-Diaz, it is not the
case “that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the
chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing
device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution’s case . . . . It
is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are
so crucial as to require evidence . . . .” 557 U. S., at ___, n. 1 (slip op.,
at 5, n. 1).
3 By looking to the formality of a statement, we do not “trea[t] the
reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it.” Post, at 5 (KENNEDY, J.,
dissenting). Although in some instances formality could signal reliabil­
ity, the dissent’s argument fails to appreciate that, under our Confron­
tation Clause precedents, formality is primarily an indicator of testi­

I agree with the Court’s assessment that the certificate at
issue here is a formal statement, despite the absence of
notarization. Ante, at 14–15; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52
(“[T]he absence of [an] oath [is] not dispositive”). The
formality derives from the fact that the analyst is asked to
sign his name and “certify” to both the result and the
statements on the form. A “certification” requires one
“[t]o attest” that the accompanying statements are true.
Black’s Law Dictionary 258 (9th ed. 2009) (definition of
“certify”); see also id., at 147 (defining “attest” as “[t]o bear
witness; testify,” or “[t]o affirm to be true or genuine; to
authenticate by signing as a witness”).
In sum, I am compelled to conclude that the report has a
“primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for
trial testimony,” Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11),
which renders it testimonial.
B
After holding that the report was testimonial, the New
Mexico Supreme Court nevertheless held that its admis­
sion was permissible under the Confrontation Clause for
two reasons: because Caylor was a “mere scrivener,” and
because Razatos could be cross-examined on the workings
of the gas chromatograph and laboratory procedures. 226
P. 3d, at 8–10. The Court convincingly explains why those
——————
monial purpose. Formality is not the sole indicator of the testimonial
nature of a statement because it is too easily evaded. See Davis v.
Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 838 (2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part). Nonetheless formality has
long been a hallmark of testimonial statements because formality
suggests that the statement is intended for use at trial. As we ex­
plained in Bryant, informality, on the other hand, “does not necessarily
indicate . . . lack of testimonial intent.” 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
19). The dissent itself recognizes the relevance of formality to the
testimonial inquiry when it notes the formality of the problematic
unconfronted statements in Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial. Post, at 7–8
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).

SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part

rationales are incorrect. Ante, at 9–13. Therefore, the
New Mexico court contravened our precedents in holding
that the report was admissible via Razatos’ testimony.
II
Although this case is materially indistinguishable from
the facts we considered in Melendez-Diaz, I highlight
some of the factual circumstances that this case does not
present.
First, this is not a case in which the State suggested an
alternate purpose, much less an alternate primary pur­
pose, for the BAC report. For example, the State has not
claimed that the report was necessary to provide Bullcom­
ing with medical treatment. See Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ ,
n. 9 (slip op., at 15, n. 9) (listing “Statements for Purposes
of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment” under Federal Rule of
Evidence 803(4) as an example of statements that are
“by their nature, made for a purpose other than use in a
prosecution”); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip
op., at 6, n. 2) (“[M]edical reports created for treatment
purposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision
today”); Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 376 (2008)
(“[S]tatements to physicians in the course of receiving
treatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay
rules”).
Second, this is not a case in which the person testifying
is a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal,
albeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.
Razatos conceded on cross-examination that he played no
role in producing the BAC report and did not observe any
portion of Curtis Caylor’s conduct of the testing. App. 58.
The court below also recognized Razatos’ total lack of
connection to the test at issue. 226 P. 3d, at 6. It would
be a different case if, for example, a supervisor who ob­
served an analyst conducting a test testified about the
results or a report about such results. We need not ad­

SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part

dress what degree of involvement is sufficient because
here Razatos had no involvement whatsoever in the rele­
vant test and report.
Third, this is not a case in which an expert witness was
asked for his independent opinion about underlying testi­
monial reports that were not themselves admitted into
evidence. See Fed. Rule Evid. 703 (explaining that facts or
data of a type upon which experts in the field would rea­
sonably rely in forming an opinion need not be admissible
in order for the expert’s opinion based on the facts and
data to be admitted). As the Court notes, ante, at 12, the
State does not assert that Razatos offered an independent,
expert opinion about Bullcoming’s blood alcohol concentra­
tion. Rather, the State explains, “[a]side from reading a
report that was introduced as an exhibit, Mr. Razatos
offered no opinion about Petitioner’s blood alcohol content
. . . .” Brief for Respondent 58, n. 15 (citation omitted).
Here the State offered the BAC report, including Caylor’s
testimonial statements, into evidence. We would face a
different question if asked to determine the constitutional­
ity of allowing an expert witness to discuss others’ testi­
monial statements if the testimonial statements were not
themselves admitted as evidence.
Finally, this is not a case in which the State introduced
only machine-generated results, such as a printout from a
gas chromatograph. The State here introduced Caylor’s
statements, which included his transcription of a blood
alcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chro­
matograph printout, along with other statements about
the procedures used in handling the blood sample. See
ante, at 10; App. 62 (“I certify that I followed the proce­
dures set out on the reverse of this report, and the state­
ments in this block are correct”). Thus, we do not decide
whether, as the New Mexico Supreme Court suggests, 226
P. 3d, at 10, a State could introduce (assuming an ade­
quate chain of custody foundation) raw data generated by

SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part

a machine in conjunction with the testimony of an expert
witness. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16, n. 5.
This case does not present, and thus the Court’s opinion
does not address, any of these factual scenarios.
*

As in Melendez-Diaz, the primary purpose of the BAC
report is clearly to serve as evidence. It is therefore tes­
timonial, and the trial court erred in allowing the State
to introduce it into evidence via Razatos’ testimony. I
respectfully concur.
