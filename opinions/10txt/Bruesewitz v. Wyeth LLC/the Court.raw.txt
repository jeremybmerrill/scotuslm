ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[February 22, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
We consider whether a preemption provision enacted in
the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986
(NCVIA)1 bars state-law design-defect claims against
vaccine manufacturers.
I

A

For the last 66 years, vaccines have been subject to the
same federal premarket approval process as prescription
drugs, and compensation for vaccine-related injuries has
been left largely to the States.2 Under that regime, the
elimination of communicable diseases through vaccination
became “one of the greatest achievements” of public health
in the 20th century.3 But in the 1970’s and 1980’s vac

cines became, one might say, victims of their own success.
They had been so effective in preventing infectious dis
eases that the public became much less alarmed at the
threat of those diseases,4 and much more concerned with
the risk of injury from the vaccines themselves.5
Much of the concern centered around vaccines against
diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), which were
blamed for children’s disabilities and developmental de
lays. This led to a massive increase in vaccine-related tort
litigation. Whereas between 1978 and 1981 only nine
product-liability suits were filed against DTP manufactur
ers, by the mid-1980’s the suits numbered more than 200
each year.6 This destabilized the DTP vaccine market,
causing two of the three domestic manufacturers to with
draw; and the remaining manufacturer, Lederle Laborato
ries, estimated that its potential tort liability exceeded its
annual sales by a factor of 200.7 Vaccine shortages arose
when Lederle had production problems in 1984.8
Despite the large number of suits, there were many
complaints that obtaining compensation for legitimate
vaccine-inflicted injuries was too costly and difficult.9 A

Opinion of the Court

significant number of parents were already declining
vaccination for their children,10 and concerns about com
pensation threatened to depress vaccination rates even
further.11 This was a source of concern to public health
officials, since vaccines are effective in preventing out
breaks of disease only if a large percentage of the popula
tion is vaccinated.12
To stabilize the vaccine market and facilitate compensa
tion, Congress enacted the NCVIA in 1986. The Act estab
lishes a no-fault compensation program “designed to work
faster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.”
Shalala v. Whitecotton, 514 U. S. 268, 269 (1995). A per
son injured by a vaccine, or his legal guardian, may file a
petition for compensation in the United States Court of
Federal Claims, naming the Secretary of Health and
Human Services as the respondent.13 A special master
then makes an informal adjudication of the petition within
(except for two limited exceptions) 240 days.14 The Court
of Federal Claims must review objections to the special
master’s decision and enter final judgment under a simi
larly tight statutory deadline.15 At that point, a claimant
has two options: to accept the court’s judgment and forgo a
traditional tort suit for damages, or to reject the judgment
and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.16
Fast, informal adjudication is made possible by the Act’s

under the Act; describes each vaccine’s compensable,

adverse side effects; and indicates how soon after vaccina
tion those side effects should first manifest themselves.17
Claimants who show that a listed injury first manifested
itself at the appropriate time are prima facie entitled to
compensation.18 No showing of causation is necessary; the
Secretary bears the burden of disproving causation.19 A
claimant may also recover for unlisted side effects, and for
listed side effects that occur at times other than those
specified in the Table, but for those the claimant must
prove causation.20 Unlike in tort suits, claimants under
the Act are not required to show that the administered
vaccine was defectively manufactured, labeled, or de
signed.
Successful claimants receive compensation for medical,
rehabilitation, counseling, special education, and voca
tional training expenses; diminished earning capacity;
pain and suffering; and $250,000 for vaccine-related
deaths.21 Attorney’s fees are provided, not only for suc
cessful cases, but even for unsuccessful claims that are not
frivolous.22 These awards are paid out of a fund created by
an excise tax on each vaccine dose.23
The quid pro quo for this, designed to stabilize the
vaccine market, was the provision of significant tort
liability protections for vaccine manufacturers. The Act
requires claimants to seek relief through the compensation
program before filing suit for more than $1,000.24 Manu

requirements (including but not limited to warning re
quirements) and have given the warning either to the
claimant or the claimant’s physician.25 They are immu
nized from liability for punitive damages absent failure to
comply with regulatory requirements, “fraud,” “intentional
and wrongful withholding of information,” or other “crimi
nal or illegal activity.”26 And most relevant to the present
case, the Act expressly eliminates liability for a vaccine’s
unavoidable, adverse side effects:
“No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac
tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury
or death associated with the administration of a vac
cine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death re
sulted from side effects that were unavoidable even
though the vaccine was properly prepared and was ac
companied by proper directions and warnings.”27

The vaccine at issue here is a DTP vaccine manufac
tured by Lederle Laboratories. It first received federal
approval in 1948 and received supplemental approvals in
1953 and 1970. Respondent Wyeth purchased Lederle in
1994 and stopped manufacturing the vaccine in 1998.
Hannah Bruesewitz was born on October 20, 1991. Her
pediatrician administered doses of the DTP vaccine ac

seizures.28 She suffered over 100 seizures during the next
month, and her doctors eventually diagnosed her with
“residual seizure disorder” and “developmental delay.”29
Hannah, now a teenager, is still diagnosed with both
conditions.
In April 1995, Hannah’s parents, Russell and Robalee
Bruesewitz, filed a vaccine injury petition in the United
States Court of Federal Claims, alleging that Hannah
suffered from on-Table residual seizure disorder and
encephalopathy injuries.30 A Special Master denied their
claims on various grounds, though they were awarded
$126,800 in attorney’s fees and costs. The Bruesewitzes
elected to reject the unfavorable judgment, and in October
2005 filed this lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court. Their
complaint alleged (as relevant here) that defective design
of Lederle’s DTP vaccine caused Hannah’s disabilities, and
that Lederle was subject to strict liability, and liability for
negligent design, under Pennsylvania common law.31
Wyeth removed the suit to the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which
granted Wyeth summary judgment on the strict-liability
and negligence design-defect claims, holding that the
Pennsylvania law providing those causes of action was
preempted by 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1).32 The United

Opinion of the Court

II 

A

We set forth again the statutory text at issue:
“No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac
tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury
or death associated with the administration of a vac
cine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death re
sulted from side effects that were unavoidable even
though the vaccine was properly prepared and was ac
companied by proper directions and warnings.”34
The “even though” clause clarifies the word that precedes
it. It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine
manufacturer must have taken for a side-effect to be con
sidered “unavoidable” under the statute. Provided that
there was proper manufacture and warning, any remain
ing side effects, including those resulting from design
defects, are deemed to have been unavoidable. State-law
design-defect claims are therefore preempted.
If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a
different design, the word “unavoidable” would do no
work. A side effect of a vaccine could always have been
avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not
containing the harmful element. The language of the
provision thus suggests that the design of the vaccine is a
given, not subject to question in the tort action. What the
statute establishes as a complete defense must be un
avoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) with
respect to the particular design. Which plainly implies
that the design itself is not open to question.35

dissent advocates for another possibility: “[A] side effect is
‘unavoidable’ . . . where there is no feasible alternative design that
would eliminate the side effect of the vaccine without compromising its
cost and utility.” Post, at 15 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). The dissent
makes no effort to ground that position in the text of §300aa–22(b)(1).
35 The

BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
Opinion of the Court

A further textual indication leads to the same conclu
sion. Products-liability law establishes a classic and well
known triumvirate of grounds for liability: defective
manufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and
defective design.36 If all three were intended to be pre
served, it would be strange to mention specifically only
two, and leave the third to implication. It would have
been much easier (and much more natural) to provide that
manufacturers would be liable for “defective manufacture,
defective directions or warning, and defective design.” It
seems that the statute fails to mention design-defect
liability “by deliberate choice, not inadvertence.” Barn
hart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168 (2003). Ex
pressio unius, exclusio alterius.
B
The dissent’s principal textual argument is mistaken.
We agree with its premise that “ ‘side effects that were
unavoidable’ must refer to side effects caused by a vac
cine’s design.”37 We do not comprehend, however, the
second step of its reasoning, which is that the use of
the conditional term “if” in the introductory phrase “if the
injury or death resulted from side effects that were un
avoidable” “plainly implies that some side effects stem
ming from a vaccine’s design are ‘unavoidable,’ while
——————
We doubt that Congress would introduce such an amorphous test by
implication when it otherwise micromanages vaccine manufacturers.
See infra, at 13–14. We have no idea how much more expensive an
alternative design can be before it “compromis[es]” a vaccine’s cost or
how much efficacy an alternative design can sacrifice to improve safety.
Neither does the dissent. And neither will the judges who must rule on
motions to dismiss, motions for summary judgment, and motions for
judgment as a matter of law. Which means that the test would proba
bly have no real-world effect.

Opinion of the Court

others are avoidable.”38 That is not so. The “if ” clause
makes total sense whether the design to which “unavoid
able” refers is (as the dissent believes) any feasible design
(making the side effects of the design used for the vaccine
at issue avoidable), or (as we believe) the particular design
used for the vaccine at issue (making its side effects un
avoidable). Under the latter view, the condition estab
lished by the “if” clause is that the vaccine have been
properly labeled and manufactured; and under the former,
that it have been properly designed, labeled, and manufac
tured. Neither view renders the “if ” clause a nullity.
Which of the two variants must be preferred is addressed
by our textual analysis, and is in no way determined by
the “if ” clause.
Petitioners’ and the dissent’s textual argument also
rests upon the proposition that the word “unavoidable” in
§300aa–22(b)(1) is a term of art that incorporates com
ment k to Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A (1963–
1964).39 The Restatement generally holds a manufacturer
strictly liable for harm to person or property caused by
“any product in a defective condition unreasonably dan
gerous to the user.”40 Comment k exempts from this
strict-liability rule “unavoidably unsafe products.” An
unavoidably unsafe product is defined by a hodge-podge of
criteria and a few examples, such as the Pasteur rabies
vaccine and experimental pharmaceuticals. Despite this
lack of clarity, petitioners seize upon one phrase in the
comment k analysis, and assert that by 1986 a majority of
courts had made this a sine qua non requirement for an
“unavoidably unsafe product”: a case-specific showing that
the product was “quite incapable of being made safer for

[its] intended . . . use.”41
We have no need to consider the finer points of comment
k. Whatever consistent judicial gloss that comment may
have been given in 1986, there is no reason to believe that
§300aa–22(b)(1) was invoking it. The comment creates a
special category of “unavoidably unsafe products,” while
the statute refers to “side effects that were unavoidable.”
That the latter uses the adjective “unavoidable” and the
former the adverb “unavoidably” does not establish that
Congress had comment k in mind. “Unavoidable” is
hardly a rarely used word. Even the cases petitioners cite
as putting a definitive gloss on comment k use the precise
phrase “unavoidably unsafe product”;42 none attaches
special significance to the term “unavoidable” standing
alone.

Though it is not pertinent to our analysis, we point out that a large
number of courts disagreed with that reading of comment k, and took it
to say that manufacturers did not face strict liability for side effects of
properly manufactured prescription drugs that were accompanied by
adequate warnings. See, e.g., Brown v. Superior Court, 227 Cal. Rptr.

Opinion of the Court

not end there. The phrase “even though” in the clause
“even though the vaccine was properly prepared and
[labeled]” is meant to signal the unexpected: unavoidable
side effects persist despite best manufacturing and label
ing practices.43 But petitioners’ reading eliminates any
opposition between the “even though” clause—called a
concessive subordinate clause by grammarians—and the
word “unavoidable.”44 Their reading makes preemption
turn equally on unavoidability, proper preparation, and
proper labeling. Thus, the dissent twice refers to the
requirements of proper preparation and proper labeling as
“two additional prerequisites” for preemption independent
of unavoidability.45 The primary textual justification for
the dissent’s position depends on that independence.46
But linking independent ideas is the job of a coordinating
junction like “and,” not a subordinating junction like “even
though.”47
——————
43 The dissent’s assertion that we treat “even though” as a synonym
for “because” misses the subtle distinction between “because” and
“despite.” See post, at 17, n. 14. “Even though” is a close cousin of the
latter. See Webster’s New International Dictionary 709, 2631 (2d ed.
1957). The statement “the car accident was unavoidable despite his
quick reflexes” indicates that quick reflexes could not avoid the acci
dent, and leaves open two unstated possibilities: (1) that other, un
stated means of avoiding the accident besides quick reflexes existed,
but came up short as well; or (2) that quick reflexes were the only
possible way to avoid the accident. Our interpretation of §300aa–
22(b)(1) explains why we think Congress meant the latter in this
context. (Incidentally, the statement “the car accident was unavoidable
because of his quick reflexes” makes no sense.)

47 The dissent responds that these “additional prerequisites” act “in a

conjunctive interpretation of the present text than it is of all provisions
that set forth additional requirements—meaning that we could elimi

BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
Opinion of the Court

Petitioners and the dissent contend that the interpreta
tion we propose would render part of §300aa–22(b)(1)
superfluous: Congress could have more tersely and more
clearly preempted design-defect claims by barring liability
“if . . . the vaccine was properly prepared and was accom
panied by proper directions and warnings.” The interven
ing passage (“the injury or death resulted from side effects
that were unavoidable even though”) is unnecessary. True
enough. But the rule against giving a portion of text an
interpretation which renders it superfluous does not pre
scribe that a passage which could have been more terse
does not mean what it says. The rule applies only if ver
bosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offend
ing passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing
interpretation. That is not the case here.48 To be sure,
petitioners’ and the dissent’s interpretation gives inde
pendent meaning to the intervening passage (the supposed
meaning of comment k); but it does so only at the expense
of rendering the remainder of the provision superfluous.
Since a vaccine is not “quite incapable of being made safer
for [its] intended use” if manufacturing defects could have
been eliminated or better warnings provided, the entire
“even though” clause is a useless appendage.49 It would
suffice to say “if the injury or death resulted from side
effects that were unavoidable”—full stop.
——————
performed by “and.” No, we think “even though” has a distinctive
concessive, subordinating role to play.
48 Because the dissent has a superfluity problem of its own, its reli
ance on Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005), is mis
placed. See id., at 449 (adopting an interpretation that was “the only
one that makes sense of each phrase” in the relevant statute).
49 That is true regardless of whether §300aa–22(b)(1) incorporates
comment k. See Restatement §402A, Comment k, pp. 353, 354 (noting
that “unavoidably unsafe products” are exempt from strict liability
“with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,
and proper warning is given”).

Opinion of the Court

III
The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in
general reinforces what the text of §300aa–22(b)(1) sug
gests. A vaccine’s license spells out the manufacturing
method that must be followed and the directions and
warnings that must accompany the product.50 Manufac
turers ordinarily must obtain the Food and Drug Admini
stration’s (FDA) approval before modifying either.51 De
viations from the license thus provide objective evidence of
manufacturing defects or inadequate warnings. Further
objective evidence comes from the FDA’s regulations—
more than 90 of them52—that pervasively regulate the
manufacturing process, down to the requirements for
plumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing
facility.53 Material noncompliance with any one of them,
or with any other FDA regulation, could cost the manufac
turer its regulatory-compliance defense.54
Design defects, in contrast, do not merit a single men
tion in the NCVIA or the FDA’s regulations. Indeed, the
FDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria
it uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for
its intended use.55 And the decision is surely not an easy
one. Drug manufacturers often could trade a little less
efficacy for a little more safety, but the safest design is not
always the best one. Striking the right balance between
safety and efficacy is especially difficult with respect to
vaccines, which affect public as well as individual health.
Yet the Act, which in every other respect micromanages
manufacturers, is silent on how to evaluate competing
designs. Are manufacturers liable only for failing to em

ploy an alternative design that the FDA has approved for
distribution (an approval it takes years to obtain56)? Or
does it suffice that a vaccine design has been approved in
other countries? Or could there be liability for failure to
use a design that exists only in a lab? Neither the Act nor
the FDA regulations provide an answer, leaving the uni
verse of alternative designs to be limited only by an ex
pert’s imagination.
Jurors, of course, often decide similar questions with
little guidance, and we do not suggest that the absence
of guidance alone suggests preemption. But the lack of
guidance for design defects combined with the extensive guidance for the two grounds of liability specifically
mentioned in the Act strongly suggests that design defects
were not mentioned because they are not a basis for
liability.
The mandates contained in the Act lead to the same
conclusion. Design-defect torts, broadly speaking, have
two beneficial effects: (1) prompting the development of
improved designs, and (2) providing compensation for
inflicted injuries. The NCVIA provides other means for
achieving both effects. We have already discussed the
Act’s generous compensation scheme. And the Act pro
vides many means of improving vaccine design. It directs
the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote
“the development of childhood vaccines that result in
fewer and less serious adverse reactions.”57 It establishes
a National Vaccine Program, whose Director is “to achieve
optimal prevention of human infectious diseases . . . and to
achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions.”58
The Program is to set priorities for federal vaccine re
search, and to coordinate federal vaccine safety and effi

cacy testing.59 The Act requires vaccine manufacturers
and health-care providers to report adverse side effects,60
and provides for monitoring of vaccine safety through a
collaboration with eight managed-care organizations.61
And of course whenever the FDA concludes that a vaccine
is unsafe, it may revoke the license.62
These provisions for federal agency improvement of
vaccine design, and for federally prescribed compensation,
once again suggest that §300aa–22(b)(1)’s silence regard
ing design-defect liability was not inadvertent. It instead
reflects a sensible choice to leave complex epidemiological
judgments about vaccine design to the FDA and the Na
tional Vaccine Program rather than juries.63
And finally, the Act’s structural quid pro quo leads to
the same conclusion: The vaccine manufacturers fund
from their sales an informal, efficient compensation pro
gram for vaccine injuries;64 in exchange they avoid costly
tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury
verdict.65 But design-defect allegations are the most
speculative and difficult type of products liability claim to

63 The dissent quotes just part of this sentence, to make it appear that
we believe complex epidemiological judgments ought to be assigned in
that fashion. See post, at 26. We do not state our preference, but
merely note that it is Congress’s expressed preference—and in order to
preclude the argument that it is absurd to think Congress enacted such
a thing, we assert that the choice is reasonable and express some of the
reasons why. Leaving it to the jury may (or may not) be reasonable as
well; we express no view.

vaccine market is inelastic, see post, at 24, n. 22, sheds no light on
whether Congress regarded the tax as a quid pro quo, most Members of
Congress being neither professional economists nor law-and-economics
scholars.

litigate. Taxing vaccine manufacturers’ product to fund
the compensation program, while leaving their liability for
design defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax
manufacturers back into the market.
The dissent believes the Act’s mandates are irrelevant
because they do not spur innovation in precisely the same
way as state-law tort systems.66 That is a novel sugges
tion. Although we previously have expressed doubt that
Congress would quietly preempt product-liability claims
without providing a federal substitute, see Medtronic, Inc.
v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 486–488 (1996) (plurality opinion),
we have never suggested we would be skeptical of preemp
tion unless the congressional substitute operated like the
tort system. We decline to adopt that stance today. The
dissent’s belief that the FDA and the National Vaccine
Program cannot alone spur adequate vaccine innovation is
probably questionable, but surely beside the point.
IV
Since our interpretation of §300aa–22(b)(1) is the only
interpretation supported by the text and structure of the
NCVIA, even those of us who believe legislative history is
a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation have no need
to resort to it. In any case, the dissent’s contention that it
would contradict our conclusion is mistaken.
The dissent’s legislative history relies on the following
syllogism: A 1986 House Committee Report states that
§300aa–22(b)(1) “sets forth the principle contained in
Comment k of Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts
(Second);”67 in 1986 comment k was “commonly under
stood” to require a case-specific showing that “no feasible
alternative design” existed; Congress therefore must have
intended §300aa–22(b)(1) to require that showing.68 The

Opinion of the Court

syllogism ignores unhelpful statements in the Report and
relies upon a term of art that did not exist in 1986.
Immediately after the language quoted by the dissent,
the 1986 Report notes the difficulty a jury would have in
faithfully assessing whether a feasible alternative design
exists when an innocent “young child, often badly injured
or killed” is the plaintiff.69 Eliminating that concern is
why the Report’s authors “strongly believ[e] that Com
ment k is appropriate and necessary as the policy for civil
actions seeking damages in tort.”70 The dissent’s interpre
tation of §300aa–22(b)(1) and its version of “the principle
in Comment K” adopted by the 1986 Report leave that
concern unaddressed.
The dissent buries another unfavorable piece of legisla
tive history. Because the Report believes that §300aa–
22(b)(1) should incorporate “the principle in Comment K”
and because the Act provides a generous no-fault compen
sation scheme, the Report counsels injured parties who
cannot prove a manufacturing or labeling defect to “pursue
recompense in the compensation system, not the tort
system.”71 That counsel echoes our interpretation of
§300aa–22(b)(1).
Not to worry, the dissent retorts, a Committee Report by
a later Congress “authoritative[ly]” vindicates its interpre
tation.72 Post-enactment legislative history (a contradic
tion in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpre
tation. See Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 238

Report, at 26; see ibid. (“[E]ven if the defendant manufacturer

‘innocent’ manufacturer if the equally ‘innocent’ child has to bear the

held that the only authoritative source of statutory meaning is the text
that has passed through the Article I process. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v.

BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
Opinion of the Court

(1999); United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 281–
282 (1947). Real (pre-enactment) legislative history is
persuasive to some because it is thought to shed light on
what legislators understood an ambiguous statutory text
to mean when they voted to enact it into law. See Exxon
Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568
(2005). But post-enactment legislative history by defini
tion “could have had no effect on the congressional vote,”
District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 605 (2008).
It does not matter that §300aa–22(b)(1) did not take
effect until the later Congress passed the excise tax that
funds the compensation scheme,73 and that the supposedly
dispositive Committee Report is attached to that funding
legislation.74 Those who voted on the relevant statutory
language were not necessarily the same persons who
crafted the statements in the later Committee Report; or if
they were did not necessarily have the same views at that
earlier time; and no one voting at that earlier time could
possibly have been informed by those later statements.
Permitting the legislative history of subsequent funding
legislation to alter the meaning of a statute would set a
dangerous precedent. Many provisions of federal law
depend on appropriations or include sunset provisions;75
they cannot be made the device for unenacted statutory
revision.
That brings us to the second flaw in the dissent’s syllo
gism: Comment k did not have a “commonly understood
meaning”76 in the mid-1980’s. Some courts thought it
required a case-specific showing that a product was “un
avoidably unsafe”; many others thought it categorically
exempted certain types of products from strict liability.77

Opinion of the Court

When “all (or nearly all) of the” relevant judicial decisions
have given a term or concept a consistent judicial gloss, we
presume Congress intended the term or concept to have
that meaning when it incorporated it into a later-enacted
statute. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)
(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg
ment) (slip op., at 5). The consistent gloss represents
the public understanding of the term. We cannot make the
same assumption when widespread disagreement exists
among the lower courts. We must make do with giving the
term its most plausible meaning using the traditional
tools of statutory interpretation. That is what we have
done today.

For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the National
Childhood Vaccine Injury Act preempts all design-defect
claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plain
tiffs who seek compensation for injury or death caused by
vaccine side effects. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
