ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 09–479.

Argued October 4, 2010—Decided November 15, 2010*

Petitioners Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions,
were charged with drug and firearm offenses, including violation of
18 U. S. C. §924(c), which prohibits using, carrying, or possessing a
deadly weapon in connection with “any crime of violence or drug traf
ficking crime,” §924(c)(1). The minimum prison term for a §924(c) of
fense is five years, §924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to “any other term of
imprisonment imposed on the [offender],” §924(c)(1)(D)(ii). Abbott
was convicted on the §924(c) count, on two predicate drug-trafficking
counts, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He received a
15-year mandatory minimum sentence for his felon-in-possession con
viction and an additional five years for his §924(c) violation. Gould’s
predicate drug-trafficking crime carried a ten-year mandatory mini
mum sentence; he received an additional five years for his §924(c)
violation. On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged their §924(c) sen
tences, resting their objections on the “except” clause prefacing
§924(c)(1)(A). That clause provides for imposition of a minimum five
year term as a consecutive sentence “[e]xcept to the extent that a
greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [§924(c) itself] or
by any other provision of law.” Abbott urged that the “except” clause
was triggered by his 15-year felon-in-possession sentence; Gould said
the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking
crime. The Third Circuit affirmed Abbott’s sentence, concluding that
the “except” clause “refers only to other minimum sentences that may
be imposed” for §924(c) violations. Gould fared no better before the
Fifth Circuit.

ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus

Held: A defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum speci
fied for his conduct in §924(c), unless another provision of law di
rected to conduct proscribed by §924(c) imposes an even greater
mandatory minimum. Pp. 5–18.
(a) Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of
1968, but the “except” clause was not added until 1998. Under the
pre-1998 text, it is undisputed, separate counts of conviction did not
preempt §924(c) sentences, and Abbott and Gould would have been
correctly sentenced under §924(c). The question here is whether
Congress’ 1998 reformulation of §924(c) rendered their sentences ex
cessive. The 1998 alteration responded primarily to Bailey v. United
States, 516 U. S. 137, which held that §924(c)(1)’s ban on “use” of a
firearm did not reach “mere possession” of a weapon, id., at 144. In
addition to bringing possession within the statute’s compass, Con
gress increased the severity of §924(c) sentences by changing “once
mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences,” United
States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___, and by elevating the sentences
for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.
Congress also restructured the provision, “divid[ing] what was once a
lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs,” id., at ___,
and it added the “except” clause at issue. Pp. 5–8.
(b) The leading portion of the “except” clause now prefacing
§924(c)(1)(A) refers to a “greater minimum sentence . . . otherwise
provided by [§924(c) itself]”; the second segment of the clause refers
to a greater minimum provided outside §924(c) “by any other provi
sion of law.” To determine whether a greater minimum sentence is
“otherwise provided . . . by any other provision of law,” the key ques
tion is: otherwise provided for what? Most courts have answered: for
the conduct §924(c) proscribes, i.e., possessing a firearm in connection
with a predicate crime.
Abbott and Gould disagree. Gould would apply the “except” clause
whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater
minimum sentence. Abbott argues that the minimum sentence “oth
erwise provided” must be one imposed for the criminal transaction
that triggered §924(c) or, in the alternative, for a firearm offense in
volving the same firearm that triggered §924(c). These three inter
pretations share a common, but implausible, premise: that Congress
in 1998 adopted a less aggressive mode of applying §924(c), one that
significantly reduced the severity of the provision’s impact on defen
dants. The pre-1998 version of §924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence
to be imposed on top of the sentence received for the predicate crime
or any separate firearm conviction. It is unlikely that Congress
meant a prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed “An Act [t]o throttle
criminal use of guns,” to effect a departure so great from §924(c)’s

original insistence that sentencing judges impose additional punish
ment for §924(c) violations. Abbott’s and Gould’s readings would un
dercut that same bill’s primary objective: to expand §924(c)’s coverage
to reach firearm possession. Their readings would also result in sen
tencing anomalies Congress surely did not intend. Section 924(c), as
they construe it, would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct
that provision makes independently criminal. Stranger still, the
worst offenders would often secure shorter sentences than less grave
offenders, because the highest sentences on other counts of conviction
would be most likely to preempt §924(c) sentences. Abbott and Gould
respond that sentencing judges may take account of any anomalies
and order appropriate adjustments. While a judge exercising discre
tion under 18 U. S. C. §3553(a) would not be required to sentence a
more culpable defendant to a lesser term, this Court doubts that Con
gress had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before United
States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, held that district courts have discre
tion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines based on §3553(a).
Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress could have an
ticipated that the then-mandatory Guidelines would resolve dispari
ties by prescribing a firearm enhancement to the predicate sentence.
But Congress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when
it amended §924(c) to impose a penalty even when the predicate
crime itself prescribed a firearm enhancement. Between 1984 and
1998, Congress expanded the reach or increased the severity of
§924(c) four times, never suggesting that a Guidelines firearm en
hancement might suffice to accomplish §924(c)’s objective. Nor is
there any indication that Congress was contemplating the Guide
lines’ relationship to §924(c) when it added the “except” clause.
Pp. 8–14.
(c) The Government’s reading—that the “except” clause is triggered
only when another provision commands a longer term for conduct vio
lating §924(c)—makes far more sense. It gives effect to statutory
language commanding that all §924(c) offenders shall receive addi
tional punishment for their violation of that provision, a command re
iterated three times: First, the statute states that the §924(c)(1) pun
ishment “shall” be imposed “in addition to” the penalty for the
predicate offense, §924(c)(1)(A); second, §924(c) demands a discrete
punishment even if the predicate crime itself “provides for an en
hanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous
weapon or device,” ibid.; third, §924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibil
ity that a §924(c) sentence might “run concurrently with any other
term of imprisonment.” Interpreting the “except” clause to train on
conduct offending §924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.
The clause is a proviso, most naturally read to refer to the conduct

Syllabus
§924(c) proscribes. See United States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534–
535. There is strong contextual support for the view that the “except”
clause was intended simply to clarify §924(c). At the same time Con
gress added the clause, it made the rest of §924(c) more complex, di
viding its existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs, and
adding new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.
Congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges:
It added the “except” clause’s initial part, which covers greater mini
mums provided “by this subsection,” to instruct judges not to stack
ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the
same weapon. In referencing greater minimums provided by “any
other provision of law,” the second portion of the clause simply fur
nishes the same no-stacking instruction for cases in which §924(c)
and a different statute both punish conduct offending §924(c). Con
gress likely anticipated such cases when framing the “except” clause,
for the bill that reformulated §924(c)’s text also amended 18 U. S. C.
§3559(c) to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons con
victed of “firearms possession (as described in §924(c)).” This inter
pretation does not render the “except” clause’s second part effectively
meaningless. Though §3559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of
§924(c) itself, that the Government places within the “except” clause,
the “any other provision of law” portion installs a safety valve for ad
ditional sentences that Congress may codify outside §924(c) in the fu
ture. Neither United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, nor Republic of
Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, warrants a different conclusion. Pp. 14–
18.

No. 09–479, 574 F. 3d 203; No. 09–7073, 329 Fed. Appx. 569, affirmed.
GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other
Members joined, except KAGAN, J., who took no part in the considera
tion or decision of the cases.
