HENRY W. SKINNER, PETITIONER v. LYNN
SWITZER, DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE
31ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[March 7, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
We granted review in this case to decide a question
presented, but left unresolved, in District Attorney’s Office
for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 12–13): May a convicted state prisoner
seeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence assert that
claim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. §1983, or is
such a claim cognizable in federal court only when as­
serted in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28
U. S. C. §2254? The Courts of Appeals have returned
diverse responses. Compare McKithen v. Brown, 481 F. 3d
89, 99 (CA2 2007) (claim seeking DNA testing is cogniza­
ble under §1983); Savory v. Lyons, 469 F. 3d 667, 669 (CA7
2006) (same); Bradley v. Pryor, 305 F. 3d 1287, 1290–1291
(CA11 2002) (same), with Harvey v. Horan, 278 F. 3d 370,
375 (CA4 2002) (claim is not cognizable under §1983) and
Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339, 341 (CA5
2002) (per curiam) (same).
In Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005), we compre­
hensively surveyed this Court’s decisions on the respective

Opinion of the Court

provinces of §1983 civil rights actions and §2254 federal
habeas petitions. Habeas is the exclusive remedy, we
reaffirmed, for the prisoner who seeks “immediate or
speedier release” from confinement. Id., at 82. Where the
prisoner’s claim would not “necessarily spell speedier
release,” however, suit may be brought under §1983. Ibid.
Adhering to our opinion in Dotson, we hold that a postcon­
viction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a
§1983 action. Success in the suit gains for the prisoner
only access to the DNA evidence, which may prove excul­
patory, inculpatory, or inconclusive. In no event will a
judgment that simply orders DNA tests “necessarily
impl[y] the unlawfulness of the State’s custody.” Id., at
81. We note, however, that the Court’s decision in Os
borne severely limits the federal action a state prisoner
may bring for DNA testing. Osborne rejected the exten­
sion of substantive due process to this area, 557 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 19), and left slim room for the prisoner to
show that the governing state law denies him procedural
due process, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).
I
In 1995, a Texas jury convicted petitioner Henry Skin­
ner and sentenced him to death for murdering his live-in
girlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two sons. Busby was
bludgeoned and choked with an axe handle and her sons
were stabbed to death; the murders were committed in the
house Busby shared with Skinner.
Skinner never denied his presence in the house when
the killings occurred. He claimed, however, that he was
incapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine.
The potent alcohol and drug mix, Skinner maintained at
trial, rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal
murders charged against him. Skinner identified, as a
likely perpetrator, Busby’s uncle, Robert Donnell (now
deceased), an ex-convict with a history of physical and

Opinion of the Court

sexual abuse.1 On direct appeal, the Texas Court of Crimi­
nal Appeals (CCA) affirmed Skinner’s conviction and
sentence. Skinner v. State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 546 (1997).
The CCA’s opinion described the crime-scene evidence in
detail:
“As they approached the house . . . , the police noticed
a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the
front porch to the fence line. There was a blood smear
on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch.
Upon entering the residence, the police found Twila’s
dead body on the living room floor. . . . An ax handle
stained with blood and hair was leaning against the
couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag con­
taining a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains
on it was laying between the couch and the coffee
table.
“[One officer] proceeded to the bedroom where
[Busby’s two sons] usually slept in bunk beds. [The
officer] found [one] dead body laying face down on the
upper bunk, covered by a blood spotted blanket. . . . A
door leading out of the bedroom and into a utility
room yielded further evidence. [He] noticed a bloody
handprint located about 24 inches off the floor on the
frame of this door. He also noted a bloody handprint
on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen
to the utility room and a handprint on the knob of the
door exiting from the utility room into the backyard.
“[When] police arrested [Skinner] . . . [t]hey found
him standing in a closet wearing blood-stained socks

1 At trial, a defense witness testified that, on the evening of the kill­
ings, Busby had spurned Donnell’s “rude sexual advances.” Skinner v.
State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 535 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). A neighbor related
at a federal postconviction hearing that she observed Donnell, a day or
two after the murders, thoroughly cleaning the carpets and inside of his
pickup truck. See Skinner v. Quarterman, 528 F. 3d 336, 345 (CA5
2008).

and blood-stained blue jeans.” Id., at 536.
Investigators also retained vaginal swabs taken from
Busby.
In preparation for trial, “the State tested the blood on
[Skinner’s] clothing, blood and hair from a blanket that
partially covered one of the victims, and hairs on one
of the victim’s back and cheeks.” Skinner v. State, 122
S. W. 3d 808, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). The State also
tested fingerprint evidence. Some of this evidence—
including bloody palm prints in the room where one victim
was killed—implicated Skinner, but “fingerprints on a bag
containing one of the knives” did not. Ibid. Items left
untested included the knives found on the premises, the
axe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and addi­
tional hair samples. See ibid.2
In the decade following his conviction, Skinner unsuc­
cessfully sought state and federal postconviction relief.
See Skinner v. Quarterman, 576 F. 3d 214 (CA5 2009),
cert. denied, 559 U. S. ___ (2010). He also pursued infor­
mal efforts to gain access to untested biological evidence
the police had collected at the scene of the crime.3
In 2001, more than six years after Skinner’s conviction,
Texas enacted Article 64, a statute allowing prisoners to
gain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances.
——————
2 After Skinner’s conviction, the State performed DNA tests on cer­
tain additional materials, but Skinner took no part in the selection
of those materials or their testing. Skinner maintains that these
ex parte tests were inconclusive. See Complaint ¶19, App. 12 (this
“testing raised more questions than it answered”). But see Skinner v.
State, 122 S. W. 3d 808, 811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (some findings were
“inculpatory”).
3 Skinner’s trial counsel, although aware that biological evidence
remained untested, did not request further testing. Postconviction,
Skinner sought DNA testing of vaginal swabs and finger nail clippings
taken from Busby, blood and hairs on a jacket found next to Busby’s
body, and biological material on knives and a dish towel recovered at
the crime scene. Complaint ¶22, App. 14–15.

Opinion of the Court

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 64.01(a) (Vernon Supp.
2010). To obtain DNA testing under Article 64, a prisoner
must meet one of two threshold criteria. He may show
that, at trial, testing either was “not available” or was
“available, but not technologically capable of providing
probative results.” Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A). Alternatively, he
may show that the evidence was not previously tested
“through no fault” on his part, and that “the interests of
justice” require a postconviction order for testing. Art.
64.01(b)(1)(B). To grant a motion for postconviction test­
ing, a court must make further findings, prime among
them, the movant “would not have been convicted if excul­
patory results had been obtained through DNA testing,”
and “the [Article 64] request . . . [was] not made to unrea­
sonably delay the execution of sentence or administration
of justice.” Art. 64.03(a)(2).
Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court,
first in 2001 and again in 2007, for DNA testing of yet
untested biological evidence. See supra, at 4, n. 3. Both
motions were denied. Affirming the denial of Skinner’s
first motion, the CCA held that he had failed to demon­
strate a “reasonable probability . . . that he would not have
been . . . convicted if the DNA test results were exculpa­
tory.” Skinner v. State, 122 S. W. 3d, at 813.
Skinner’s second motion was bolstered by discovery he
had obtained in the interim.4 The CCA again affirmed the
denial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground
that Skinner failed to meet the “no fault” requirement.
See Skinner v. State, 293 S. W. 3d 196, 200 (2009).5 Dur­
——————
4 On the basis of discovery in a federal postconviction proceeding, an
expert retained by Skinner concluded that Skinner, Busby, and her two
sons could be excluded as sources of a hair collected from Busby’s right
hand after the killings. See Record 190. See also Complaint ¶27, App.
18.
5 The District Attorney, in response to Skinner’s second motion, in­
formed the Texas district court that “[t]o the best of the State’s infor­

ing postconviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial coun­
sel testified that he had not “ask[ed] for testing because he
was afraid the DNA would turn out to be [Skinner’s].” Id.,
at 202. That decision, the CCA concluded, constituted “a
reasonable trial strategy” that the court had no cause to
second-guess. Id., at 209.
Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunc­
tive relief under §1983, naming as defendant respondent
Lynn Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prose­
cuted Skinner and has custody of the evidence Skinner
would like to have DNA tested. Skinner’s federal-court
complaint alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth
Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for
the DNA testing he requested. Complaint ¶33, App. 20–
21. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the
complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can
be granted. App. 24–41. Under the governing Circuit
precedent, Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339,
the Magistrate Judge observed, postconviction requests for
DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not
under §1983. App. 39. Adopting the Magistrate Judge’s
recommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinner’s
suit. Id., at 44–45.
On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit affirmed, 363 Fed. Appx. 302 (2010) (per
curiam), reiterating that “an action by a prisoner for post­
conviction DNA testing is not cognizable under §1983 and
must instead be brought as a petition for writ of habeas
corpus,” id., at 303. On Skinner’s petition,6 we granted

mation, knowledge, and belief, the items sought to be tested are still
available for testing, the chain of custody is intact, and the items are in
a condition to be tested although the State has not sought expert
opinion in that regard.” Record 202. See also Complaint ¶29, App. 19.
6 The State of Texas scheduled Skinner’s execution for March 24,
2010. We granted Skinner’s application to stay his execution until
further action of this Court. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).

certiorari, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), and now reverse the Fifth
Circuit’s judgment.
II 

A

Because this case was resolved on a motion to dismiss
for failure to state a claim, the question below was “not
whether [Skinner] will ultimately prevail” on his proce­
dural due process claim, see Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S.
232, 236 (1974), but whether his complaint was sufficient
to cross the federal court’s threshold, see Swierkiewicz v.
Sorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 514 (2002). Skinner’s com­
plaint is not a model of the careful drafter’s art, but under
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need not
pin plaintiff’s claim for relief to a precise legal theory.
Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gener­
ally requires only a plausible “short and plain” statement
of the plaintiff’s claim, not an exposition of his legal argu­
ment. See 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice &
Procedure §1219, pp. 277–278 (3d ed. 2004 and Supp.
2010).
Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph
alleging that the State’s refusal “to release the biological
evidence for testing . . . has deprived [him] of his liberty
interests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of
his conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his
sentence . . . .” Complaint ¶33, App. 20–21. As earlier
recounted, see supra, at 5–6, Skinner had twice requested
and failed to obtain DNA testing under the only state-law
procedure then available to him. See Complaint ¶¶22–31,
App. 14–20.7 At oral argument in this Court, Skinner’s
counsel clarified the gist of Skinner’s due process claim:
He does not challenge the prosecutor’s conduct or the

terials he identified. See Complaint ¶31, App. 20.

decisions reached by the CCA in applying Article 64 to his
motions; instead, he challenges, as denying him proce­
dural due process, Texas’ postconviction DNA statute “as
construed” by the Texas courts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. See
also id., at 52 (Texas courts, Skinner’s counsel argued,
have “construed the statute to completely foreclose any
prisoner who could have sought DNA testing prior to
trial[,] but did not[,] from seeking testing” postconviction).8
The merits of Skinner’s federal-court complaint assail­
ing the Texas statute as authoritatively construed, and
particularly the vitality of his claim in light of Osborne,
see supra, at 2—unaddressed by the District Court or the
Fifth Circuit—are not ripe for review. We take up here
only the questions whether there is federal-court subject­
matter jurisdiction over Skinner’s complaint, and whether
the claim he presses is cognizable under §1983.
B
Respondent Switzer asserts that Skinner’s challenge is
“[j]urisdictionally [b]arred” by what has come to be known
as the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. Brief for Respondent 48–
49 (boldface deleted). In line with the courts below, we
conclude that Rooker-Feldman does not bar Skinner’s suit.
As we explained in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic
Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280 (2005), the RookerFeldman doctrine has been applied by this Court only
twice, i.e., only in the two cases from which the doctrine
takes its name: first, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263
U. S. 413 (1923), then 60 years later, District of Columbia

Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), who “attempt[ed] to sidestep
state process through . . . a federal lawsuit,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 17),
Skinner first resorted to state court, see supra, at 5–6. In this respect,
Skinner is better positioned to urge in federal court “the inadequacy of
the state-law procedures available to him in state postconviction relief.”

Opinion of the Court

Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462 (1983). Both
cases fit this pattern: The losing party in state court9 filed
suit in a U. S. District Court after the state proceedings
ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court
judgment and seeking federal-court review and rejection of
that judgment. Alleging federal-question jurisdiction, the
plaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman asked the District Court
to overturn the injurious state-court judgment. We held,
in both cases, that the District Courts lacked subject­
matter jurisdiction over such claims, for 28 U. S. C. §1257
“vests authority to review a state court’s judgment solely
in this Court.” See Exxon, 544 U. S., at 292.
We observed in Exxon that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine
had been construed by some federal courts “to extend far
beyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases.”
Id., at 283. Emphasizing “the narrow ground” occupied by
the doctrine, id., at 284, we clarified in Exxon that RookerFeldman “is confined to cases of the kind from which the
doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court
losers . . . inviting district court review and rejection of
[the state court’s] judgments.” Ibid.
Skinner’s litigation, in light of Exxon, encounters no
Rooker-Feldman shoal. “If a federal plaintiff ‘present[s]
[an] independent claim,’ ” it is not an impediment to the
exercise of federal jurisdiction that the “same or a related
question” was earlier aired between the parties in state
court. id., at 292–293 (quoting GASH Assocs. v. Rosemont,
995 F. 2d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); first alteration in original);
see In re Smith, 349 Fed. Appx. 12, 18 (CA6 2009) (Sutton,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (a defen­
dant’s federal challenge to the adequacy of state-law pro­
cedures for postconviction DNA testing is not within the

Columbia Court of Appeals, equivalent for this purpose to a state’s
highest court.

Opinion of the Court

“limited grasp” of Rooker-Feldman).
As earlier noted, see supra, at 7–8, Skinner does not
challenge the adverse CCA decisions themselves; instead,
he targets as unconstitutional the Texas statute they
authoritatively construed. As the Court explained in
Feldman, 460 U. S., at 487, and reiterated in Exxon, 544
U. S., at 286, a state-court decision is not reviewable by
lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the
decision may be challenged in a federal action.10 Skinner’s
federal case falls within the latter category. There was,
therefore, no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skin­
ner’s federal suit.11
C
When may a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitu­
tional state action, pursue a civil rights claim under
§1983, and when is habeas corpus the prisoner’s sole
remedy? This Court has several times considered that
question. Pathmarking here is Heck v. Humphrey, 512
U. S. 477 (1994). Plaintiff in that litigation was a state
prisoner serving time for manslaughter. He brought a
§1983 action for damages, alleging that he had been
unlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.
Although the complaint in Heck sought monetary damages
only, not release from confinement, we ruled that the
plaintiff could not proceed under §1983. Any award in his
favor, we observed, would “necessarily imply” the invalid­
——————
10 The Court further observed in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic
Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 292–293 (2005), that “[w]hen there is
parallel state and federal litigation,” state preclusion law may become
decisive, but “[p]reclusion . . . is not a jurisdictional matter.”
11 Switzer asserts that Skinner could have raised his federal claim in
the Article 64 proceeding. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Even if that were so,
“Rooker-Feldman is not simply preclusion by another name,” Lance v.
Dennis, 546 U. S. 459, 466 (2006) (per curiam), and questions of preclu­
sion unresolved below are “best left for full airing and decision on
remand,” id., at 467 (GINSBURG, J., concurring).

Opinion of the Court

ity of his conviction. See id., at 487. When “a judgment in
favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity
of his conviction or sentence,” the Court held, §1983 is not
an available remedy. Ibid. “But if . . . the plaintiff’s ac­
tion, even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity
of [his conviction or sentence], the [§1983] action should be
allowed to proceed . . . .” Ibid.
We summarized the relevant case law most recently in
Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). That case in­
volved prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of
administrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.
They could proceed under §1983, the Court held, for they
sought no “injunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier
release into the community,” id., at 82, and “a favorable
judgment [would] not ‘necessarily imply the invalidity of
[their] conviction[s] or sentence[s],’ ” ibid. (quoting Heck,
512 U. S., at 487; first alteration added).
Measured against our prior holdings, Skinner has prop­
erly invoked §1983. Success in his suit for DNA testing
would not “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his convic­
tion. While test results might prove exculpatory, that
outcome is hardly inevitable; as earlier observed, see
supra, at 2, results might prove inconclusive or they might
further incriminate Skinner. See Nelson v. Campbell, 541
U. S. 637, 647 (2004) (“[W]e were careful in Heck to stress
the importance of the term ‘necessarily.’ ”).12
Respondent Switzer nevertheless argues, in line with
Fifth Circuit precedent, see Kutzner, 303 F. 3d, at 341,
that Skinner’s request for DNA testing must be pursued, if
at all, in an application for habeas corpus, not in a §1983
action. The dissent echoes Switzer’s argument. See post,
at 3. Although Skinner’s immediate plea is simply for an

12 The dissent would muddle the clear line Heck and Dotson drew, and
instead would instruct district courts to resort to “first principles” each
time a state prisoner files a §1983 claim in federal court. Post, at 2, 7.

SKINNER v. SWITZER
Opinion of the Court

order requiring DNA testing, his ultimate aim, Switzer
urges, is to use the test results as a platform for attacking
his conviction. It suffices to point out that Switzer has
found no case, nor has the dissent, in which the Court has
recognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available
one, where the relief sought would “neither terminat[e]
custody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from cus­
tody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.” Dotson, 544 U. S.,
at 86 (SCALIA, J., concurring).
Respondent Switzer and her amici forecast that a “vast
expansion of federal jurisdiction . . . would ensue” were we
to hold that Skinner’s complaint can be initiated under
§1983. See Brief for National District Attorneys Associa­
tion as Amicus Curiae 8. In particular, they predict a
proliferation of federal civil actions “seeking postconviction
discovery of evidence [and] other relief inescapably associ­
ated with the central questions of guilt or punishment.”
Id., at 6. These fears, shared by the dissent, post, at 6, are
unwarranted.13
In the Circuits that currently allow §1983 claims for
DNA testing, see supra, at 1, no evidence tendered by
Switzer shows any litigation flood or even rainfall. The
——————
13 Unlike the parole determinations at issue in Wilkinson v. Dotson,
544 U. S. 74 (2005), Switzer urges, claims like Skinner’s require inquiry
into the State’s proof at trial and therefore lie at “the core of the crimi­
nal proceeding itself.” Tr. of Oral 41; see id., at 33–34. Dotson de­
clared, however, in no uncertain terms, that when a prisoner’s claim
would not “necessarily spell speedier release,” that claim does not lie at
“the core of habeas corpus,” and may be brought, if at all, under §1983.
544 U. S., at 82 (majority opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted);
see id., at 85–86 (SCALIA, J., concurring). Whatever might be said of
Switzer’s argument were we to recast our doctrine, Switzer’s position
cannot be reconciled with the line our precedent currently draws. Nor
can the dissent’s advocacy of a “retur[n] to first principles.” Post, at 7.
Given the importance of providing clear guidance to the lower courts,
“we again see no reason for moving the line our cases draw.” Dotson,
544 U. S., at 84.

Opinion of the Court

projected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible
regarding DNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected
substantive due process as a basis for such claims. See
supra, at 2.
More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of
1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321–66, Congress has placed a
series of controls on prisoner suits, constraints designed to
prevent sportive filings in federal court. See, e.g., PLRA
§803(d) (adding 42 U. S. C. §1997e to create new proce­
dures and penalties for prisoner lawsuits under §1983);
PLRA §804(a)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(b)(1) to require
any prisoner proceeding in forma pauperis to pay the full
filing fee out of a percentage of his prison trust account);
PLRA §804(c)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(f) to require
prisoners to pay the full amount of any cost assessed
against them out of their prison trust account); PLRA
§804(d) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(g) to revoke, with lim­
ited exception, in forma pauperis privileges for any pris­
oner who has filed three or more lawsuits that fail to state
a claim, or are malicious or frivolous). See also CrawfordEl v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 596–597 (1998) (PLRA aims to
“discourage prisoners from filing claims that are unlikely
to succeed,” and statistics suggest that the Act is “having
its intended effect”).
Nor do we see any cause for concern that today’s ruling
will spill over to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373
U. S. 83 (1963); indeed, Switzer makes no such assertion.
Brady announced a constitutional requirement addressed
first and foremost to the prosecution’s conduct pretrial.
Brady proscribes withholding evidence “favorable to an
accused” and “material to [his] guilt or to punishment.”
Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1). To
establish that a Brady violation undermines a conviction,
a convicted defendant must make each of three showings:
(1) the evidence at issue is “favorable to the accused,
either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeach­

fully or inadvertently”; and (3) “prejudice . . . ensued.”
Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281–282 (1999); see
Banks v. Dretke, 540 U. S. 668, 691 (2004).
Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory,
incriminating, or inconclusive results, a Brady claim,
when successful postconviction, necessarily yields evi­
dence undermining a conviction: Brady evidence is, by
definition, always favorable to the defendant and material
to his guilt or punishment. See Strickler, 527 U. S., at
296. And parties asserting Brady violations postconvic­
tion generally do seek a judgment qualifying them for
“immediate or speedier release” from imprisonment. See
Dotson, 544 U. S., at 82. Accordingly, Brady claims have
ranked within the traditional core of habeas corpus and
outside the province of §1983. See Heck, 512 U. S., at
479, 490 (claim that prosecutors and an investigator had
“ ‘knowingly destroyed’ evidence ‘which was exculpatory in
nature and could have proved [petitioner’s] innocence’ ”
cannot be maintained under §1983); Amaker v. Weiner,
179 F. 3d 48, 51 (CA2 1999) (“claim [that] sounds under
Brady v. Maryland . . . does indeed call into question the
validity of [the] conviction”); Beck v. Muskogee Police
Dept., 195 F. 3d 553, 560 (CA10 1999) (same).

Finally, Switzer presents several reasons why Skinner’s
complaint should fail for lack of merit. Those arguments,
unaddressed by the courts below, are ripe for considera­
tion on remand. “[M]indful that we are a court of review,
not of first view,” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718,
n. 7 (2005), we confine this opinion to the matter on which
we granted certiorari and express no opinion on the ulti­
mate disposition of Skinner’s federal action.
