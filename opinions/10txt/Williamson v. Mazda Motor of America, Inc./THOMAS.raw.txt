DELBERT WILLIAMSON, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC., ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA, FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT, DIVISION THREE
[February 23, 2011]

JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
The Court concludes that the National Traffic and Mo
tor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Safety Act) and Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (FMVSS 208) do not
pre-empt the Williamsons’ state tort lawsuit. I agree. But
I reach this result by a more direct route: the Safety Act’s
saving clause, which speaks directly to this question and
answers it. See 49 U. S. C. §30103(e).
I
The plain text of the Safety Act resolves this case.
Congress has instructed that “[c]ompliance with a motor
vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does
not exempt a person from liability at common law.” Ibid.
This saving clause “explicitly preserv[es] state common
law actions.” Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 18).
Here, Mazda complied with FMVSS 208 when it chose to
install a simple lap belt. According to Mazda, the Wil
liamsons’ lawsuit alleging that it should have installed a
lap-and-shoulder seatbelt instead is pre-empted. That
argument is foreclosed by the saving clause; the William
sons’ state tort action is not pre-empted.
The majority does not rely on the Safety Act’s saving
clause because this Court effectively read it out of the

statute in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S.
861 (2000). In Geier, the Court interpreted the saving
clause as simply cancelling out the statute’s express pre
emption clause with respect to common-law tort actions.
This left the Court free to consider the effect of conflict
pre-emption principles on such tort actions. See id., at
869.
But it makes no sense to read the express pre-emption
clause in conjunction with the saving clause. See id., at
898 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The express pre-emption
clause bars States from having any safety “standard appli
cable to the same aspect of performance” as a federal
standard unless it is “identical” to the federal one.
§30103(b). That clause pre-empts States from establish
ing “objective rule[s] prescribed by a legislature or an
administrative agency” in competition with the federal
standards; it says nothing about the tort lawsuits that are
the focus of the saving clause. Id., at 896.* Read inde
pendently of the express pre-emption clause, the saving
clause simply means what it says: FMVSS 208 does not
pre-empt state common-law actions.
II
As in Geier, rather than following the plain text of the
statute, the majority’s analysis turns on whether the tort
lawsuit here “ ‘stands as an obstacle to the accomplish
ment and execution of the full purposes and objectives’ ”
of FMVSS 208. Ante, at 5 (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz,
312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)). I have rejected purposes-and
objectives pre-emption as inconsistent with the Constitu

(addressing a similar express pre-emption clause and saving clause in
the Federal Boat Safety Act, and holding that it is “perfectly rational”
for Congress to bar state “administrative and legislative regulations”
while allowing “private damages remedies” to compensate accident
victims).

tion because it turns entirely on extratextual “judicial
suppositions.” Wyeth, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22); see
also Haywood v. Drown, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (dissent
ing opinion) (slip op., at 26–27).
Pre-emption occurs “by direct operation of the Suprem
acy Clause,” Brown v. Hotel Employees, 468 U. S. 491, 501
(1984), which “requires that pre-emptive effect be given
only to those federal standards and policies that are set
forth in, or necessarily follow from, the statutory text that
was produced through the constitutionally required bi
cameral and presentment procedures.” Wyeth, 555 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 5) (opinion of THOMAS, J.). In short,
pre-emption must turn on the text of a federal statute or
the regulations it authorizes. See id., at ___ (slip op., at
6); see also Geier, supra, at 911 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Purposes-and-objectives pre-emption—which by design
roams beyond statutory or regulatory text—is thus wholly
illegitimate. It instructs courts to pre-empt state laws
based on judges’ “conceptions of a policy which Congress
has not expressed and which is not plainly to be inferred
from the legislation which it has enacted.” Hines, supra,
at 75 (Stone, J., dissenting); Geier, supra, at 907 (opinion
of Stevens, J.) (expressing concern about judges “running
amok with our potentially boundless (and perhaps inade
quately considered) [purposes-and-objectives pre-emption
doctrine]”); see also Wyeth, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13–
21) (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (recounting the history of the
doctrine).
The majority’s purposes-and-objectives pre-emption
analysis displays the inherent constitutional problem with
the doctrine. The Court begins with FMVSS 208, which
allowed manufacturers to install either simple lap or lap
and-shoulder seatbelts in the rear aisle seat of 1993 mini
vans. The majority then turns to what it considers the
primary issue: whether “that choice [was] a significant
regulatory objective.” Ante, at 8 (emphasis added). Put

more plainly, the question is whether the regulators really
wanted manufacturers to have a choice or did not really
want them to have a choice but gave them one anyway.
To answer that question, the majority engages in a
“freewheeling, extratextual, and broad evaluatio[n] of the
‘purposes and objectives’ ” of FMVSS 208. Wyeth, supra, at
___ (slip op., at 23) (opinion of THOMAS, J.). The Court
wades into a sea of agency musings and Government
litigating positions and fishes for what the agency may
have been thinking 20 years ago when it drafted the rele
vant provision. After scrutinizing the 1989 Federal Regis
ter, a letter written in 1994, and the Solicitor General’s
present-day assurances, the Court finds that Department
of Transportation liked the idea of lap-and-shoulder seat
belts in all seats, but did not require them, primarily for
cost-efficiency reasons and also because of some concern
for ingress-egress around the belt mounts. Ante, at 8–11.
From all of this, the majority determines that although
the regulators specifically and intentionally gave manu
facturers a choice between types of seatbelts, that choice
was not a “significant regulatory objective” and so does not
pre-empt state tort lawsuits.
That the Court in Geier reached an opposite conclusion
reveals the utterly unconstrained nature of purposes-and
objectives pre-emption. There is certainly “considerable
similarity between this case and Geier.” Ante, at 2. Just
as in this case, Geier involved a choice offered to car
manufacturers in FMVSS 208: whether to install airbags.
Ante, at 8. And just as in this case, the Court in Geier
relied on “history, the agency’s contemporaneous explana
tion, and the Government’s current understanding” to
determine the significance of that choice. Ante, at 7–8.
Yet the Geier Court concluded that “giving auto manufac
turers a choice among different kinds of passive restraint
devices was a significant objective of the federal regula
tion,” ante, at 6, and thus found the Geiers’ lawsuit pre

empted.
The dispositive difference between this case and Geier—
indeed, the only difference—is the majority’s “psycho
analysis” of the regulators. United States v. Public Util.
Comm’n of Cal., 345 U. S. 295, 319 (1953) (Jackson, J.,
concurring) (describing reliance on legislative history).
The majority cites no difference on the face of FMVSS 208
between the airbag choice addressed in Geier and the
seatbelt choice at issue in this case.
According to the majority, to determine whether FMVSS
208 pre-empts a tort suit, courts apparently must embark
on the same expedition undertaken here: sifting through
the Federal Register, examining agency ruminations, and
asking the Government what it currently thinks. Pre
emption is then proper if the court decides that the regula
tors thought the choice especially important, but not if the
choice was only somewhat important. This quest roves far
from the Safety Act and analyzes pre-emption based on a
formless inquiry into how strongly an agency felt about
the regulation it enacted 20 years ago.
“[F]reeranging speculation about what the purposes of
the [regulation] must have been” is not constitutionally
proper in any case. Wyeth, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15)
(opinion of THOMAS, J.). The Supremacy Clause com
mands that the “[l]aws of the United States,” not the
unenacted hopes and dreams of the Department of Trans
portation, “shall be the supreme Law of the Land.” U. S.
Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. The impropriety is even more obvi
ous here because the plain text of the Safety Act resolves
this case.
For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.
