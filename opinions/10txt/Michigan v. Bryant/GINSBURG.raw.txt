MICHIGAN, PETITIONER v. RICHARD PERRY 

BRYANT 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT

OF MICHIGAN

[February 28, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting.
I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that Covington’s state
ments were testimonial and that “[t]he declarant’s intent
is what counts.” Ante, at 2 (dissenting opinion). Even if
the interrogators’ intent were what counts, I further
agree, Covington’s statements would still be testimonial.
Ante, at 8. It is most likely that “the officers viewed their
encounter with Covington [as] an investigation into a past
crime with no ongoing or immediate consequences.” Ante,
at 10. Today’s decision, JUSTICE SCALIA rightly notes,
“creates an expansive exception to the Confrontation
Clause for violent crimes.” Ibid. In so doing, the decision
confounds our recent Confrontation Clause jurisprudence,
ante, at 12, which made it plain that “[r]eliability tells us
nothing about whether a statement is testimonial,” ante,
at 14 (emphasis deleted).
I would add, however, this observation. In Crawford v.
Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 56, n. 6 (2004), this Court noted
that, in the law we inherited from England, there was a
well-established exception to the confrontation require
ment: The cloak protecting the accused against admission
of out-of-court testimonial statements was removed for
dying declarations. This historic exception, we recalled in
Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358 (2008); see id., at
361–362, 368, applied to statements made by a person

MICHIGAN v. BRYANT
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

about to die and aware that death was imminent. Were
the issue properly tendered here, I would take up the
question whether the exception for dying declarations
survives our recent Confrontation Clause decisions. The
Michigan Supreme Court, however, held, as a matter of
state law, that the prosecutor had abandoned the issue.
See 483 Mich. 132, 156–157, 768 N. W. 2d 65, 78 (2009).
The matter, therefore, is not one the Court can address in
this case.
