HOWARD K. STERN, EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF 

VICKIE LYNN MARSHALL, PETITIONER v. 

ELAINE T. MARSHALL, EXECUTRIX OF THE

ESTATE OF E. PIERCE MARSHALL 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 23, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring.
I agree with the Court’s interpretation of our Article III
precedents, and I accordingly join its opinion. I adhere to
my view, however, that—our contrary precedents notwith
standing—“a matter of public rights . . . must at a mini
mum arise between the government and others,” Granfi
nanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 65 (1989)
(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg
ment) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The sheer surfeit of factors that the Court was required
to consider in this case should arouse the suspicion that
something is seriously amiss with our jurisprudence in
this area. I count at least seven different reasons given in
the Court’s opinion for concluding that an Article III judge
was required to adjudicate this lawsuit: that it was one
“under state common law” which was “not a matter that
can be pursued only by grace of the other branches,” ante,
at 27; that it was “not ‘completely dependent upon’ adjudi
cation of a claim created by federal law,” ibid.; that “Pierce
did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie’s claim in the
bankruptcy court proceedings,” ibid.; that “the asserted
authority to decide Vickie’s claim is not limited to a ‘par
ticularized area of the law,’ ” ante, at 28; that “there was

never any reason to believe that the process of adjudi
cating Pierce’s proof of claim would necessarily resolve
Vickie’s counterclaim,” ante, at 32; that the trustee was
not “asserting a right of recovery created by federal bank
ruptcy law,” ante, at 33; and that the Bankruptcy Judge
“ha[d] the power to enter ‘appropriate orders and judg
ments’—including final judgments—subject to review only
if a party chooses to appeal,” ante, at 35.
Apart from their sheer numerosity, the more fundamen
tal flaw in the many tests suggested by our jurisprudence
is that they have nothing to do with the text or tradition of
Article III. For example, Article III gives no indication
that state-law claims have preferential entitlement to an
Article III judge; nor does it make pertinent the extent to
which the area of the law is “particularized.” The multi
factors relied upon today seem to have entered our juris
prudence almost randomly.
Leaving aside certain adjudications by federal adminis
trative agencies, which are governed (for better or worse)
by our landmark decision in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.
22 (1932), in my view an Article III judge is required in all
federal adjudications, unless there is a firmly established
historical practice to the contrary. For that reason—and
not because of some intuitive balancing of benefits and
harms—I agree that Article III judges are not required in
the context of territorial courts, courts-martial, or true
“public rights” cases. See Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v.
Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 71 (1982) (plurality
opinion). Perhaps historical practice permits non-Article
III judges to process claims against the bankruptcy estate,
see, e.g., Plank, Why Bankruptcy Judges Need Not and
Should Not Be Article III Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L. J. 567,
607–609 (1998); the subject has not been briefed, and so I
state no position on the matter. But Vickie points to no
historical practice that authorizes a non-Article III judge
to adjudicate a counterclaim of the sort at issue here.
