BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE LELAND STANFORD 

JUNIOR UNIVERSITY, PETITIONER v. ROCHE 

MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC., ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[June 6, 2011]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring.
I agree with the Court’s resolution of this case and with
its reasoning. I write separately to note that I share
JUSTICE BREYER’s concerns as to the principles adopted by
the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in FilmTec
Corp. v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 939 F. 2d 1568 (1991), and the
application of those principles to agreements that impli
cate the Bayh-Dole Act. See post, at 6–10 (dissenting
opinion). Because Stanford failed to challenge the decision
below on these grounds, I agree that the appropriate
disposition is to affirm. Like the dissent, however, I un
derstand the majority opinion to permit consideration of
these arguments in a future case. See ante, at 5, n. 2.
