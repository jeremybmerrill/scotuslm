GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment NOTICE: This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports. Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Wash ington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press. No. 10–382 [June 13, 2011]  JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins, concurring in the judgment. I agree with the Court that the Government is not an ordinary trustee. See ante, at 17–19. Unlike a private trustee, the Government has its own “distinc[t] interest” in the faithful carrying out of the laws governing the conduct 437 (1912). This unique “national interest,” ibid., obli gates Government attorneys, in rendering advice, to make their own “independent evaluation of the law and facts” in an effort “to arrive at a single position of the United States,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a (Letter from Attorney General Griffin B. Bell to Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus (May 31, 1979)). “For that reason,” as the Court explains, “the Government seeks legal advice in a ‘per sonal’ rather than a fiduciary capacity.” Ante, at 18. The attorney-client privilege thus protects the Government’s communications with its attorneys from disclosure. Going beyond attorney-client communications, the Court holds that the Government “assumes Indian trust respon sibilities only to the extent it expressly accepts those responsibilities by statute.” Ante, at 14. The Court there
GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment fore concludes that the trust relationship described by 25 U. S. C. §162a does not include the usual “common-law disclosure obligations.” Ante, at 21. Because it is unnec essary to decide what information other than attorney client communications the Government may withhold from the beneficiaries of tribal trusts, I concur only in the Court’s judgment.
