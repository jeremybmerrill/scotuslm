MARCUS SYKES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 9, 2011]


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that the Indiana crime of in
tentional vehicular flight, Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A)
(2004), is a “violent felony” under the Armed Career
Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The
majority also correctly refuses to apply the “ purposeful,
violent, and aggressive ” test created in Begay v. United
States, 553 U. S. 137, 145 (2008). However, the majority
errs by implying that the “purposeful, violent, and aggres
sive” test may still apply to offenses “akin to strict liabil
ity, negligence, and recklessness crimes.” Ante, at 11.
The error in imposing that test, which does not appear
in ACCA, is well catalogued. See, e.g., Begay, 553 U. S., at
150–152 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 158–
159 (ALITO, J., dissenting); ante, at 11 (finding “no pre
cise textual link” in the statute). I agree with JUSTICES
SCALIA and KAGAN that the majority’s partial retreat from
Begay only further muddies ACCA’s residual clause. Post,
at 1 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); post, at 1, n. 1 (KAGAN, J.,
dissenting).
The only question here is whether, in the ordinary case,
using a vehicle to knowingly flee from the police after
being ordered to stop “involves conduct that presents a
serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). I believe that it does. Therefore I concur
in the judgment.

SYKES v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

I
Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a
felony. Any person who “knowingly or intentionally . . .
flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has,
by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered
the person to stop” commits a misdemeanor. Ind. Code
§35–44–3–3(a)(3). If the person “uses a vehicle” to flee,
however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.
§3(b)(1)(A). That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a
“violent felony” under ACCA if it is “burglary, arson, or
extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves
conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).
As explained below, Indiana’s crime of intentional ve
hicular flight “involves conduct that presents a serious
potential risk of physical injury to another.” Ibid. The
elements of §3(b)(1)(A), compared to those of the enumer
ated ACCA offense of burglary, suggest that an ordinary
violation of §3(b)(1)(A) is far riskier than an ordinary
burglary. Statistics, common experience, and Indiana
cases support this conclusion.
A
The specific crimes Congress listed as “violent felon
[ies]” in ACCA—arson, extortion, burglary, and use of
explosives—provide a “baseline against which to measure
the degree of risk” that a nonenumerated offense must
present in order to qualify as a violent felony. James v.
United States, 550 U. S. 192, 208 (2007); see also ante, at
6. Burglary, for instance, sets a low baseline level for risk.
Its elements are “unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or
remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to com
mit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599
(1990). As this Court has recognized, the risk of burglary
is in “the possibility that an innocent person might appear
while the crime is in progress” and the danger inherent in

THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

such a “face-to-face confrontation.” James, 550 U. S., at
203. The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an
ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars gen
erally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward
avoiding detection. Nevertheless, that small chance suf
ficed for Congress to list burglary as a “violent felony,” and
for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also quali
fies. See id., at 195.
Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional ve
hicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses
greater potential risk. Although interruption and confron
tation are quite rare for burglary, every §3(a)(3) flight is
committed in the presence of a police officer. Every
§3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in know
ing defiance of an officer’s direct order to stop, “which is a
clear challenge to the officer’s authority and typically
initiates pursuit.” United States v. Harrimon, 568 F. 3d
531, 535 (CA5 2009); see also United States v. Spells, 537
F. 3d 743, 752 (CA7 2008) (“Taking flight calls the officer
to give chase, and aside from any accompanying risk to
pedestrians and other motorists, such flight dares the
officer to needlessly endanger himself in pursuit”). Fi
nally, in every §3(b)(1)(A) flight, the perpetrator is armed
with what can be a deadly weapon: a vehicle. See, e.g.,
Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 383 (2007) (noting that “the
threat posed by the flight on foot of an unarmed suspect”
was not “even remotely comparable to the extreme danger
to human life” posed by that vehicular chase); United
States v. Kendrick, 423 F. 3d 803, 809 (CA8 2005) (“[T]he
dangerous circumstances surrounding a person’s attempt
to flee from law enforcement are compounded by the
person’s operation of a motor vehicle”); United States v.
Aceves-Rosales, 832 F. 2d 1155, 1157 (CA9 1987) (per
curiam) (“It is indisputable that an automobile . . . can be
used as a deadly weapon”).
In sum, every violation of §3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant

THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in
front of a police officer. Based on its elements, the poten
tial risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles “armed
burglary in the presence of a security guard” more than
simple burglary. Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with
much more risk—a far greater likelihood of confrontation
with police and a greater chance of violence in that
confrontation—than burglary. It follows that the “the con
duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi
nary case,” poses a greater risk of harm than the enumer
ated offense of burglary. James, supra, at 208.
B
Common experience and statistical evidence confirm the
“potential risk” of intentional vehicular flight. Cf. Cham
bers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122, 129 (2009) (statistical
evidence, though not always necessary, “strongly supports
the intuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a
serious potential risk of physical injury”). Data from the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows
that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and
occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase
related crashes. National Center for Statistics & Analysis,
Fatalities in Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes Involving
Police in Pursuit 37–56 (2010) (reporting 1,269 such
deaths between 2000 and 2009).
The number injured must be much higher. Many thou
sands of police chases occur every year. In California and
Pennsylvania, which collect statewide pursuit data, police
were involved in a combined total of more than 8,700
chases in 2007 alone. See Pennsylvania State Police
Bureau of Research & Development, Police Pursuits 2007
Annual Report; Report to the Legislature, Senate Bill 719,
California Police Pursuits (March 2008); see also Schultz,
Hudak, & Alpert, Emergency Driving and Pursuits, FBI
Law Enforcement Bulletin, Apr. 2009, pp. 1, 4 (surveying

more than 2,100 police officers and finding an average of
just over one pursuit per officer each year). And up to 41%
of all chases involve a crash, which always carries some
risk of injury. Wells & Falcone, Research on Police Pur
suits: Advantages of Multiple Data Collection Strategies,
20 Policing: Int’l J. Police Strategies & Management 729,
740 (1997) (citing nine studies, each showing a crash rate
between 18% and 41%). Indeed, studies show that 4% to
17% of all chases actually cause injury. Ibid.; see also C.
Lum & G. Fachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innova
tion and Reform 57 (2008) (finding that 23.5% of flights
involve a crash, and 9% of flights cause injury).
An International Association of Chiefs of Police study
of 7,737 pursuits across 30 States found 900 injuries, of
which 313 were to police or bystanders. Ibid. As the
majority observes, that injury rate is just over 4 injuries
per 100 chases, excluding injuries to the perpetrator.
Ante, at 8. By comparison, the injury rate for burglary
and arson is around 3 injuries per 100 crimes, or less.
Ante, at 9; see also Harrimon, supra, at 537 (citing similar
arson statistics, showing between 1 and 3 injuries per 100
fires, apparently including injuries to perpetrators). Sta
tistics support what logic suggests: The ordinary case of
intentional vehicular flight is risky, indeed, more so than
some offenses listed in ACCA.
These statistical risks of intentional flight merely rein
force common sense and real world experience. See, e.g.,
Carroll & Woomer, Family Killed in Visalia Crash After
Man Flees From Sheriff’s Deputy, Visalia Times-Delta,

chases. See, e.g., Bowes, Claim Settled in Death of Officer,

dangerous.
C
Convictions under §3(b)(1)(A) further support this con
clusion. See, e.g., Mason v. State, 944 N. E. 2d 68, 69–70
(Ind. App. 2011) (defendant suddenly drove his car toward
police officers, who then fired at him; he crashed into other
cars and was Tasered); Jones v. State, 938 N. E. 2d 1248,
1253 (Ind. App. 2010) (defendant accelerated and crashed
into a police car); Haney v. State, 920 N. E. 2d 818, 2010

and then into a field where he crashed into a tree); Hape
v. State, 903 N. E. 2d 977, 984, 985, n. 4, 994 (Ind. App.
2009) (defendant fled for 40 minutes, at times in excess of
100 mph and into oncoming traffic; police fired at his truck
at least 20 times; he was captured only after driving into a
flooded area); Smith v. State, 908 N. E. 2d 1280, 2009 WL
1766526, *1 (Ind. App., June 23, 2009) (defendant led
police on a stop-and-go chase for five minutes, which
included traveling at 30 mph through a stop sign and
crowded parking lot; he ultimately had to be chemical
sprayed); Butler v. State, 912 N. E. 2d 449, 2009 WL
2706123, *1 (Ind. App., Aug. 28, 2009) (defendant led a
chase at speeds up to 80 mph, swerved into the path of an
oncoming vehicle, and eventually jumped from the car
while it was still moving); Amore v. State, 884 N. E. 2d
434, 2008 WL 1032611, *1 (Ind. App., Apr. 11, 2008) (de
fendant led police on a 15-mile chase at speeds up to 125
mph, ending in a crash); Johnson v. State, 879 N. E. 2d 24,
2008 WL 131195, *1 (Ind. App., Jan. 14, 2008) (defendant
led a chase at 65–70 mph at 1 a.m. with no tail lights,
crashed his car, and caused a police car to crash); Tinder

led a 12:30 a.m. chase, which ended when he ran off the
road, crashed through a corn silo, and hit a fence). Al
though these cases are only a limited collection, their facts
illustrate that convictions under §3(b)(1)(A) often involve
highly dangerous conduct.
II
Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a
violent felony for two main reasons. First, he asserts that
it is possible to violate Indiana’s intentional vehicular
flight statute without doing anything dangerous. Second,
he urges that the existence of Ind. Code §35–44–3–
3(b)(1)(B), which includes “substantial risk” as an addi


8

SYKES v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

tional element, indicates that §3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.
Neither argument is persuasive.
A
Sykes observes that it would violate the statute to flee
at low speed, obeying traffic signs and stopping after only
a short distance. See Woodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d
897, 900–901 (Ind. App. 2002); post, at 4 (KAGAN, J., dis
senting). Such a flight, he urges, would not present “a
serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” so
a conviction under the statute cannot categorically be a
violent felony.
The fact that Sykes can imagine a nonrisky way to
violate §3(b)(1)(A) does not disprove that intentional ve
hicular flight is dangerous “in the ordinary case.” See
James, 550 U. S., at 208. It is also possible to imagine
committing burglary—an enumerated offense—under
circumstances that pose virtually no risk of physical in
jury. See id., at 207 (hypothesizing a “break-in of an
unoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and
away from any potential intervenors”).
Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he
imagines is the ordinary violation of §3(b)(1)(A). Sykes
offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his
view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight. See
Swain v. State, 923 N. E. 2d 32, 2010 WL 623720 (Ind.
App., Feb. 23, 2010); Woodward, supra, at 898. Yet not
even those cases obviously involve nonrisky conduct. In
Swain, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up
her boyfriend’s accomplice as he ran on foot from two
police officers. 2010 WL 623720, *1, *3. As the officers
approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled,
“ ‘Hurry up. Come on. They’re coming,’ ” and drove off as
the runner jumped in. Id., at *1. She stopped 10 to 15
seconds later, when police vehicles converging on the
scene took up pursuit. Ibid. In Woodward, the defendant

THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

ignored a police siren for approximately a mile, passed
several good places to pull over, and drove all the way
home, but traveled at the speed limit of 45 mph and
obeyed traffic laws. 770 N. E. 2d, at 898. Eventually the
defendant got out of his car and shouted profanities at the
officer, who drew his pistol. Id., at 898, 901; see also id.,
at 901, 902 (observing that the defendant had refused to
stop “except on his own terms” and noting “the dangers
that could await a police officer stopping where the citizen
selects”). These two cases fall well short of showing
that intentional flight in Indiana is ordinarily nonrisky.1
See also post, at 6 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (noting that
the “intuition that dangerous flights outstrip mere failures
to stop . . . seems consistent with common sense and
experience”).
B
Sykes also notes that a different subparagraph, §3(b)
(1)(B), covers intentional flight committed while “oper
at[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person,” whereas
§3(b)(1)(A) has no such element. From this, Sykes infers
that §3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does
not present a serious potential risk. The argument is that,
even though the elements of §3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct
that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the
presence of §3(b)(1)(B) casts §3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous
light. Post, at 8 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). But the fact that
§3(b)(1)(B) includes “substantial risk of bodily injury”
as an element does not restrict §3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky
——————
1 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.
His
§3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car
at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road,
weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among
bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house. Ante, at 4; 2
App. 11 (Sealed).

SYKES v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

conduct.
First, apart from the existence of §3(b)(1)(B), the ab
sence of risk as an element of §3(b)(1)(A) does not mean
that the offense is not a violent felony. ACCA does not
require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of
injury as an element of the offense. Enumerated violent
felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
Second, §3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
of §3(b)(1)(A). Both are class D felonies, and at the time of
Sykes’ conviction, there was no statutory difference in
punishment between them. Even now, the offenses re
main of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
The similarity in punishment for these related, overlap
ping offenses suggests that §3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equiva
lent of one type of §3(b)(1)(B) violation. Section 3(b)(1)(B)
enhances punishments for three separate types of in
tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, §3(a)(1);
interfering with service of process, §3(a)(2); and fleeing
from a police officer, §3(a)(3). Under §3(b)(1)(B), commit
ting any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly
weapon, inflicting injury, or “operat[ing] a vehicle in a
manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to
another person” has long been a class D felony.
In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added §3(b)(1)(A) to
provide that any use of a vehicle to flee from an officer
under §3(a)(3) is always a class D felony.
Section
3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment
for one particular violation of §3(b)(1)(B).2 It is still the
——————
2 Indiana

law at the time of Sykes’ conviction presented two related
provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment. One
was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a
narrower provision that did not. While JUSTICE KAGAN would infer that
the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky,
post, at 6–8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.
Consider reckless endangerment statutes. In Hawaii, for instance, it
is “reckless endangering in the second degree” either to “recklessly

case that under §3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an
officer or interfere with service of process is a class D
felony only if the vehicle is “operate[d] . . . in a manner
that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another
person.” §3(b)(1)(B). But using a vehicle to intentionally
flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove
risk. §3(b)(1)(A).
This rough equivalence between §3(b)(1)(A) and §3(b)
(1)(B) is borne out in Indiana case law. The conduct
underlying the Indiana cases discussed above, see supra,
at 6–7, demonstrates that despite §3(b)(1)(B), convictions
under §3(b)(1)(A) include risky flights.
Third, the remainder of Indiana’s resisting law enforce
——————
plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,”
Haw. Rev. Stat. §707–714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to “[i]ntentionally
discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,” §707–714(1)(b). I would
infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se
that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given
case. Other States have similar statutes. See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.
11, §§603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§6–2–504(a), (b) (2009); Me.
Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17–A, §§301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).
Similarly here, I infer that §3(b)(1)(A)’s upgrade of intentional flight
to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the
offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, “operat[ing] a vehicle
in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another
person” under §3(b)(1)(B).
JUSTICE KAGAN argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana
Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from
§3(b)(1)(B) when it added §3(b)(1)(A). Post, at 12. There are at least
two problems with this reasoning. First, even though §3(b)(1)(A) may
be redundant with §3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in
subsection (a)(3), the reference to “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B) is
still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).
Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference
to “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B). Second, although JUSTICE
KAGAN can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require
perfection in statutory drafting. See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC,
562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). I think it clear enough what
the statute means.


12

SYKES v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

ment statute confirms that its other provisions do not
reserve §3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct. An intentional
vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is
operated “in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.”
Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(2). The same act becomes a class
B felony if someone is killed. §35–44–3–3(b)(3).3 JUSTICE
KAGAN asserts that each of these “separate, escalating
crimes” captures an increasing degree of risk and neces
sarily means that §3(b)(1)(A), the offense simpliciter, is
less risky than it otherwise seems. Post, at 7.
The flaw in this reasoning is that §§3(b)(2) and (3) en
hance punishment based solely on the results of the flight,
not the degree of risk it posed. Neither provision requires
any action by a suspect beyond that which satisfies the
elements of §3(b)(1)(A).4 Rather, each provision addresses
what happens when the risk inherent in a violation of
§3(b)(1)(A) is actualized and someone is hurt or killed.
The risk of physical injury inherent in intentional vehicu
lar flight simpliciter was apparently clear enough to spur
the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the
inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.
By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insur
ance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legisla
tures do not specify what additional punishment is war
ranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or
police. See, e.g., Ind. Code §35–43–5–7.2; §35–43–9–7. In
sum, §§3(b)(2) and (3) do not demonstrate that §3(b)(1)(A)
is less risky than it otherwise seems, but instead support
the idea that it is inherently risky.
——————
3 Indiana recently added that if a police officer dies, it becomes a class
A felony. 2010 Ind. Acts p. 1197.
4 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight
that did not satisfy §3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on JUSTICE
KAGAN’s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly
progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.
See post, at 7.

Looking to the elements, statistics, common experience,
and cases, I conclude that in the ordinary case, Indiana’s
crime of intentional vehicular flight, §3(b)(1)(A), “involves
conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The crime
is therefore a violent felony under ACCA.
