MARCUS SYKES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 9, 2011]


JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.
As the Court's opinion acknowledges, this case is “an
other in a series,” ante, at 1. More specifically, it is an at
tempt to clarify, for the fourth time since 2007, what
distinguishes “violent felonies” under the residual clause
of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii), from other crimes. See James v. United
States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007); Begay v. United States, 553
U. S. 137 (2008); Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122
(2009). We try to include an ACCA residual-clause case in
about every second or third volume of the United States
Reports.
As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar
ification of the Delphic residual clause, today’s opinion
produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further
confusion. Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same
thing over and over again, but expecting different results.
Four times is enough. We should admit that ACCA’s
residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void
for vagueness. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357
(1983).
I
ACCA defines “violent felony,” in relevant part, as “any
crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding
one year . . . that . . . is burglary, arson, or extortion, in

volves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to
another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Many years of
prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this defini
tion. A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has
three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year man
datory minimum sentence and the possibility of life im
prisonment. See §924(e)(1); see United States v. Harrison,
558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009). Without those
prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence,
which could not possibly exceed 10 years. See §924(a)(2).
Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within
ACCA’s residual clause; that is, if it “involves conduct
that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to
another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Today’s opinion says, or ini
tially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent
felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
of risk “ ‘comparable to that posed by its closest analog
among the enumerated offenses.’ ” Ante, at 6. That is a
quotation from the Court’s opinion in the first of our
residual-clause trilogy, James, 550 U. S., at 203. I did not
join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the
elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least
risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was
the closest analog. See id., at 230 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
The problem with applying the James standard to the pres
ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under
Indiana law are not analogous to any of the four enumer
ated offenses. See Ind. Code §35–44–3–3 (2004). Nor is it
apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely
resembles, for example, statutory rape, see United States
v. Daye, 571 F. 3d 225, 228–236 (CA2 2009); possession of
a sawed-off shotgun, see United States v. Upton, 512 F. 3d
394, 403–405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison,
see Chambers, supra. I predicted this inadequacy of the
“closest analog” test in my James dissent. See 550 U. S.,

SCALIA, J., dissenting

at 215.
But as it turns out, the Court’s inability to identify an
analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present
case. For today’s opinion introduces the James standard
with the words “[f]or instance,” ante, at 6. It is (according
to the Court) merely one example of how the enumerated
crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explo
sives) “provide guidance.” Ibid. And the opinion then
proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least
risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in
James—finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both
arson and burglary. See ante, at 6–9.
But what about the test that determined the outcome in
our second case in this “series”—the “purposeful, violent,
and aggressive” test of Begay? Fear not. That incompati
ble variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in
today’s tutti-frutti opinion. “In many cases,” we are told,
it “will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.” Ante, at
11. That seems to be the case here—though why, and
when it will not be the case, are not entirely clear. The
Court’s accusation that Sykes “overreads the opinions of
this Court,” ante, at 10, apparently applies to his interpre
tation of Begay’s “purposeful, violent, and aggressive” test,
which the Court now suggests applies only “to strict liabil
ity, negligence, and recklessness crimes,” ante, at 11. But
that makes no sense. If the test excluded only those unin
tentional crimes, it would be recast as the “purposeful”
test, since the last two adjectives (“violent, and aggres
sive”) would do no work. For that reason, perhaps, all 11
Circuits that have addressed Begay “overrea[d]” it just as
Sykes does*—and as does the Government, see Brief for

United States 8.
The only case that is not brought forward in today’s
opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most
recent in the trilogy, Chambers, 555 U. S. 122—which
applied both the risky-as-the-least-risky test and the “pur
poseful, violent, and aggressive” test to reach the con
clusion that failure to report for periodic incarceration
was not a crime of violence under ACCA. But today’s
opinion does cite Chambers for another point: Whereas
James rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be
cause, among other reasons, no “hard statistics” on risk
iness “have been called to our attention,” 550 U. S., at
210; and whereas Begay made no mention of statistics;
Chambers explained (as today’s opinion points out) that
“statistical evidence sometimes ‘helps provide a conclusive
. . . answer’ concerning the risks that crimes present,”
ante, at 8 (quoting Chambers, supra, at 129). Today’s
opinion then outdoes Chambers in the volume of statistics
that it spews forth—statistics compiled by the Interna
tional Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries
attributable to police pursuits, ante, at 8; statistics from
the Department of Justice concerning injuries attributable
to burglaries, ante, at 9; statistics from the U. S. Fire
Administration concerning injuries attributable to fires,
ibid., and (by reference to JUSTICE THOMAS’s concurrence)
statistics from the National Center for Statistics & Analy
sis, the Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Research, the
FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin and several articles pub
lished elsewhere concerning injuries attributable to police
pursuits, ante, at 8 (citing ante, at 4–5 (THOMAS, J., con
curring in judgment)).

SCALIA, J., dissenting

Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to
develop the key facts in a case. We normally give parties
more robust protection, leaving important factual ques
tions to district courts and juries aided by expert wit
nesses and the procedural protections of discovery. See
Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid.
702–703, 705. An adversarial process in the trial courts
can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that
the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies’ find
ings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.
The Court does not examine, for example, whether the
police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative
sample of all vehicular flights. The data may be skewed
towards the rare and riskier forms of flight. See post, at 6,
n. 4 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). We also have no way of
knowing how many injuries reported in that data would
have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was
driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.
Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary
and arson data the Court cites. For example, the Court
relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude
that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See ante, at 9. But
a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration
suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons. See
Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research
Series, No. 8, pp. 1–2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at
http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/tfrs/v1i8-508.pdf
(as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file). The Court does not reveal why it chose one
dataset over another. In sum, our statistical analysis in
ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading
as statutory interpretation. Most of the statistics on
which the Court relies today come from government
funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this
litigation until the Government’s merits brief to this
Court. See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also Chambers,

SCALIA, J., dissenting

supra, at 128–129 (demonstrating that the same was true
in that case).
But the more fundamental problem with the Court’s use
of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness. Vague
ness, of course, must be measured ex ante—before the
Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision,
not after. Nothing is vague once the Court decrees pre
cisely what it means. And is it seriously to be expected
that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry
statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that
this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury
than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be
believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extor
tion, or use of explosives? To ask the question is to answer
it. A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.
II
When I dissented from the Court’s judgment in James, I
said that the residual clause’s “shoddy draftsmanship” put
courts to a difficult choice:
“They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtu
ally all predicate offenses, . . . ; (2) apply it case by
case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable
whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the par
ticular reviewing panel) believes there is a ‘serious po
tential risk of physical injury to another’ (whatever
that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of in
terpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively
predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller
subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the
drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness
. . . .” 550 U. S., at 229–230.
My dissent “tried to implement,” id., at 230, the third
option; and the Court, I believed, had chosen the second.

SCALIA, J., dissenting

“Today’s opinion,” I wrote, “permits an unintelligible crim
inal statute to survive uncorrected, unguided, and unex
plained.” Id., at 230–231.
My assessment has not been changed by the Court’s
later decisions in the ACCA “series.” Today’s opinion,
which adds to the “closest analog” test (James) the “pur
poseful, violent, and aggressive” test (Begay), and even the
risky-as-the-least-risky test that I had proposed as the
exclusive criterion, has not made the statute’s applica
tion clear and predictable. And all of them together—or
even the risky-as-the-least-risky test alone, I am now
convinced—never will. The residual-clause series will be
endless, and we will be doing ad hoc application of ACCA
to the vast variety of state criminal offenses until the cows
come home.
That does not violate the Constitution. What does vio
late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a
sentencing statute that does not “give a person of ordinar
ily intelligence fair notice” of its reach, United States v.
Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 123 (1979) (internal quotation
marks omitted), and that permits, indeed invites, arbi
trary enforcement, see Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. The
Court’s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause
will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to
come. The reality is that the phrase “otherwise involves
conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another” does not clearly define the crimes that
will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA
penalties. It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity
which the text itself does not honestly contain. And even
if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by
now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.
We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal
statutes in the past—indeed, in the recent past. See, e.g.,
Skilling v. United States, 561 U. S. ___ (2010). That is
regrettable, see id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring in part


8

SYKES v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). What sets
ACCA apart from those statutes—and what confirms its
incurable vagueness—is our repeated inability to craft a
principled test out of the statutory text. We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to
yield “an intelligible principle,” ante, at 13, each attempt
to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less
predictable and more arbitrary than the last. ACCA’s
residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal
proscriptions require. See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89–90 (1921).
The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be
unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant’s
conduct. See ante, at 14. Even apart from the fact that
our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,
this is not the first time I have found the comparison
unpersuasive:
“None of the provisions the Court cites . . . is similar
in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical
injury with the word ‘otherwise,’ preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The
phrase ‘shades of red,’ standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase ‘fireengine red, light pink, maroon, navy blue, or colors
that otherwise involve shades of red’ assuredly does
so.” James, 550 U. S., at 230, n. 7.
Of course even if the cited statutes were comparable,
repetition of constitutional error does not produce constitutional truth.

We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing
volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particu
lar. It should be no surprise that as the volume increases,
so do the number of imprecise laws. And no surprise that
our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti
tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitu
tion. Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts
legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants
credit for addressing a national problem but does not have
the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty
gritty. In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to
call a halt. I do not think it would be a radical step—
indeed, I think it would be highly responsible—to limit
ACCA to the named violent crimes. Congress can quickly
add what it wishes. Because the majority prefers to let
vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.
