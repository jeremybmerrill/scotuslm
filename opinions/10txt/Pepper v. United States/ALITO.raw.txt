JASON PEPPER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT

[March 2, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part, concurring in the
judgment in part, and dissenting in part.
I join Part III of the opinion of the Court. I agree with
the Court that the decision below cannot be affirmed on
the basis of 18 U. S. C. §3742(g), as amicus suggests. This
provision was designed to function as part of the manda
tory Guidelines scheme that the Court struck down in
United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265 (2005).
Although amicus’ argument is ingenious, even the sort of
surgery sanctioned in Booker cannot transform this provi
sion into one that can survive in the post-Booker world.
I also concur in the judgment to the extent that it holds
that the decision below regarding evidence of postsentenc
ing rehabilitation must be reversed. That decision, which
entirely precluded consideration of such evidence, was
consistent with the policy statement in §5K2.19 of the
United States Sentencing Guidelines, but “[t]he Booker
remedial decision . . . does not permit a court of appeals
to treat the Guidelines’ policy decisions as binding.”
Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 116 (2007)
(ALITO, J., dissenting).
Under Booker, however, district judges are still required
in almost all cases to give significant weight to the policy
decisions embodied in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
See 552 U. S., at 116; Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38,
61–67 (2007) (ALITO, J., dissenting). Congress delegated

PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of ALITO, J.

to the Sentencing Commission the authority to make
policy decisions regarding federal sentencing, see 18
U. S. C. §§3553(a)(4), (5), and requiring judges to give
significant weight to the Commission’s policy decisions
does not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment right that the
mandatory Guidelines system was found to violate, i.e.,
the right to have a jury make certain factual findings that
are relevant to sentencing.
While I continue to believe that sentencing judges
should be required to give significant weight to all Guide
lines provisions and policy statements, see Kimbrough,
552 U. S., at 116 (opinion of ALITO, J.), the Court in
Kimbrough held that sentencing judges may not be re
quired to give weight to some unusual policy decisions, see
id., at 109–110 (majority opinion). And JUSTICE BREYER
now makes a reasonable case that the particular policy
statement involved in this case is distinguishable from
almost all of the other rules that the Commission has
adopted. See ante, p. ___ (opinion concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). His position seems to me more
consistent with Kimbrough than the Court’s. It would at
least prevent us from sliding all the way down the slippery
slope that leads back to the regime of entirely discretion
ary federal sentencing that preceded the enactment of the
Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987.
Anyone familiar with the history of criminal sentencing
in this country cannot fail to see the irony in the Court’s
praise for the sentencing scheme exemplified by Williams
v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949), and 18 U. S. C. §3661.*

* Insofar as 18 U. S. C. §3661 permitted a sentencing judge to con
sider evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation, that provision was
effectively modified by the subsequent enactment of the Sentencing
Reform Act, which instructed the Sentencing Commission to adopt
guidelines and policy statements that avoid “unwarranted sentencing
disparities,” 28 U. S. C. §991(b)(1)(B); see also §994(f), and which
provided that sentencing courts “shall consider . . . any pertinent policy

Opinion of ALITO, J.

By the time of the enactment of the Sentencing Reform
Act in 1984, this scheme had fallen into widespread disre
pute. See, e.g., Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,
366 (1989) (noting “[f]undamental and widespread dissat
isfaction with the uncertainties and the disparities” of this
scheme); United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 142
(1980) (“It has been observed . . . that sentencing is one of
the areas of the criminal justice system most in need of
reform”); S. Rep. No. 98–223, p. 62 (1983) (“The shameful
disparity in criminal sentences is a major flaw in the
existing criminal justice system”). Under this system,
each federal district judge was free to implement his or
her individual sentencing philosophy, and therefore the
sentence imposed in a particular case often depended
heavily on the spin of the wheel that determined the judge
to whom the case was assigned. See Bullington v. Mis
souri, 451 U. S. 430, 444, n. 16 (1981) (“There has been no
attempt to separate policymaking from individual sentenc
ing determinations” (internal quotation marks omitted));
M. Frankel, Criminal Sentences: Law Without Order 5
(1973) (“[T]he almost wholly unchecked and sweeping
powers we give to judges in the fashioning of sentences are
terrifying and intolerable for a society that professes
devotion to the rule of law”).
Some language in today’s opinion reads like a paean to
that old regime, and I fear that it may be interpreted as
sanctioning a move back toward the system that prevailed
prior to 1984. If that occurs, I suspect that the day will
come when the irrationality of that system is once again
seen, and perhaps then the entire Booker line of cases will
be reexamined.
