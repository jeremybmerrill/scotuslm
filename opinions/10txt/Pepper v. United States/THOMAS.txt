No. 09–6822 [March 2, 2011]  JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting. I would affirm the Court of Appeals and uphold Pepper’s sentence. As written, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines do not permit district courts to impose a sentence below the Guidelines range based on the defendant’s postsen tencing rehabilitation.1 See United States Sentencing (USSG). Therefore, I respectfully dissent. (2005), the Court rendered the entire Guidelines scheme advisory, a remedy that was “far broader than necessary States, 552 U. S. 85, 114 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Because there is “no principled way to apply the Booker remedy,” I have explained that it is “best to apply the statute as written, including 18 U. S. C. §3553(b), which makes the Guidelines mandatory,” unless doing so would actually violate the Sixth Amendment. Id., at 116; see Booker, supra, at 313–326 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in 708, 717 (2008) (THOMAS, J., concurring). I would apply the Guidelines as written in this case
because doing so would not violate the Sixth Amendment. The constitutional problem arises only when a judge makes “a finding that raises the sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by refer ence to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defen dant.” Booker, supra, at 313 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Pepper admitted in his plea agreement to involvement with between 1,500 and 5,000 grams of methamphetamine mixture, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life under 412 F. 3d 995, 996 (CA8 2005). Because Pepper has ad mitted facts that would support a much longer sentence than the 65 months he received, there is no Sixth Amend ment problem in this case. Under a mandatory Guidelines regime, Pepper’s sen tence was proper. The District Court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, incorporated a USSG §5K1.1 depar ture and the Government’s motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), and settled on a 65-month sentence. Guideline §5K2.19 expressly prohibits down ward departures based on “[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional.” Nor is there any provision in the Guidelines for the “variance” Pepper seeks, as such variances are creations of the Booker remedy. I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold Pepper’s sentence. Although this outcome would not represent my own policy choice, I am bound by the choices made by Congress and the Federal Sentencing Commission. Like the major ity, I believe that postsentencing rehabilitation can be highly relevant to meaningful resentencing. See ante, at 13–15. In light of Pepper’s success in escaping drug addic
tion and becoming a productive member of society, I do not see what purpose further incarceration would serve. But Congress made the Guidelines mandatory, see 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1), and authorized USSG §5K2.19. I am con strained to apply those provisions unless the Constitution prohibits me from doing so, and it does not here.

1 I agree with the Court that the law of the case doctrine did not con
trol Pepper’s resentencing. See ante, at 29–31.

2 Pepper also stated that he understood both the 10-year statutory
minimum and that the Government was making no promises about any
exceptions.
