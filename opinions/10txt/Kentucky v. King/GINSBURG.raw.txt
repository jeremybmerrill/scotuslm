KENTUCKY, PETITIONER v. HOLLIS DESHAUN KING
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF 

KENTUCKY

[May 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting.
The Court today arms the police with a way routinely to
dishonor the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement in
drug cases. In lieu of presenting their evidence to a neu
tral magistrate, police officers may now knock, listen, then
break the door down, nevermind that they had ample time
to obtain a warrant. I dissent from the Court’s reduction
of the Fourth Amendment’s force.
The Fourth Amendment guarantees to the people “[t]he
right . . . to be secure in their . . . houses . . . against un
reasonable searches and seizures.” Warrants to search,
the Amendment further instructs, shall issue only upon a
showing of “probable cause” to believe criminal activity is
afoot. These complementary provisions are designed to
ensure that police will seek the authorization of a neutral
magistrate before undertaking a search or seizure. Excep
tions to the warrant requirement, this Court has ex
plained, must be “few in number and carefully delineated,”
if the main rule is to remain hardy. United States v.
United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407
U. S. 297, 318 (1972); see Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S.
27, 31 (2001).
This case involves a principal exception to the warrant
requirement, the exception applicable in “exigent circum
stances.” See ante, at 6–7. “[C]arefully delineated,” the
exception should govern only in genuine emergency situa

tions. Circumstances qualify as “exigent” when there is an
imminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that
evidence will be immediately destroyed, or that a suspect
will escape. Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403
(2006). The question presented: May police, who could
pause to gain the approval of a neutral magistrate, dis
pense with the need to get a warrant by themselves creat
ing exigent circumstances? I would answer no, as did the
Kentucky Supreme Court. The urgency must exist, I
would rule, when the police come on the scene, not subse
quent to their arrival, prompted by their own conduct.
I
Two pillars of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence
should have controlled the Court’s ruling: First, “whenever
practical, [the police must] obtain advance judicial ap
proval of searches and seizures through the warrant pro
cedure,” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 20 (1968); second,
unwarranted “searches and seizures inside a home” bear
heightened scrutiny, Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573,
586 (1980). The warrant requirement, Justice Jackson
observed, ranks among the “fundamental distinctions
between our form of government, where officers are under the law, and the police-state where they are the law.”
Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 17 (1948). The
Court has accordingly declared warrantless searches, in
the main, “per se unreasonable.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437
U. S. 385, 390 (1978); see also Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S.
551, 559 (2004). “[T]he police bear a heavy burden,” the
Court has cautioned, “when attempting to demonstrate an
urgent need that might justify warrantless searches.”
Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 749–750 (1984).
That heavy burden has not been carried here. There
was little risk that drug-related evidence would have been
destroyed had the police delayed the search pending
a magistrate’s authorization. As the Court recognizes,

GINSBURG, J., dissenting

“[p]ersons in possession of valuable drugs are unlikely to
destroy them unless they fear discovery by the police.”
Ante, at 8. Nothing in the record shows that, prior to the
knock at the apartment door, the occupants were appre
hensive about police proximity.
In no quarter does the Fourth Amendment apply with
greater force than in our homes, our most private space
which, for centuries, has been regarded as “ ‘entitled to
special protection.’ ” Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103,
115, and n. 4 (2006); Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 99
(1998) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Home intrusions, the
Court has said, are indeed “the chief evil against which . . .
the Fourth Amendment is directed.” Payton, 445 U. S., at
585 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Silverman v.
United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511 (1961) (“At [the Fourth
Amendment’s] very core stands the right of a man to
retreat to his own home and there be free from unreason
able governmental intrusion.”). “ ‘[S]earches and seizures
inside a home without a warrant are [therefore] presump
tively unreasonable.’ ” Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403
(quoting Groh, 540 U. S., at 559). How “secure” do our
homes remain if police, armed with no warrant, can pound
on doors at will and, on hearing sounds indicative of
things moving, forcibly enter and search for evidence of
unlawful activity?
II
As above noted, to justify the police activity in this case,
Kentucky invoked the once-guarded exception for emer
gencies “in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant
. . . threaten[s] ‘the destruction of evidence.’ ” Schmerber
v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770 (1966) (quoting Preston v.
United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)). To fit within
this exception, “police action literally must be [taken] ‘now
or never’ to preserve the evidence of the crime.” Roaden v.
Kentucky, 413 U. S. 496, 505 (1973).

KENTUCKY v. KING
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

The existence of a genuine emergency depends not only
on the state of necessity at the time of the warrantless
search; it depends, first and foremost, on “actions taken
by the police preceding the warrantless search.” United
States v. Coles, 437 F. 3d 361, 367 (CA3 2006). See also
United States v. Chambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 565 (CA6 2005)
(“[O]fficers must seek a warrant based on probable cause
when they believe in advance they will find contraband or
evidence of a crime.”). “[W]asting a clear opportunity to
obtain a warrant,” therefore, “disentitles the officer from
relying on subsequent exigent circumstances.” S. Saltz
burg & D. Capra, American Criminal Procedure 376 (8th
ed. 2007).
Under an appropriately reined-in “emergency” or “exi
gent circumstances” exception, the result in this case
should not be in doubt. The target of the investigation’s
entry into the building, and the smell of marijuana seep
ing under the apartment door into the hallway, the Ken
tucky Supreme Court rightly determined, gave the police
“probable cause . . . sufficient . . . to obtain a warrant to
search the . . . apartment.” 302 S. W. 3d 649, 653 (2010).
As that court observed, nothing made it impracticable for
the police to post officers on the premises while proceeding
to obtain a warrant authorizing their entry. Id., at
654. Before this Court, Kentucky does not urge otherwise.
See Brief for Petitioner 35, n. 13 (asserting “[i]t should be
of no importance whether police could have obtained a
warrant”).
In Johnson, the Court confronted this scenario: standing
outside a hotel room, the police smelled burning opium
and heard “some shuffling or noise” coming from the room.
333 U. S., at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted). Could
the police enter the room without a warrant? The Court
answered no. Explaining why, the Court said:
“The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home

is . . . a grave concern, not only to the individual but to
a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security
and freedom from surveillance. When the right of
privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is,
as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not a
policeman . . . .
.
.
.
.
.
“If the officers in this case were excused from the
constitutional duty of presenting their evidence to a
magistrate, it is difficult to think of [any] case in
which [a warrant] should be required.” Id., at 14–15.
I agree, and would not allow an expedient knock to over
ride the warrant requirement.* Instead, I would accord
that core requirement of the Fourth Amendment full
respect. When possible, “a warrant must generally be
secured,” the Court acknowledges. Ante, at 5. There is
every reason to conclude that securing a warrant was
entirely feasible in this case, and no reason to contract the
Fourth Amendment’s dominion.

——————
* The Court in Johnson was informed that “when [the officer]
knocked on [Johnson’s] door the ‘first thing that naturally struck [her]’
was to conceal the opium and the equipment for smoking it.” See Brief
for United States in Johnson v. United States, O. T. 1947, No. 329,
p. 17, n. 6. Had the Government in Johnson urged that the “shuffling
or noise” indicated evidence was at risk, would the result have
changed? Justice Jackson’s recognition of the primacy of the warrant
requirement suggests not. But see ante, at 15, n. 5 (distinguishing
Johnson on the ground that the Government did not contend “that
the officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of
evidence”).
