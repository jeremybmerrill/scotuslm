NOTICE: This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports. Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Wash­ ington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press. No. 10–235 [June 23, 2011]  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part III–A.* This case concerns the standard of causation applicable in cases arising under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), 45 U. S. C. §51 et seq. FELA renders rail­ roads liable for employees’ injuries or deaths “resulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.” §51. In accord with the text and purpose of the Act, this Court’s decision and the uniform view of federal appellate courts, we con­ clude that the Act does not incorporate “proximate cause” standards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions. The charge proper in FELA cases, we hold, sim­ ply tracks the language Congress employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a plaintiff employee’s injury if the railroad’s negligence played any part in bringing about the injury. Respondent Robert McBride worked as a locomotive
engineer for petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., which operates an interstate system of railroads. On April 12, 2004, CSX assigned McBride to assist on a local run be­ tween Evansville, Indiana, and Mount Vernon, Illinois. The run involved frequent starts and stops to add and remove individual rail cars, a process known as “switch­ ing.” The train McBride was to operate had an unusual engine configuration: two “wide-body” engines followed by three smaller conventional cabs. McBride protested that the configuration was unsafe, because switching with heavy, wide-body engines required constant use of a hand­ operated independent brake. But he was told to take the train as is. About ten hours into the run, McBride injured his hand while using the independent brake. Despite two surgeries and extensive physical therapy, he never re­ gained full use of the hand. Seeking compensation for his injury, McBride com­ menced a FELA action against CSX in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. He alleged that CSX was twice negligent: First, the railroad required him to use equipment unsafe for switching; second, CSX failed to train him to operate that equipment. App. 24a–26a. A verdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSX “was negligent” and that the “negligence caused or contributed to” McBride’s injury. Id., at 23a. CSX sought additional charges that the court declined to give. One of the rejected instructions would have required “the plaintiff [to] show that . . . the defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the injury.” Id., at 34a. Another would have defined “proximate cause” to mean “any cause which, in natural or probable sequence, produced the injury complained of,” with the qualification that a proxi­ mate cause “need not be the only cause, nor the last or nearest cause.” Id., at 32a. Instead, the District Court employed, as McBride re­
quested, the Seventh Circuit’s pattern instruction for FELA cases, which reads: “Defendant ‘caused or contributed to’ Plaintiff’s injury if Defendant’s negligence played a part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury. The mere fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean that the injury was caused by negligence.” Id., at 31a. For this instruction, the Seventh Circuit relied upon this U. S. 500 (1957). The jury returned a verdict for McBride, setting total damages at $275,000, but reducing that amount by one-third, the percentage the jury attributed to plaintiff’s negligence. App. 29a. CSX appealed to the Seventh Circuit, renewing its ob­ jection to the failure to instruct on “proximate cause.” Before the appellate court, CSX “maintain[ed] that the correct definition of proximate causation is a ‘direct rela­ tion between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.’ ” 598 F. 3d 388, 393, n. 3 (2010) (quoting Holmes 258, 268 (1992)). A properly instructed jury, CSX con­ tended, might have found that the chain of causation was too indirect, or that the engine configuration was unsafe because of its propensity to cause crashes during switch­ ing, not because of any risk to an engineer’s hands. Brief for Defendant-Appellant in No. 08–3557 (CA7), pp. 49–52. The Court of Appeals approved the District Court’s instruction and affirmed the judgment entered on the jury’s verdict. Rogers had “relaxed the proximate cause requirement” in FELA cases, the Seventh Circuit con­ cluded, a view of Rogers “echoed by every other court of appeals.” 598 F. 3d, at 399. While acknowledging that a handful of state courts “still appl[ied] traditional formula­ tions of proximate cause in FELA cases,” id., at 404, n. 7, the Seventh Circuit said it could hardly declare erroneous
an instruction that “simply paraphrase[d] the Supreme Court’s own words in Rogers,” id., at 406. We granted certiorari to decide whether the causation instruction endorsed by the Seventh Circuit is proper in FELA cases. 562 U. S. ___ (2010). That instruction does not include the term “proximate cause,” but does tell the jury defendant’s negligence must “pla[y] a part—no matter how small—in bringing about the [plaintiff’s] injury.” App. 31a. The railroad business was exceptionally hazardous at the dawn of the twentieth century. As we have recounted, “the physical dangers of railroading . . . resulted in the death or maiming of thousands of workers every year,” 542 (1994), including 281,645 casualties in the year 1908 alone, S. Rep. No. 61–432, p. 2 (1910). Enacted that same year in an effort to “shif[t] part of the human overhead of doing business from employees to their employers,” Gott shall, 512 U. S., at 542 (internal quotation marks omit­ ted), FELA prescribes: “Every common carrier by railroad . . . shall be li­ able in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier . . . for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such car­ rier . . . .” 45 U. S. C. §51 (emphasis added). Liability under FELA is limited in these key respects: Railroads are liable only to their employees, and only for injuries sustained in the course of employment. FELA’s language on causation, however, “is as broad as could be Given the breadth of the phrase “resulting in whole or in
part from the [railroad’s] negligence,” and Congress’ “hu­ manitarian” and “remedial goal[s],” we have recognized that, in comparison to tort litigation at common law, “a relaxed standard of causation applies under FELA.” Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 542–543. In our 1957 decision in Rogers, we described that relaxed standard as follows: “Under [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.” 352 U. S., at 506. As the Seventh Circuit emphasized, the instruction the District Court gave in this case, permitting a verdict for McBride if “[railroad] negligence played a part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury,” tracked the language of Rogers. If Rogers prescribes the definition of causation applicable under FELA, that instruction was 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (“Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the area of statutory interpretation . . . .”). While CSX does not ask us to disturb Rogers, the railroad contends that lower courts have overread that opinion. In CSX’s view, shared by the dissent, post, at 9– 10, Rogers was a narrowly focused decision that did not touch, concern, much less displace common-law formula­ tions of “proximate cause.” Understanding this argument requires some back­ ground. The term “proximate cause” is shorthand for a concept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should give rise to legal liability. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §42, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton). “What we . . . mean by the word ‘proximate,’ ” one noted jurist has explained, is simply this: “[B]ecause of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice,
the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events 248 N. Y. 339, 352, 162 N. E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J., dissenting). Common-law “proximate cause” formulations varied, and were often both constricted and difficult to comprehend. See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73–77, 812–813 (2d ed. 1888) (describing, for example, prescriptions pre­ cluding recovery in the event of any “intervening” cause or any contributory negligence). Some courts cut off liability if a “proximate cause” was not the sole proximate cause. Prosser and Keeton §65, p. 452 (noting “tendency . . . to look for some single, principal, dominant, ‘proximate’ cause of every injury”). Many used definitions resembling those CSX proposed to the District Court or urged in the Court of Appeals. See supra, at 2–3 (CSX proposed key words “natural or probable” or “direct” to describe required relationship between injury and alleged negligent con­ duct); Prosser and Keeton §43, pp. 282–283. Drawing largely on Justice Souter’s concurring opinion (2007), CSX contends that the Rogers “any part” test displaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contributory negligence or other “multi­ ple causes.” Brief for Petitioner 35 (internal quotation marks omitted).1 Rogers “did not address the requisite directness of a cause,” CSX argues, hence that question continues to be governed by restrictive common-law for­ mulations. Ibid. To evaluate CSX’s argument, we turn first to the facts of Rogers. The employee in that case was injured while burning off weeds and vegetation that lined the defen­
dant’s railroad tracks. A passing train had fanned the flames, which spread from the vegetation to the top of a culvert where the employee was standing. Attempting to escape, the employee slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries. 352 U. S., at 501–503. A Missouri state-court jury returned a verdict for the employee, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in fail­ ing to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault because of his lack of attention to 467, 472 (Mo. 1955). As the fire “was something extraordi­ nary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of the gravel,” the court felt “obliged to say [that] plaintiff’s injury was not the natural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.” Ibid. We held that the jury’s verdict should not have been upset. Describing two potential readings of the Missouri Supreme Court’s opinion, we condemned both. First, the court erred in concluding that the employee’s negligence was the “sole” cause of the injury, for the jury reasonably found that railroad negligence played a part. Rogers, 352 U. S., at 504–505. Second, the court erred insofar as it held that the railroad’s negligence was not a sufficient cause unless it was the more “probable” cause of the in­ jury. Id., at 505. FELA, we affirmed, did not incorporate any traditional common-law formulation of “proximate causation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendant’s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.” Id., at 506. Whether the railroad’s negli­ gent act was the “immediate reason” for the fall, we added, was “an irrelevant consideration.” Id., at 503. We then announced the “any part” test, id., at 506, and reiterated it several times. See, e.g., id., at 507 (“narro[w]” and “single inquiry” is whether “negligence of the employer played any part at all” in bringing about the injury); id., at 508
(FELA case “rarely presents more than the single question whether negligence of the employer played any part, how­ ever small, in the injury”).2 Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive state­ ment of the FELA causation standard. Notably, the Mis­ souri Supreme Court in Rogers did not doubt that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, including railroad negligence and employee negligence. See 284 S. W. 2d, at 472 (reciting FELA’s “in whole or in part” language). But the railroad’s part, according to the state court, was too indirect, not sufficiently “natural and probable,” to estab­ lish the requisite causation. Ibid. That is the very reason­ ing the Court rejected in Rogers. It is also the reasoning CSX asks us to resurrect. Our understanding is informed by the statutory history and precedent on which Rogers drew. Before FELA was enacted, the “harsh and technical” rules of state common law had “made recovery difficult or even impossible” for in­ ginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1, 3 (1964). “[D]issatisfied with the [railroad’s] common-law duty,” Congress sought to “sup­ plan[t] that duty with [FELA’s] far more drastic duty of paying damages for injury or death at work due in whole or in part to the employer’s negligence.” Rogers, 352 U. S., at 507. Yet, Rogers observed, the Missouri court and other lower courts continued to ignore FELA’s “sig­ nifican[t]” departures from the “ordinary common-law
negligence” scheme, to reinsert common-law formulations of causation involving “probabilities,” and consequently to “deprive litigants of their right to a jury determination.” Id., at 507, 509–510. Aiming to end lower court disregard of congressional purpose, the Rogers Court repeatedly called the “any part” test the “single” inquiry determining causation in FELA cases. Id., at 507, 508 (emphasis added). In short, CSX’s argument that the Rogers stan­ dard concerns only division of responsibility among multi­ ple actors, and not causation more generally, misses the thrust of our decision in that case. Tellingly, in announcing the “any part . . . in producing Co., 335 U. S. 520 (1949), a decision emphasizing that FELA had parted from traditional common-law formula­ tions of causation. What qualified as a “proximate” or legally sufficient cause in FELA cases, Coray had ex­ plained, was determined by the statutory phrase “result­ ing in whole or in part,” which Congress “selected . . . to fix liability” in language that was “simple and direct.” Id., at 524. That straightforward phrase, Coray observed, was incompatible with “dialectical subtleties” that common-law courts employed to determine whether a particular cause was sufficiently “substantial” to constitute a proximate cause. Id., at 523–524.3 Our subsequent decisions have confirmed that Rogers
announced a general standard for causation in FELA cases, not one addressed exclusively to injuries involving multiple potentially cognizable causes. The very day Rogers was announced, we applied its “any part” instruc­ tion in a case in which the sole causation issue was the directness or foreseeability of the connection between the carrier’s negligence and the plaintiff’s injury. See Fergu 524 (1957) (plurality opinion). 372 U. S. 108 (1963), we held jury findings for the plaintiff proper in a case presenting the following facts: For years, the railroad had allowed a fetid pool, containing “dead and decayed rats and pigeons,” to accumulate near its right-of­ way; while standing near the pool, the plaintiff-employee suffered an insect bite that became infected and required amputation of his legs. Id., at 109. The appellate court had concluded there was insufficient evidence of causation to warrant submission of the case to the jury. Id., at 112. We reversed, reciting the causation standard Rogers Cedar Rapids & Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166–167 (1969) (contrasting suit by railroad employee, who “is not required to prove common-law proximate causation but only that his injury resulted ‘in whole or in part’ from the railroad’s violation,” with suit by nonemployee, where “definition of causation . . . [is] left to state law”); Gott shall, 512 U. S., at 543 (“relaxed standard of causation applies under FELA”).4
In reliance on Rogers, every Court of Appeals that re­ views judgments in FELA cases has approved jury in­ structions on causation identical or substantively equiva­ lent to the Seventh Circuit’s instruction.5 Each appellate court has rejected common-law formulations of proximate cause of the kind CSX requested in this case. See supra, at 2–3. The current model federal instruction, recognizing that the “FELA causation standard is distinct from the usual proximate cause standard,” reads: “The fourth element [of a FELA action] is whether an injury to the plaintiff resulted in whole or part from the negligence of the railroad or its employees or agents. In other words, did such negligence play any
part, even the slightest, in bringing about an injury to the plaintiff?” 5 L. Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions–Civil ¶89.02, pp. 89–38, 89–40, and com­ ment (2010) (hereinafter Sand). Since shortly after Rogers was decided, charges of this order have been accepted as the federal model. See W. Mathes & E. Devitt, Federal Jury Practice and Instruc­ tions §84.12, p. 517 (1965) (under FELA, injury “is proxi­ mately caused by” the defendant’s negligence if the negli­ gence “played any part, no matter how small, in bringing about or actually causing the injury”).6 The overwhelming majority of state courts7 and scholars8 similarly compre­ hend FELA’s causation standard. In sum, the understanding of Rogers we here affirm “has been accepted as settled law for several decades.” IBP, [more than 50] years in which it could have corrected our decision in [Rogers] if it disagreed with it, and has not ways Comm’n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991). Countless judges have instructed countless juries in language drawn from Rogers. To discard or restrict the Rogers instruction now would ill serve the goals of “stability” and “predictability”
that the doctrine of statutory stare decisis aims to ensure. Ibid. CSX nonetheless insists that proximate causation, as captured in the charge and definitions CSX requested, is a concept fundamental to actions sounding in negligence. The Rogers “any part” instruction opens the door to unlim­ ited liability, CSX worries, inviting juries to impose liabil­ ity on the basis of “but for” causation. The dissent shares these fears. Post, at 5–6, 15–16. But a half century’s experience with Rogers gives us little cause for concern: CSX’s briefs did not identify even one trial in which the instruction generated an absurd or untoward award.9 Nor has the dissent managed to uncover such a case. Post, at 13–14 (citing no actual case but conjuring up images of falling pianos and spilled coffee). While some courts have said that Rogers eliminated the concept of proximate cause in FELA cases,10 we think it “more accurate . . . to recognize that Rogers describes the test for proximate causation applicable in FELA suits.” Sorrell, 549 U. S., at 178 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment). That understanding was expressed by the
Opinion GINSBURG, drafters of the 1965 federal model instructions, see supra, at 11–12: Under FELA, injury “is proximately caused” by the railroad’s negligence if that negligence “played any part . . . in . . . causing the injury.” Avoiding “dialectical subtleties” that confound attempts to convey intelligibly to juries just what “proximate cause” means, see Coray, 335 U. S., at 524, the Rogers instruction uses the everyday words contained in the statute itself. Jurors can compre­ hend those words and apply them in light of their ex­ perience and common sense. Unless and until Congress orders otherwise, we see no good reason to tamper with an instruction tied to FELA’s text, long employed by lower courts, and hardly shown to be unfair or unworkable. As we have noted, see supra, at 5–6, the phrase “proxi­ mate cause” is shorthand for the policy-based judgment that not all factual causes contributing to an injury should be legally cognizable causes. Prosser and Keeton explain: “In a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go forward to eternity, and the causes of an event go back to the dawn of human events, and beyond.” §41, p. 264. To prevent “infinite liability,” ibid., courts and legislatures appropriately place limits on the chain of causation that may support recovery on any particular claim. The term “proximate cause” itself is hardly essential to the imposition of such limits. It is a term notoriously confusing. See, e.g., Prosser and Keeton §42, p. 273 (“The word ’proximate’ is a legacy of Lord Chancellor Bacon, who in his time committed other sins. . . . It is an unfortunate word, which places an entirely wrong emphasis upon the factor of physical or mechanical closeness. For this reason ‘legal cause’ or perhaps even ‘responsible cause’ would be a more appropriate term.” (footnotes omitted)). And the lack of consensus on any one definition of “proximate cause” is manifest. Id., §41, p. 263. Common­
Opinion GINSBURG, law formulations include, inter alia, the “immediate” or “nearest” antecedent test; the “efficient, producing cause” test; the “substantial factor” test; and the “probable,” or “natural and probable,” or “foreseeable” consequence test. 103, 106–121 (1911); Smith, Legal Cause in Actions of Notably, CSX itself did not settle on a uniform definition of the term “proximate cause” in this litigation, nor does the dissent. In the District Court, CSX requested a jury instruction defining “proximate cause” to mean “any cause which, in natural or probable sequence, produced the injury complained of.” App. 32a. On appeal, “CSX main­ tain[ed] that the correct definition . . . is a ‘direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.’ ” 598 F. 3d, at 393, n. 3. Before this Court, CSX called for “a demonstration that the plaintiff’s injury resulted from the wrongful conduct in a way that was natural, probable, and foreseeable.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 9–10. Lay triers, studies show, are scarcely aided by charges so phrased. See Steele & Thornburg, Jury Instructions: A 88–92, 110 (1988) (85% of actual and potential jurors were unable to understand a pattern proximate cause instruc­ tion similar to the one requested by CSX); Charrow & Charrow, Making Legal Language Understandable: A Psycholinguistic Study of Jury Instructions, 79 Colum. misunderstood proximate cause to mean “approximate cause” or “estimated cause”). In light of the potential of “proximate cause” instructions to leave jurors at sea, it is not surprising that the drafters of the Restatement (Third) of Torts avoided the term altogether. See 1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm §29 (2005) (confining liability to “harms that result from the risks that made the actor’s conduct tortious”); id.,
Comment b. Congress, it is true, has written the words “proximate cause” into a number of statutes.11 But when the legisla­ tive text uses less legalistic language, e.g., “caused by,” “occasioned by,” “in consequence of,” or, as in FELA, “resulting in whole or in part from,” and the legislative purpose is to loosen constraints on recovery, there is little reason for courts to hark back to stock, judge-made proximate-cause formulations. See Smith, Legal Cause in (1912). FELA’s language is straightforward: railroads are made answerable in damages for an employee’s “injury or death resulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.” 45 U. S. C. §51. The argument for importing into FELA’s text “previous judicial definitions or dicta” originating in non­ statutory common-law actions, see Smith, Legal Cause in Actions of Tort (Continued), supra, at 235, misapprehends how foreseeability figures in FELA cases. “[R]easonable foreseeability of harm,” we clarified in Gallick, is indeed “an essential ingredient of [FELA] neg ligence.” 372 U. S., at 117 (emphasis added). The jury, therefore, must be asked, initially: Did the carrier “fai[l] to observe that degree of care which people of ordinary pru­ dence and sagacity would use under the same or similar circumstances[?]” Id., at 118. In that regard, the jury may be told that “[the railroad’s] duties are measured by
what is reasonably foreseeable under like circumstances.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, “[i]f a per­ son has no reasonable ground to anticipate that a par­ ticular condition . . . would or might result in a mishap and injury, then the party is not required to do anything to correct [the] condition.” Id., at 118, n. 7 (internal quota­ tion marks omitted).12 If negligence is proved, however, and is shown to have “played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury,” Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506 (empha­ sis added),13 then the carrier is answerable in damages even if “the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it occurred” was not “[p]robable” or “foreseeable.” Gallick, 372 U. S., at 120–121, and n. 8 (internal quotation marks omitted); see 4 F. Harper, F. James, & O. Gray, Law of Torts §20.5(6), p. 203 (3d ed. 2007); 5 Sand 89–21. Properly instructed on negligence and causation, and told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their “common sense” in reviewing the evidence, see Tr. 205 (Aug. 19, 2008), juries would have no warrant to award damages in far out “but for” scenarios. Indeed, judges would have no warrant to submit such cases to the jury. 1958) (alleged negligence was failure to provide lavatory for female employee; employee was injured by a suitcase while looking for a lavatory in a passenger car; applying Rogers, appellate court affirmed lower court’s dismissal for F. 2d 1, 2–5 (CA1 1990) (employee suffered stress-related
heart attack after railroad forced him to work more than 12 hours with inadequate breaks; applying Rogers, appel­ late court affirmed grant of summary judgment for lack of causation). See also supra, at 13 (Rogers has generated no extravagant jury awards or appellate court decisions). In addition to the constraints of common sense, FELA’s limitations on who may sue, and for what, reduce the risk of exorbitant liability. As earlier noted, see supra, at 4, the statute confines the universe of compensable injuries to those sustained by employees, during employment. §51. Hence there are no unforeseeable plaintiffs in FELA cases. And the statute weeds out the injuries most likely to bear only a tenuous relationship to railroad negligence, namely, those occurring outside the workplace.14 There is a real risk, on the other hand, that the “in natural or probable sequence” charge sought by CSX would mislead. If taken to mean the plaintiff’s injury must probably (“more likely than not”) follow from the railroad’s negligent conduct, then the force of FELA’s “resulting in whole or in part” language would be blunted. Railroad negligence would “probably” cause a worker’s in­ jury only if that negligence was a dominant contributor to the injury, not merely a contributor in any part. * * * For the reasons stated, it is not error in a FELA case to refuse a charge embracing stock proximate cause termi­ nology. Juries in such cases are properly instructed that a
defendant railroad “caused or contributed to” a railroad worker’s injury “if [the railroad's] negligence played a part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury.” That, indeed, is the test Congress prescribed for proximate causation in FELA cases. See supra, at 9, 13. As the courts below so held, the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is Affirmed.

* JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part III–A of this opinion.

1 In Sorrell, the Court held that the causation standard was the same
for railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence, but said
nothing about what that standard should be. 549 U. S., at 164–165.

2 In face of Rogers’ repeated admonition that the “any part . . . in pro­
ducing the injury” test was the single test for causation under FELA,
the dissent speculates that Rogers was simply making a veiled ref­
erence to a particular form of modified comparative negligence, i.e.,
allowing plaintiff to prevail on showing that her negligence was “slight”
while the railroad’s was “gross.” Post, at 9–10. That is not what Rogers
conveyed. To repeat, Rogers instructed that “the test of a jury case
[under FELA] is simply whether . . . employer negligence played any
part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.” 352 U. S., at 506.


——————
3 The

dissent, while recognizing “the variety of formulations” courts
have employed to define “proximate cause,” post, at 2, does not say
which of the many formulations it would declare applicable in FELA
cases. We regard the phrase “negligence played a part—no matter how
small,” see Rogers, 352 U. S., at 508, as synonymous with “negligence
played any part, even the slightest,” see id., at 506, and the phrase “in
producing the injury” as synonymous with the phrase “in bringing
about the injury.” We therefore approve both the Seventh Circuit’s
instruction and the “any part, even the slightest, in producing the
injury” formulation. The host of definitions of proximate cause, in
contrast, are hardly synonymous.


——————
4 CSX and the dissent observe, correctly, that some of our pre-Rogers
decisions invoked common-law formulations of proximate cause. See,
e.g., Brady v. Southern R. Co., 320 U. S. 476, 483 (1943) (injury must
be “the natural and probable consequence of the negligence” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the “natural or probable” charge
that CSX requested was drawn from Brady, which in turn relied on a
pre-FELA case, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469,


——————
475 (1877). But other pre-Rogers FELA decisions invoked no common­
law formulations. See, e.g., Union Pacific R. Co. v. Huxoll, 245 U. S.
535, 537 (1918) (approving instruction asking whether negligence “con­
tribute[d] ‘in whole or in part’ to cause the death”); Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 524 (1949) (rejecting use of common-law
“dialectical subtleties” concerning the term “proximate cause,” and ap­
proving use of “simple and direct” statutory language). We rely on
Rogers not because “time begins in 1957,” post, at 7, but because Rogers
stated a clear instruction, comprehensible by juries: Did the railroad’s
“negligence pla[y] any part, even the slightest, in producing [the plain­
tiff ’s] injury”? 352 U. S., at 506. In so instructing, Rogers replaced the
array of formulations then prevalent. We have repeated the Rogers
instruction in subsequent opinions, and lower courts have employed it
for over 50 years. To unsettle the law as the dissent urges would show

five Circuits that have published pattern FELA causation in­
structions use the language of the statute or of Rogers rather than
traditional common-law formulations. See Brief for Academy of Rail
Labor Attorneys as Amicus Curiae 19–20.
7 See id., at 21–22, 25–27 (collecting cases and pattern instructions).
The parties dispute the exact figures, but all agree there are no more
than a handful of exceptions. The Seventh Circuit found “[a]t most”
three. 598 F. 3d 388, 404, n. 7 (2010).
8 See, e.g., DeParcq, The Supreme Court and the Federal Employers’
Liability Act, 1956–57 Term, 36 Texas L. Rev. 145, 154–155 (1957); 2 J.

9 Pressed on this point at oral argument, CSX directed us to two cases
cited by its amicus. In Richards v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 330 F. 3d
428, 431, 437 (CA6 2003), a defective brake malfunctioned en route,
and the employee was injured while inspecting underneath the train to
locate the problem; the Sixth Circuit sent the case to a jury. In Norfolk
Southern R. Co. v. Schumpert, 270 Ga. App. 782, 783–786, 608 S. E. 2d
236, 238–239 (2004), the employee was injured while replacing a
coupling device that fell to the ground because of a negligently absent
pin; the court upheld a jury award. In our view, the causal link in
these cases is hardly farfetched; in fact, in both, the lower courts
observed that the evidence did not show mere “but for” causation. See
Richards, 330 F. 3d, at 437, and n. 5; Schumpert, 270 Ga. App., at 784,
608 S. E. 2d, at 239.
10 See, e.g., Summers, 132 F. 3d, at 606; Oglesby v. Southern Pacific
Transp. Co., 6 F. 3d 603, 609 (CA9 1993).

11 See, e.g., Act of Sept. 7, 1916, ch. 458, §1, 39 Stat. 742–743 (United
States not liable to injured employee whose “intoxication . . . is the
proximate cause of the injury”); Act of Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 105, §306, 40
Stat. 407 (United States liable to member of Armed Forces for post­
discharge disability that “proximately result[ed] from [a pre-discharge]
injury”); Act of June 5, 1924, ch. 261, §2, 43 Stat. 389 (United States
liable for “any disease proximately caused” by federal employment).

12 A

railroad’s violation of a safety statute, however, is negligence per
se. See Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U. S. 426, 438 (1958).
13 The dissent protests that we would require only a showing that
“defendant was negligent in the first place.” Post, at 13. But under
Rogers and the pattern instructions based on Rogers, the jury must find
that defendant’s negligence in fact “played a part—no matter how
small—in bringing about the injury.” See supra, at 2–3, 11–12 (Sev­
enth Circuit pattern instruction and model federal instructions).

14 CSX observes, as does the dissent, post, at 4, that we have applied
traditional notions of proximate causation under the RICO, antitrust,
and securities fraud statutes. But those statutes cover broader classes
of potential injuries and complainants. And none assign liability in
language akin to FELA’s “resulting in whole or in part” standard. §51
(emphasis added). See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corpo
ration, 503 U. S. 258, 265–268 (1992); Associated Gen. Contractors of
Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519, 529–535 (1983); Dura Pharma
ceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 342–346 (2005).
