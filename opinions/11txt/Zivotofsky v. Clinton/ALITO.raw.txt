ZIVOTOFSKY, PETITIONER v. HILLARY

RODHAM CLINTON, SECRETARY 

OF STATE

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

[March 26, 2012]


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.
This case presents a narrow question, namely, whether
the statutory provision at issue infringes the power of the
President to regulate the contents of a passport. This case
does not require the Judiciary to decide whether the power
to recognize foreign governments and the extent of their
territory is conferred exclusively on the President or is
shared with Congress. Petitioner does not claim that the
statutory provision in question represents an attempt by
Congress to dictate United States policy regarding the
status of Jerusalem. Instead, petitioner contends in effect
that Congress has the power to mandate that an American
citizen born abroad be given the option of including in his
passport and Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA)
what amounts to a statement of personal belief on the
status of Jerusalem.
Powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution certainly give Congress a measure of authority to prescribe
the contents of passports and CRBAs. The Constitution
gives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce,
Art. I, §8, cl. 3, and this power includes the power to regulate the entry of persons into this country, see Henderson

ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

v. Mayor of New York, 92 U. S. 259, 270–271 (1876). The
Constitution also gives Congress the power to make a
“uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and
pursuant to this power, Congress has enacted laws concerning the citizenship of children born abroad to parents
who are citizens of this country, see United States v. Wong
Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688 (1898). These powers allow
Congress to mandate that identifying information be included in passports and CRBAs.
The President also has a measure of authority concerning the contents of passports and CRBAs. The President
has broad authority in the field of foreign affairs, see, e.g.,
American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414
(2003), and, historically, that authority has included the
power to issue passports, even in the absence of any formal congressional conferral of authority to do so. See
Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (explaining that
“[p]rior to 1856, when there was no statute on the subject,
the common perception was that the issuance of a passport was committed to the sole discretion of the Executive
and that the Executive would exercise this power in the
interests of the national security and foreign policy of the
United States”). We have described a passport as “a letter
of introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for
the bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bearer.” Id., at 292. This is apparent from the first page of
petitioner’s passport, which reads as follows:
“The Secretary of State of the United States of America hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit
the citizen / national of the United States named herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of
need to give all lawful aid and protection.” App. 19.
Similarly, a CRBA is a certification made by a consular official that the bearer acquired United States citizenship
at birth. See id., at 20.

ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

Under our case law, determining the constitutionality of
an Act of Congress may present a political question, but I
do not think that the narrow question presented here falls
within that category. Delineating the precise dividing line
between the powers of Congress and the President with
respect to the contents of a passport is not an easy matter,
but I agree with the Court that it does not constitute a
political question that the Judiciary is unable to decide.
