RODHAM CLINTON, SECRETARY 

OF STATE



ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT



[March 26, 2012]




JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.
I join Part I of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s opinion. As she
points out, Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), set forth
several categories of legal questions that the Court had
previously held to be “political questions” inappropriate for
judicial determination. Those categories include (1) instances in which the Constitution clearly commits decisionmaking power to another branch of Government, and
(2) issues lacking judicially manageable standards for
resolution. Id., at 217. They also include (3) issues that
courts cannot decide without making “an initial policy
determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,”
(4) issues that a court cannot independently decide “without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches
of government,” (5) cases in which there is “an unusual
need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision
already made,” and (6) cases in which there is a potential
for “embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by
various departments on one question.” Ibid.
As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR also points out, these categories
(and in my view particularly the last four) embody “circumstances in which prudence may counsel against a

court’s resolution of an issue presented.” Ante, at 3 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see
Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 253 (1993) (Souter,
J., concurring in judgment) (the political-question doctrine
“deriv[es] in large part from prudential concerns about the
respect we owe the political departments”); Goldwater v.
Carter, 444 U. S. 996, 1000 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring
in judgment) (“[T]he political-question doctrine rests in
part on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect
among the three branches of Government”); see also Jaffe,
Standing to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74
Harv. L. Rev. 1265, 1304 (1961) (prudence counsels hesitation where a legal issue is “felt to be so closely related to
a complex of decisions not within the court’s jurisdiction
that its resolution by the court would either be poor in
itself or would jeopardize sound decisions in the larger
complex”).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR adds that the circumstances in
which these prudential considerations lead the Court not
to decide a case otherwise properly before it are rare.
Ante, at 7. I agree. But in my view we nonetheless have
before us such a case. Four sets of prudential considerations, taken together, lead me to that conclusion.
First, the issue before us arises in the field of foreign
affairs. (Indeed, the statutory provision before us is a
subsection of a section that concerns the relation between
Jerusalem and the State of Israel. See §214 of the Foreign
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat.
1365 (“United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as
the Capital of Israel”).) The Constitution primarily delegates the foreign affairs powers “to the political departments of the government, Executive and Legislative,” not
to the Judiciary. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.
Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948); see also
Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803) (noting
discretionary foreign affairs functions of Secretary of State

BREYER, J., dissenting

as beyond the power of the Judiciary to review). And that
fact is not surprising. Decisionmaking in this area typically is highly political. It is “delicate” and “complex.” Chicago & Southern Air Lines, 333 U. S., at 111. It often
rests upon information readily available to the Executive
Branch and to the intelligence committees of Congress,
but not readily available to the courts. Ibid. It frequently
is highly dependent upon what Justice Jackson called
“prophecy.” Ibid. And the creation of wise foreign policy
typically lies well beyond the experience or professional
capacity of a judge. Ibid. At the same time, where foreign
affairs is at issue, the practical need for the United States
to speak “with one voice and ac[t] as one,” is particularly
important. See United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 242
(1942) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also R. Fallon,
J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and
Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System
240 (6th ed. 2009).
The result is a judicial hesitancy to make decisions that
have significant foreign policy implications, as reflected in
the fact that many of the cases in which the Court has invoked the political-question doctrine have arisen in this
area, e.g., cases in which the validity of a treaty depended
upon the partner state’s constitutional authority, Doe v.
Braden, 16 How. 635, 657 (1854), or upon its continuing
existence, Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 285 (1902);
cases concerning the existence of foreign states, governments, belligerents, and insurgents, Oetjen v. Central
Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297, 302 (1918); United States v.
Klintock, 5 Wheat. 144, 149 (1820); United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634–635 (1818); and cases concerning
the territorial boundaries of foreign states, Williams v.
Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420 (1839); Foster v. Neilson,
2 Pet. 253, 307 (1829). See Baker, supra, at 186, 211–213
(citing these cases as the Court’s principal foreignrelations political-question cases); see also Fallon, supra,

ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
BREYER, J., dissenting

at 243–247.
Second, if the courts must answer the constitutional
question before us, they may well have to evaluate the
foreign policy implications of foreign policy decisions. The
constitutional question focuses upon a statutory provision,
§214(d), that says: The Secretary of State, upon the request of a U. S. citizen born in Jerusalem (or upon the
request of the citizen’s legal guardian), shall “record” in
the citizen’s passport or consular birth report “the place
of birth as Israel.” 116 Stat. 1366. And the question is
whether this statute unconstitutionally seeks to limit the
President’s inherent constitutional authority to make certain kinds of foreign policy decisions. See American Ins.
Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414–415 (2003)
(citing cases); Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417,
445 (1998) (“[T]his Court has recognized that in the foreign affairs arena, the President has ‘a degree of discretion
and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be
admissible were domestic affairs alone involved’ ” (quoting
United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S.
304, 320 (1936))); cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.
v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 637–638 (1952) (Jackson, J.,
concurring).
The Secretary of State argues that the President’s constitutional authority to determine foreign policy includes
the power to recognize foreign governments, that this
Court has long recognized that the latter power belongs
to the President exclusively, that the power includes the
power to determine claims over disputed territory as well
as the policy governing recognition decisions, and that the
statute unconstitutionally limits the President’s exclusive
authority to exercise these powers. See U. S. Const., Art.
II, §2, cl. 2; Art. II, §3; e.g., Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How.
38, 50–51 (1852) (recognition); Williams, supra, at 420
(disputed territory); Pink, supra, at 229 (recognition policy); see also Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (execu-

tive passport authority).
Zivotofsky, supported by several Members of Congress,
points out that the Constitution also grants Congress
powers related to foreign affairs, such as the powers to
declare war, to regulate foreign commerce, and to regulate
naturalization. See Art. I, §8, cls. 3, 4, 11; see also American Ins. Assn., supra, at 414. They add that Congress may
share some of the recognition power and its attendant
power of determining claims over disputed territory. E.g.,
Palmer, supra, at 634 (recognition); Jones v. United States,
137 U. S. 202, 212 (1890) (disputed territory). And they
add that Congress may enact laws concerning travel into
this country and concerning the citizenship of children
born abroad to U. S. citizens. See Henderson v. Mayor of
New York, 92 U. S. 259, 270–271 (1876) (travel); Fong Yue
Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 714 (1893) (immigration); United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688
(1898) (citizenship). They argue that these powers include
the power to specify the content of a passport (or consular
birth report). And when such a specification takes the
form of statutory law, they say, the Constitution requires
the President (through the Secretary of State) to execute
that statute. See Art. II, §3.
Were the statutory provision undisputedly concerned
only with purely administrative matters (or were its enforcement undisputedly to involve only major foreign
policy matters), judicial efforts to answer the constitutional question might not involve judges in trying to answer questions of foreign policy. But in the Middle East,
administrative matters can have implications that extend
far beyond the purely administrative. Political reactions
in that region can prove uncertain. And in that context it
may well turn out that resolution of the constitutional
argument will require a court to decide how far the statute, in practice, reaches beyond the purely administrative,
determining not only whether but also the extent to

ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
BREYER, J., dissenting

which enforcement will interfere with the President’s
ability to make significant recognition-related foreign
policy decisions.
Certainly the parties argue as if that were so. Zivotofsky, for example, argues that replacing “Jerusalem” on
his passport with “Israel” will have no serious foreign
policy significance. See Brief for Petitioner 43, 46–52;
Reply Brief for Petitioner 25–26. And in support he points
to (1) a State Department official’s statement that birthplace designation serves primarily as “an element of identification,” while omitting mention of recognition; (2) the
fact that the State Department has recorded births in
unrecognized territories in the region, such as the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank, apparently without adverse
effect; and (3) the fact that sometimes Jerusalem does
(because of what the Government calls “clerical errors”)
carry with it the name of “Israel” on certain official documents, again apparently without seriously adverse effect.
See Brief for Petitioner 7–10, 15, 43, 50; App. 50, 58–60,
75–76. Moreover, Zivotofsky says, it is unfair to allow the
100,000 or so Americans born in cities that the United
States recognizes as under Israeli sovereignty, such as Tel
Aviv or Haifa, the right to a record that mentions Israel,
while denying that privilege to the 50,000 or so Americans
born in Jerusalem. See Brief for Petitioner 18–20, 48–49;
App. 48.
At the same time, the Secretary argues that listing
Israel on the passports (and consular birth reports) of
Americans born in Jerusalem will have significantly adverse foreign policy effects. See Brief for Respondent 8,
37–41. She says that doing so would represent “ ‘an official decision by the United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city located within Israel,’ ” id., at 38–39, that it
“would be interpreted as an official act of recognizing
Jerusalem as being under Israeli sovereignty,” App. 56,
and that our “national security interests” consequently

7

BREYER, J., dissenting

“would be significantly harmed,” id., at 49. Such an action, she says, “ ‘would signal, symbolically or concretely,
that’ ” the United States “ ‘recognizes that Jerusalem is a
city that is located within the sovereign territory of Israel,’” and doing so, “‘would critically compromise the ability
of the United States to work with Israelis, Palestinians
and others in the region to further the peace process.’ ”
Brief for Respondent 2; App. 52–53. She adds that the
very enactment of this statutory provision in 2002 produced headlines in the Middle East stating the “the U. S.
now recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.” Id., at 231;
Brief for Respondent 10; see also App. 53–55, 227–231.
A judge’s ability to evaluate opposing claims of this kind
is minimal. At the same time, a judicial effort to do so
risks inadvertently jeopardizing sound foreign policy
decisionmaking by the other branches of Government.
How, for example, is this Court to determine whether, or
the extent to which, the continuation of the adjudication
that it now orders will itself have a foreign policy effect?
Third, the countervailing interests in obtaining judicial
resolution of the constitutional determination are not
particularly strong ones. Zivotofsky does not assert the
kind of interest, e.g., an interest in property or bodily
integrity, which courts have traditionally sought to protect. See, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 673–
674 (1977) (enduring commitment to legal protection of
bodily integrity). Nor, importantly, does he assert an
interest in vindicating a basic right of the kind that the
Constitution grants to individuals and that courts traditionally have protected from invasion by the other branches
of Government. And I emphasize this fact because the
need for judicial action in such cases can trump the foreign
policy concerns that I have mentioned. As Professor Jaffe
pointed out many years ago, “Our courts would not refuse
to entertain habeas corpus to test the constitutionality of
the imprisonment of an alleged Chinese agent even if it

ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
BREYER, J., dissenting

were clear that his imprisonment was closely bound up
with our relations to the Chinese government.” 74 Harv.
L. Rev., at 1304; see also T. Franck, Political Questions/
Judicial Answers 63–64 (1992); cf. Boumediene v. Bush,
553 U. S. 723, 755 (2008).
The interest that Zivotofsky asserts, however, is akin to
an ideological interest. See Brief for Petitioner 54 (citizen
born in Jerusalem, unlike citizen born in Tel Aviv or
Haifa, does not have the “option” to “specify or suppress the
name of a country that accords with his or her ideology”);
see also id., at 19 (State Department policy bars citizens
born in Jerusalem “from identifying their birthplace in a
manner that conforms with their convictions”). And insofar as an individual suffers an injury that is purely ideological, courts have often refused to consider the matter,
leaving the injured party to look to the political branches
for protection. E.g., Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 66–
67 (1986); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 739–740
(1972). This is not to say that Zivotofsky’s claim is unimportant or that the injury is not serious or even that it is
purely ideological. It is to point out that those suffering
somewhat similar harms have sometimes had to look to
the political branches for resolution of relevant legal issues. Cf. United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179
(1974); Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972).
Fourth, insofar as the controversy reflects different
foreign policy views among the political branches of Government, those branches have nonjudicial methods of
working out their differences. Cf. Goldwater, 444 U. S., at
1002, 1004 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and
Stewart and Stevens, JJ., concurring in judgment) (finding
in similar fact strong reason for Judiciary not to decide
treaty power question). The Executive and Legislative
Branches frequently work out disagreements through
ongoing contacts and relationships, involving, for example,
budget authorizations, confirmation of personnel, commit-

BREYER, J., dissenting

tee hearings, and a host of more informal contacts, which,
taken together, ensure that, in practice, Members of Congress as well as the President play an important role in
the shaping of foreign policy. Indeed, both the Legislative
Branch and the Executive Branch typically understand
the need to work each with the other in order to create
effective foreign policy. In that understanding, those
related contacts, and the continuous foreign policy-related
relationship lies the possibility of working out the kind of
disagreement we see before us. Moreover, if application of
the political-question “doctrine ultimately turns, as
Learned Hand put it, on ‘how importunately the occasion
demands an answer,’ ” Nixon, 506 U. S., at 253 (Souter, J.,
concurring in judgment) (quoting L. Hand, The Bill of
Rights 15 (1958)), the ability of the political branches to
work out their differences minimizes the need for judicial
intervention here.
The upshot is that this case is unusual both in its minimal need for judicial intervention and in its more serious
risk that intervention will bring about “embarrassment,”
show lack of “respect” for the other branches, and potentially disrupt sound foreign policy decisionmaking. For
these prudential reasons, I would hold that the politicalquestion doctrine bars further judicial consideration of
this case. And I would affirm the Court of Appeals’ similar conclusion.
With respect, I dissent.
