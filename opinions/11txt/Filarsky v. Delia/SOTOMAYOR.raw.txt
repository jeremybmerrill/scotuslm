STEVE A. FILARSKY, PETITIONER v. NICHOLAS B.

DELIA

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 17, 2012] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring.
The Court of Appeals denied qualified immunity to
Filarsky solely because, as retained outside counsel, he
was not a formal employee of the City of Rialto. I agree
with and join today’s opinion holding that this distinction
is not a sound basis on which to deny immunity.
I add only that it does not follow that every private
individual who works for the government in some capacity
necessarily may claim qualified immunity when sued
under 42 U. S. C. §1983. Such individuals must satisfy
our usual test for conferring immunity. As the Court
explains, that test “look[s] to the ‘general principles of tort
immunities and defenses’ applicable at common law, and
the reasons we have afforded protection from suit under
§1983.” Ante, at 5 (quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S.
409, 418 (1976)).
Thus in Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399 (1997),
we denied qualified immunity to prison guards who were
privately employed, despite their quintessentially public
function. We did so because we found “no special reasons
significantly favoring an extension of governmental immunity” in that context. Id., at 412. We left open, however, the question whether immunity would be appropriate
for “a private individual briefly associated with a government body, serving as an adjunct to government in an

essential governmental activity, or acting under close official supervision.” Id., at 413.
Filarsky, supported by the United States as amicus
curiae, contends that he fits into this coda because he
worked in close coordination with and under the supervision of City employees. Whether Filarsky was supervised
by those employees, and did not himself do the supervising, is unclear. But there is no doubt that Filarsky
worked alongside the employees in investigating Delia.
In such circumstances, I agree that Filarsky should be
allowed to claim qualified immunity from a §1983 suit.
As the Court’s opinion persuasively explains, there is a
“ ‘firmly rooted’ tradition of immunity” applicable to individuals who perform government work in capacities other
than as formal employees. Id., at 404; see ante, at 5–11.
And conferring qualified immunity on individuals like
Filarsky helps “protec[t] government’s ability to perform
its traditional functions,” and thereby helps “protect the
public at large.” Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 167–168
(1992). When a private individual works closely with
immune government employees, there is a real risk that
the individual will be intimidated from performing his
duties fully if he, and he alone, may bear the price of
liability for collective conduct. See ante, at 12; see also
ante, at 13 (noting distraction caused to immune public
employees by §1983 litigation brought against nonimmune
associates).
This does not mean that a private individual may assert
qualified immunity only when working in close coordination with government employees. For example, Richardson’s suggestion that immunity is also appropriate for
individuals “serving as an adjunct to government in an
essential governmental activity,” 521 U. S., at 413, would
seem to encompass modern-day special prosecutors and
comparable individuals hired for their independence.
There may yet be other circumstances in which immunity

is warranted for private actors. The point is simply that
such cases should be decided as they arise, as is our
longstanding practice in the field of immunity law.
