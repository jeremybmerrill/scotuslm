BILLY JOE REYNOLDS, PETITIONER v. UNITED 

STATES 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[January 23, 2012]


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification
Act (Act), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U. S. C. §16901 et seq. (2006
ed. and Supp. III), requires those convicted of certain sex
crimes to provide state governments with (and to update)
information, such as names and current addresses, for
inclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.
§§16912(a), 16913–16914, 16919(a) (2006 ed.). The Act
makes it a crime for a person who is “required to register” under the Act and who “travels in interstate or foreign
commerce” knowingly to “fai[l] to register or update a registration . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §2250(a). The question before us concerns the date on which this federal registration requirement took effect with respect to sex offenders
convicted before the Act became law.
The Act defines the term “sex offender” as including
these pre-Act offenders. 42 U. S. C. §16911(1); see Carr v.
United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7). It
says that “[a] sex offender shall register.” §16913(a). And
it further says that “[t]he Attorney General shall have the
authority to specify the applicability of the [registration]

REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

requirements . . . to sex offenders convicted before the
enactment of this chapter . . . .” §16913(d) (emphasis
added). In our view, these provisions, read together, mean
that the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to
pre-Act offenders until the Attorney General specifies that
they do apply. We reverse a Court of Appeals determination that, in effect, holds the contrary.
I

A

The new federal Act reflects Congress’ awareness that
pre-Act registration law consisted of a patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration systems. See
73 Fed. Reg. 38045 (2008). The Act seeks to make those
systems more uniform and effective. It does so by repealing several earlier federal laws that also (but less effectively) sought uniformity; by setting forth comprehensive
registration-system standards; by making federal funding
contingent on States’ bringing their systems into compliance with those standards; by requiring both state and
federal sex offenders to register with relevant jurisdictions
(and to keep registration information current); and by
creating federal criminal sanctions applicable to those who
violate the Act’s registration requirements. 18 U. S. C.
§2250(a) (criminal provision); 42 U. S. C. §§16911(10),
16913–16916 (2006 ed. and Supp. III) (registration requirements); §16925 (federal funding); §129, 120 Stat. 600
(repeal of earlier laws).
The Act’s criminal penalty applies to “[w]ho[m]ever . . .
is required to register under [the Act].” 18 U. S. C.
§2250(a). It says that such a person (a federal sex offender
or a nonfederal sex offender who travels in interstate
commerce) must not knowingly fail “to register or update
a registration as required by [the Act].” Ibid. (emphasis
added); see Appendix, infra, at 14.
The relevant registration requirements are set forth in

Opinion of the Court

an Act provision that states:
“Registry requirements for sex offenders
“(a) In general
“A sex offender [defined to include any offender who
was convicted of a sex offense] shall register, and keep
the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the
offender resides, where the offender is an employee,
and where the offender is a student. . . .
“(b) Initial registration
“The sex offender shall initially register [either] before completing a sentence of imprisonment with
respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement; or [for those not sentenced to prison] not
later than 3 business days after being sentenced . . . .
“(c) Keeping the registration current
“A sex offender shall [update his registration within] 3 business days after each change of name, residence, employment, or student status [by] appear[ing]
in person in at least 1 jurisdiction involved . . . and inform[ing] that jurisdiction of all [relevant] changes . . . .
“(d) Initial registration of sex offenders unable
to comply with subsection (b)
“The Attorney General shall have the authority to
specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements . . . to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter or its implementation in a
particular jurisdiction, and to prescribe rules for the
registration of any such sex offenders and for other
categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply
with subsection (b).” 42 U. S. C. §16913 (emphasis
added).

REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

The new Act became law on July 27, 2006.
On February 28, 2007, the Attorney General promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that “[t]he requirements of
[the Act] apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders
convicted of the offense for which registration is required
prior to the enactment of that Act.” 72 Fed. Reg. 8897
(codified at 28 CFR §72.3). Subsequently, the Attorney
General promulgated further rules, regulations, and specifications. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38030 (2008); 75 Fed. Reg.
81849 (2010); 76 Fed. Reg. 1630 (2011). The present case
focuses upon the applicability of the Act’s registration
requirements to pre-Act offenders during the period between (1) July 27, 2006 (when the Act took effect) and
(2) the moment when the Attorney General promulgated
a valid rule specifying the registration requirements’ applicability, namely, February 28, 2007 (or a later date if
the February 28 specification was invalid).
B
Billy Joe Reynolds, the petitioner, is a pre-Act offender.
He was convicted of a Missouri sex offense in October
2001; he served four years in prison; he was released in
July 2005; he then registered as a Missouri sex offender;
but he moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without
updating his Missouri registration information (as Missouri law required) and without registering in Pennsylvania. A federal grand jury indicted him, charging him with,
between September 16 and October 16, 2007, having
“knowingly failed to register and update a registration as
required by [the Act].” App. 13; see 18 U. S. C. §2250(a).
In the Government’s view, Reynolds’ failure to update his
address information when he moved to Pennsylvania
violated the requirement that a “sex offender” update
registration information within “3 business days after
each change of . . . residence.” 42 U. S. C. §16913(c).
Reynolds moved to dismiss the indictment on the

Opinion of the Court

ground that in September and October 2007 the Act’s registration requirements had not yet become applicable to
pre-Act offenders. He conceded that the Act had become
law earlier (namely, in July 2006), and he conceded that
the Attorney General had already (in February 2007)
promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the Act’s
registration requirements were applicable to pre-Act
offenders. But he claimed that the Interim Rule was
invalid because it violated both the Constitution’s “nondelegation” doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Act’s
(APA) requirement for “good cause” to promulgate a rule
without “notice and comment” (as the Attorney General
had done). See A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United
States, 295 U. S. 495, 529 (1935) (nondelegation doctrine);
5 U. S. C. §§553(b)(3)(B), (d)(3) (APA). Because the Interim Rule is invalid, he added, the law must treat him like a
pre-Act offender who traveled interstate and violated the
Act’s registration requirements before the Attorney General specified their applicability.
The District Court rejected on the merits Reynolds’ legal
attack on the Interim Rule. But the Court of Appeals
rejected Reynolds’ argument without reaching those merits. 380 Fed. Appx. 125 (2010). That court thought that
the Act’s registration requirements apply to pre-Act offenders such as Reynolds (who was subject to a preexisting state-law registration requirement) from the date
of the new law’s enactment—even in the absence of any
rule or regulation by the Attorney General specifying that
the new registration requirements apply. That being so,
the validity of the Interim Rule could make no legal difference, for the Act required Reynolds to follow the
new federal registration requirements regardless of any
rulemaking.
The Courts of Appeals have reached different conclusions about whether the Act’s registration requirements
apply to pre-Act offenders prior to the time that the Attor-


6

REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

ney General specifies their applicability, i.e., from July
2006 until at least February 2007. Six Circuits have held
that the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to
pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney General so
specifies. United States v. Johnson, 632 F. 3d 912, 922–
927 (CA5 2011); United States v. Valverde, 628 F. 3d 1159,
1162–1164 (CA9 2010); United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d
408, 414–419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F.
3d 222, 226–229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551
F. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008); United States v. Madera, 528 F.
3d 852, 856–859 (CA11 2008) (per curiam). Five Circuits
have held that they apply from the date of the Act’s enactment, and prior to any such specification, at least with
respect to pre-Act offenders who had already registered
under state law. United States v. Fuller, 627 F. 3d 499,
506 (CA2 2010); United States v. DiTomasso, 621 F. 3d 17,
24 (CA1 2010); United States v. Shenandoah, 595 F. 3d
151, 163 (CA3 2010); United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d
926, 932 (CA10 2008); United States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912,
918–919 (CA8 2008). In light of this split, we agreed to
consider the question.
II

A

The question before us is whether the Act requires
pre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General
validly specifies that the Act’s registration provisions apply to them. We believe that it does not. For one thing,
a natural reading of the textual language supports our
conclusion. The text consists of four statements. See
supra, at 3. Statement One says that “[a] sex offender
shall register, and keep the registration current.” Statement Two says that a sex offender must initially register
before completing his “sentence of imprisonment” (or, if
the sentence does not involve imprisonment, within three
days of conviction). Statement Three says that the sex

7

Opinion of the Court

offender must update a registration within three business
days of any change of “name, residence, employment, or
student status.” Statement Four says that “[t]he Attorney
General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders
convicted before the enactment of this chapter.”
Read naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First.
It specifically deals with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of
a broad general class (all sex offenders) to which the First
Statement applies. And it therefore should control the
Act’s application to that subset. See Gozlon-Peretz v.
United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) (specific statutory
provision normally controls over one of more general
application); see also Bloate v. United States, 559 U. S.
___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10) (same).
At the same time, the Fourth Statement says that the
Attorney General has authority to specify the Act’s “applicability,” not its “nonapplicability.” And it consequently
is more naturally read as conferring the authority to apply
the Act, not the authority to make exceptions. That is
how we normally understand a term such as “authority to
specify” in the context of applying new rules to persons
already governed by pre-existing rules. If, for example,
the Major League Baseball Players Association and the
team owners agreed that the Commissioner of Baseball
“shall have the authority to specify the applicability” to
the major leagues of the more stringent minor league drug
testing policy, we should think that the minor league
policy would not apply unless and until the Commissioner
so specified.
For another thing, this reading of the Act efficiently
resolves what Congress may well have thought were practical problems arising when the Act sought to apply the
new registration requirements to pre-Act offenders. The
problems arise out of the fact that the Act seeks to make
more uniform a patchwork of pre-existing state systems.


8

REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Doing so could require newly registering or re-registering
“a large number” of pre-Act offenders. That effort could
prove expensive. And it might not prove feasible to do so
immediately. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38063 (recognizing these
problems). Congress’ concern about these problems is reflected in the Act’s providing the States with three years
to bring their systems into compliance with federal standards while permitting the Attorney General to extend that
3-year grace period to five years. 42 U. S. C. §16924.
These same considerations might have warranted different federal registration treatment of different categories of pre-Act offenders. Cf. 73 Fed. Reg. 38035–38036,
and 38046–38047 (final Department of Justice guidelines
allowing States to meet Act requirements without registering certain categories of pre-Act offenders); 76 Fed. Reg.
1635–1636 (supplemental guidelines allowing the same).
At least Congress might well have so thought. And consequently, Congress might well have looked for a solution.
Asking the Department of Justice, charged with responsibility for implementation, to examine these pre-Act
offender problems and to apply the new registration requirements accordingly could have represented one efficient and desirable solution (though we express no view
on Reynolds’ related constitutional claim). Cf. 42 U. S. C.
§§16912(b), 16914(a)(7), (b)(7), 16919, 16941, 16945
(granting the Attorney General authority to administer
various aspects of the Act). And that is just the solution
that the Act’s language says that Congress adopted.
Finally, our reading of the Act takes Congress to have
filled potential lacunae (created by related Act provisions)
in a manner consistent with basic background principles
of criminal law. The Second Statement, for example, says
that a sex offender must register before completing his
prison term, but the provision says nothing about when a
pre-Act offender who completed his prison term pre-Act
must register. Although a state pre-Act offender could not

9

Opinion of the Court

be prosecuted until he traveled interstate, there is no
interstate requirement for a federal pre-Act offender. And
to apply the Act to either of these pre-Act offenders from
the date of enactment would require reading into the
statute, silent on the point, some kind of unsaid equivalent (e.g., registering or updating within a “reasonable
time” or “within three days of first post-Act travel in interstate commerce” or “as preexisting state law requires”).
Pre-Act offenders, aware of such complexities, lacunae,
and difficulties, might, on their own, reach different conclusions about whether, or how, the new registration
requirements applied to them. A ruling from the Attorney
General, however, could diminish or eliminate those uncertainties, thereby helping to eliminate the very kind of
vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to
avoid. Cf., e.g., United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 266
(1997) (noting that “the canon of strict construction of
criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by
so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it
only to conduct clearly covered”).
B
The Government makes three principal arguments to
the contrary. First, it says that our interpretation of the
Act conflicts with one basic statutory purpose, namely, the
“establish[ment of] a comprehensive national system for
the registration of [sex] offenders,” 42 U. S. C. §16901,
that includes offenders who committed their offenses
before the Act became law. The Act reflects that purpose
when it defines “sex offender” broadly to include any
“individual who was convicted of a sex offense.” §16911(1).
And we have recognized that purpose in stating that, in
general, the Act’s criminal provisions apply to any pre-Act
offender required to register under the Act who later
travels interstate and fails to register. See Carr, 560
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).


10

REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

The Act’s history also reveals that many of its supporters placed considerable importance upon the registration
of pre-Act offenders. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt.
1, p. 24 (2005) (H. R. Rep.) (“[Twenty] percent of sexual
offenders are ‘lost,’ and there is a strong public interest
in finding them and having them register with current
information to mitigate the risks of additional crimes
against children”); 152 Cong. Rec. 15333 (2006) (statement
of Sen. Cantwell) (“Child sex offenders have exploited this
stunning lack of uniformity, and the consequences have
been tragic. Twenty percent of the Nation’s 560,000 sex
offenders are ‘lost’ because State offender registry programs are not coordinated well enough”); id., at 15338
(statement of Sen. Kyl) (“There currently are over 100,000
sex offenders in this country who are required to register
but are ‘off the system.’ They are not registered. The
penalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that
these individuals register”); id., at 13050 (statement of
Sen. Frist) (“There are currently 550,000 registered sex
offenders in the U. S. and at least 100,000 of them are
missing from the system. Every day that we don’t have
this national sex offender registry, these missing sex
predators are out there somewhere”).
The difficulty with the Government’s argument, however, is that it overstates the need for instantaneous registration of pre-Act offenders. Our different reading, we
concede, involves implementation delay. But that delay
need not be long (the Attorney General issued his Interim
Rule 217 days after the effective date of the new law).
And that delay can be justified by the need to accommodate other Act-related interests. See supra, at 7–9.
Second, the Government suggests that our reading leads
to an absurd result. As it points out, the Fourth Statement
grants the Attorney General the “authority to specify”
the registration requirements’ applicability not only to
pre-Act offenders but also to those convicted prior to the

11

Opinion of the Court

“implementation” of the new Act “in a particular jurisdiction.” Some jurisdictions might not implement the Act
for up to five years. See 42 U. S. C. §16924; see also Dept. of
Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Justice Department
Finds 24 Jurisdictions Have Substantially Implemented
SORNA Requirements (July 28, 2011) (stating that as
of July 28, 2011, 14 States had implemented the
Act’s requirements), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/
pressreleases/2011/SMART_PR-072811.htm (all Internet
materials as visited Jan. 19, 2012, and available in Clerk
of Court’s case file). Yet, the Government concludes, it is
absurd to believe that Congress would have desired so
long a delay in the application of its new registration
requirements.
The problem with this argument, however, is that reading the two categories similarly (a matter which we need
not decide) would not require a long delay in applying the
registration requirements to post-Act offenders who committed a crime in a jurisdiction that is slow to implement
the new requirements. At most, that reading would require the Attorney General to promulgate a rule applicable to all preimplementation offenders. That rule could
specify that the Act’s preregistration provisions apply to
some or to all those offenders. And it could do so quickly,
well before a jurisdiction implements the Act’s requirements. Indeed, the Attorney General’s Interim Rule and
the Department of Justice’s final guidelines, both issued
before any jurisdiction implemented the Act’s requirements, state that the Act’s requirements apply to “all sex
offenders,” including all preimplementation offenders. See
72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR §72.3); 73 Fed. Reg.
38036; cf. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs,
Justice Department Announces First Two Jurisdictions
to Implement Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (Sept. 23, 2009), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/
pressreleases/2009/SMART09154.htm.


12

REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Third, the Government argues against our interpretation on the ground that the Act says only that the Attorney General “shall have the authority to specify the
applicability” of the Act’s registration requirements to preAct offenders; it does not say that he “shall specify” or
otherwise require him to do so. The Act’s language, the
Government continues, consequently gives the Attorney
General the power not to specify anything; that power is
inconsistent with Congress’ intent to ensure the speedy
registration of thousands of “lost” pre-Act offenders, supra,
at 10; and we can avoid this result only by reading the
Act’s registration requirements as applying immediately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders (though
the Attorney General would have the power to make
exceptions).
This argument bases too much upon too little. There is
no reason to believe that Congress feared that the Attorney General would refuse to apply the new requirements
to pre-Act offenders. See, e.g., H. R. Rep., at 23–24; Protecting Our Nation’s Children from Sexual Predators and
Violent Criminals: What Needs To Be Done? Hearing
before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary,
109th Cong., 1st Sess., 4–13 (2005); Office of the Press
Sec’y, The White House, President Signs H. R. 4472,
the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006
(July 27, 2006), http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/
news/releases/2006/07/20060727-6.html. And there was no
need for a mandatory requirement to avoid that unrealistic
possibility. There is consequently no need to read the
language unnaturally as giving the Attorney General the
authority only to make exceptions from an implicit (unstated) rule that would otherwise apply the new registration requirements to all pre-Act offenders across the board
and immediately.
Finally, we note that some lower courts have read the


Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)

13

Opinion of the Court

Attorney General’s specification authority as applying
only to those pre-Act sex offenders unable to comply with
the statute’s “initial registration” requirements. See 42
U. S. C. §16913(b). That, however, is not what the statute
says. Rather, its Fourth Statement, §16913(d), says that
the Attorney General has the authority (1) to specify the
applicability of the registration requirements to pre-Act
(and preimplementation) offenders, “and ” (2) to prescribe
rules for their registration, “and ” (3) to prescribe registration rules for other categories of sex offenders who are
unable to comply with the initial registration requirements. See supra, at 3. The word “and” means that the
Attorney General’s authority extends beyond those pre-Act
“sex offenders who are unable to comply” with the initial
registration requirements.
III
For these reasons, we conclude that the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until
the Attorney General so specifies. Whether the Attorney
General’s Interim Rule sets forth a valid specification
consequently matters in the case before us. And we reverse the Third Circuit’s judgment to the contrary. We
remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
So ordered.
