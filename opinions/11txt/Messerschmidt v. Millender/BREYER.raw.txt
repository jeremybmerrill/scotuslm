DECEASED, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[February 22, 2012]


JUSTICE BREYER, concurring.
The Court concludes that the officers acted reasonably
in searching the house for “ ‘all firearms and firearmrelated items.’ ” Ante, at 11–12 (emphasis deleted). In
support of this conclusion, it cites two sets of circumstances. First, the majority points to “Bowen’s possession
of one illegal gun, his gang membership, his willingness to
use the gun to kill someone, and his concern about the
police . . . .” Ante, at 11. Second, the majority notes that
“[a] reasonable officer also could believe that seizure of the
firearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on
Kelly,” because “Bowen had already attempted to murder
Kelly once with a firearm, and had yelled ‘I’ll kill you’ as
she tried to escape from him.” Ante, at 12. In my view,
given all these circumstances together, the officers could
reasonably have believed that the scope of their search
was supported by probable cause. On that basis, I concur.
