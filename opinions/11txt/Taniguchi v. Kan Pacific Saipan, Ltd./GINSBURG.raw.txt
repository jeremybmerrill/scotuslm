KOUICHI TANIGUCHI, PETITIONER v. KAN PACIFIC
SAIPAN, LTD., DBA MARIANAS RESORT AND SPA
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[May 21, 2012]

JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER and
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.
To be comprehended by the parties, the witnesses, and
the court, expression in foreign languages must be trans­
lated into English. Congress therefore provided, in 28
U. S. C. §1920(6), that the prevailing party may recoup
compensation paid to “interpreters.” The word “interpret­
ers,” the Court emphasizes, commonly refers to translators
of oral speech. Ante, at 5–6. But as the Court acknowl­
edges, ante, at 7, and n. 2, “interpreters” is more than
occasionally used to encompass those who translate writ­
ten speech as well. See Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary of the English Language 1182 (1976) (hereinafter Webster’s) (defining “interpreter” as “one that
translates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties
conversing in different tongues”); Black’s Law Dictionary
895 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “interpreter” as a “person who
translates, esp. orally, from one language to another”);
Ballentine’s Law Dictionary 655 (3d ed. 1969) (defining
“interpreter” as “[o]ne who interprets, particularly one
who interprets words written or spoken in a foreign
language”).
In short, employing the word “interpreters” to include
translators of written as well as oral speech, if not “the
most common usage,” ante, at 8, is at least an “acceptable”

usage, ibid. Moreover, the word “interpret” is generally
understood to mean “to explain or tell the meaning of:
translate into intelligible or familiar language or terms,”
while “translate” commonly means “to turn into one’s own
or another language.” Webster’s 1182, 2429. See also
Random House Dictionary of the English Language 744,
1505 (1973) (defining the transitive verb “interpret” as,
inter alia, “to translate,” and “translate” as “to turn (some­
thing written or spoken) from one language into another”).
Notably, several federal district court decisions refer to
translators of written documents as “interpreters.” E.g.,
United States v. Prado-Cervantez, No. 11–40044–11, 2011
WL 4691934, *3 (Kan., Oct. 6, 2011) (“Standby counsel
should also be prepared to arrange for interpreters to
interpret or translate documents when necessary for
defendant.”); Mendoza v. Ring, No. 07–3114, 2008 WL
2959848, *2 (CD Ill., July 30, 2008) (“The interpreter is
also directed to translate filings by the plaintiff from
Spanish to English. The original and translated versions
will be docketed.”). So do a number of state statutes. E.g.,
Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §26806(a) (West 2008) (“[T]he clerk
of the court may employ as many foreign language inter­
preters as may be necessary . . . to translate documents intended for filing in any civil or criminal action . . . .”).
Most federal courts of appeals confronted with the ques­
tion have held that costs may be awarded under §1920(6)
for the translation of documents necessary to, or in prepa­
ration for, litigation. Compare 633 F. 3d 1218, 1220–1222
(CA9 2011); BDT Prods., Inc. v. Lexmark Int’l, Inc., 405
F. 3d 415, 419 (CA6 2005); Slagenweit v. Slagenweit, 63
F. 3d 719, 721 (CA8 1995) (per curiam); and Chore-Time
Equip., Inc. v. Cumberland Corp., 713 F. 2d 774, 782 (CA
Fed. 1983) (all holding that costs for document translation
are covered by §1920(6)), with Extra Equipamentos E
Exportação Ltda. v. Case Corp., 541 F. 3d 719, 727–728
(CA7 2008) (costs for document translation are not covered

by §1920(6)). See also In re Puerto Rico Elec. Power Auth.,
687 F. 2d 501, 506, 510 (CA1 1982) (recognizing that
costs of document translation may be reimbursed, with­
out specifying the relevant subsection of §1920); Studieng­
esellschaft Kohle mbH v. Eastman Kodak Co., 713 F. 2d
128, 133 (CA5 1983) (allowing document translation
costs under §1920(4)); Quy v. Air Am., Inc., 667 F. 2d 1059,
1065 (CADC 1981) (allowing “translation costs” under
§1920(6)).1
In practice, federal trial courts have awarded document
translation costs in cases spanning several decades. See,
e.g., Raffold Process Corp. v. Castanea Paper Co., 25
F. Supp. 593, 594 (WD Pa. 1938). Before the Court Inter­
preters Act added §1920(6) to the taxation of costs statute
in 1978, district courts awarded costs for document trans­
lation under §1920(4), which allowed taxation of “[f ]ees for
exemplification and copies of papers,” 28 U. S. C. §1920(4)
(1976 ed.), or under §1920’s predecessor, 28 U. S. C. §830
(1925 ed.). See, e.g., Bennett Chemical Co. v. Atlantic
Commodities, Ltd., 24 F. R. D. 200, 204 (SDNY 1959)
(§1920(4)); Raffold Process Corp., 25 F. Supp., at 594
(§830). Pre-1978, district courts also awarded costs for
oral translation of witness testimony. See, e.g., Kaiser
Industries Corp. v. McLouth Steel Corp., 50 F. R. D. 5, 11
(ED Mich. 1970). Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act, a
measure intended to expand access to interpretation
services, indicates a design to eliminate the availability of
costs awards for document translation. See S. Rep. No.
95–569, p. 4 (1977) (hereinafter S. Rep.) (“The commit­
tee . . . feels the time has come to provide by statute for
the provision of and access to qualified certified interpret­

costs, like other costs recoverable under §1920, may be
“denied or limited” if they “were unreasonably incurred or unnecessary
to the case.” 10 Moore’s Federal Practice §54.101[1][b], p. 54–158 (3d
ed. 2012).

ers, for a broader spectrum of people than the present law
allows.”). Post-1978, rulings awarding document transla­
tion costs under §1920(6) indicate the courts’ understand­
ing both that the term “interpreter” can readily encompass
oral and written translation, and that Congress did not
otherwise instruct.2 I agree that context should guide the
determination whether §1920(b) is most sensibly read to
encompass persons who translate documents. See ante, at
8–9. But the context key for me is the practice of federal
courts both before and after §1920(6)’s enactment.
The purpose of translation, after all, is to make relevant
foreign-language communication accessible to the litigants
and the court. See S. Rep., at 1 (The Court Interpreters
Act is intended “to insure that all participants in our

some federal district courts make the practice of allowing

Federal courts can meaningfully take part.”). Documen­
tary evidence in a foreign language, no less than oral
statements, must be translated to equip the parties to
present their case clearly and the court to decide the
merits intelligently. See, e.g., United States v. Mosquera,
816 F. Supp. 168, 175 (EDNY 1993) (“For a non-English
speaking [party] to stand equal with others before the
court requires translation [of relevant documents].”);
Lockett v. Hellenic Sea Transports, Ltd., 60 F. R. D. 469,
473 (ED Pa. 1973) (“To be understood by counsel for plain­
tiffs and defendant, as well as for use at trial, the [ship’s]
deck log had to be translated [from Greek] into the Eng­
lish language.”).3 And it is not extraordinary that what
documents say, more than what witnesses testify, may
make or break a case.
Distinguishing written from oral translation for cost­
award purposes, moreover, is an endeavor all the more
dubious, for, as the Court acknowledges, ante, at 13, some
translation tasks do not fall neatly into one category or
the other. An interpreter, for example, may be called upon
to “sight translate” a written document, i.e., to convey a
written foreign-language document’s content orally in
English. R. González, V. Vásquez, & H. Mikkelson, Fun­
damentals of Court Interpretation: Theory, Policy and
Practice 401 (1991) (hereinafter González). In-court sight
translation, Taniguchi concedes, counts as “interpreta­
tion,” even though it does not involve translating verbal
expression. Tr. of Oral Arg. 10. Yet an interpreter’s prep­

for printed or electronically recorded transcripts”); §1920(3) (2006 ed.)
(“Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses”); §1920(4) (“Fees
for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any [necessary]
materials”). Nothing indicates that Congress intended paragraph (6),
unlike paragraphs (2)–(4), to apply exclusively to oral communications.

written document in advance, Taniguchi maintains, does
not count as “interpretation.” Ibid. But if the interpreter
then reads the prepared written translation aloud in
court, that task, in Taniguchi’s view, can be charged as
“interpretation,” id., at 11, even though the reading in­
volves no translation of foreign-language expression—
written or oral—at all.
Similarly hard to categorize is the common court­
interpreter task of listening to a recording in a foreign
language, transcribing it, then translating it into English. See González 439. Although this task involves oral
foreign-language communication, it does not, Taniguchi
contends, qualify as “interpretation,” because it involves
“the luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the
leisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.” Reply Brief
for Petitioner 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). But
sight translation—which Taniguchi concedes may be
charged as “interpretation”—may sometimes involve sim­
ilarly careful linguistic analysis of a written document
in advance of a court proceeding. Davis & Hewitt, Lessons
in Administering Justice: What Judges Need to Know
about the Requirements, Role, and Professional Responsi­
bilities of the Court Interpreter, 1 Harv. Latino L. Rev.
121, 131 (1994).
Taniguchi warns that translation costs can be exorbi­
tant and burdensome to police. Reply Brief 19–22; Tr. of
Oral Arg. 20–21. The Court expresses a similar concern.

Court also observes that “[t]axable costs are limited to relatively

26, 2012) (awarding $440,000 in copying costs); Jones v. Halliburton

costs, on the other hand, are not inevitably large. See Brief for Re­

costs, however, has shown that district judges are up to
the task of confining awards to translation services neces­
sary to present or defeat a claim. See Eastman Kodak Co.,
713 F. 2d, at 133 (district court should not award docu­
ment translation costs “carte blanche,” but must deter­
mine whether such costs were necessarily incurred). See
also, e.g., Conn v. Zakharov, No. 1:09 CV 0760, 2010 WL
2293133, *3 (ND Ohio, June 4, 2010) (denying translation
costs where prevailing party did not demonstrate the costs
were necessary); Maker’s Mark Distillery, Inc. v. Diageo
North Am., Inc., No. 3:03–CV–93, 2010 WL 2651186, *3
(WD Ky., June 30, 2010) (same); Competitive Technologies
v. Fujitsu Ltd., No. C–02–1673, 2006 WL 6338914, *11

(Ore., June 14, 2002) (same); Oetiker v. Jurid Werke,
GmbH, 104 F. R. D. 389, 393 (DC 1982) (same); Lockett, 60
F. R. D., at 473 (awarding costs for “necessary” transla­
tions); Kaiser, 50 F. R. D., at 11–12 (same); Bennett, 24
F. R. D., at 204 (same); Raffold Process Corp., 25 F. Supp.,
at 594 (same). Courts of appeals, in turn, are capable of
reviewing such judgments for abuse of discretion.
In short, §1920(6)’s prescription on “interpreters” is not
so clear as to leave no room for interpretation. Given the
purpose served by translation and the practice prevailing
in district courts, supra, at 3, there is no good reason to
exclude from taxable costs payments for placing written
words within the grasp of parties, jurors, and judges. I
would therefore affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.
