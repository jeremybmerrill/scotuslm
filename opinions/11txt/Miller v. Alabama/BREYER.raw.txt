KUNTRELL JACKSON, PETITIONER
v.
RAY HOBBS, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT



OF ARKANSAS



[June 25, 2012] 


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins,
concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion in full. I add that, if the State
continues to seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for Kuntrell Jackson, there will have to be a
determination whether Jackson “kill[ed] or intend[ed] to
kill” the robbery victim. Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___,
___ (2010) (slip op., at 18). In my view, without such a
finding, the Eighth Amendment as interpreted in Graham
forbids sentencing Jackson to such a sentence, regardless
of whether its application is mandatory or discretionary
under state law.
In Graham we said that “when compared to an adult
murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to
kill has a twice diminished moral culpability.” Ibid. (emphasis added). For one thing, “compared to adults, juveniles have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense

of responsibility; they are more vulnerable or susceptible
to negative influences and outside pressures, including
peer pressure; and their characters are not as well
formed.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (internal quotation
marks omitted). See also ibid. (“[P]sychology and brain
science continue to show fundamental differences between
juvenile and adult minds” making their actions “less likely
to be evidence of ‘irretrievably depraved character’ than
are the actions of adults” (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543
U. S. 551, 570 (2005))); ante, at 8–9. For another thing,
Graham recognized that lack of intent normally diminishes the “moral culpability” that attaches to the crime in
question, making those that do not intend to kill “categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
18) (citing Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 434–435
(2008); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Tison v.
Arizona, 481 U. S. 137 (1987)). And we concluded that,
because of this “twice diminished moral culpability,” the
Eighth Amendment forbids the imposition upon juveniles
of a sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide cases.
Graham, supra, at ___, ___ (slip op., at 18, 32).
Given Graham’s reasoning, the kinds of homicide that
can subject a juvenile offender to life without parole must
exclude instances where the juvenile himself neither kills
nor intends to kill the victim. Quite simply, if the juvenile
either kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks “twice
diminished” responsibility. But where the juvenile neither
kills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Graham as extenuating apply. The dissent itself here would
permit life without parole for “juveniles who commit the
worst types of murder,” post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS,
C. J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of
one who did not himself kill or intend to kill.
I recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases,
the question of intent is a complicated one. The felony-

BREYER, J., concurring

murder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in
the course of a felony to all participants who intended to
commit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or
intended to kill. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal
Law §§14.5(a) and (c) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been
based on the idea of “transferred intent”; the defendant’s
intent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill
required for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, & C.
Steiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed.
2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton’s Criminal Law §147 (15th ed.
1994).
But in my opinion, this type of “transferred intent” is
not sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could
subject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As
an initial matter, this Court has made clear that this
artificially constructed kind of intent does not count as
intent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not
rely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may
receive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids
imposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in
a robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and
simply was “in the car by the side of the road . . . , waiting
to help the robbers escape.” Enmund, supra, at 788. Cf.
Tison, supra, at 157–158 (capital punishment permissible for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death
because he was “actively involved” in every aspect of the
kidnaping and his behavior showed “a reckless disregard
for human life”). Given Graham, this holding applies to
juvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See
ante, at 12–13. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the Tison
standard of “reckless disregard” may not be eligible for life
without parole. Rather, Graham dictates a clear rule: The
only juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to
life without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses
who “kill or intend to kill.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 18).

MILLER v. ALABAMA
BREYER, J., concurring

Moreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults,
there is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without
parole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to
kill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant’s
intent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dangerous felony should understand the risk that the victim
of the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2
LaFave, supra, §14.5(c). Yet the ability to consider the
full consequences of a course of action and to adjust one’s
conduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles
lack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 8–9. Justice Frankfurter cautioned, “Legal theories and their phrasing in
other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncritically transferred to a determination of a State’s duty toward children.” May v. Anderson, 345 U. S. 528, 536
(1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of
transferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to
sentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve
such “fallacious reasoning.” Ibid.
This is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation present in Kuntrell Jackson’s case. Jackson simply went
along with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he
became aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially
stayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying something like “We ain’t playin’ ” or “ ‘I thought you all was
playin,’ ” before an older confederate shot and killed the
store clerk. Jackson v. State, 359 Ark. 87, 91, 194 S. W. 3d
757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of
first-degree murder under a statute that permitted them
to convict if, Jackson “attempted to commit or committed
an aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that offense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk’s] death
under circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the
value of human life.” Ibid. See Ark. Code Ann. §5–10–
101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15. Thus, to be found guilty,
Jackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did

BREYER, J., concurring

not), nor did he need to have intent to kill or even “extreme indifference.” As long as one of the teenage accomplices in the robbery acted with extreme indifference to
the value of human life, Jackson could be convicted of
capital murder. Ibid.
The upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk,
might not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v.
Norris, 2011 Ark. 49, at 10, ___ S. W. 3d ___ (Danielson,
J., dissenting) (“[A]ny evidence of [Jackson’s] intent to kill
was severely lacking”). In that case, the Eighth Amendment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the
possibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a
finding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk’s death,
the question remains open whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a
juvenile in those circumstances as well. Ante, at 17.
