ALBERT W. FLORENCE, PETITIONER v. BOARD OF

CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF

BURLINGTON ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[April 2, 2012]


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court. As with JUSTICE ALITO,
however, it is important for me that the Court does not
foreclose the possibility of an exception to the rule it announces. JUSTICE KENNEDY explains that the circumstances before it do not afford an opportunity to consider
that possibility. Ante, at 18–19. Those circumstances
include the facts that Florence was detained not for a
minor traffic offense but instead pursuant to a warrant for
his arrest, and that there was apparently no alternative, if
Florence were to be detained, to holding him in the general jail population.
Factual nuances have not played a significant role as
this case has been presented to the Court. Both courts
below regarded acknowledged factual disputes as “immaterial” to their conflicting dispositions, 621 F. 3d 296, 300
(CA3 2010), and before this Court Florence challenged
suspicionless strip searches “no matter what the circumstances.” Pet. for Cert. i.
The Court makes a persuasive case for the general
applicability of the rule it announces. The Court is nonetheless wise to leave open the possibility of exceptions, to
ensure that we “not embarrass the future.” Northwest
