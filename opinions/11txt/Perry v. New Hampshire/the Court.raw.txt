BARION PERRY, PETITIONER v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

NEW HAMPSHIRE

[January 11, 2012]


JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
In our system of justice, fair trial for persons charged
with criminal offenses is secured by the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees to defendants the right to counsel,
compulsory process to obtain defense witnesses, and the
opportunity to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution. Those safeguards apart, admission of evidence in
state trials is ordinarily governed by state law, and the
reliability of relevant testimony typically falls within the
province of the jury to determine. This Court has recognized, in addition, a due process check on the admission of
eyewitness identification, applicable when the police have
arranged suggestive circumstances leading the witness to
identify a particular person as the perpetrator of a crime.
An identification infected by improper police influence,
our case law holds, is not automatically excluded. Instead,
the trial judge must screen the evidence for reliability
pretrial. If there is “a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,” Simmons v. United States, 390
U. S. 377, 384 (1968), the judge must disallow presentation of the evidence at trial. But if the indicia of reliability
are strong enough to outweigh the corrupting effect of the

PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

police-arranged suggestive circumstances, the identification evidence ordinarily will be admitted, and the jury will
ultimately determine its worth.
We have not extended pretrial screening for reliability
to cases in which the suggestive circumstances were not
arranged by law enforcement officers. Petitioner requests
that we do so because of the grave risk that mistaken
identification will yield a miscarriage of justice.1 Our
decisions, however, turn on the presence of state action
and aim to deter police from rigging identification procedures, for example, at a lineup, showup, or photograph
array. When no improper law enforcement activity is
involved, we hold, it suffices to test reliability through the
rights and opportunities generally designed for that purpose, notably, the presence of counsel at postindictment
lineups, vigorous cross-examination, protective rules of evidence, and jury instructions on both the fallibility of
eyewitness identification and the requirement that guilt
be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

1 The dissent, too, appears to urge that all suggestive circumstances
raise due process concerns warranting a pretrial ruling. See post, at 6,
9, 14–17. Neither Perry nor the dissent, however, points to a single
case in which we have required pretrial screening absent a policearranged identification procedure. Understandably so, for there are no
such cases. Instead, the dissent surveys our decisions, heedless of the
police arrangement that underlies every one of them, and inventing a
“longstanding rule,” post, at 6, that never existed. Nor are we, as the
dissent suggests, imposing a mens rea requirement, post, at 1, 7, or
otherwise altering our precedent in any way. As our case law makes
clear, what triggers due process concerns is police use of an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure, whether or not they intended
the arranged procedure to be suggestive.

Opinion of the Court

reported that an African-American male was trying to
break into cars parked in the lot of Ullon’s apartment
building. Officer Nicole Clay responded to the call. Upon
arriving at the parking lot, Clay heard what “sounded like
a metal bat hitting the ground.” App. 37a–38a. She then
saw petitioner Barion Perry standing between two cars.
Perry walked toward Clay, holding two car-stereo amplifiers in his hands. A metal bat lay on the ground behind
him. Clay asked Perry where the amplifiers came from.
“[I] found them on the ground,” Perry responded. Id.,
at 39a.
Meanwhile, Ullon’s wife, Nubia Blandon, woke her
neighbor, Alex Clavijo, and told him she had just seen
someone break into his car. Clavijo immediately went
downstairs to the parking lot to inspect the car. He first
observed that one of the rear windows had been shattered.
On further inspection, he discovered that the speakers
and amplifiers from his car stereo were missing, as were
his bat and wrench. Clavijo then approached Clay and
told her about Blandon’s alert and his own subsequent
observations.
By this time, another officer had arrived at the scene.
Clay asked Perry to stay in the parking lot with that
officer, while she and Clavijo went to talk to Blandon.
Clay and Clavijo then entered the apartment building
and took the stairs to the fourth floor, where Blandon’s and
Clavijo’s apartments were located. They met Blandon in
the hallway just outside the open door to her apartment.
Asked to describe what she had seen, Blandon stated
that, around 2:30 a.m., she saw from her kitchen window a
tall, African-American man roaming the parking lot and
looking into cars. Eventually, the man circled Clavijo’s
car, opened the trunk, and removed a large box.2
——————
2 The box, which Clay found on the ground near where she first encountered Perry, contained car-stereo speakers. App. 177a–178a.

PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

Clay asked Blandon for a more specific description of the
man. Blandon pointed to her kitchen window and said the
person she saw breaking into Clavijo’s car was standing in
the parking lot, next to the police officer. Perry’s arrest
followed this identification.
About a month later, the police showed Blandon a photographic array that included a picture of Perry and asked
her to point out the man who had broken into Clavijo’s car.
Blandon was unable to identify Perry.
B
Perry was charged in New Hampshire state court with
one count of theft by unauthorized taking and one count of
criminal mischief.3 Before trial, he moved to suppress
Blandon’s identification on the ground that admitting it at
trial would violate due process. Blandon witnessed what
amounted to a one-person showup in the parking lot,
Perry asserted, which all but guaranteed that she would
identify him as the culprit. Id., at 15a–16a.
The New Hampshire Superior Court denied the motion.
Id., at 82a–88a. To determine whether due process prohibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification at
trial, the Superior Court said, this Court’s decisions instruct a two-step inquiry. First, the trial court must decide whether the police used an unnecessarily suggestive
identification procedure. Id., at 85a. If they did, the court
must next consider whether the improper identification
procedure so tainted the resulting identification as to
render it unreliable and therefore inadmissible. Ibid.
(citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), and Manson v.
Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977)).
Perry’s challenge, the Superior Court concluded, failed
at step one: Blandon’s identification of Perry on the night
——————
3 The theft charge was based on the taking of items from Clavijo’s car,
while the criminal mischief count was founded on the shattering of
Clavijo’s car window.

Opinion of the Court

of the crime did not result from an unnecessarily suggestive procedure “manufacture[d] . . . by the police.” App.
86a–87a. Blandon pointed to Perry “spontaneously,” the
court noted, “without any inducement from the police.”
Id., at 85a–86a. Clay did not ask Blandon whether the
man standing in the parking lot was the man Blandon had
seen breaking into Clavijo’s car. Ibid. Nor did Clay ask
Blandon to move to the window from which she had observed the break-in. Id., at 86a.
The Superior Court recognized that there were reasons
to question the accuracy of Blandon’s identification: the
parking lot was dark in some locations; Perry was standing next to a police officer; Perry was the only AfricanAmerican man in the vicinity; and Blandon was unable,
later, to pick Perry out of a photographic array. Id., at
86a–87a. But “[b]ecause the police procedures were not
unnecessarily suggestive,” the court ruled that the reliability of Blandon’s testimony was for the jury to consider.
Id., at 87a.
At the ensuing trial, Blandon and Clay testified to
Blandon’s out-of-court identification. The jury found Perry
guilty of theft and not guilty of criminal mischief.
On appeal, Perry repeated his challenge to the admissibility of Blandon’s out-of-court identification. The trial
court erred, Perry contended, in requiring an initial showing that the police arranged the suggestive identification
procedure. Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry argued,
suffice to trigger the court’s duty to evaluate the reliability
of the resulting identification before allowing presentation
of the evidence to the jury.
The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Perry’s
argument and affirmed his conviction. Id., at 9a–11a.
Only where the police employ suggestive identification
techniques, that court held, does the Due Process Clause
require a trial court to assess the reliability of identification evidence before permitting a jury to consider it. Id.,

We granted certiorari to resolve a division of opinion on

A

The Constitution, our decisions indicate, protects a defendant against a conviction based on evidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the
evidence, but by affording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted
as unworthy of credit. Constitutional safeguards available
to defendants to counter the State’s evidence include
the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 343–345 (1963); compulsory process,
Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 408–409 (1988); and
confrontation plus cross-examination of witnesses, Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U. S. 15, 18–20 (1985) (per curiam).

Opinion of the Court

Apart from these guarantees, we have recognized, state
and federal statutes and rules ordinarily govern the admissibility of evidence, and juries are assigned the task of
determining the reliability of the evidence presented at
trial. See Kansas v. Ventris, 556 U. S. 586, 594, n. (2009)
(“Our legal system . . . is built on the premise that it is the
province of the jury to weigh the credibility of competing
witnesses.”). Only when evidence “is so extremely unfair
that its admission violates fundamental conceptions of
justice,” Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352
(1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), have we imposed a constraint tied to the Due Process Clause. See,
e.g., Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, 269 (1959) (Due
process prohibits the State’s “knowin[g] use [of] false
evidence,” because such use violates “any concept of ordered liberty.”).
Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated
here, Perry relies on a series of decisions involving policearranged identification procedures. In Stovall v. Denno,
388 U. S. 293 (1967), first of those decisions, a witness
identified the defendant as her assailant after police officers brought the defendant to the witness’ hospital room.
Id., at 295. At the time the witness made the identification, the defendant—the only African-American in the
room—was handcuffed and surrounded by police officers.
Ibid. Although the police-arranged showup was undeniably suggestive, the Court held that no due process violation occurred. Id., at 302. Crucial to the Court’s decision
was the procedure’s necessity: The witness was the only
person who could identify or exonerate the defendant; the
witness could not leave her hospital room; and it was
uncertain whether she would live to identify the defendant
in more neutral circumstances. Ibid.
A year later, in Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377
(1968), the Court addressed a due process challenge to
police use of a photographic array. When a witness identi-


8

PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

fies the defendant in a police-organized photo lineup, the
Court ruled, the identification should be suppressed only
where “the photographic identification procedure was so
[unnecessarily] suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.” Id., at
384–385. Satisfied that the photo array used by Federal
Bureau of Investigation agents in Simmons was both
necessary and unlikely to have led to a mistaken identification, the Court rejected the defendant’s due process
challenge to admission of the identification. Id., at 385–
386. In contrast, the Court held in Foster v. California,
394 U. S. 440 (1969), that due process required the exclusion of an eyewitness identification obtained through
police-arranged procedures that “made it all but inevitable
that [the witness] would identify [the defendant].” Id., at
443.
Synthesizing previous decisions, we set forth in Neil v.
Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), and reiterated in Manson v.
Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977), the approach appropriately used to determine whether the Due Process Clause
requires suppression of an eyewitness identification tainted by police arrangement. The Court emphasized, first,
that due process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is both
suggestive and unnecessary. Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409
U. S., at 198. Even when the police use such a procedure,
the Court next said, suppression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable consequence. Brathwaite, 432
U. S., at 112–113; Biggers, 409 U. S., at 198–199.
A rule requiring automatic exclusion, the Court reasoned, would “g[o] too far,” for it would “kee[p] evidence
from the jury that is reliable and relevant,” and “may
result, on occasion, in the guilty going free.” Brathwaite,
432 U. S., at 112; see id., at 113 (when an “identification is
reliable despite an unnecessarily suggestive [police] identification procedure,” automatic exclusion “is a Draconian

9

Opinion of the Court

sanction,” one “that may frustrate rather than promote
justice”).
Instead of mandating a per se exclusionary rule, the
Court held that the Due Process Clause requires courts to
assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether improper police
conduct created a “substantial likelihood of misidentification.” Biggers, 409 U. S., at 201; see Brathwaite, 432
U. S., at 116. “[R]eliability [of the eyewitness identification] is the linchpin” of that evaluation, the Court stated
in Brathwaite. Id., at 114. Where the “indicators of [a
witness’] ability to make an accurate identification” are
“outweighed by the corrupting effect” of law enforcement
suggestion, the identification should be suppressed. Id., at
114, 116. Otherwise, the evidence (if admissible in all
other respects) should be submitted to the jury.5
Applying this “totality of the circumstances” approach,
id., at 110, the Court held in Biggers that law enforcement’s use of an unnecessarily suggestive showup did not
require suppression of the victim’s identification of her
assailant. 409 U. S., at 199–200. Notwithstanding the
improper procedure, the victim’s identification was reliable: She saw her assailant for a considerable period of time
under adequate light, provided police with a detailed description of her attacker long before the showup, and
had “no doubt” that the defendant was the person she had
seen. Id., at 200 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Similarly, the Court concluded in Brathwaite that police
use of an unnecessarily suggestive photo array did not
——————
5 Among

“factors to be considered” in evaluating a witness’ “ability to
make an accurate identification,” the Court listed: “the opportunity of
the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness’
degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal,
the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time
between the crime and the confrontation.” Manson v. Brathwaite, 432
U. S. 98, 114 (1977) (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 199–200
(1972)).


10

PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

require exclusion of the resulting identification. 432 U. S.,
at 114–117. The witness, an undercover police officer,
viewed the defendant in good light for several minutes,
provided a thorough description of the suspect, and was
certain of his identification. Id., at 115. Hence, the “indicators of [the witness’] ability to make an accurate identification [were] hardly outweighed by the corrupting effect
of the challenged identification.” Id., at 116.
B
Perry concedes that, in contrast to every case in the
Stovall line, law enforcement officials did not arrange the
suggestive circumstances surrounding Blandon’s identification. See Brief for Petitioner 34; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5
(counsel for Perry) (“[W]e do not allege any manipulation
or intentional orchestration by the police.”). He contends,
however, that it was mere happenstance that each of
the Stovall cases involved improper police action. The
rationale underlying our decisions, Perry asserts, supports
a rule requiring trial judges to prescreen eyewitness evidence for reliability any time an identification is made
under suggestive circumstances. We disagree.
Perry’s argument depends, in large part, on the Court’s
statement in Brathwaite that “reliability is the linchpin in
determining the admissibility of identification testimony.”
432 U. S., at 114. If reliability is the linchpin of admissibility under the Due Process Clause, Perry maintains, it
should make no difference whether law enforcement was
responsible for creating the suggestive circumstances that
marred the identification.
Perry has removed our statement in Brathwaite from its
mooring, and thereby attributes to the statement a meaning a fair reading of our opinion does not bear. As just
explained, supra, at 8–9, the Brathwaite Court’s reference
to reliability appears in a portion of the opinion concerning
the appropriate remedy when the police use an unneces-

11

Opinion of the Court

sarily suggestive identification procedure.
The Court
adopted a judicial screen for reliability as a course preferable to a per se rule requiring exclusion of identification
evidence whenever law enforcement officers employ an
improper procedure. The due process check for reliability,
Brathwaite made plain, comes into play only after the
defendant establishes improper police conduct. The very
purpose of the check, the Court noted, was to avoid depriving the jury of identification evidence that is reliable,
notwithstanding improper police conduct. 432 U. S., at
112–113.6
Perry’s contention that improper police action was not
essential to the reliability check Brathwaite required is
echoed by the dissent. Post, at 3–4. Both ignore a key
premise of the Brathwaite decision: A primary aim of excluding identification evidence obtained under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances, the Court said, is to deter
law enforcement use of improper lineups, showups, and
photo arrays in the first place. See 432 U. S., at 112.
Alerted to the prospect that identification evidence improperly obtained may be excluded, the Court reasoned,
police officers will “guard against unnecessarily suggestive
procedures.” Ibid. This deterrence rationale is inapposite
in cases, like Perry’s, in which the police engaged in no
improper conduct.
Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1 (1970), another decision in the Stovall line, similarly shows that the Court has
linked the due process check, not to suspicion of eyewitness testimony generally, but only to improper police
arrangement of the circumstances surrounding an identi——————
6 The Court’s description of the question presented in Brathwaite
assumes that improper state action occurred: “[Does] the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment compe[l] the exclusion, in a state
criminal trial, apart from any consideration of reliability, of pretrial
identification evidence obtained by a police procedure that was both
suggestive and unnecessary.” 432 U. S., at 99.

PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

fication. The defendants in Coleman contended that a
witness’ in-court identifications violated due process,
because a pretrial stationhouse lineup was “so unduly
prejudicial and conducive to irreparable misidentification
as fatally to taint [the later identifications].” 399 U. S., at
3 (plurality opinion). The Court rejected this argument.
Id., at 5–6 (plurality opinion), 13–14 (Black, J., concurring), 22, n. 2 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), 28, n. 2 (Stewart,
J., dissenting). No due process violation occurred, the
plurality explained, because nothing “the police said or did
prompted [the witness’] virtually spontaneous identification of [the defendants].” Id., at 6. True, Coleman was the
only person in the lineup wearing a hat, the plurality
noted, but “nothing in the record show[ed] that he was
required to do so.” Ibid. See also Colorado v. Connelly,
479 U. S. 157, 163, 167 (1986) (Where the “crucial element
of police overreaching” is missing, the admissibility of an
allegedly unreliable confession is “a matter to be governed
by the evidentiary laws of the forum, . . . and not by the
Due Process Clause.”).
Perry and the dissent place significant weight on United
States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218 (1967), describing it as a
decision not anchored to improper police conduct. See
Brief for Petitioner 12, 15, 21–22, 28; post, at 2–4, 8–10.
In fact, the risk of police rigging was the very danger to
which the Court responded in Wade when it recognized a
defendant’s right to counsel at postindictment, policeorganized identification procedures. 388 U. S., at 233,
235–236. “[T]he confrontation compelled by the State
between the accused and the victim or witnesses,” the
Court began, “is peculiarly riddled with innumerable
dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even
crucially, derogate from a fair trial.” Id., at 228 (emphasis
added). “A major factor contributing to the high incidence
of miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification,” the
Court continued, “has been the degree of suggestion inher-

13

Opinion of the Court

ent in the manner in which the prosecution presents
the suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification.” Ibid.
(emphasis added). To illustrate the improper suggestion it
was concerned about, the Court pointed to police-designed
lineups where “all in the lineup but the suspect were
known to the identifying witness, . . . the other participants in [the] lineup were grossly dissimilar in appearance
to the suspect, . . . only the suspect was required to wear
distinctive clothing which the culprit allegedly wore, . . .
the witness is told by the police that they have caught the
culprit after which the defendant is brought before the
witness alone or is viewed in jail, . . . the suspect is pointed out before or during a lineup, . . . the participants in the
lineup are asked to try on an article of clothing which fits
only the suspect.” Id., at 233 (footnotes omitted). Beyond
genuine debate, then, prevention of unfair police practices
prompted the Court to extend a defendant’s right to counsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups. Id., at
235.
Perry’s argument, reiterated by the dissent, thus lacks
support in the case law he cites. Moreover, his position
would open the door to judicial preview, under the banner
of due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifications. External suggestion is hardly the only factor that
casts doubt on the trustworthiness of an eyewitness’ testimony. As one of Perry’s amici points out, many other
factors bear on “the likelihood of misidentification,” post,
at 9—for example, the passage of time between exposure
to and identification of the defendant, whether the witness
was under stress when he first encountered the suspect,
how much time the witness had to observe the suspect,
how far the witness was from the suspect, whether the
suspect carried a weapon, and the race of the suspect and
the witness. Brief for American Psychological Association
as Amicus Curiae 9–12. There is no reason why an identification made by an eyewitness with poor vision, for ex-


14

PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

ample, or one who harbors a grudge against the defendant, should be regarded as inherently more reliable, less of
a “threat to the fairness of trial,” post, at 14, than the
identification Blandon made in this case. To embrace
Perry’s view would thus entail a vast enlargement of the
reach of due process as a constraint on the admission of
evidence.
Perry maintains that the Court can limit the due process check he proposes to identifications made under
“suggestive circumstances.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–14. Even
if we could rationally distinguish suggestiveness from
other factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perry’s limitation would still involve trial courts,
routinely, in preliminary examinations. Most eyewitness
identifications involve some element of suggestion. Indeed, all in-court identifications do. Out-of-court identifications volunteered by witnesses are also likely to involve
suggestive circumstances. For example, suppose a witness
identifies the defendant to police officers after seeing a
photograph of the defendant in the press captioned “theft
suspect,” or hearing a radio report implicating the defendant in the crime. Or suppose the witness knew that the
defendant ran with the wrong crowd and saw him on the
day and in the vicinity of the crime. Any of these circumstances might have “suggested” to the witness that the
defendant was the person the witness observed committing the crime.
C
In urging a broadly applicable due process check on
eyewitness identifications, Perry maintains that eyewitness identifications are a uniquely unreliable form of
evidence. See Brief for Petitioner 17–22 (citing studies
showing that eyewitness misidentifications are the leading
cause of wrongful convictions); Brief for American Psychological Association as Amicus Curiae 14–17 (describing

15

Opinion of the Court

research indicating that as many as one in three eyewitness identifications is inaccurate). See also post, at 14–17.
We do not doubt either the importance or the fallibility of
eyewitness identifications. Indeed, in recognizing that
defendants have a constitutional right to counsel at
postindictment police lineups, we observed that “the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken
identification.” Wade, 388 U. S., at 228.
We have concluded in other contexts, however, that the
potential unreliability of a type of evidence does not alone
render its introduction at the defendant’s trial fundamentally unfair. See, e.g., Ventris, 556 U. S., at 594, n. (declining to “craft a broa[d] exclusionary rule for uncorroborated
statements obtained [from jailhouse snitches],” even
though “rewarded informant testimony” may be inherently
untrustworthy); Dowling, 493 U. S., at 353 (rejecting argument that the introduction of evidence concerning
acquitted conduct is fundamentally unfair because such
evidence is “inherently unreliable”). We reach a similar
conclusion here: The fallibility of eyewitness evidence does
not, without the taint of improper state conduct, warrant a
due process rule requiring a trial court to screen such
evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess
its creditworthiness.
Our unwillingness to enlarge the domain of due process
as Perry and the dissent urge rests, in large part, on our
recognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally determines the reliability of evidence. See supra, at 7. We
also take account of other safeguards built into our adversary system that caution juries against placing undue
weight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability.
These protections include the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confront the eyewitness. See Maryland v.
Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845 (1990) (“The central concern of
the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of the
evidence against a criminal defendant.”). Another is the

Opinion of the Court

defendant’s right to the effective assistance of an attorney,
who can expose the flaws in the eyewitness’ testimony
during cross-examination and focus the jury’s attention on
the fallibility of such testimony during opening and closing
arguments. Eyewitness-specific jury instructions, which
many federal and state courts have adopted,7 likewise
warn the jury to take care in appraising identification
evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Telfaire, 469 F. 2d
552, 558–559 (CADC 1972) (per curiam) (D. C. Circuit
Model Jury Instructions) (“If the identification by the
witness may have been influenced by the circumstances
under which the defendant was presented to him for identification, you should scrutinize the identification with
great care.”). See also Ventris, 556 U. S., at 594, n. (citing
jury instructions that informed jurors about the unreliability of uncorroborated jailhouse-informant testimony as
a reason to resist a ban on such testimony); Dowling, 493

Opinion of the Court

U. S., at 352–353. The constitutional requirement that
the government prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt also impedes convictions based on dubious identification evidence.
State and federal rules of evidence, moreover, permit
trial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its probative
value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact
or potential for misleading the jury. See, e.g., Fed. Rule
Evid. 403; N. H. Rule Evid. 403 (2011). See also Tr. of
Oral Arg. 19–22 (inquiring whether the standard Perry
seeks differs materially from the one set out in Rule 403).
In appropriate cases, some States also permit defendants
to present expert testimony on the hazards of eyewitness
identification evidence. See, e.g., State v. Clopten, 2009
UT 84, A33, 223 P. 3d 1103, 1113 (“We expect . . . that in
cases involving eyewitness identification of strangers or
near-strangers, trial courts will routinely admit expert
testimony [on the dangers of such evidence].”).
Many of the safeguards just noted were at work at
Perry’s trial. During her opening statement, Perry’s courtappointed attorney cautioned the jury about the vulnerability of Blandon’s identification. App. 115a (Blandon,
“the eyewitness that the State needs you to believe[,] can’t
pick [Perry] out of a photo array. How carefully did she
really see what was going on? . . . How well could she
really see him?”). While cross-examining Blandon and
Officer Clay, Perry’s attorney constantly brought up the
weaknesses of Blandon’s identification. She highlighted:
(1) the significant distance between Blandon’s window and
the parking lot, id., at 226a; (2) the lateness of the hour,
id., at 225a; (3) the van that partly obstructed Blandon’s
view, id., at 226a; (4) Blandon’s concession that she was
“so scared [she] really didn’t pay attention” to what Perry
was wearing, id., at 233a; (5) Blandon’s inability to describe Perry’s facial features or other identifying marks,
id., at 205a, 233a–235a; (6) Blandon’s failure to pick Perry

Opinion of the Court

out of a photo array, id., at 235a; and (7) Perry’s position
next to a uniformed, gun-bearing police officer at the
moment Blandon made her identification, id., at 202a–
205a. Perry’s counsel reminded the jury of these frailties
during her summation.
Id., at 374a–375a (Blandon
“wasn’t able to tell you much about who she saw . . . . She
couldn’t pick [Perry] out of a lineup, out of a photo array
. . . . [Blandon said] [t]hat guy that was with the police
officer, that’s who was circling. Again, think about the
context with the guns, the uniforms. Powerful, powerful
context clues.”).
After closing arguments, the trial court read the jury a
lengthy instruction on identification testimony and the
factors the jury should consider when evaluating it. Id.,
at 399a–401a. The court also instructed the jury that
the defendant’s guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt, id., at 390a, 392a, 395a–396a, and specifically
cautioned that “one of the things the State must prove
[beyond a reasonable doubt] is the identification of the
defendant as the person who committed the offense,” id.,
at 398a–399a.
Given the safeguards generally applicable in criminal
trials, protections availed of by the defense in Perry’s case,
we hold that the introduction of Blandon’s eyewitness
testimony, without a preliminary judicial assessment of its
reliability, did not render Perry’s trial fundamentally
unfair.

For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the New
Hampshire courts’ appraisal of our decisions. See supra,
at 4–5. Finding no convincing reason to alter our precedent, we hold that the Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial inquiry into the reliability of
an eyewitness identification when the identification was
not procured under unnecessarily suggestive circum-
