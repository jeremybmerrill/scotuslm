MARGARET MINNECI, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

RICHARD LEE POLLARD ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 10, 2012]


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question is whether we can imply the existence of
an Eighth Amendment-based damages action (a Bivens
action) against employees of a privately operated federal
prison. See generally Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 389 (1971) (“[V]iolation of [the
Fourth Amendment] by a federal agent . . . gives rise to a
cause of action for damages” against a Federal Government employee). Because we believe that in the circumstances present here state tort law authorizes adequate
alternative damages actions—actions that provide both
significant deterrence and compensation—we cannot do
so. See Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537, 550 (2007) (no
Bivens action where “alternative, existing” processes
provide adequate protection).
I
Richard Lee Pollard was a prisoner at a federal facility
operated by a private company, the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation. In 2002 he filed a pro se complaint in
federal court against several Wackenhut employees, who
(now) include a security officer, a food-services supervisor,

MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

and several members of the medical staff. As the Federal
Magistrate Judge interpreted Pollard’s complaint, he
claimed that these employees had deprived him of adequate medical care, had thereby violated the Eighth
Amendment’s prohibition against “cruel and unusual”
punishment, and had caused him injury. He sought
damages.
Pollard said that a year earlier he had slipped on a cart
left in the doorway of the prison’s butcher shop. The
prison medical staff took x rays, thought he might have
fractured both elbows, brought him to an outside clinic for
further orthopedic evaluation, and subsequently arranged
for surgery. In particular, Pollard claimed:
(1) Despite his having told a prison guard that he could
not extend his arm, the guard forced him to put on a
jumpsuit (to travel to the outside clinic), causing him “the
most excruciating pain,” App. 32;
(2) During several visits to the outside clinic, prison
guards made Pollard wear arm restraints that were connected in a way that caused him continued pain;
(3) Prison medical (and other) personnel failed to follow
the outside clinic’s instructions to put Pollard’s left elbow
in a posterior splint, failed to provide necessary physical
therapy, and failed to conduct necessary studies, including
nerve conduction studies;
(4) At times when Pollard’s arms were in casts or similarly disabled, prison officials failed to make alternative
arrangements for him to receive meals, with the result
that (to avoid “being humiliated” in the general food service area, id., at 35) Pollard had to auction off personal
items to obtain funds to buy food at the commissary;
(5) Prison officials deprived him of basic hygienic care
to the point where he could not bathe for two weeks;
(6) Prison medical staff provided him with insufficient
medicine, to the point where he was in pain and could not
sleep; and

Opinion of the Court

(7) Prison officials forced him to return to work before
his injuries had healed.
After concluding that the Eighth Amendment did not
provide for a Bivens action against a privately managed
prison’s personnel, the Magistrate Judge recommended
that the District Court dismiss Pollard’s complaint. The
District Court did so. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit
found that the Eighth Amendment provided Pollard with a
Bivens action, and it reversed the District Court. Pollard
v. The GEO Group, Inc., 607 F. 3d 583, 603, as amended,
629 F. 3d 843, 868 (CA9 2010).
The defendants sought certiorari. And, in light of a split
among the Courts of Appeals, we granted the petition. Compare ibid. (finding an Eighth Amendment Bivens action
where prisoner sues employees of a privately operated
federal prison), with, e.g., Alba v. Montford, 517 F. 3d
1249, 1254–1256 (CA11 2008) (no Bivens action available),
and Holly v. Scott, 434 F. 3d 287, 288 (CA4 2006) (same).
II
Recently, in Wilkie v. Robbins, supra, we rejected a
claim that the Fifth Amendment impliedly authorized a
Bivens action that would permit landowners to obtain
damages from government officials who unconstitutionally
interfere with their exercise of property rights. After
reviewing the Court’s earlier Bivens cases, the Court
stated:
“[T]he decision whether to recognize a Bivens remedy
may require two steps. In the first place, there is the
question whether any alternative, existing process for
protecting the [constitutionally recognized] interest
amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial
Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages. . . . But even in the absence
of an alternative, a Bivens remedy is a subject of
judgment: ‘the federal courts must make the kind of


4

MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

remedial determination that is appropriate for a
common-law tribunal, paying particular heed, however, to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.’ ” 551
U. S., at 550 (quoting Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367,
378 (1983)).
These standards seek to reflect and to reconcile the
Court’s reasoning set forth in earlier cases. In Bivens
itself the Court held that the Fourth Amendment implicitly authorized a court to order federal agents to pay damages to a person injured by the agents’ violation of the
Amendment’s constitutional strictures. 403 U. S., at 389.
The Court noted that “ ‘where federally protected rights
have been invaded,’ ”courts can “ ‘adjust their remedies so
as to grant the necessary relief.’ ” Id., at 392 (quoting Bell
v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946)). See also Correctional
Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 66 (2001) (“authority to imply a new constitutional tort” anchored within
general “ ‘arising under’ ” jurisdiction). It pointed out that
the Fourth Amendment prohibited, among other things,
conduct that state law might permit (such as the conduct
at issue in that very case). Bivens, 403 U. S., at 392–393.
It added that the interests protected on the one hand by
state “trespass” and “invasion of privacy” laws and on the
other hand by the Fourth Amendment’s guarantees “may
be inconsistent or even hostile.” Id., at 394. It stated
that “[h]istorically, damages have been regarded as the
ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in
liberty.” Id., at 395. And it found “no special factors
counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action
by Congress.” Id., at 396.
In Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979), the Court
considered a former congressional employee’s claim for
damages suffered as a result of her employer’s unconstitutional discrimination based on gender. The Court found a

5

Opinion of the Court

damages action implicit in the Fifth Amendment’s Due
Process Clause. Id., at 248–249. In doing so, the Court
emphasized the unavailability of “other alternative forms
of judicial relief.” Id., at 245. And the Court noted that
there was “no evidence” that Congress (or the Constitution) intended to foreclose such a remedy. Id., at 247.
In Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980), the Court
considered a claim for damages brought by the estate of
a federal prisoner who (the estate said) had died as the
result of government officials’ “deliberat[e] indifferen[ce]”
to his medical needs—indifference that violated the
Eighth Amendment. Id., at 16, n. 1, 17 (citing Estelle v.
Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976)). The Court implied an action
for damages from the Eighth Amendment. 446 U. S., at
17–18. It noted that state law offered the particular plaintiff no meaningful damages remedy. Id., at 17, n. 4.
Although the estate might have brought a damages claim
under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the defendant in any
such lawsuit was the employer, namely the United States,
not the individual officers who had committed the violation. Id., at 21. A damages remedy against an individual
officer, the Court added, would prove a more effective
deterrent. Ibid. And, rather than leave compensation to
the “vagaries” of state tort law, a federal Bivens action
would provide “uniform rules.” 446 U. S., at 23.
Since Carlson, the Court has had to decide in several
different instances whether to imply a Bivens action. And
in each instance it has decided against the existence of
such an action. These instances include:
(1) A federal employee’s claim that his federal employer
dismissed him in violation of the First Amendment, Bush,
supra, at 386–388 (congressionally created federal civil
service procedures provide meaningful redress);
(2) A claim by military personnel that military superiors violated various constitutional provisions, Chappell v.
Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 298–300 (1983) (special factors


6

MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

related to the military counsel against implying a Bivens
action), see also United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669,
683–684 (1987) (similar);
(3) A claim by recipients of Social Security disability
benefits that benefits had been denied in violation of the
Fifth Amendment, Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412,
414, 425 (1988) (elaborate administrative scheme provides
meaningful alternative remedy);
(4) A former bank employee’s suit against a federal
banking agency, claiming that he lost his job due to agency
action that violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process
Clause, FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 484–486 (1994) (no
Bivens actions against government agencies rather than
particular individuals who act unconstitutionally);
(5) A prisoner’s Eighth Amendment-based suit against
a private corporation that managed a federal prison, Malesko, 534 U. S., at 70–73 (to permit suit against the
employer-corporation would risk skewing relevant incentives; at the same time, the ability of a prisoner to bring
state tort law damages action against private individual
defendants means that the prisoner does not “lack effective remedies,” id., at 72).
Although the Court, in reaching its decisions, has not
always similarly emphasized the same aspects of the
cases, Wilkie fairly summarizes the basic considerations
that underlie those decisions. 551 U. S., at 550. We consequently apply its approach here. And we conclude that
Pollard cannot assert a Bivens claim.
That is primarily because Pollard’s Eighth Amendment
claim focuses upon a kind of conduct that typically falls
within the scope of traditional state tort law. And in the
case of a privately employed defendant, state tort law
provides an “alternative, existing process” capable of
protecting the constitutional interests at stake. 551 U. S.,
at 550. The existence of that alternative here constitutes
a “convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain

7

Opinion of the Court

from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.” Ibid. Our reasoning is best understood if we set
forth and explain why we reject Pollard’s arguments to the
contrary.
III
Pollard (together with supporting amici) asks us to
imply a Bivens action for four basic reasons—none of
which we find convincing. First, Pollard argues that this
Court has already decided in Carlson that a federal prisoner may bring an Eighth Amendment-based Bivens
action against prison personnel; and we need do no more
than simply apply Carlson’s holding here. Carlson, however, was a case in which a federal prisoner sought damages from personnel employed by the government, not
personnel employed by a private firm. 446 U. S., at 25.
And for present purposes that fact—of employment
status—makes a critical difference.
For one thing, the potential existence of an adequate
“alternative, existing process” differs dramatically in the
two sets of cases. Prisoners ordinarily cannot bring statelaw tort actions against employees of the Federal Government. See 28 U. S. C. §§2671, 2679(b)(1) (Westfall Act)
(substituting United States as defendant in tort action
against federal employee); Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225,
238, 241 (2007) (Westfall Act immunizes federal employee
through removal and substitution of United States as
defendant). But prisoners ordinarily can bring state-law
tort actions against employees of a private firm. Infra, at
9–10.
For another thing, the Court specifically rejected Justice
Stevens’ somewhat similar suggestion in his dissenting
opinion in Malesko, namely that a prisoner’s suit against a
private prison-management firm should fall within Carlson’s earlier holding because such a firm, like a federal
employee, is a “federal agent.” Compare Malesko, 534


8

MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

U. S., at 70, and n. 4 (majority opinion), with id., at 76–77,
82 (dissenting opinion). In rejecting the dissent’s suggestion, the Court explained that the context in Malesko was
“fundamentally different” from the contexts at issue in
earlier cases, including Carlson. 534 U. S., at 70. That
difference, the Court said, reflected in part the nature of
the defendant, i.e., a corporate employer rather than an
individual employee, ibid., and in part reflected the existence of alternative “effective” state tort remedies, id., at
72–73. This last-mentioned factor makes it difficult to
square Pollard’s argument with Malesko’s reasoning.
Second, Pollard argues that, because of the “vagaries” of
state tort law, Carlson, 446 U. S., at 23, we should consider only whether federal law provides adequate alternative
remedies. See id., at 18–19, 23 (considering adequacy of
federal remedies); see also, e.g., Schweiker, supra, at 423
(similar); Bush, 462 U. S., at 378 (similar). But cf. Carlson, supra, at 24 (“ ‘[R]elevant Indiana statute would not
permit survival of the [state tort] claim’ ”). This argument
flounders, however, on the fact that the Court rejected it
in Malesko. Compare 534 U. S., at 72–73 (majority opinion), with id., at 79–80 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (making
similar suggestion). State tort law, after all, can help to
deter constitutional violations as well as to provide compensation to a violation’s victim. And it is consequently
unsurprising that several cases have considered the adequacy or inadequacy of state-law remedies when determining whether to imply a Bivens remedy. See, e.g., Bivens,
403 U. S., at 394 (state tort law “inconsistent or even
hostile” to Fourth Amendment); Davis, 442 U. S., at 245,
n. 23 (noting no state-law remedy available); cf. Malesko,
supra, at 70 (noting that the Court has implied Bivens
action only where any alternative remedy against individual officers was “nonexistent” or where plaintiff “lacked
any alternative remedy” at all).
Third, Pollard argues that state tort law does not pro-

Opinion of the Court

vide remedies adequate to protect the constitutional interests at issue here. Pollard’s claim, however, is a claim for
physical or related emotional harm suffered as a result of
aggravated instances of the kind of conduct that state
tort law typically forbids. That claim arose in California,
where state tort law provides for ordinary negligence
actions, for actions based upon “want of ordinary care or
skill,” for actions for “negligent failure to diagnose or
treat,” and for actions based upon the failure of one with a
custodial duty to care for another to protect that other
from “ ‘unreasonable risk of physical harm.’ ” See Cal. Civ.
Code Ann. §§1714(a), 1714.8(a) (West 2009 and Supp.
2012); Giraldo v. California Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 168 Cal. App. 4th 231, 248, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d
371, 384 (2008) (quoting Haworth v. State, 60 Haw. 557,
562, 592 P. 2d 820, 824 (1979)). California courts have
specifically applied this law to jailers, including private
operators of prisons. Giraldo, supra, at 252, 85 Cal. Rptr.
3d, at 387 (“[J]ailers owe prisoners a duty of care to protect them from foreseeable harm”); see also Lawson v.
Superior Ct., 180 Cal. App. 4th 1372, 1389–1390, 1397,
103 Cal. Rptr. 3d 834, 849–850, 855 (2010) (same).
Moreover, California’s tort law basically reflects general
principles of tort law present, as far as we can tell, in the
law of every State. See Restatement (Second) of Torts
§§314A(4), 320 (1963–1964). We have found specific authority indicating that state law imposes general tort
duties of reasonable care (including medical care) on prison employees in every one of the eight States where privately managed secure federal facilities are currently located. See Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisions,

when necessary, and to treat him humanely and refrain

Human Servs., 176 N. C. App. 278, 280, 626 S. E. 2d 666,
668 (2006) (North Carolina, same); Clemets v. Heston, 20
Ohio App. 3d 132, 135–136, 485 N. E. 2d 287, 291 (1985)
(Ohio, same); Williams v. Syed, 782 A. 2d 1090, 1093–1094
(Pa. Commw. 2001) (Pennsylvania, same); Salazar v.
Collins, 255 S. W. 3d 191, 198–200 (Tex. App. 2008) (Texas, same); see also Schellenger, 14 A. L. R. 2d 353, §2[a]
(Later Case Service and Supp. 2011) (same). But cf. Miss.
Code. Ann. §11–46–9(1)(m) (Supp. 2011) (statute forbidding such actions against State—though not private—
employees); N. Y. Correc. Law Ann. §§24 (West 2003), 121
(2011 Cum. Supp.) (similar).
We note, as Pollard points out, that state tort law may
sometimes prove less generous than would a Bivens action, say, by capping damages, see Cal. Civ. Code Ann.
§3333.2(b) (West 1997), or by forbidding recovery for emotional suffering unconnected with physical harm, see 629
F. 3d, at 864, or by imposing procedural obstacles, say,
initially requiring the use of expert administrative panels
in medical malpractice cases, see, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.,
Tit. 24, §2853, (Supp. 2010); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 231,
§60B (West 2010). But we cannot find in this fact sufficient basis to determine state law inadequate.
State-law remedies and a potential Bivens remedy need
not be perfectly congruent. See Bush, supra, at 388 (administrative remedies adequate even though they “do not
provide complete relief ”). Indeed, federal law as well as


Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)

11

Opinion of the Court

state law contains limitations. Prisoners bringing federal
lawsuits, for example, ordinarily may not seek damages
for mental or emotional injury unconnected with physical
injury. See 42 U. S. C. §1997e(e). And Bivens actions,
even if more generous to plaintiffs in some respects, may
be less generous in others. For example, to show an
Eighth Amendment violation a prisoner must typically
show that a defendant acted, not just negligently, but with
“deliberate indifference.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S.
825, 834 (1994). And a Bivens plaintiff, unlike a state
tort law plaintiff, normally could not apply principles of
respondeat superior and thereby obtain recovery from a
defendant’s potentially deep-pocketed employer. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 676 (2009).
Rather, in principle, the question is whether, in general,
state tort law remedies provide roughly similar incentives
for potential defendants to comply with the Eighth
Amendment while also providing roughly similar compensation to victims of violations. The features of the two
kinds of actions just mentioned suggest that, in practice,
the answer to this question is “yes.” And we have found
nothing here to convince us to the contrary.
Fourth, Pollard argues that there “may” be similar
kinds of Eighth Amendment claims that state tort law
does not cover. But Pollard does not convincingly show
that there are such cases. Compare Brief for Respondent
Pollard 32 (questioning the availability of state tort remedies for “prisoners [who] suffer attacks by other inmates,
preventable suicides, or the denial of heat, ventilation or
movement”), with Giraldo, supra, at 248–249, 85 Cal Rptr.
3d, at 384–385 (courts have long held that prison officials
must protect, e.g., transgender inmate from foreseeable
harm by other inmates), and Restatement (Second) of
Torts §§314A(4), 320.
Regardless, we concede that we cannot prove a negative
or be totally certain that the features of state tort law


12

MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

relevant here will universally prove to be, or remain, as we
have described them. Nonetheless, we are certain enough
about the shape of present law as applied to the kind of
case before us to leave different cases and different state
laws to another day. That is to say, we can decide whether to imply a Bivens action in a case where an Eighth
Amendment claim or state law differs significantly from
those at issue here when and if such a case arises. The
possibility of such a different future case does not provide
sufficient grounds for reaching a different conclusion here.
For these reasons, where, as here, a federal prisoner
seeks damages from privately employed personnel working at a privately operated federal prison, where the conduct allegedly amounts to a violation of the Eighth
Amendment, and where that conduct is of a kind that
typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law
(such as the conduct involving improper medical care at
issue here), the prisoner must seek a remedy under state
tort law. We cannot imply a Bivens remedy in such a case.
The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.
So ordered.
