GLORIA GAIL KURNS, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE

OF GEORGE M. CORSON, DECEASED, ET AL., 

PETITIONERS v. RAILROAD FRICTION 

PRODUCTS CORPORATION ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF



APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT



[February 29, 2012]




JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring in part and dissent­
ing in part.
I concur in the Court’s holding that the Locomotive
Inspection Act (LIA), 49 U. S. C. §20701 et seq., pre-empts
petitioners’ tort claims for defective design, but I respect­
fully dissent from the Court’s holding that the same is
true of petitioners’ claims for failure to warn. In my view,
the latter escape pre-emption because they impose no
state-law requirements in the field reserved for federal
regulation: “the equipment of locomotives.” Napier v.
Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 612 (1926).
I
Statutory stare decisis compels me to agree that the LIA
occupies “the field of regulating locomotive equipment
used on a highway of interstate commerce.” Id., at 607.
Perhaps this Court might decide Napier differently today.
The LIA lacks an express pre-emption clause, and “our
recent cases have frequently rejected field pre-emption in
the absence of statutory language expressly requiring it.”
Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison,
520 U. S. 564, 617 (1997) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The

KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

LIA contains no substantive regulations, let alone a
“scheme of federal regulation . . . so pervasive as to make
reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the
States to supplement it.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,
331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). Instead of relying on such
indications of Congress’ intent to oust state law, Napier
implied field pre-emption from the LIA’s mere delegation
of regulatory authority to the Interstate Commerce Com­
mission. Compare 272 U. S., at 612–613, with, e.g., Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,
471 U. S. 707, 717 (1985), and New York State Dept. of
Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S. 405, 415 (1973). None­
theless, Napier’s construction of the LIA has been settled
law for 85 years, and “ ‘[c]onsiderations of stare decisis
have special force in the area of statutory interpretation.’ ”
Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, 502
U. S. 197, 202 (1991).
Consistent with the values served by statutory stare
decisis, however, it is important to be precise about what
Napier held: Napier defined the pre-empted field as the
physical composition of locomotive equipment. See 272
U. S., at 611 (“[T]he power delegated . . . by the [LIA] . . .
extends to the design, the construction, and the material
of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all ap­
purtenances”); id., at 612 (“The federal and the state
statutes are directed to the same subject—the equipment
of locomotives. They operate upon the same object”); see
also Act of June 7, 1924, §2, 43 Stat. 659 (making the
LIA’s standard of care applicable to the “locomotive, its
boiler, tender, and all parts and appurtenances thereof ”).
Petitioners’ defective-design claims fall within the pre­
empted field because they would impose state-law re­
quirements on a locomotive’s physical makeup. See ante,
at 7–8.

Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

II
Petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims, by contrast, proceed
on a fundamentally different theory of tort liability that
does not implicate a product’s physical composition at all.
A failure-to-warn claim asks nothing of a product’s design, but requires instead that a manufacturer caution of
nonobvious dangers and provide instructions for safe use.
Indeed, a product may be flawlessly designed and still
subject its manufacturer or seller to liability for lack of
adequate instructions or warnings. See, e.g., Madden, The
Duty To Warn in Products Liability: Contours and Criti­
cism, 89 W. Va. L. Rev. 221 (1987) (“Although a product is
unerringly designed, manufactured and assembled, injury
or damage occasioned by its intended or reasonably fore­
seeable use may subject the seller to liability. Such liabil­
ity may be found if the product has a potential for injury
that is not readily apparent to the user” (cited in Restate­
ment (Third) of Torts: Products Liability §2, Reporter’s
Note, Comment i, n. 1 (1997) (hereinafter Restatement));
see also Madden, 89 W. Va. L. Rev., at 221, n. 1 (collecting
cases). Petitioners’ complaint embodies just this concep­
tual distinction. Compare App. 22–23, ¶¶10(c)–(e), (g),
with id., at 25, ¶10(p).1
In the jurisdictions relevant to this suit, failure to warn
is “a distinct cause of action under the theory of strict
products liability.” Riley v. American Honda Motor Co.,
259 Mont. 128, 132, 856 P. 2d 196, 198 (1993). Thus, “ ‘a
failure to warn of an injury[-]causing risk associated with
the use of a technically pure and fit product can render
such product unreasonably dangerous.’ ” Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Jahnig v. Coisman, 283 N. W. 2d 557, 560 (S. D. 1979)
——————
1 Nor

do petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims allege that respondents’
locomotive parts should have been altered, for example, by affixing
warnings to the products themselves. See App. 22–23, ¶¶10(c)–(e), (g);
id., at 27, ¶12(d).

KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

(“In products liability suits based upon strict liability, . . .
the product itself need not be defective. Where a manufac­
turer or seller has reason to anticipate that danger may
result from a particular use of his product, and he fails to
give adequate warning of such a danger, the product sold
without such warning is in a defective condition within
the strict liability doctrine”); Greiner v. Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengeselleschaft, 540 F. 2d 85, 92–93 (CA3 1976) (find­
ing that “failure to adequately warn of inherent or latent
limitations in a product, which do not necessarily amount
to a design defect” is “an independent basis of liability”
under Pennsylvania law).2
Similarly, this Court has explained that a failure-to­
warn claim is “narrower” than a claim that alleges a defect
in the underlying product. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,
565 (2009). Thus in Wyeth, this Court affirmed a state
damages award based on a drug manufacturer’s failure to
provide sufficient warnings to clinicians against intrave­
nous administration of the drug, but noted that it was
unnecessary to decide “whether a state rule proscribing
intravenous administration would be pre-empted.” Ibid.
Cf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 444
(2005) (“Rules that require manufacturers to design rea­
sonably safe products . . . plainly do not qualify as re­
quirements for ‘labeling or packaging.’ None of these
common-law rules requires that manufacturers label or
package their products in any particular way”).
The majority treats defective-design and failure-to-warn
claims as congruent, reasoning that each asserts a product
defect. See ante, at 8–9 (citing Restatement §2(c) and
——————
2 Petitioners brought suit in Pennsylvania, but alleged that their
decedent, George Corson, was exposed to asbestos at railroad mainte­
nance and repair shops in Montana and South Dakota. Id., at 42, ¶¶6–
7. Because the District Court granted summary judgment on the issue
of pre-emption, it performed no choice-of-law analysis to identify the
applicable substantive state law. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a–39a.

Comment l). That may be true at a high level of generality, but “[d]esign and failure-to-warn claims . . . rest on
different factual allegations and distinct legal concepts.”
Restatement §2, at 35, Comment n. For example, a manu­
facturer or seller cannot escape liability for an unreasona­
bly unsafe design merely by issuing a warning. See id., at
33, Comment l (“Warnings are not . . . a substitute for the
provision of a reasonably safe design”). In a fundamental
sense, therefore, a failure-to-warn claim proceeds by tak­
ing a product’s physical design as a given. A failure-to­
warn claim alleges a “defect” by asserting that a product,
as designed, is safe for use only when accompanied by a
warning—not that a product must be designed differently.
The majority further conflates defective-design and
failure-to-warn claims by noting that each is “directed at”
locomotive equipment. Ante, at 9. That is insufficient.
Not every state law that “could be said to affect tangen­
tially” matters within the regulated field is pre-empted.
English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990).
Rather, “for a state law to fall within the pre-empted zone,
it must have some direct and substantial effect” on the
primary conduct of entities subject to federal regulation.
Ibid. As explained above, the LIA regulates the physical
equipment of locomotives. But petitioners’ failure-to-warn
claims, if successful, would have no necessary effect on the
physical equipment of locomotives at all, as respondents
themselves acknowledge. See Brief for Respondents 55
(petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims “may not themselves
literally mandate physical alteration of the locomotive’s
design or construction”).
In the majority’s view, a “duty to warn and the accom­
panying threat of liability will inevitably influence” a
manufacturer’s design choices. Ante, at 9, n. 4. But an
“influence” is not the same as an “effect,” and not every
state law with some imaginable impact on matters within
a federally regulated field is, for that reason alone, pre­

empted. See English, 496 U. S., at 85–86; Silkwood v.
Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 256 (1984). Indeed, the
majority elides the distinction between indirect and direct
regulation, even though this Court has explained that
the two are not equivalent for pre-emption purposes. See
Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 186 (1988)
(“Congress may reasonably determine that incidental regulatory pressure is acceptable, whereas direct regulatory
authority is not”). State wage-and-hour laws, workplace safety standards, or tax credits for green technology,
for example, could all “influence” the means and materials
of locomotive equipment manufacture without imposing
direct obligations. Nor does the majority substantiate its
assertion that the “influence” exerted by a duty to warn
need be “inevitabl[e]” or “substantial.” Ante, at 9, n. 4. To
the contrary, the requirements imposed by such a duty
could be light, and the corresponding liability negligible,
in comparison to the commercial value of retaining an
existing design.
Respondents could have complied with state-law duties
to warn by providing instructions for the safe maintenance
of asbestos-containing locomotive parts in equipment man­
uals. See, e.g., Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., Engine
Manual for 600 Series Diesel Engines (1951), online at
http://www.rr-fallenflags.org/manual/blh-6em.html
(last
visited Feb. 27, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file). Or respondents could have ensured that repair
shops posted signs. See Restatement §2, at 29–30, Com­
ment i (duty to warn “may require that instructions and
warnings be given not only to purchasers, users, and
consumers, but also to others who a reasonable seller
should know will be in a position to reduce or avoid the
risk of harm”); see also, e.g., Patch v. Hillerich & Bradsby
Co., 361 Mont. 241, 246, 257 P. 3d 383, 388 (2011) (“While
placing a warning directly on a product is one method of
warning, other methods of warning exist, including, but

not limited to, issuing oral warnings and placing warnings
in advertisements, posters, and media releases”). Neither
step would encroach on the pre-empted field of locomo­
tives’ “physical elements.” Napier, 272 U. S., at 612. The
majority is therefore wrong to say that “the ‘gravamen’ of
petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims ‘is still that [Corson]
suffered harmful consequences as a result of his exposure
to asbestos contained in locomotive parts and appurte­
nances.’ ” Ante, at 8–9 (quoting Kurns v. A. W. Chesteron,
Inc., 620 F. 3d 392, 398, n. 8 (CA3 2010)). Rather, the
“gravamen” of these claims is that petitioners’ decedent
George Corson could have avoided the harmful conse­
quences of exposure to asbestos while repairing precisely
the same locomotive parts had respondents cautioned him,
for example, to wear a mask.
Finally, preserving petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims
coheres with the LIA’s regulatory regime. Neither the
Interstate Commerce Commission, to which Congress first
delegated authority under the LIA, nor the Federal Rail­
road Administration (FRA), to whom that authority now
belongs, has ever regulated locomotive repair and mainte­
nance. To the contrary, the FRA takes the position that it
lacks power under the LIA to regulate within locomotive
maintenance and repair facilities. Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae in John Crane, Inc. v. Atwell, O. T.
2010, No. 10–272, p. 10 (“[T]he field covered by the LIA
does not include requirements concerning the repair of
locomotives that are not in use”); Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 13 (“The preempted field . . . does not
include tort claims based on injuries arising when locomo­
tives are not in use”). The FRA has determined that the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not itself,
bears primary responsibility for workplace safety, includ­
ing with respect to hazardous materials. 43 Fed. Reg.
10583–10590 (1978); cf., e.g., English, 496 U. S., at 83, and
n. 6. And the FRA has not promulgated regulations that


8

KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

address warnings specific to maintenance and repair.
Because the pre-empted field is congruent with the regu­
lated field, see, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89,
112 (2000), the majority’s decision sweeps far too broadly.3
*
*
*
In short, the majority affords the LIA field-pre-emptive
effect well beyond what Napier requires, leaving petition­
ers without a remedy for what they allege was fatal ex­
posure to asbestos in repair facilities. “It is difficult to
believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all
means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal
conduct.” Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 251. That is doubly true
in light of the LIA’s “purpose . . . of facilitating employee
recovery, not of restricting such recovery or making it
impossible.” Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 189 (1949).
I therefore concur in part and dissent in part.

——————
3 Disagreeing with the agency’s interpretation, JUSTICE KAGAN con­
cludes that the LIA empowers the FRA to require warnings as an
incident of the authority to prescribe locomotive design. Compare ante,
2–3 (concurring opinion), with, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 22–23. Such power,
if it exists, must be limited to warnings that impose direct require­
ments on the physical composition of locomotive equipment. Cf. n. 1,
supra; 49 CFR §§229.85, 229.113 (2010). That may be a formal line,
but it is the line that this Court drew in describing the scope of the
authority conferred by the LIA, and therefore the pre-empted field. See
Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 611–612 (1926).
And it is the line that separates petitioners’ design-defect claims from
their claims for failure to warn.
