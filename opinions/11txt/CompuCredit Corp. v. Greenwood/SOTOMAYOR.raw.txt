COMPUCREDIT CORPORATION, ET AL., PETITIONERS
v. WANDA GREENWOOD ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 10, 2012]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE KAGAN joins,
concurring in the judgment.
Claims alleging the violation of a statute, such as the
Credit Repair Organizations Act (Act), 15 U. S. C. §1679
et seq., are generally subject to valid arbitration agreements unless Congress evinces a contrary intent in the
text, history, or purpose of the statute. See Gilmer v.
Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 26 (1991). I
agree with the Court that Congress has not shown that
intent here. But for the reasons stated by the dissent, I
find this to be a much closer case than the majority opinion suggests.
The Act creates a cause of action in its liability provision, see §1679g(a), denominates the cause of action a
“right to sue” in the mandatory disclosure statement,
§1679c(a), and then provides that “right[s]” may not be
waived, §1679f(a). Those for whom Congress wrote the
Act—lay readers “of limited economic means and . . .
inexperienced in credit matters,” §1679(a)(2)—reasonably
may interpret the phrase “right to sue” as promising a
right to sue in court. And it is plausible to think that
Congress, aware of the impact of its words, intended such
a construction of the liability provision.
But while this interpretation of the Act is plausible, it is
in my view no more compelling than the contrary con-

struction that petitioners urge. As the majority opinion
notes, the disclosure provision does not itself confer a
cause of action, and the liability provision that does is
materially indistinguishable from other statutes that we
have held not to preclude arbitration. In my mind this
leaves the parties’ arguments in equipoise, and our precedents require that petitioners prevail in this circumstance.
This is because respondents, as the opponents of arbitration, bear the burden of showing that Congress disallowed
arbitration of their claims, and because we resolve doubts
in favor of arbitration. See id., at 26. Of course, if we
have misread Congress’ intent, then Congress can correct
our error by amending the statute.
I add one more point. The majority opinion contrasts
the liability provision of the Act with other, more recently
enacted statutes that expressly disallow arbitration. I do
not understand the majority opinion to hold that Congress
must speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to
preclude arbitration of statutory claims. We have never
said as much, and on numerous occasions have held that
proof of Congress’ intent may also be discovered in the
history or purpose of the statute in question. See ibid. (“If
such an intention exists, it will be discoverable in the text
of the [statute], its legislative history, or an ‘inherent
conflict’ between arbitration and the [statute’s] underlying
purposes”); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon,
482 U. S. 220, 227 (1987) (“If Congress did intend to limit
or prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular
claim, such an intent ‘will be deducible from [the statute’s]
text or legislative history,’ or from an inherent conflict
between arbitration and the statute’s underlying purposes” (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler ChryslerPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985); citation omitted)). I agree with the dissent that the statutes the
majority opinion cites shed little light on the thoughts of
the Congress that passed the Act. But the Act’s text is not

dispositive, and respondents identify nothing in the legislative history or purpose of the Act that would tip the
balance of the scale in favor of their interpretation.
