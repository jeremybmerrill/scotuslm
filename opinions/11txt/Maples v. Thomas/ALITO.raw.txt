CORY R. MAPLES, PETITIONER v. KIM T. THOMAS,

COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF 

CORRECTIONS 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[January 18, 2012]


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court. Unbeknownst to petitioner, he was effectively deprived of legal representation
due to the combined effect of no fewer than eight unfortunate events: (1) the departure from their law firm of the
two young lawyers who appeared as counsel of record in
his state postconviction proceeding; (2) the acceptance by
these two attorneys of new employment that precluded
them from continuing to represent him; (3) their failure to
notify petitioner of their new situation; (4) their failure to
withdraw as his counsel of record; (5) the apparent failure
of the firm that they left to monitor the status of petitioner’s case when these attorneys departed; (6) when notice of
the decision denying petitioner’s request for state postconviction relief was received in that firm’s offices, the
failure of the firm’s mail room to route that important
communication to either another member of the firm or to
the departed attorneys’ new addresses; (7) the failure of
the clerk’s office to take any action when the envelope
containing that notice came back unopened; and (8) local
counsel’s very limited conception of the role that he was
obligated to play in petitioner’s representation. Under
these unique circumstances, I agree that petitioner’s
attorneys effectively abandoned him and that this aban-

donment was a “cause” that is sufficient to overcome petitioner’s procedural default.
In an effort to obtain relief for his client, petitioner’s
counsel in the case now before us cast blame for what
occurred on Alabama’s system of providing legal representation for capital defendants at trial and in state collateral
proceedings. See Brief for Petitioner 3–6. But whatever
may be said about Alabama’s system, I do not think that
Alabama’s system had much if anything to do with petitioner’s misfortune. The quality of petitioner’s representation at trial obviously played no role in the failure to meet
the deadline for filing his notice of appeal from the denial
of his state postconviction petition. Nor do I see any important connection between what happened in this case
and Alabama’s system for providing representation for
prisoners who are sentenced to death and who wish to
petition the state courts for collateral relief. Unlike other
States, Alabama relies on attorneys who volunteer to
represent these prisoners pro bono, and we are told that
most of these volunteers work for large, out-of-state firms.
Id., at 4. Petitioner’s brief states that the Alabama system
had “a direct bearing on the events giving rise . . . to the
procedural default at issue,” id., at 3, but a similar combination of untoward events could have occurred if petitioner had been represented by Alabama attorneys who were
appointed by the court and paid for with state funds. The
firm whose lawyers represented petitioner pro bono is one
of the country’s most prestigious and expensive, and I
have little doubt that the vast majority of criminal defendants would think that they had won the lottery if they
were given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys
from such a firm. See id., at 9 (stating that it “seemed as
though Maples had won the lottery when two attorneys
working at an elite New York law firm . . . agreed to represent Maples pro bono”).
What occurred here was not a predictable consequence

of the Alabama system but a veritable perfect storm of
misfortune, a most unlikely combination of events that,
without notice, effectively deprived petitioner of legal representation. Under these unique circumstances, I agree
that petitioner’s procedural default is overcome.
