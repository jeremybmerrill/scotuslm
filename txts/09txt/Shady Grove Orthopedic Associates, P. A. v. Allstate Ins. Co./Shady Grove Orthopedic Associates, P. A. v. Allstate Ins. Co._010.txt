Opinion of SCALIA, J.
the Court

“prescrib[ing] the considerations relevant to class certifica­
tion and postcertification proceedings,” §901(b) addresses
only “the size of a monetary award a class plaintiff may
pursue.” Post, at 11–12. Accordingly, the dissent says,
Rule 23 and New York’s law may coexist in peace.
We need not decide whether a state law that limits the
remedies available in an existing class action would con­
flict with Rule 23; that is not what §901(b) does. By its
terms, the provision precludes a plaintiff from “main­
tain[ing]” a class action seeking statutory penalties.
Unlike a law that sets a ceiling on damages (or puts other
remedies out of reach) in properly filed class actions,
§901(b) says nothing about what remedies a court may
award; it prevents the class actions it covers from coming
into existence at all.4 Consequently, a court bound by
§901(b) could not certify a class action seeking both statu­
tory penalties and other remedies even if it announces in
advance that it will refuse to award the penalties in the
event the plaintiffs prevail; to do so would violate the
statute’s clear prohibition on “maintain[ing]” such suits as
class actions.
The dissent asserts that a plaintiff can avoid §901(b)’s
barrier by omitting from his complaint (or removing) a
request for statutory penalties. See post, at 14–15. Even
assuming all statutory penalties are waivable,5 the fact
——————
4 Contrary to the dissent’s implication, post, at 13, we express no view
as to whether state laws that set a ceiling on damages recoverable in a
single suit, see App. A to Brief for Respondent, are pre-empted.
Whether or not those laws conflict with Rule 23, §901(b) does conflict
because it addresses not the remedy, but the procedural right to main­
tain a class action. As Allstate and the dissent note, several federal
statutes also limit the recovery available in class actions. See, e.g., 12
U. S. C. §2605(f)(2)(B); 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(B); 29 U. S. C.
§1854(c)(1). But Congress has plenary power to override the Federal
Rules, so its enactments, unlike those of the States, prevail even in case
of a conflict.
5 But see, e.g., Asher v. Abbott Labs., 290 App. Div. 2d 208, 737
