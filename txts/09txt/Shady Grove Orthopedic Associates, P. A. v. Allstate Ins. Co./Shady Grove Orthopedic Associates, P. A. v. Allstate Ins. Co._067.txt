SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Shady Grove also observes that a New York court has
applied §901(b) to a federal claim for relief under the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), 47
U. S. C. §227, see Rudgayzer & Gratt v. Cape Canaveral
Tour & Travel, Inc., 22 App. Div. 3d 148, 799 N. Y. S. 2d
795 (2005), thus revealing §901(b)’s “procedural” cast.
Brief for Petitioner 36. We note first that the TCPA itself
calls for the application of state law. See Rudgayzer, 22
App. Div. 3d, at 149–150, 799 N. Y. S. 2d, at 796–797
(federal action authorized in state court “if otherwise
permitted by the laws or rules of the court of [the] State”
(quoting 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3))). See also Gottlieb v.
Carnival Corp., 436 F. 3d 335, 342 (CA2 2006) (Sotomayor,
J.) (“Congress sought, via the TCPA, to enact the func
tional equivalent of a state law.”). The TCPA, the Su
preme Court of Connecticut has recognized, thus “carves
out an exception to th[e] general rule” that “when Erie . . .
is reversed . . . , a state court hearing a federal case is
normally required to apply federal substantive law”: “Un
der §227(b)(3) . . . it is state substantive law that deter
mines, as a preliminary matter, whether a federal action
under the act may be brought in state court.” Weber v.
U. S. Sterling Securities, Inc., 282 Conn. 722, 736, 924
A. 2d 816, 826 (2007) (in TCPA action governed by New
York substantive law, §901(b) applied even though the
claim was pursued in Connecticut state court).

added)). See also, e.g., Walker, 446 U. S., at 742–743, and n. 4 (Okla
homa statute deemed “[a]n action” commenced for purposes of the
statute of limitations upon service of the summons (quoting Okla. Stat.,
Tit. 12, §97 (1971)). Our characterization of a state statute as substan
tive for Erie purposes has never hinged on whether the law applied only
to domestic causes of action. To the contrary, we have ranked as
substantive a variety of state laws that the state courts apply to federal
and out-of-state claims, including statutes of limitations and burden-of
proof prescriptions. See infra, at 21.
