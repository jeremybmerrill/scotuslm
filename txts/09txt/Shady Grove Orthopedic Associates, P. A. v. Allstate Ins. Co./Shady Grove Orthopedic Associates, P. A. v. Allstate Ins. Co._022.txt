Opinion of SCALIA, J.

rights without consulting State law: If the Rule creates a
substantive right, even one that duplicates some state­
created rights, it establishes a new federal right. But it is
hard to understand how it can be determined whether a
Federal Rule “abridges” or “modifies” substantive rights
without knowing what state-created rights would obtain if
the Federal Rule did not exist. Sibbach’s exclusive focus
on the challenged Federal Rule—driven by the very real
concern that Federal Rules which vary from State to State
would be chaos, see 312 U. S., at 13–14—is hard to square
with §2072(b)’s terms.11
Sibbach has been settled law, however, for nearly seven
decades.12 Setting aside any precedent requires a “special

11 The concurrence’s approach, however, is itself unfaithful to the
statute’s terms. Section 2072(b) bans abridgement or modification only
of “substantive rights,” but the concurrence would prohibit pre-emption
of “procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the scope of a
substantive right or remedy,” post, at 19. This would allow States to
force a wide array of parochial procedures on federal courts so long as
they are “sufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy.” Post,
at 13.
12 The concurrence implies that Sibbach has slipped into desuetude,
apparently for lack of sufficient citations. See post, at 13–14, n. 14. We
are unaware of any rule to the effect that a holding of ours expires if
the case setting it forth is not periodically revalidated. In any event,
the concurrence’s account of our shunning of Sibbach is greatly exag­
gerated. Hanna did not merely cite the case, but recognized it as
establishing the governing rule. 380 U. S., at 464–465, 470–471.
Mississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 445–446
(1946), likewise cited Sibbach and applied the same test, examining the
Federal Rule, not the state law it displaced. True, Burlington Northern
R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1 (1987), and for that matter Business
Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S.
533 (1991), did not cite Sibbach. But both cited and followed Hanna—
which as noted held out Sibbach as setting forth the governing rule.
See Burlington Northern, supra, at 5–6, 8; Business Guides, supra, at
552–554. Thus, while Sibbach itself may appear infrequently in the
U. S. Reports, its rule—and in particular its focus on the Federal Rule
as the proper unit of analysis—is alive and well.
In contrast, Hanna’s obscure obiter dictum that a court “need not
