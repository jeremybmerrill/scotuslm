GINSBURG, J., dissenting

necessary. Mindful of the history behind §901(b)’s enact
ment, the thrust of our precedent, and the substantive
rights limitation in the Rules Enabling Act, I conclude, as
did the Second Circuit and every District Court to have
considered the question in any detail,4 that Rule 23 does
not collide with §901(b). As the Second Circuit well un
derstood, Rule 23 prescribes the considerations relevant to
class certification and postcertification proceedings—but it
does not command that a particular remedy be available
when a party sues in a representative capacity. See 549
F. 3d 137, 143 (2008).5 Section 901(b), in contrast, trains
on that latter issue. Sensibly read, Rule 23 governs proce
dural aspects of class litigation, but allows state law to
control the size of a monetary award a class plaintiff may
pursue.

Sterling Securities, Inc., 282 Conn. 722, 738–739, 914 A. 2d 816, 827–
828 (2007) (section 901(b) applied in Connecticut state court to action
governed by New York substantive law).
5 Shady Grove projects that a dispensation in favor of Allstate would
require “courts in all diversity class actions . . . [to] look to state rules
and decisional law rather than to Rule 23 . . . in making their class
certification decisions.” Brief for Petitioner 55. This slippery-slope
projection is both familiar and false. Cf. R. Bork, The Tempting of
America 169 (1990) (“Judges and lawyers live on the slippery slope of
analogies; they are not supposed to ski it to the bottom.”). In this case,
CPLR §901(a) lists the state-law prerequisites for class certification,
but Allstate does not contend that §901(a) overrides Rule 23. Brief for
Respondent 18 (“There is no dispute that the criteria for class certifica
tion under state law do not apply in federal court; that is the ground
squarely occupied by Rule 23.”). Federal courts sitting in diversity have
routinely applied Rule 23’s certification standards, rather than compa
rable state provisions. See, e.g., In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian
Export Antitrust Litigation, 522 F. 3d 6, 18–24 (CA1 2008); Order and
Reasons in In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation, Civ.
Action No. 05–4182 (ED La., Aug. 6, 2009).
