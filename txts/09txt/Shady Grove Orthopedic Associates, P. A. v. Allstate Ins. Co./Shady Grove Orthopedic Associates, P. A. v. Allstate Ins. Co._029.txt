SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

has struck turns, in part, on the nature of the state law
that is being displaced by a federal rule. And in my view,
the application of that balance does not necessarily turn
on whether the state law at issue takes the form of what is
traditionally described as substantive or procedural.
Rather, it turns on whether the state law actually is part
of a State’s framework of substantive rights or remedies.
See §2072(b); cf. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471 (“The line be
tween ‘substance’ and ‘procedure’ shifts as the legal con
text changes”); Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99,
108 (1945) (noting that the words “ ‘substance’ ” and “ ‘pro
cedure’ ” “[e]ach impl[y] different variables depending
upon the particular problem for which [they] are used”).
Applying this balance, therefore, requires careful inter
pretation of the state and federal provisions at issue. “The
line between procedural and substantive law is hazy,”
Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 92 (1938) (Reed, J.,
concurring), and matters of procedure and matters of
substance are not “mutually exclusive categories with
easily ascertainable contents,” Sibbach, 312 U. S., at 17
(Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Rather, “[r]ules which law
yers call procedural do not always exhaust their effect by
regulating procedure,” Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan
Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 555 (1949), and in some situations,
“procedure and substance are so interwoven that rational
separation becomes well-nigh impossible,” id., at 559
(Rutledge, J., dissenting).
A “state procedural rule,
though undeniably ‘procedural’ in the ordinary sense of
the term,” may exist “to influence substantive outcomes,”
S. A. Healy Co. v. Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage Dist.,
60 F. 3d 305, 310 (CA7 1995) (Posner, J.), and may in
some instances become so bound up with the state-created
right or remedy that it defines the scope of that substan
tive right or remedy. Such laws, for example, may be
seemingly procedural rules that make it significantly more
difficult to bring or to prove a claim, thus serving to limit
