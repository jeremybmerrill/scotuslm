SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

The absence of an inevitable collision between Rule 23
and §901(b) becomes evident once it is comprehended that
a federal court sitting in diversity can accord due respect
to both state and federal prescriptions. Plaintiffs seeking
to vindicate claims for which the State has provided a
statutory penalty may pursue relief through a class action
if they forgo statutory damages and instead seek actual
damages or injunctive or declaratory relief; any putative
class member who objects can opt out and pursue actual
damages, if available, and the statutory penalty in an
individual action. See, e.g., Mendez v. The Radec Corp.,
260 F. R. D. 38, 55 (WDNY 2009); Brzychnalski v. Unesco,
Inc., 35 F. Supp. 2d 351, 353 (SDNY 1999).9 See also
Alexander, Practice Commentaries, at 105 (“Even if a
statutory penalty or minimum recovery is involved, most
courts hold that it can be waived, thus confining the class
recovery to actual damages and eliminating the bar of
CPLR 901(b).”). In this manner, the Second Circuit ex
——————
for purposes of tolling a state statute of limitations (although the Rule
indisputably controls when an action commences for federal procedural
purposes), so too we could read Rule 23 not to direct when a class action
may be maintained for purposes of recovering statutory damages
prescribed by state law. On this reading of Rule 23, no rewriting of
§901(b) is necessary to avoid a conflict.
9 The New York Legislature appears to have anticipated this result.
In discussing the remedial bar effected by §901(b), the bill’s sponsor
explained that a “statutory class action for actual damages would still
be permissible.” S. Fink, [Sponsor’s] Memorandum, Bill Jacket, L.
1975, Ch. 207. See also State Consumer Protection Board Memoran
dum (May 29, 1975), Bill Jacket, L. 1975, Ch. 207. On this understand
ing, New York courts routinely authorize class actions when the class
waives its right to receive statutory penalties. See, e.g., Cox v. Micro
soft Corp., 8 App. Div. 3d 39, 778 N. Y. S. 2d 147 (2004); Pesantez v.
Boyle Env. Servs., Inc., 251 App. Div. 2d 11, 673 N. Y. S. 2d 659 (1998);
Ridge Meadows Homeowners’ Assn., Inc. v. Tara Development Co., 242
App. Div. 2d 947, 665 N. Y. S. 2d 361 (1997); Super Glue Corp. v. Avis
Rent A Car System, Inc., 132 App. Div. 2d 604, 517 N. Y. S. 2d 764
(1987); Weinberg v. Hertz Corp., 116 App. Div. 2d 1, 499 N. Y. S. 2d 693
(1986).
