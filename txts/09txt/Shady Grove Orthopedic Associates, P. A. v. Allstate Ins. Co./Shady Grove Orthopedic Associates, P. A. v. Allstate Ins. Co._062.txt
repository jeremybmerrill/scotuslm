GINSBURG, J., dissenting

plained, “Rule 23’s procedural requirements for class
actions can be applied along with the substantive re
quirement of CPLR 901(b).” 549 F. 3d, at 144. In sum,
while phrased as responsive to the question whether
certain class actions may begin, §901(b) is unmistakably
aimed at controlling how those actions must end. On that
remedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.
Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves §901(b) in control of
the remedial issue at the core of this case should be dis
pelled by our Erie jurisprudence, including Hanna, which
counsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions
against stretching a rule to cover every situation it could
conceivably reach.10 The Court states that “[t]here is no
reason . . . to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether
claims made eligible for class treatment by some other law
should be certified as class actions.” Ante, at 5. To the
contrary, Palmer, Ragan, Cohen, Walker, Gasperini, and
Semtek provide good reason to look to the law that creates
the right to recover. See supra, at 4–7. That is plainly so
on a more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there
any reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief
when the State that created the remedy disallows its
pursuit on behalf of a class? None at all is the answer our
federal system should give.
Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain
penalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class
relief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for
certain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum
recovery. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(B) (Truth in
Lending Act) (“[I]n the case of a class action . . . no mini

10 The plurality notes that “we have rejected every statutory chal
lenge to a Federal Rule that has come before us.” Ante, at 13. But it
omits that we have interpreted Rules with due restraint, including Rule
23, thus diminishing prospects for the success of such challenges. See
Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S. 815, 842 (1999); Amchem Products,
Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 612–613 (1997); supra, at 4–8.
