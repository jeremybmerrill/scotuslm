Opinion of STEVENS, J.

Act “say, roughly, that federal courts are to apply state
‘substantive’ law and federal ‘procedural’ law,” the inquir
ies are not the same. Ibid.; see also id., at 469–470. The
Enabling Act does not invite federal courts to engage in
the “relatively unguided Erie choice,” id., at 471, but
instead instructs only that federal rules cannot “abridge,
enlarge or modify any substantive right,” §2072(b). The
Enabling Act’s limitation does not mean that federal rules
cannot displace state policy judgments; it means only that
federal rules cannot displace a State’s definition of its own
rights or remedies. See Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S.
1, 13–14 (1941) (reasoning that “the phrase ‘substantive
rights’ ” embraces only those state rights that are sought
to be enforced in the judicial proceedings).
Congress has thus struck a balance: “[H]ousekeeping
rules for federal courts” will generally apply in diversity
cases, notwithstanding that some federal rules “will inevi
tably differ” from state rules. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 473.
But not every federal “rul[e] of practice or procedure,”
§2072(a), will displace state law. To the contrary, federal
rules must be interpreted with some degree of “sensitivity
to important state interests and regulatory policies,”
Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415,
427, n. 7 (1996), and applied to diversity cases against the
background of Congress’ command that such rules not
alter substantive rights and with consideration of “the
degree to which the Rule makes the character and result
of the federal litigation stray from the course it would
follow in state courts,” Hanna, 380 U. S., at 473. This can
be a tricky balance to implement.3
It is important to observe that the balance Congress

Chemerinsky §5.3, at 321 (observing that courts “have struggled
to develop an approach that permits uniform procedural rules to be
applied in federal court while still allowing state substantive law to
govern”).
