Opinion of SCALIA, J.

than many others enjoyed by litigants in District
Courts sitting in the several states before the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure altered and abolished old
rights or privileges and created new ones in connec­
tion with the conduct of litigation. . . . If we were to
adopt the suggested criterion of the importance of the
alleged right we should invite endless litigation and
confusion worse confounded.

U. S., at 13–14 (footnotes omitted).
Hanna unmistakably expressed the same understanding
that compliance of a Federal Rule with the Enabling Act is
to be assessed by consulting the Rule itself, and not its
effects in individual applications:
“[T]he court has been instructed to apply the Federal
Rule, and can refuse to do so only if the Advisory
Committee, this Court, and Congress erred in their
prima facie judgment that the Rule in question trans­
gresses neither the terms of the Enabling Act nor con­
stitutional restrictions.” 380 U. S., at 471.
In sum, it is not the substantive or procedural nature or
purpose of the affected state law that matters, but the
substantive or procedural nature of the Federal Rule. We
have held since Sibbach, and reaffirmed repeatedly, that
the validity of a Federal Rule depends entirely upon
whether it regulates procedure. See Sibbach, supra, at 14;
Hanna, supra, at 464; Burlington, 480 U. S., at 8. If it
does, it is authorized by §2072 and is valid in all jurisdic­
tions, with respect to all claims, regardless of its incidental
effect upon state-created rights.

A few words in response to the concurrence. We under­
