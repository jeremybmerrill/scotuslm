GINSBURG, J., dissenting

therefore applied the Act “with an eye alert to . . . avoiding
disregard of State law.” Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326
U. S. 99, 110 (1945).
The second, the Rules Enabling Act, enacted in 1934,
authorizes us to “prescribe general rules of practice and
procedure” for the federal courts, but with a crucial re
striction: “Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify
any substantive right.” 28 U. S. C. §2072. Pursuant to
this statute, we have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. In interpreting the scope of the Rules, includ
ing, in particular, Rule 23, we have been mindful of the
limits on our authority. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Fibreboard
Corp., 527 U. S. 815, 845 (1999) (The Rules Enabling Act
counsels against “adventurous application” of Rule 23; any
tension with the Act “is best kept within tolerable limits.”);
Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 612–613
(1997). See also Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin
Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 503–504 (2001).
If a Federal Rule controls an issue and directly conflicts
with state law, the Rule, so long as it is consonant with
the Rules Enabling Act, applies in diversity suits. See
Hanna, 380 U. S., at 469–474. If, however, no Federal
Rule or statute governs the issue, the Rules of Decision
Act, as interpreted in Erie, controls. That Act directs
federal courts, in diversity cases, to apply state law when
failure to do so would invite forum-shopping and yield
markedly disparate litigation outcomes. See Gasperini,
518 U. S., at 428; Hanna, 380 U. S., at 468. Recognizing
that the Rules of Decision Act and the Rules Enabling Act
simultaneously frame and inform the Erie analysis, we
have endeavored in diversity suits to remain safely within
the bounds of both congressional directives.

In our prior decisions in point, many of them not men
