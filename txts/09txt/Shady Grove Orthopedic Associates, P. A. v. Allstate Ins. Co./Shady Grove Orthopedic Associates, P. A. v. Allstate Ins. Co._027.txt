v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

matter. See id., at 469–472. If no federal rule applies, a
federal court must follow the Rules of Decision Act, 28
U. S. C. §1652, and make the “relatively unguided Erie
choice,”2 Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471, to determine whether
the state law is the “rule of decision.” But when a situa
tion is covered by a federal rule, the Rules of Decision Act
inquiry by its own terms does not apply. See §1652;
Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471. Instead, the Rules Enabling Act
(Enabling Act) controls. See 28 U. S. C. §2072.
That does not mean, however, that the federal rule
always governs. Congress has provided for a system of
uniform federal rules, see ibid., under which federal courts
sitting in diversity operate as “an independent system for
administering justice to litigants who properly invoke its
jurisdiction,” Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,
Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), and not as state-court
clones that assume all aspects of state tribunals but are
managed by Article III judges. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at
473–474. But while Congress may have the constitutional
power to prescribe procedural rules that interfere with
state substantive law in any number of respects, that is
not what Congress has done. Instead, it has provided in
the Enabling Act that although “[t]he Supreme Court”
may “prescribe general rules of practice and procedure,”
§2072(a), those rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify
any substantive right,” §2072(b). Therefore, “[w]hen a
situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, . . . the
court has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule”
unless doing so would violate the Act or the Constitution.
Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471.

2 The Erie choice requires that the court consider “the twin aims of
the Erie rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of
inequitable administration of the laws.” Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S.
460, 468 (1965); see also Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427–428 (describing
Erie inquiry).
