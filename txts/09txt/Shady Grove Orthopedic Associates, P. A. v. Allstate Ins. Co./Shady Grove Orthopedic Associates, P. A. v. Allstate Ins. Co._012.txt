a controlled remedy,’ ” post, at 9 (quoting Memorandum on
Approving L. 1975, Ch. 207, reprinted in 1975 N. Y. Laws,
at 1748; emphasis deleted), and (4) a state court’s state­
ment that the final text of §901(b) “ ‘was the result of a
compromise among competing interests,’ ” post, at 9 (quot­
ing Sperry v. Crompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863
N. E. 2d 1012, 1015 (2007)).
This evidence of the New York Legislature’s purpose is
pretty sparse. But even accepting the dissent’s account of
the Legislature’s objective at face value, it cannot override
the statute’s clear text. Even if its aim is to restrict the
remedy a plaintiff can obtain, §901(b) achieves that end by
limiting a plaintiff’s power to maintain a class action. The
manner in which the law “could have been written,” post,
at 23, has no bearing; what matters is the law the Legisla­
ture did enact. We cannot rewrite that to reflect our
perception of legislative purpose, see Oncale v. Sundowner
Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80 (1998).6 The
dissent’s concern for state prerogatives is frustrated
rather than furthered by revising state laws when a po­

decision in Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740 (1980),
discussed by the dissent, post, at 5–6, 13–14, n. 8, is not to the contrary.
There we held that Rule 3 (which provides that a federal civil action is
“ ‘commenced’ ” by filing a complaint in federal court) did not displace a
state law providing that “ ‘[a]n action shall be deemed commenced,
within the meaning of this article [the statute of limitations], as to each
defendant, at the date of the summons which is served on him . . . .’ ”
446 U. S., at 743, n. 4 (quoting Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, §97 (1971); altera­
tion in original, emphasis added). Rule 3, we explained, “governs the
date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules
begin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations” or tolling
rules, which it did not “purpor[t] to displace.” 446 U. S., at 751, 750.
The texts were therefore not in conflict. While our opinion observed
that the State’s actual-service rule was (in the State’s judgment) an
“integral part of the several policies served by the statute of limita­
tions,” id., at 751, nothing in our decision suggested that a federal court
may resolve an obvious conflict between the texts of state and federal
rules by resorting to the state law’s ostensible objectives.
