Opinion of STEVENS, J.

ordinarily “prescribe general rules of practice and proce
dure,” §2072(a), do “not abridge, enlarge or modify any
substantive right,” §2072(b).
JUSTICE SCALIA believes that the sole Enabling Act
question is whether the federal rule “really regulates
procedure,” ante, at 12, 16, 17, 20, n. 13 (plurality opinion)
(internal quotation marks omitted), which means, appar
ently, whether it regulates “the manner and the means by
which the litigants’ rights are enforced,” ante, at 13 (inter
nal quotation marks omitted). I respectfully disagree.7
This interpretation of the Enabling Act is consonant with
the Act’s first limitation to “general rules of practice and
procedure,” §2072(a). But it ignores the second limitation
that such rules also “not abridge, enlarge or modify any
substantive right,” §2072(b) (emphasis added),8 and in so

7 This

understanding of the Enabling Act has been the subject of sub
stantial academic criticism, and rightfully so. See, e.g., Wright §4509,
at 264, 269–270, 272; Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv.
L. Rev. 693, 719 (1974) (hereinafter Ely); see also R. Fallon, J. Man
ning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler’s, The Federal
Courts and the Federal System 593, n. 6 (6th ed. 2009) (discussing Ely).
8 JUSTICE SCALIA concedes as much, see ante, at 18–19, but argues
that insofar as I allow for the possibility that a federal rule might
violate the Enabling Act when it displaces a seemingly procedural state
rule, my approach is itself “unfaithful to the statute’s terms,” which
cover “substantive rights” but not “procedural rules,” ante, at 19, n. 11
(internal quotation marks omitted). This is not an objection to my
interpretation of the Enabling Act—that courts must look to whether a
federal rule alters substantive rights in a given case—but simply to the
way I would apply it, allowing for the possibility that a state rule that
regulates something traditionally considered to be procedural might
actually define a substantive right. JUSTICE SCALIA’s objection, more
over, misses the key point: In some instances, a state rule that appears
procedural really is not. A rule about how damages are reviewed on
appeal may really be a damages cap. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.
A rule that a plaintiff can bring a claim for only three years may really
be a limit on the existence of the right to seek redress. A rule that a
claim must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt may really be a
definition of the scope of the claim. These are the sorts of rules that
