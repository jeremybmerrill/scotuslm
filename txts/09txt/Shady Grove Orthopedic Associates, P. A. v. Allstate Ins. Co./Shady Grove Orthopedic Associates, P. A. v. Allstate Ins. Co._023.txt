justification” beyond a bare belief that it was wrong.
Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172
(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). And a party
seeking to overturn a statutory precedent bears an even
greater burden, since Congress remains free to correct us,
ibid., and adhering to our precedent enables it do so, see,
e.g., Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545, 556 (1989); 28
U. S. C. §1367; Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services,
Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 558 (2005). We do Congress no service
by presenting it a moving target. In all events, Allstate
has not even asked us to overrule Sibbach, let alone car­
ried its burden of persuading us to do so. Cf. IBP, Inc. v.
Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32 (2005). Why we should cast
aside our decades-old decision escapes us, especially since
(as the concurrence explains) that would not affect the
result.13

wholly blind itself” to a Federal Rule’s effect on a case’s outcome, 380 

U. S., at 473—which the concurrence invokes twice, post, at 8, 13–14,
n. 14—has never resurfaced in our opinions in the 45 years since its
first unfortunate utterance. Nor does it cast doubt on Sibbach’s
straightforward test: As the concurrence notes, Hanna cited Sibbach for
that statement, 380 U. S., at 473, showing it saw no inconsistency
between the two.
13 The concurrence is correct, post, at 10, n. 9, that under our disposi­
tion any rule that “really regulates procedure,” Sibbach, supra, at 14,
will pre-empt a conflicting state rule, however “bound up” the latter is
with substantive law. The concurrence is wrong, however, that that
result proves our interpretation of §2072(b) implausible, post, at 10,
n. 9. The result is troubling only if one stretches the term “substantive
rights” in §2072(b) to mean not only state-law rights themselves, but
also any state-law procedures closely connected to them. Neither the
text nor our precedent supports that expansive interpretation. The
examples the concurrence offers—statutes of limitations, burdens of
proof, and standards for appellate review of damages awards—do not
make its broad definition of substantive rights more persuasive. They
merely illustrate that in rare cases it may be difficult to determine
whether a rule “really regulates” procedure or substance. If one con­
cludes the latter, there is no pre-emption of the state rule; the Federal
Rule itself is invalid.
