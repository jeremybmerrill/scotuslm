Opinion of SCALIA, J.
the Court

But while the dissent does indeed artificially narrow the
scope of §901(b) by finding that it pursues only substan­
tive policies, that is not the central difficulty of the dis­
sent’s position. The central difficulty is that even artificial
narrowing cannot render §901(b) compatible with Rule 23.
Whatever the policies they pursue, they flatly contradict
each other. Allstate asserts (and the dissent implies, see
post, at 3, 11) that we can (and must) interpret Rule 23 in
a manner that avoids overstepping its authorizing stat­
ute.7 If the Rule were susceptible of two meanings—one
that would violate §2072(b) and another that would not—
we would agree. See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S.
815, 842, 845 (1999); cf. Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed
Martin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 503–504 (2001). But it is not.
Rule 23 unambiguously authorizes any plaintiff, in any
federal civil proceeding, to maintain a class action if the
Rule’s prerequisites are met. We cannot contort its text,
even to avert a collision with state law that might render
——————
7 The

dissent also suggests that we should read the Federal Rules
“ ‘with sensitivity to important state interests’ ” and “ ‘to avoid conflict
with important state regulatory policies.’ ” Post, at 7 (quoting Gasperini
v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 427, n. 7, 438, n. 22
(1996)). The search for state interests and policies that are “important”
is just as standardless as the “important or substantial” criterion we
rejected in Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1941), to define
the state-created rights a Federal Rule may not abridge.
If all the dissent means is that we should read an ambiguous Federal
Rule to avoid “substantial variations [in outcomes] between state and
federal litigation,” Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S.
497, 504 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), we entirely agree.
We should do so not to avoid doubt as to the Rule’s validity—since a
Federal Rule that fails Erie’s forum-shopping test is not ipso facto
invalid, see Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 469–472 (1965)—but
because it is reasonable to assume that “Congress is just as concerned
as we have been to avoid significant differences between state and
federal courts in adjudicating claims,” Stewart Organization, Inc. v.
Ricoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22, 37–38 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The
assumption is irrelevant here, however, because there is only one
reasonable reading of Rule 23.
