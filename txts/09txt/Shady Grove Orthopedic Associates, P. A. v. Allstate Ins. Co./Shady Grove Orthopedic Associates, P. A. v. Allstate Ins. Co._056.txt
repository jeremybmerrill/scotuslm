. . . except when expressly authorized in the pertinent
statute.” Sperry v. Crompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211,
863 N. E. 2d 1012, 1015 (2007). These constituents
“feared that recoveries beyond actual damages could lead
to excessively harsh results.” Ibid. “They also argued that
there was no need to permit class actions . . . [because]
statutory penalties . . . provided an aggrieved party with a
