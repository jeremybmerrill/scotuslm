SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A. v. 

ALLSTATE INSURANCE CO. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 08–1008. Argued November 2, 2009—Decided March 31, 2010
After respondent Allstate refused to remit the interest due under New
York law on petitioner Shady Grove’s insurance claim, Shady Grove
filed this class action in diversity to recover interest Allstate owed it
and others. Despite the class action provisions set forth in Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the District Court held itself deprived of
jurisdiction by N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §901(b), which precludes a
class action to recover a “penalty” such as statutory interest. Affirm
ing, the Second Circuit acknowledged that a Federal Rule adopted in
compliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. §2072, would
control if it conflicted with §901(b), but held there was no conflict be
cause §901(b) and Rule 23 address different issues—eligibility of the
particular type of claim for class treatment and certifiability of a
given class, respectively. Finding no Federal Rule on point, the Court
of Appeals held that §901(b) must be applied by federal courts sitting
in diversity because it is “substantive” within the meaning of Erie R.
Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938).
Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
549 F. 3d 137, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
PARTS I and II–A, concluding that §901(b) does not preclude a federal
district court sitting in diversity from entertaining a class action un
der Rule 23. Pp. 3–12.
(a) If Rule 23 answers the question in dispute, it governs here
unless it exceeds its statutory authorization or Congress’s rulemak
ing power. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4–5.
Pp. 3–4.
