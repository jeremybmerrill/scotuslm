SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

sity, our precedents have set out a two-step framework for
federal courts to negotiate this thorny area. At both steps
of the inquiry, there is a critical question about what the
state law and the federal rule mean.
The court must first determine whether the scope of the
federal rule is “ ‘sufficiently broad’ ” to “ ‘control the issue’ ”
before the court, “thereby leaving no room for the opera
tion” of seemingly conflicting state law. See Burlington
Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1987); Walker
v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749–750, and n. 9
(1980). If the federal rule does not apply or can operate
alongside the state rule, then there is no “Ac[t] of Con
gress” governing that particular question, 28 U. S. C.
§1652, and the court must engage in the traditional Rules
of Decision Act inquiry under Erie and its progeny. In
some instances, the “plain meaning” of a federal rule will
not come into “ ‘direct collision’ ” with the state law, and
both can operate. Walker, 446 U. S., at 750, n. 9, 749. In
other instances, the rule “when fairly construed,” Burling
ton Northern R. Co., 480 U. S., at 4, with “sensitivity to
important state interests and regulatory policies,”
Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427, n. 7, will not collide with the
state law.5

thus agree with JUSTICE GINSBURG, post, at 3–7, that a federal
rule, like any federal law, must be interpreted in light of many different
considerations, including “sensitivity to important state interests,” post,
at 7, and “regulatory policies,” post, at 2. See Stewart Organization,
Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22, 37–38 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)
(“We should assume . . . when it is fair to do so, that Congress is just as
concerned as we have been to avoid significant differences between
state and federal courts in adjudicating claims. . . . Thus, in deciding
whether a federal . . . Rule of Procedure encompasses a particular issue,
a broad reading that would create significant disuniformity between
state and federal courts should be avoided if the text permits”). I
disagree with JUSTICE GINSBURG, however, about the degree to which
the meaning of federal rules may be contorted, absent congressional
authorization to do so, to accommodate state policy goals.
