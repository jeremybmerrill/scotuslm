SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
Opinion of SCALIA, J.
the Court

4–5 (1987). If it does, it governs—New York’s law not­
withstanding—unless it exceeds statutory authorization or
Congress’s rulemaking power. Id., at 5; see Hanna v.
Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 463–464 (1965). We do not wade
into Erie’s murky waters unless the federal rule is inappli­
cable or invalid. See 380 U. S., at 469–471.

The question in dispute is whether Shady Grove’s suit
may proceed as a class action. Rule 23 provides an an­
swer. It states that “[a] class action may be maintained” if
two conditions are met: The suit must satisfy the criteria
set forth in subdivision (a) (i.e., numerosity, commonality,
typicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also
must fit into one of the three categories described in sub­
division (b). Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b). By its terms this
creates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit
meets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class
action. (The Federal Rules regularly use “may” to confer
categorical permission, see, e.g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.
8(d)(2)–(3), 14(a)(1), 18(a)–(b), 20(a)(1)–(2), 27(a)(1),
30(a)(1), as do federal statutes that establish procedural
entitlements, see, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §626(c)(1); 42 U. S. C.
§2000e–5(f)(1).) Thus, Rule 23 provides a one-size-fits-all
formula for deciding the class-action question. Because
§901(b) attempts to answer the same question—i.e., it
states that Shady Grove’s suit “may not be maintained as
a class action” (emphasis added) because of the relief it
seeks—it cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is
ultra vires.
The Second Circuit believed that §901(b) and Rule 23 do
not conflict because they address different issues. Rule 23,
it said, concerns only the criteria for determining whether
a given class can and should be certified; section 901(b), on
the other hand, addresses an antecedent question:
whether the particular type of claim is eligible for class
