Opinion of STEVENS, J.

this is not such a case.
Rule 23 Controls Class Certification
When the District Court in the case before us was asked
to certify a class action, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23
squarely governed the determination whether the court
should do so. That is the explicit function of Rule 23. Rule
23, therefore, must apply unless its application would
abridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or remedies.
Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I under
stand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does not govern the
question of class certification in this matter because New
York has made a substantive judgment that such a class
should not be certified, as a means of proscribing damages.
Although, as discussed infra, at 17–20, I do not accept the
dissent’s view of §901(b), I also do not see how the dis
sent’s interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view.15 I
——————
15 Nor do I see how it follows from the dissent’s premises that a class
cannot be certified. The dissent contends that §901(b) is a damages
“limitation,” post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, or “proscription,” post, at 12,
n. 6, 21, whereas Rule 23 “does not command that a particular remedy
be available when a party sues in a representative capacity,” post, at
11, and that consequently both provisions can apply. Yet even if the
dissent’s premises were correct, Rule 23 would still control the question
whether petitioner may certify a class, and §901(b) would be relevant
only to determine whether petitioner, at the conclusion of a class-action
lawsuit, may collect statutory damages.
It may be that if the dissent’s interpretation of §901(b) were correct,
this class could not (or has not) alleged sufficient damages for the
federal court to have jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. §1332(d)(6). But that
issue was not raised in respondent’s motion to dismiss (from which the
case comes to this Court), and it was not squarely presented to the
Court. In any event, although the lead plaintiff has “acknowledged
that its individual claim” is for less than the required amount in
controversy, see 549 F. 3d 137, 140 (CA2 2008), we do not know what
actual damages the entire class can allege. Thus, even if the Court
were to adopt all of the dissent’s premises, I believe the correct disposi
tion would be to vacate and remand for further consideration of
whether the required amount in controversy has or can be met.
