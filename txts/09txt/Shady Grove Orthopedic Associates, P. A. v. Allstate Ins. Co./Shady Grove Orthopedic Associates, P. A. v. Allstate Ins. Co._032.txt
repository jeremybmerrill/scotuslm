Opinion of STEVENS, J.

If, on the other hand, the federal rule is “sufficiently
broad to control the issue before the Court,” such that
there is a “direct collision,” Walker, 446 U. S., at 749–750,
the court must decide whether application of the federal
rule “represents a valid exercise” of the “rulemaking au
thority . . . bestowed on this Court by the Rules Enabling
Act.” Burlington Northern R. Co., 480 U. S., at 5; see also
Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427, n. 7; Hanna, 380 U. S., at
471–474. That Act requires, inter alia, that federal rules
“not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.” 28
U. S. C. §2072(b) (emphasis added).
Unlike JUSTICE
SCALIA, I believe that an application of a federal rule that
effectively abridges, enlarges, or modifies a state-created
right or remedy violates this command. Congress may
have the constitutional power “to supplant state law” with
rules that are “rationally capable of classification as pro
cedure,” ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted),
but we should generally presume that it has not done so.
Cf. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8)
(observing that “we start with the assumption” that a
federal statute does not displace a State’s law “unless that
was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the mandate that
federal rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any
substantive right” evinces the opposite intent, as does
Congress’ decision to delegate the creation of rules to this
Court rather than to a political branch, see 19 C. Wright,
A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure
§4509, p. 265 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright).
Thus, the second step of the inquiry may well bleed back
into the first. When a federal rule appears to abridge,
enlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must
consider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to
avoid that impermissible result. See, e.g., Semtek Int’l Inc.
v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 503 (2001)
(avoiding an interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Proce
