Today’s judgment denies to the States the full power
Congress has to keep certain monetary awards within
reasonable bounds. Cf. Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___,
___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (“In light of . . . federalism and
comity concerns . . . it would seem particularly strange to
disregard state . . . rules that are substantially similar to
those to which we give full force in our own courts.”).
States may hesitate to create determinate statutory penal
ties in the future if they are impotent to prevent federal
court distortion of the remedy they have shaped.11
By finding a conflict without considering whether Rule
23 rationally should be read to avoid any collision, the
Court unwisely and unnecessarily retreats from the feder
alism principles undergirding Erie. Had the Court re

interpret Rule 23 so woodenly—and every reason not to do
so. Cf. Traynor, 37 Tex. L. Rev., at 669 (“It is bad enough

11 States have adopted a variety of formulations to limit the use of

at 4, likely prevents the enforcement of all of these statutes in diversity
actions—including the numerous state statutory provisions that, like
§901(b), attempt to curb the recovery of statutory damages. See, e.g.,
Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §2988.5(a)(2) (West 1993); Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§12–14.5–235(d) (2009); Conn. Gen. Stat. §36a–683(a) (2009); Haw.
Rev. Stat. §489–7.5(b)(1) (2008); Ind. Code §24–4.5–5–203(a)(2) (2004);
Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §367.983(1)(c) (West 2006); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.
167B, §20(a)(2)(B) (2008); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §493.112(3)(c) (West

Ann. §1351.08(A) (West 2004); Okla. Stat., Tit. 14A, §5–203(1) (2007
