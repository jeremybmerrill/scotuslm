there was no real conflict.”).

Because I perceive no unavoidable conflict between Rule
23 and §901(b), I would decide this case by inquiring
“whether application of the [state] rule would have so
important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the
litigants that failure to [apply] it would be likely to cause a
plaintiff to choose the federal court.” Hanna, 380 U. S., at
468, n. 9. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 428.
Seeking to pretermit that inquiry, Shady Grove urges
that the class-action bar in §901(b) must be regarded as
“procedural” because it is contained in the CPLR, which
“govern[s] the procedure in civil judicial proceedings in all
courts of the state.” Brief for Petitioner 34 (quoting CPLR
§101; emphasis in original). Placement in the CPLR is
hardly dispositive. The provision held “substantive” for
Erie purposes in Gasperini is also contained in the CPLR

scriptions plainly “substantive” for Erie purposes however
they may be characterized for other purposes, see York,
326 U. S., at 109–112. See also, e.g., 1 Restatement (Sec

(1969) (hereinafter Restatement) (“Under the rule of Erie
. . . the federal courts have classified the burden of persua
sion as to contributory negligence as a matter of substan
tive law that is governed by the rule of the State in which
they sit even though the courts of that State have charac
terized their rule as procedural for choice-of-law pur
poses.”); Cook, “Substance” and “Procedure” in the Conflict
of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333 (1933).
Shady Grove also ranks §901(b) as “procedural” because
“nothing in [the statute] suggests that it is limited to
rights of action based on New York state law, as opposed
to federal law or the law of other states”; instead it “ap
