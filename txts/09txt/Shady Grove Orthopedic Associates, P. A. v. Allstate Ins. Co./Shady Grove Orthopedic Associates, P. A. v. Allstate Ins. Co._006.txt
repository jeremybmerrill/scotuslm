Opinion of SCALIA, J.
the Court

interest on overdue benefits, Shady Grove sought relief on
behalf of itself and a class of all others to whom Allstate
owes interest. The District Court dismissed the suit for
lack of jurisdiction. 466 F. Supp. 2d 467 (2006). It rea­
soned that N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §901(b), which pre­
cludes a suit to recover a “penalty” from proceeding as a
class action, applies in diversity suits in federal court,
despite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Concluding
that statutory interest is a “penalty” under New York law,
it held that §901(b) prohibited the proposed class action.
And, since Shady Grove conceded that its individual claim
(worth roughly $500) fell far short of the amount-in­
controversy requirement for individual suits under 28
U. S. C. §1332(a), the suit did not belong in federal court.3
The Second Circuit affirmed. 549 F. 3d 137 (2008). The
court did not dispute that a federal rule adopted in com­
pliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. §2072,
would control if it conflicted with §901(b). But there was
no conflict because (as we will describe in more detail
below) the Second Circuit concluded that Rule 23 and
§901(b) address different issues. Finding no federal rule
on point, the Court of Appeals held that §901(b) is “sub­
stantive” within the meaning of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,
304 U. S. 64 (1938), and thus must be applied by federal
courts sitting in diversity.
We granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009).

The framework for our decision is familiar. We must
first determine whether Rule 23 answers the question in
dispute. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1,
——————
3 Shady Grove had asserted jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1332(d)(2),
which relaxes, for class actions seeking at least $5 million, the rule
against aggregating separate claims for calculation of the amount in
controversy. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545
U. S. 546, 571 (2005).
