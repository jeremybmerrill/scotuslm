GINSBURG, J., dissenting

fairest and most efficient way of conducting litigation.”).
Suppose, for example, that a State, wishing to cap dam
ages in class actions at $1,000,000, enacted a statute
providing that “a suit to recover more than $1,000,000
may not be maintained as a class action.” Under the
Court’s reasoning—which attributes dispositive signifi
cance to the words “may not be maintained”—Rule 23
would preempt this provision, nevermind that Congress,
by authorizing the promulgation of rules of procedure for
federal courts, surely did not intend to displace state
created ceilings on damages.7 The Court suggests that the
analysis might differ if the statute “limit[ed] the remedies
available in an existing class action,” ante, at 7, such that
Rule 23 might not conflict with a state statute prescribing
that “no more than $1,000,000 may be recovered in a class
action.” There is no real difference in the purpose and
intended effect of these two hypothetical statutes. The
notion that one directly impinges on Rule 23’s domain,
while the other does not, fundamentally misperceives the
office of Rule 23.8

7 There

is, of course, a difference between “justly administering [a]
remedy,” Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14 (1941), and prescrib
ing the content of that remedy; if Rule 23 can be read to increase a
plaintiff’s recovery from $1,000,000 to some greater amount, the Rule
has arguably “enlarge[d] . . . [a] substantive right” in violation of the
Rules Enabling Act. 28 U. S. C. §2072(b). The plurality appears to
acknowledge this point, stating that the Federal Rules we have found
to be in compliance with the Act have not “altered . . . available reme
dies.” Ante, at 13. But the Court’s relentless reading of Rule 23 today
does exactly that: The Federal Rule, it says, authorizes the recovery of
class-size statutory damages even though the New York provision
instructs that such penalties shall not be available.
8 The Court states that “[w]e cannot rewrite [a state law] to reflect
our perception of legislative purpose.” Ante, at 9. But we can, of
course, interpret the Federal Rules in light of a State’s regulatory policy
to decide whether and to what extent a Rule preempts state law. See
supra, at 3–7. Just as we read Federal Rule 3 in Walker v. Armco Steel
Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 751 (1980), not to govern when a suit commences
