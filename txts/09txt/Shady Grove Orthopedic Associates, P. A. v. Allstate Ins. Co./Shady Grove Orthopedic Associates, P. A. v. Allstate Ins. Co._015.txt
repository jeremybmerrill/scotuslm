Opinion of SCALIA, J.

it invalid. See Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740,
750, n. 9 (1980).8 What the dissent’s approach achieves is
not the avoiding of a “conflict between Rule 23 and
§901(b),” post, at 17, but rather the invalidation of Rule 23
(pursuant to §2072(b) of the Rules Enabling Act) to the
extent that it conflicts with the substantive policies of
§901. There is no other way to reach the dissent’s destina­
tion. We must therefore confront head-on whether Rule
23 falls within the statutory authorization.

Erie involved the constitutional power of federal courts
to supplant state law with judge-made rules. In that
context, it made no difference whether the rule was tech­
nically one of substance or procedure; the touchstone was
whether it “significantly affect[s] the result of a litigation.”
Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 109 (1945). That
is not the test for either the constitutionality or the statu­
tory validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Congress has
undoubted power to supplant state law, and undoubted
power to prescribe rules for the courts it has created, so
long as those rules regulate matters “rationally capable of
classification” as procedure. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 472. In
the Rules Enabling Act, Congress authorized this Court to
promulgate rules of procedure subject to its review, 28
U. S. C. §2072(a), but with the limitation that those rules
“shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive
right,” §2072(b).
We have long held that this limitation means that the
Rule must “really regulat[e] procedure,—the judicial

8 The cases chronicled by the dissent, see post, at 3–8, each involved a
Federal Rule that we concluded could fairly be read not to “control the
issue” addressed by the pertinent state law, thus avoiding a “direct
collision” between federal and state law, Walker, 446 U. S., at 749
(internal quotation marks omitted). But here, as in Hanna, supra, at
470, a collision is “unavoidable.”
