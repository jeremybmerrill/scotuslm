process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by
substantive law and for justly administering remedy and
redress for disregard or infraction of them,” Sibbach, 312
U. S., at 14; see Hanna, supra, at 464; Burlington, 480
U. S., at 8. The test is not whether the rule affects a
litigant’s substantive rights; most procedural rules do.
Mississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438,
445 (1946). What matters is what the rule itself regulates:
If it governs only “the manner and the means” by which
the litigants’ rights are “enforced,” it is valid; if it alters
“the rules of decision by which [the] court will adjudicate
[those] rights,” it is not. Id., at 446 (internal quotation
marks omitted).
Applying that test, we have rejected every statutory
challenge to a Federal Rule that has come before us. We
have found to be in compliance with §2072(b) rules pre­
scribing methods for serving process, see id., at 445–446
(Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(f)); Hanna, supra, at 463–465 (Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 4(d)(1)), and requiring litigants whose
mental or physical condition is in dispute to submit to
examinations, see Sibbach, supra, at 14–16 (Fed. Rule
Civ. Proc. 35); Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 113–
114 (1964) (same). Likewise, we have upheld rules au­
thorizing imposition of sanctions upon those who file
frivolous appeals, see Burlington, supra, at 8 (Fed. Rule
App. Proc. 38), or who sign court papers without a reason­
able inquiry into the facts asserted, see Business Guides,
Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498
U. S. 533, 551–554 (1991) (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11). Each
of these rules had some practical effect on the parties’
rights, but each undeniably regulated only the process for
enforcing those rights; none altered the rights themselves,
the available remedies, or the rules of decision by which
the court adjudicated either.
Applying that criterion, we think it obvious that rules
