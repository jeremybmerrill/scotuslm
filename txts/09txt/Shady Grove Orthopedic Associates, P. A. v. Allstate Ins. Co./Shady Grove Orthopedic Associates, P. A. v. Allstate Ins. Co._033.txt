SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

dure 41(b) that “would arguably violate the jurisdictional
limitation of the Rules Enabling Act” contained in
§2072(b)).6 And when such a “saving” construction is not
possible and the rule would violate the Enabling Act,
federal courts cannot apply the rule. See 28 U. S. C.
§2072(b) (mandating that federal rules “shall not” alter
“any substantive right” (emphasis added)); Hanna, 380
U. S., at 473 (“[A] court, in measuring a Federal Rule
against the standards contained in the Enabling Act . . .
need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the Rule
makes the character and result of the federal litigation

also Semtek Int’l Inc., 531 U. S., at 503–504 (noting that if
state law granted a particular right, “the federal court’s
extinguishment of that right. . . would seem to violate
[§2072(b)]”); cf. Statement of Justices Black and Douglas,
374 U. S. 865, 870 (1963) (observing that federal rules “as
applied in given situations might have to be declared
invalid”). A federal rule, therefore, cannot govern a par
ticular case in which the rule would displace a state law
that is procedural in the ordinary use of the term but is so
intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions
to define the scope of the state-created right. And absent
a governing federal rule, a federal court must engage in
the traditional Rules of Decision Act inquiry, under the
Erie line of cases. This application of the Enabling Act
shows “sensitivity to important state interests,” post, at 7,
and “regulatory policies,” post, at 2, but it does so as Con
gress authorized, by ensuring that federal rules that

(adopting “limiting construction” of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23
that, inter alia, “minimizes potential conflict with the Rules Enabling
Act”); Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 612–613 (1997)
(observing that federal rules “must be interpreted in keeping with the
Rules Enabling Act, which instructs that rules of procedure ‘shall not
abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right’ ”).
