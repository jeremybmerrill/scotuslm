SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.

judicial power between the state and federal systems.”
Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 474 (1965) (concurring
opinion). Although we have found Erie’s application
“sometimes [to be] a challenging endeavor,” Gasperini, 518
U. S., at 427, two federal statutes mark our way.
The first, the Rules of Decision Act,1 prohibits federal
courts from generating substantive law in diversity ac
tions. See Erie, 304 U. S., at 78. Originally enacted as
part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, this restraint serves a
policy of prime importance to our federal system. We have

1 The Rules of Decision Act directs that, “[t]he laws of the several
states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or

cases where they apply.” 28 U. S. C. §1652.
