Opinion of SCALIA, J.

right . . . not to be subjected to aggregated class-action
liability” in a single suit. Brief for Respondent 31. To
begin with, we doubt that that is so. Nothing in the text of
§901(b) (which is to be found in New York’s procedural
code) confines it to claims under New York law; and of
course New York has no power to alter substantive rights
and duties created by other sovereigns. As we have said,
the consequence of excluding certain class actions may be
to cap the damages a defendant can face in a single suit,
but the law itself alters only procedure. In that respect,
§901(b) is no different from a state law forbidding simple
joinder. As a fallback argument, Allstate argues that even
if §901(b) is a procedural provision, it was enacted “for
substantive reasons,” id., at 24 (emphasis added). Its end
was not to improve “the conduct of the litigation process
itself” but to alter “the outcome of that process.” Id., at 26.
The fundamental difficulty with both these arguments is
that the substantive nature of New York’s law, or its
substantive purpose, makes no difference. A Federal Rule
of Procedure is not valid in some jurisdictions and invalid
in others—or valid in some cases and invalid in others—
depending upon whether its effect is to frustrate a state
substantive law (or a state procedural law enacted for
substantive purposes). That could not be clearer in
Sibbach:
“The petitioner says the phrase [‘substantive rights’ in
the Rules Enabling Act] connotes more; that by its use
Congress intended that in regulating procedure this
Court should not deal with important and substantial
rights theretofore recognized. Recognized where and
by whom? The state courts are divided as to the
power in the absence of statute to order a physical ex­
amination. In a number such an order is authorized
by statute or rule. . . .
“The asserted right, moreover, is no more important
