SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A., 

PETITIONER v. ALLSTATE INSURANCE 

COMPANY

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[March 31, 2010] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY,
JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
The Court today approves Shady Grove’s attempt to
transform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award, although
the State creating the right to recover has proscribed this
alchemy. If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York state
court, the 2% interest payment authorized by New York
Ins. Law Ann. §5106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty for over
due benefits would, by Shady Grove’s own measure,
amount to no more than $500. By instead filing in federal
court based on the parties’ diverse citizenship and request
ing class certification, Shady Grove hopes to recover, for
the class, statutory damages of more than $5,000,000.
The New York Legislature has barred this remedy, in
structing that, unless specifically permitted, “an action to
recover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery cre
ated or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a
class action.” N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) §901(b)
(West 2006). The Court nevertheless holds that Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures
for the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts
the application of §901(b) in diversity suits.
The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New
York’s restriction on the availability of statutory damages.
