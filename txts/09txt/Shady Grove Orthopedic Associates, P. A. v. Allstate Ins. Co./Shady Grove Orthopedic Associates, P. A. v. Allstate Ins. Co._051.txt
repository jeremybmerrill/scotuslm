SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.
v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

interpretations of the Federal Rules that would trench on
state prerogatives without serving any countervailing
federal interest. “Application of the Hanna analysis,” we
have said, “is premised on a ‘direct collision’ between the
Federal Rule and the state law.” Walker v. Armco Steel
Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749–750 (1980) (quoting Hanna, 380
U. S., at 472). To displace state law, a Federal Rule,
“when fairly construed,” must be “ ‘sufficiently broad’ ” so
as “to ‘control the issue’ before the court, thereby leaving
no room for the operation of that law.” Burlington North
ern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1987) (quoting
Walker, 446 U. S., at 749–750, and n. 9; emphasis added);
cf. Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22,
37–38 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[I]n deciding
whether a federal . . . Rule of Procedure encompasses a
particular issue, a broad reading that would create signifi
cant disuniformity between state and federal courts
should be avoided if the text permits.”).
In pre-Hanna decisions, the Court vigilantly read the
Federal Rules to avoid conflict with state laws. In Palmer
v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 117 (1943), for example, the
Court read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative de
fenses, to control only the manner of pleading the listed
defenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in
such cases, Palmer held, state law controls.
Six years later, in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &
Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949), the Court ruled that
state law determines when a diversity suit commences for
purposes of tolling the state limitations period. Although
Federal Rule 3 specified that “[a] civil action is commenced
by filing a complaint with the court,” we held that the
Rule did not displace a state law that tied an action’s
commencement to service of the summons. Id., at 531–
533. The “cause of action [wa]s created by local law,” the
Court explained, therefore “the measure of it [wa]s to be
found only in local law.” Id., at 533.
