ALVAREZ v. SMITH
Syllabus
litigation of the issues and preserves the rights of the parties, while
prejudicing none by a preliminary decision.
United States v.
Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 40. Where mootness is the result of
settlement rather than happenstance, however, the losing party for
feits the equitable remedy of vacatur. U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v.
Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 25. This case more closely re
sembles mootness through happenstance than through settlement.
In Bancorp, the party seeking review caused the mootness by volun
tarily settling the issue contested throughout the litigation. Here,
the Court believes that the presence of the federal case played no
significant role in the termination of plaintiffs’ state-court forfeiture
proceedings. Plaintiffs’ forfeiture cases took place with no procedural
link to the case before this Court; apparently terminated on substan
tive grounds in their ordinary course; and, to the Court’s knowledge,
no one raised the procedural question at issue here in those cases.
This Court therefore concludes that it should follow its ordinary prac
tice and order vacatur. Pp. 6–9.

524 F. 3d 834, vacated and remanded.
BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,
C. J., and SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, GINSBURG, ALITO, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined, and in which STEVENS, J., joined as to Parts I and
II. STEVENS, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
