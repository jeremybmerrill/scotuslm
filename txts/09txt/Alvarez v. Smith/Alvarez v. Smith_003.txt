ANITA ALVAREZ, COOK COUNTY STATE’S 

ATTORNEY, PETITIONER v. CHERMANE 

SMITH ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[December 8, 2009] 


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether
Illinois law provides a sufficiently speedy opportunity for
an individual, whose car or cash police have seized with­
out a warrant, to contest the lawfulness of the seizure.
See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1; United States v. Von Neu
mann, 474 U. S. 242 (1986); United States v. $8,850, 461
U. S. 555 (1983). At the time of oral argument, however,
we learned that the underlying property disputes have all
ended. The State has returned all the cars that it seized,
and the individual property owners have either forfeited
any relevant cash or have accepted as final the State’s
return of some of it. We consequently find the case moot,
and we therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and remand the case to that court with instruc­
tions to dismiss. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340
U. S. 36, 39 (1950); see also E. Gressman, K. Geller, S.
Shapiro, T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Prac­
tice 941–942 (9th ed. 2007).
