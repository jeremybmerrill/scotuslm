Opinion of the Court

warrant. See Complaint ¶28, at 34a–35a (Waldo, seizure
on Jan. 20, 2006); id., ¶29, at 35a (Yunker, seizure on
Sept. 26, 2006); id., ¶30, at 35a (Williams, seizure in July
2006); Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification ¶8, at 39a.
The plaintiffs added that the police department still had
custody of their property. See Complaint ¶¶24–30, at
34a–35a. They claimed that the failure of the State to
provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal
Due Process Clause. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1. And
they asked the court (1) to certify the case as a class ac­
tion, (2) to declare that they had a due process right to a
prompt postseizure probable-cause hearing, (3) to declare
that the hearing must take place within 10 days of any
seizure, and (4) to enjoin the defendants’ current practice
of keeping the property in custody for a longer time with­
out a judicial determination of probable cause. See Com­
plaint ¶36, App. 36a.
The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the
ground that Seventh Circuit precedent made clear that
“the Constitution does not require any procedure prior to
the actual forfeiture proceeding.” Jones v. Takaki, 38
F. 3d 321, 324 (1994) (citing Von Neumann, supra, at 249).
On February 22, 2007, the District Court granted the
motion to dismiss. It also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for
class certification. The plaintiffs appealed.
On May 2, 2008, the Seventh Circuit decided the appeal
in the plaintiffs’ favor. Smith v. Chicago, 524 F. 3d 834.
It reconsidered and departed from its earlier precedent.
Id., at 836–839. It held that “the procedures set out in”
the Illinois statute “show insufficient concern for the due
process right of the plaintiffs.” Id., at 838. And it added
that, “given the length of time which can result between
the seizure of property and the opportunity for an owner
to contest the seizure under” Illinois law, “some sort of
mechanism to test the validity of the retention of the
property is required.” Ibid. The Court of Appeals re­
