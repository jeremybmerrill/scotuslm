Opinion of the Court

issued its opinion. And, after this Court granted certio­
rari, the Court of Appeals recalled its mandate, taking the
case away from the District Court before the District
Court could respond to the motion. Thus, we have before
us a complaint that seeks only declaratory and injunctive
relief, not damages.
The plaintiffs point out that they sought certification of
a class. And a class might well contain members who
continue to dispute ownership of seized property. But that
fact is beside the point. The District Court denied the
plaintiffs’ class certification motion. The plaintiffs did not
appeal that denial. Hence the only disputes relevant here
are those between these six plaintiffs and the State’s
Attorney; those disputes concerned cars and cash; and
those disputes are now over.

Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 404 (1980) (“A named
plaintiff whose claim expires may not continue to press

The parties, of course, continue to dispute the lawful­
ness of the State’s hearing procedures. But that dispute is
no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the
plaintiffs’ particular legal rights. Rather, it is an abstract
dispute about the law, unlikely to affect these plaintiffs
any more than it affects other Illinois citizens. And a
dispute solely about the meaning of a law, abstracted from
any concrete actual or threatened harm, falls outside the
scope of the constitutional words “Cases” and “Controver­
sies.” See, e.g., Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S.
472, 477 (1990); North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U. S. 244, 246
(1971) (per curiam); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300
U. S. 227, 241 (1937); Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653
(1895).
We can find no special circumstance here that might
warrant our continuing to hear the case. We have some­
times heard attacks on practices that no longer directly
