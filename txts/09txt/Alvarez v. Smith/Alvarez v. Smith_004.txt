ALVAREZ v. SMITH 

Opinion of the Court 


I

Illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal
property (including cars and cash) used “to facilitate” a
drug crime. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, §570/505(a)(6) (West
2008). It permits a police officer to seize that property
without a warrant where (1) the officer has “probable
cause to believe” the property was so used and (2) a “war­
rantless seizure . . . would be reasonable” in the circum­
stances. §570/505(b). When an officer has seized property
without a warrant, the relevant law enforcement agency
must notify the State’s Attorney within 52 days of the
seizure; the State’s Attorney must notify the property
owner of any impending forfeiture within a further 45
days; and, if the owner wishes to contest forfeiture, the
State’s Attorney must begin judicial forfeiture proceedings
within yet a further 45 days. See ch. 725, §§150/5–150/6.
Thus, the statute gives the State up to 142 days, nearly
five months, to begin judicial forfeiture proceedings—
during which time the statute permits the State to keep
the car or cash within its possession.
On November 22, 2006, six individuals (the respondents
or “plaintiffs”) brought this federal civil rights action
against defendants the city of Chicago, the Superintendent
of the Chicago Police Department, and the Cook County
State’s Attorney (the petitioner here, whom we shall call
the “State’s Attorney”). See Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C.
§1983. Three of the individuals, Chermane Smith, Ed­
manuel Perez, and Tyhesha Brunston, said that earlier in
2006 the police had, upon their arrests, seized their cars
without a warrant. See Complaint ¶25, App. 34a (Smith,
seizure on Jan. 19, 2006); id., ¶26, at 34a (Perez, seizure
on Mar. 8, 2006); id., ¶27, at 34a (Brunston, seizure on
Apr. 8, 2006); Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification ¶8,
at 39a. The other three plaintiffs, Michelle Waldo, Kirk
Yunker, and Tony Williams, said that earlier in 2006
police had, upon their arrests, seized their cash without a
