ALVAREZ v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

affect the attacking party, but are “capable of repetition”
while “evading review.”
See, e.g., Federal Election
Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 462
(2007); Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S.
498, 515 (1911). Yet here, unlike those cases, nothing
suggests that the individual plaintiffs will likely again
prove subject to the State’s seizure procedures. See Los
Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983) (“[T]he capable­
of-repetition doctrine applies only in exceptional situa­
tions, and generally only where the named plaintiff can
make a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected
to the alleged illegality”); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S.
312, 318–319 (1974) (per curiam). And in any event, since
those who are directly affected by the forfeiture practices
might bring damages actions, the practices do not “evade
review.” See Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft,
436 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1978) (damages claim saves case from
mootness). Consequently, the case is moot. See, e.g.,
Preiser, supra, at 403–404; Mills, supra, at 658.

It is less easy to say whether we should order the judg­
ment below vacated. The statute that enables us to vacate
a lower court judgment when a case becomes moot is
flexible, allowing a court to “direct the entry of such ap­
propriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such
further proceedings to be had as may be just under the
circumstances.” 28 U. S. C. §2106; see also U. S. Bancorp
Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 21
(1994). Applying this statute, we normally do vacate the
lower court judgment in a moot case because doing so
“clears the path for future relitigation of the issues be­
tween the parties,” preserving “the rights of all parties,”
while prejudicing none “by a decision which . . . was only
preliminary.” Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.
In Bancorp, however, we described circumstances where
