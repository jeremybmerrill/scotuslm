Opinion of the Court

No. 2006–COFO–000201 (Cook County, IL) (Waldo’s cash
returned on Mar. 19, 2007). The disparate dates at which
plaintiffs’ forfeiture proceedings terminated—11, 14, 27,
and 40 months after the seizures—indicate that the
State’s Attorney did not coordinate the resolution of plain­
tiffs’ state-court cases, either with each other or with
plaintiffs’ federal civil rights case. Cf. Munsingwear, 340
U. S., at 39–40 (stating that a lower court judgment would
have been vacated even though an action of the party
seeking review had brought about the mootness because
that action—a commodity being decontrolled by Executive
Order—was basically unrelated); see also Fleming v.
Munsingwear, Inc., 162 F. 2d 125, 127 (CA8 1947).
For these reasons, we believe that the presence of this
federal case played no significant role in the termination
of the separate state-court proceedings. This conclusion is
reinforced by the fact that neither party, although aware
of Bancorp, suggested the contrary at oral argument.
Indeed, both parties argued against mootness at oral
argument, a fact that further suggests that a desire to
avoid review in this case played no role at all in producing
the state case terminations. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–11, 33–38.
And if the presence of this federal case played no role in
causing the termination of those state cases, there is not
present here the kind of “voluntary forfeit[ure]” of a legal
remedy that led the Court in Bancorp to find that consid­
erations of “fairness” and “equity” tilted against vacatur.
We consequently conclude that we should follow our
ordinary practice, thereby “clear[ing] the path for future
relitigation of the issues.” Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.
Thus, nothing in this opinion prevents the plaintiffs from
bringing a claim for damages based on the conduct alleged
in their complaint. Id., at 37–40.
We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Ap­
peals and remand the case to that court with instructions
to dismiss.
It is so ordered.
