Opinion of STEVENS, J.

carry its burden to “demonstrate . . . equitable entitlement
to the extraordinary remedy of vacatur.” Bancorp, 513
U. S., at 26.
There was a third option for disposing of this case: We
could have dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvi
dently granted. Like denying the petition in the first
place, that disposition would have preserved the judgment
below. At the time we granted certiorari on February 23,
2009, petitioner had already resolved the underlying
property disputes for five of the six named respondents.
See ante, at 4, 8–9. It was entirely predictable that the
final settlement would soon follow. Moreover, the briefing
in this case has revealed a disagreement over basic de
scriptive questions of Illinois law, questions that were not
passed upon below. Compare Brief for Petitioner 60–66
with Brief for Respondents 41–44. And, of course, we have
no way of knowing how the District Court would have
applied the Court of Appeals’ remand order, which left it
great discretion to “fashion appropriate procedural relief”
“with the help of the parties.” Smith v. City of Chicago,
524 F. 3d 834, 838 (CA7 2008). It has become clear that
the Court was overhasty in deciding to review this case;
the improvidence of our grant provides an additional
reason why we should not vacate the work product of our
colleagues on the Court of Appeals.
I respectfully dissent from Part III of the Court’s opinion
and from its judgment.
