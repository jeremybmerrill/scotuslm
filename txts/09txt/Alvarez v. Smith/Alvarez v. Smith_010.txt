ALVAREZ v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

by voluntary action.” Id., at 24 (emphasis added). By
virtue of the settlement, that party had “voluntarily for­
feited his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal
or certiorari.” Id., at 25. Hence, compared to mootness
caused by “happenstance,” considerations of “equity” and
“fairness” tilted against vacatur. Id., at 25–26.
Applying these principles to the case before us, we
conclude that the terminations here fall on the “happen­
stance” side of the line. The six individual cases proceeded
through a different court system without any procedural
link to the federal case before us. To our knowledge (and
we have examined the state-court docket sheets), no one in
those cases raised the procedural question at issue here.
Rather, the issues in those six cases were issues solely of
state substantive law: Were the cars and the cash forfeit­
able or not? And court docket sheets suggest that the six
state cases terminated on substantive grounds in the
ordinary course of such state proceedings. In the three
automobile cases, the State voluntarily dismissed the
proceedings and returned the cars between 11 and 40
months after the seizures, a long enough time for the
State to have investigated the matters and to have deter­
mined (after the termination of any related criminal pro­
ceedings) for evidentiary reasons that it did not wish to
claim the cars. See Dockets in People v. 2004 Chevrolet
Impala, No. 2006–COFO–000296 (Cook County, IL)
(Brunston’s car returned on July 27, 2009); People v.
Smith, No. 2006–COFO–000036 (Cook County, IL)
(Smith’s car returned on May 5, 2008); and People v. 1999
Chevrolet Malibu, No. 2006–COFO–000288 (Cook County,
IL) (Perez’s car returned on Jan. 29, 2007). In the remain­
ing contested case, involving cash, the State voluntarily
dismissed the proceedings after 14 months, again a long
enough time for the State to have weighed the evidence
and found a compromise settlement appropriate on the
merits. See Docket in People v. $1,500 in U. S. Currency,
