ALVAREZ v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

versed the judgment of the District Court and remanded
the case for further proceedings. Id., at 839. Its mandate
issued about seven weeks thereafter.
On February 23, 2009, we granted certiorari to review
the Seventh Circuit’s “due process” determination. The
Court of Appeals then recalled its mandate. The parties
filed briefs in this Court. We then recognized that
the case might be moot, and we asked the parties to ad­
dress the question of mootness at the forthcoming oral
argument.
At oral argument counsel for both sides confirmed that
there was no longer any dispute about ownership or pos­
session of the relevant property. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5
(State’s Attorney); id., at 56–57 (plaintiffs). The State had
returned the cars to plaintiffs Smith, Perez, and Brunston.
See id., at 5. Two of the plaintiffs had “defaulted,” appar­
ently conceding that the State could keep the cash. Ibid.
And the final plaintiff and the State’s Attorney agreed
that the plaintiff could keep some, but not all, of the cash
at issue. Id., at 5, 56–57. As counsel for the State’s Attor­
ney told us, “[T]hose cases are over.” Id., at 5.

The Constitution permits this Court to decide legal
questions only in the context of actual “Cases” or “Contro­
versies.” U. S. Const., Art. III, §2. An “ ‘actual controversy
must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the
time the complaint is filed.’ ” Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S.
395, 401 (1975) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S.
452, 459, n. 10 (1974)). In this case there is no longer any
actual controversy between the parties about ownership or
possession of the underlying property.
The State’s Attorney argues that there is a continuing
controversy over damages. We concede that the plaintiffs
filed a motion in the District Court seeking damages. But
the plaintiffs filed their motion after the Seventh Circuit
