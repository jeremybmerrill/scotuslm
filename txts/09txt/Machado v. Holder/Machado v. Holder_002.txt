MACHADO v. HOLDER
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

poor performance deprived them of their constitutional
right to the effective assistance of counsel. But they did
not explicitly assert a right to effective assistance based on
any source of law other than the Constitution. In their
petition for certiorari, moreover, petitioners disclaimed
any nonconstitutional basis for relief when they argued
that, by denying the existence of a constitutional right to
the effective assistance of counsel, the Fourth Circuit’s
decision “allow[s] no recourse for a particular alien against
dishonest or corrupt immigration practitioners.” Pet. for
Cert. 11 (emphasis added). This sentence would make no
sense if petitioners were advancing both constitutional
and nonconstitutional grounds for relief on their claim.
Instead of granting, vacating, and remanding, I would
deny the petition for certiorari.
