SCALIA, J., dissenting

By the way, even if the Court of Appeals had carelessly
described application of the pre-AEDPA version of
§2254(d) in the manner which the Court suggests, that
would have been no worse than what we have done. For
example, in Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U. S. 731, 735
(1990) (per curiam), we stated that a federal court may not
overturn a state habeas court’s factual determinations
“unless it concludes that they are not ‘fairly supported by
the record.’ See 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8).” And in Parker v.
Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991), we explained that a
federal habeas court “is not to overturn a factual conclu

“suggestion” here (let alone an actual argument) that paragraphs (2),
(6), or (7) were in issue. And if the Court means no more than that
petitioner here made some process-type noises, the same was true—and
indeed more true—of Parker and Demosthenes. In Parker, we stated
the “crux of [petitioner’s] contentions” was that the state courts “fail[ed]
to treat adequately” the evidence he presented. 498 U. S., at 313. In
Demosthenes, the Ninth Circuit had said that the state court’s process
for determining whether the capital inmate was competent was defi
cient because “ ‘a full evidentiary hearing on competence should have
been held.’ ” 495 U. S., at 736 (quoting Order in Baal v. Godinez, No.
90–15716 (CA9, June 2, 1990), p. 5).
