SCALIA, J., dissenting

was not objectively unreasonable under Strickland. Jef
ferson v. Hall, 570 F. 3d 1283, 1301–1309 (CA11 2009).
That court correctly stated the applicable framework
under §2254(d):
“Pre-AEDPA, questions of law and mixed questions
of law and fact resolved by state habeas courts are re
viewed de novo, while the state courts’ factual findings
are ‘subject to the presumption of correctness.’
Freund v. Butterworth, 165 F. 3d 839, 861 (11th Cir.
1999). Although these findings may be disregarded if,
for example, they are not ‘fairly supported by the re
cord,’ Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (11th
Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8)), this Court
has construed the ‘presumption of correctness’ stan
dard to be the same as the ‘clear error’ standard of
review.” Id., at 1300 (emphasis added; footnote

Confronted with no argument that §2254(d)(1)–(7) applied
or that it must disregard the state courts’ factual findings,
the Court of Appeals understandably did not pass upon
those questions.
The Court of Appeals did consider the record on its own,
as required by §2254(d)(8), to determine whether the state
courts’ factual determinations were fairly supported by the
record. Id., at 1303–1304, and n. 8. In doing so, the court
“specifically note[d] that neither Jefferson nor the district
court questioned the state court’s factual finding that [the
defense’s psychiatric expert] led [one of Jefferson’s attor
ney’s] to believe that further investigation would simply
be a waste of time, . . . despite [his attorney’s] testimony
that [the expert] told him it ‘may’ be a waste of time.” Id.,
at 1303, n. 8. It added that Jefferson did not “point to any
particular finding that was clearly erroneous,” id., at 1304,
n. 8—applying the same standard Jefferson had proposed
in his brief, see supra, at 3. Even the dissent agreed that
