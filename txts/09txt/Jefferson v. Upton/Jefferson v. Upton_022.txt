SCALIA, J., dissenting

might alter the judgment below, we cannot grant a peti
tion for certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand
the case (GVR) simply to obtain a re-do. Webster v.
Cooper, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)
(slip op., at 3). Yet today the Court vacates the judgment
of the Eleventh Circuit on the basis of an error that court
did not commit, with respect to a statutory issue that had
never previously been raised, and remands for more ex
tensive consideration of a new argument that might affect
the judgment. Under the taxonomy of our increasingly
unprincipled GVR practice, this creature is of the same
genus as the “Summary Remand for a More Extensive
Opinion than Petitioner Requested” (SRMEOPR). Id., at
___ (slip op., at 4). But it is a distinctly odious species,
deserving of its own name: Summary Remand to Ponder a
Point Raised Neither Here nor Below (SRPPRNHB).
