JEFFERSON v. UPTON
SCALIA, J., dissenting

court findings (but for the §2254(d) presumption), see id.,
at 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13.
“The premise of our adversarial system is that appellate
courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry
and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions
presented and argued by the parties before them.” Car
ducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983) (opinion
of Scalia, J.). Our refusal to abide by standard rules of
appellate practice is unfair to the Eleventh Circuit, whose
judgment the Court vacates, and especially to the respon
dent here, who suffers a loss in this Court without ever
having an opportunity to address the merits of the statu
tory question the Court decides.

The Court’s approach would be objectionable even if it
were correct that the Court of Appeals went astray. But
it is not. The Court of Appeals did not treat §2254(d)(8)
as “the exclusive statutory exception” to the presumption
of correctness. Ante, at 10. It is true that the major
ity’s opinion—as well as the dissent’s—discussed only
§2254(d)(8). But that is because only §2254(d)(8), and
not §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), was ever brought to the
court’s attention. On the fair reading we owe the Elev
enth Circuit’s opinion, there simply was no error in its
application of §2254(d).
The Court asserts, however, that the Eleventh Circuit
ignored the other seven paragraphs in §2254(d) when it
“invoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8)
of §2254(d).” Ante, at 9. It did nothing of the sort. The
Court of Appeals said that a state court’s factual findings
“may be disregarded if, for example, they are not ‘fairly
supported by the record,’ Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d
1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C.
§2254(d)(8)).” 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (emphasis added). The
Court of Appeals thus expressly acknowledged that
