JEFFERSON v. UPTON
SCALIA, J., dissenting

state courts’ “[f]indings of fact and credibility determina
tions are reviewed for clear error.” Brief for Peti
tioner/Appellee, No. 07–12502, pp. 16–17 (hereinafter
Appeals Brief). It declared that “The District Court Cor
rectly Deferred to the Fact Findings of the State Court” in
adjudicating his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.
Id., at 21 (capitalization and boldface type deleted); see
also id., at 29, and n. 7, 31. And it conceded that with
respect to the ineffective-assistance claim, “[t]he relevant
facts are not in dispute.” Id., at 24. Jefferson did charac
terize the state habeas court’s factual findings as gener
ally “dubious” and suggested there were “serious doubts”
about them, id., at 32, n. 10. But not once did he argue
that the dubiousness of the findings was the consequence
of a failure to meet the requirements of §2254(d)(2), (6), or
(7)—or even more generally that the findings should not
be presumed correct under §2254(d). Instead, he pressed
the same argument he made in the District Court: Even if
the state courts’ factual findings were correct, his trial
attorneys rendered ineffective assistance in deciding to
forgo further investigation of his childhood head injury.
Id., at 31–33, 50–51.
Nor did the courts below pass upon the argument the
Court now addresses. The District Court did not dispute
the state courts’ factual findings. Jefferson v. Terry, 490
F. Supp. 2d 1261, 1319–1320 (ND Ga. 2007). It accepted
those findings as true, including the state habeas court’s
credibility findings, id., at 1323–1324, and n. 17, but held
“as a matter of law” that it was objectively unreasonable
for Jefferson’s attorneys “not to investigate” further into
the effect, if any, of the accident on Jefferson’s mental
capacity and health, id., at 1324. Concluding that Jeffer
son was thereby prejudiced, the court ordered a new sen
tencing hearing. Id., at 1328.
The Court of Appeals disagreed with that determination
and reversed, holding that his trial attorneys’ performance
