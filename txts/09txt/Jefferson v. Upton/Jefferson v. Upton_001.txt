SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
LAWRENCE JOSEPH JEFFERSON v. STEPHEN 

UPTON, WARDEN 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES
COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 09–8852. Decided May 24, 2010

PER CURIAM.
Petitioner Lawrence Jefferson, who has been sentenced
to death, claimed in both state and federal courts that his
lawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they
failed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suf
fered as a child. The state court rejected that claim after
making a finding that the attorneys were advised by an
expert that such investigation was unnecessary. Under
the governing federal statute, that factual finding is pre
sumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies.
See 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(8) (1994 ed.). But the Court
of Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifi
cally §2254(d)(8)). And on that basis, it considered itself
“duty-bound” to accept the state court’s finding, and re
jected Jefferson’s claim. Because the Court of Appeals did
not fully consider several remaining potentially applicable
exceptions, we vacate its judgment and remand.

When Jefferson was a child, he “suffered a serious in
jury to his head.” Jefferson v. Terry, 490 F. Supp. 2d 1261,
1326 (ND Ga. 2007); see id., at 1320 (quoting Jefferson’s
mother’s testimony that “a car ran over the top of his
head” when he was two years old). The accident left his
skull swollen and misshapen and his forehead visibly
scarred. Jefferson v. Hall, 570 F. 3d 1283, 1311, 1315, n. 4
(CA11 2009) (Carnes, J., dissenting). During the District
Court proceedings below, uncontroverted experts testified
