JEFFERSON v. UPTON
Per Curiam

12502 (CA11), pp. 31–32, n. 10 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).
A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and Jeffer
son filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And, in so doing,
he challenges—as he did in the State Supreme Court, the
District Court, and the Court of Appeals—“the fact find
ings of the state court,” given what he describes as the
deficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing
his claim. Pet. for Cert. 11–13, 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13 (re
counting “ ‘reason[s] to doubt’ ” the state court’s findings).
Cf. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation,
513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995) (stating standard for preserving
an issue for review in this Court).
III
This habeas application was filed prior to the enactment
of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996 and is therefore governed by federal habeas law as it
existed prior to that point. Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S.
320, 326–336 (1997). In 1963, we set forth the “appropri
ate standard” to be applied by a “federal court in habeas
corpus” when “the facts” pertinent to a habeas application
“are in dispute.” Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312.
We held that when “the habeas applicant was afforded a
full and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable
findings” the district court “ordinarily should . . . accept
the facts as found” by the state-court judge. Id., at 318.
However, “if the habeas applicant did not receive a full
and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the
time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding,” we held that
the federal court “must hold an evidentiary hearing” to
resolve any facts that “are in dispute.” Id., at 312. We
further “explain[ed] the controlling criteria” by enumerat
ing six circumstances in which such an evidentiary hear
ing would be required:
“(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved
