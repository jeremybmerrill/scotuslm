U. S. 564, 572 (1985)).

Jefferson next sought federal habeas relief in the Dis
trict Court. In his opening brief, he argued that “there is
no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give
any deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus
Court.” Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:96–CV–989–CC (ND
Ga.), Doc. 105, p. 4, and n. 1 (hereinafter District Court
Brief). In support of that argument, he claimed that the
state court “merely signed an order drafted by the State
without revision of a single word,” even though the order
“described witnesses who never testified.” Ibid. And he
said that such a process “rais[es] serious doubts as to
whether [the judge] even read, much less carefully consid

The District Court ruled in Jefferson’s favor. It noted
that under the relevant statute “factual findings of state
courts are presumed to be correct unless one of . . . eight
enumerated exceptions . . . applies.” 490 F. Supp. 2d, at
1280; see also id., at 1280, n. 5 (listing the exceptions).
And it acknowledged “the state habeas corpus court’s
failure to explain the basis” for its credibility findings. Id.,
at 1324, n. 17. But it accepted Jefferson’s claim of ineffec
tive assistance of counsel without disturbing the state
court’s factual findings because it believed he should
prevail even accepting those findings as true. Id., at
1324–1325.
On appeal, Jefferson defended the District Court’s judg
ment primarily on its own terms. But he also argued that
the state court’s factfinding was “dubious at best” in light
of the process that court employed, and that the Court of
Appeals therefore “should harbor serious doubts about the
findings of fact and credibility determinations in the state
court record.” Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 07–
