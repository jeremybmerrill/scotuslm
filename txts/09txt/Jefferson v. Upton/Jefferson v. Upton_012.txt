No. 09–8852. Decided May 24, 2010

JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.
The question presented by Jefferson’s petition for writ of
certiorari is whether his trial attorneys rendered ineffec

Court conjures up an “error” with respect to that ground
by misquoting and mischaracterizing the Court of Appeals’
