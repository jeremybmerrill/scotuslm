SCALIA, J., dissenting

This is a straightforward request for error correction on a
constitutional claim in light of those four decisions, and
neither the request nor those cases have anything to do
with the pre-AEDPA version of §2254(d). Nor does that
question necessarily encompass whether the Court of
Appeals misapplied that version of §2254(d) in determin
ing the deference due to the state courts’ factual findings.
The statutory question may be “related to,” and “perhaps
complementary to the one petitioner presented,” but it is
not “fairly included therein.” Yee, supra, at 537 (internal
quotation marks omitted).
As for the body of Jefferson’s petition: Far from invoking
§2254(d)’s exceptions to the presumption of correctness to
support the Sixth Amendment claim, the petition does not
even mention subsection (d), let alone paragraphs (2), (6),
or (7). There is no argument, anywhere in the section
entitled “Reasons for Granting the Writ,” that the state
courts’ factual findings are not entitled to a presumption
of correctness.
The Court claims, ante, at 6, that Jefferson sufficiently
presented the statutory issue by his characterizations of
the state courts’ factual findings in the “Statement of the
Case” section of his petition, see Pet. for Cert. 11–13, 17,
n. 12, 18, n. 13. Even if that were so, “ ‘the fact that [peti
tioner] discussed this issue in the text of [his] petition for
certiorari does not bring it before us. Rule 14.1(a) requires
that a subsidiary question be fairly included in the ques
tion presented for our review.’ ” Wood v. Allen, 558 U. S.
___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Izumi Seimitsu
Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S.
27, 31, n. 5 (1993) (per curiam)). But in any event, the
cited passages do not remotely present the statutory issue.
They contain no argument that §2254(d)’s presumption is
inapplicable because of §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but merely
describe the proceedings below, see Pet. for Cert. 11–13,
and assert that there might be reasons to doubt the state
