Per Curiam

any of the exceptions enumerated in §§2254(d)(1)–(8)
apply in this case, see, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S.
709, 718, n. 7 (2005), especially given that the facts sur
rounding the state habeas court’s process are undeveloped.
Respondent has conceded that it drafted the state court’s
final order at that court’s request and that the order was
adopted verbatim, 263 Ga., at 317, 431 S. E. 2d, at 111,
and has not disputed in this Court that the state court
solicited the order “ex parte and without prior notice” and
“did not seek a proposed order from Petitioner,” Pet. for
Cert. 12, and n. 8. But the precise nature of what tran
spired during the state-court proceedings is not fully
known. See 263 Ga. at 316–317, 431 S. E. 2d, at 111
(noting dispute as to whether Jefferson “had a chance to
respond” to the final order); see also Pet. for Cert. 13.
Accordingly, we believe it necessary for the lower courts
to determine on remand whether the state court’s factual
findings warrant a presumption of correctness, and to
conduct any further proceedings as may be appropriate in
light of their resolution of that issue. See Townsend,
supra, at 313–319; Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1
(1992). In so holding, we express no opinion as to whether
Jefferson’s Sixth Amendment rights were violated assum
ing the state court’s factual findings to be true.

The petition for a writ of certiorari and motion to pro
ceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
