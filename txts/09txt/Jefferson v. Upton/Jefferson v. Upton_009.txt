send, supra, at 312. Or, to use the statutory language,
they are arguments that the state court’s “factfinding
procedure,” “hearing,” and “proceeding” were not “full,
fair, and adequate.” §§2254(d)(2), (6), (7).
But the Court of Appeals did not consider the state
court’s process when it applied the statutory presumption
of correctness. Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that
applied only paragraph (8) of §2254(d), which, codifying
the second Townsend exception, 372 U. S., at 313, lifts the
presumption of correctness for findings that are “not fairly
supported by the record.” See 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (quoting
Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (CA11 1995), in
turn quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8)). And even though
the Court of Appeals “recognize[d]” that Jefferson had
argued that the state court’s process had produced factual
findings that were “ ‘dubious at best,’ ” and that federal
courts should therefore “ ‘harbor serious doubts about’ ” the
state court’s “ ‘findings of fact and credibility,’ ” the Court
of Appeals nonetheless held that the state court’s findings
are “ ‘entitled to a presumption of correctness’ ” that it was
“duty-bound” to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (quoting
Appeals Brief 32, n. 10). The Court of Appeals explicitly
stated that it considered itself “duty-bound” to defer to the
state court’s findings because “Jefferson has not argued
that any of the state courts’ factual findings were ‘not
fairly supported by the record,’ ” a direct reference to
§2254(d)(8) and to the second Townsend exception. 570
F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (emphasis added). And it then con
cluded: “Based on these factual findings of the state ha
beas courts—all of which are fairly supported by the re
cord—we believe that Jefferson’s counsel were reasonable
in deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.” Id.,
at 1304 (emphasis added).
In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly con
sider the legal status of the state court’s factual findings.
Under Townsend, as codified by the governing statute, a
