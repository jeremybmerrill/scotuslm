SCALIA, J., dissenting

of Law, Record in No. 1:96–CV–989–CC (ND Ga.), Doc.
105 (hereinafter District Court Brief). The sentence is: “In
entering the State Habeas Corpus Order Judge Newton
merely signed an order drafted by the State without revi
sion of a single word.” Id., at 4. The footnote adds:
“[T]he order signed by Judge Newton described wit
nesses who never testified, raising serious doubt as to
whether he even read, much less carefully considered,
the proposed order submitted by the State. In this
circumstance, there is no reason under principles of
comity or otherwise to give any deference to the find
ings of the State Habeas Court, because there was ap
parently no serious consideration or deliberation of
the factual and legal issues raised.” Ibid., n. 1.
This passing suggestion that deference would be unwar

the state fact-finding procedure was inadequate,
§2254(d)(2), that Jefferson was denied a full, fair, and
adequate hearing, §2254(d)(6), or that Jefferson was de
nied due process of law, §2254(d)(7). And it only appeared,
I emphasize again, in the “Prior Proceedings” section of
the brief. The argument section of Jefferson’s District
Court Brief, consisting of 164 pages and containing sepa
rate assignments of error from III to XLIV (44), makes no
mention of the ground upon which the Court today relies.
And the assignment of error that is the basis for the ques
tion presented in Jefferson’s petition, VI, id., at 47–80, did
not dispute the state courts’ factual findings under
§2254(d), but only challenged the state courts’ legal con
clusion that his attorneys’ failure to conduct a fuller inves
tigation into the head injury he suffered as a child was not
deficient performance under Strickland v. Washington,
466 U. S. 668 (1984).
Jefferson also did not raise the point in the Eleventh
Circuit. His brief to that court acknowledged that the
