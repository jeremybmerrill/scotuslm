JEFFERSON v. UPTON
SCALIA, J., dissenting

misapplied that provision and our precedents by treating
one of those exceptions, §2254(d)(8), “as the exclusive
statutory exception” to the presumption of correctness,
and by failing to address whether §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7)
might also bar application of that presumption.1 Ante, at
10.
The Court’s opinion, however, is the first anyone (in
cluding Jefferson) has heard of this argument. Jefferson’s
briefs below contain no discussion or even citation of sub
section (d)—let alone of paragraphs (2), (6), or (7)—and the
courts below understandably never passed upon the appli
cation of those provisions. Under our longstanding prac
tice, that should be the end of the matter. See, e.g., Penn
sylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212–
213 (1998).
But the Court insists, ante, at 5–6, 8–9, that if we squint
at them long enough we can see in Jefferson’s briefs below
a challenge to the state court’s fact-finding process cogni
zable under §2254(d)(2), (6), and (7). But the handful of
isolated, vague statements it musters (buried in hundreds
of pages of briefs) show no such thing. The Court’s only
evidence that Jefferson presented the point to the District
Court, ante, at 5, 8, consists of a single sentence of text
(and an accompanying two-sentence footnote) in the “Prior
Proceedings” section of his 180-page brief. Final Eviden
tiary Brief and Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions

four exceptions in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) (1994 ed.) were:
“(2) that the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was
not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing;
.
.
.
.
.
“(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate
hearing in the State court proceeding; or
“(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due process of law in the
State court proceeding;
“(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a consideration of [the rele
vant] part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determi
nation is not fairly supported by the record . . . .”
