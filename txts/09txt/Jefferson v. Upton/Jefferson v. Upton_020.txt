SCALIA, J., dissenting

§2254(d)(8) was but one example of the grounds for disre
garding a state court’s factual findings. And the Circuit
precedent it cited, Jackson v. Herring, similarly did not
imply, much less hold, that §2254(d)(8) provided the only
grounds for setting aside a state court’s factual findings
under §2254(d). See 42 F. 3d, at 1366.
Next, the Court states:
“And even though the Court of Appeals ‘recognize[d]’
that Jefferson had argued that the state court’s proc
ess had produced factual findings that were ‘ “dubious
at best,” ’ and that federal courts should therefore
‘ “harbor serious doubts about” ’ the state court’s
‘ “findings of fact and credibility,” ’ the Court of Ap
peals nonetheless held that the state court’s findings
are ‘ “entitled to a presumption of correctness” ’ that it
was ‘ “duty-bound” ’ to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8
(quoting Appeals Brief 32, n. 10).” Ante, at 9.
Again, the Court has plucked isolated language from here
and there in the Court of Appeals’ opinion, to produce a
reading which suggests that the Court of Appeals agreed
with, or at least did not contest, Jefferson’s claim of “seri
ous doubts.” That is not so. In the first paragraph of
footnote eight of its opinion, the panel reasoned that it was
“duty-bound to accept” the state courts’ factual findings
because it concluded they “are clear, unambiguous, and
fairly supported by the record.” 570 F. 3d, at 1303–1304,
n. 8. That language precedes the panel’s analysis—in the
second paragraph of footnote eight—regarding Jefferson’s
statements that the findings were “dubious” and raised
“serious doubts.” The Court omits the panel’s actual
explanation for declining to credit Jefferson’s general
characterization of the quality of the record, which is:
“Jefferson does not point to any particular factual finding
that was clearly erroneous, and Jefferson even says in the
argument section of his brief that, ‘[t]he relevant facts are
