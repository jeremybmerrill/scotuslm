JEFFERSON v. UPTON
Per Curiam

would not be worthwhile.’ ” Ibid.; cf. Pet. for Cert. 17,
n. 12.
Jefferson contends, and the State has not disputed, that
after the hearing concluded the state-court judge con
tacted the attorneys for the State ex parte. And in a pri
vate conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his
attorneys, the judge asked the State’s attorneys to draft
the opinion of the court. See id., at 3, 12. According to
Jefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he
informed of the request made to opposing counsel. Id., at
12, n. 8, 13; see also Jefferson v. Zant, 263 Ga. 316, 431
S. E. 2d 110, 111 (1993) (“Jefferson contends [the order]
amounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which
[he] has not had a chance to respond”).
The attorneys for the State prepared an opinion finding
that “Dr. Dudley led [Jefferson’s trial attorneys] to believe
that further investigation would simply be a waste of time
because Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.” Jefferson v. Zant,
Civ. Action No. 87–V–1241 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga.,
Oct. 7, 1992), p. 16, App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. 16 (hereinafter
State Order); see also id., at 37. The opinion “specifically
credits the testimony of [the trial attorneys] with regard to
their efforts to investigate Petitioner’s mental condition.”
Id., at 18; see also id., at 36. And relying on these find
ings, it concludes that Jefferson’s attorneys “made a rea
sonable investigation into [his] mental health” and were
thus not ineffective. Id., at 37.
Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court acknowledged,
the State’s opinion discusses statements purportedly made
on Jefferson’s behalf by a witness “who did not testify” or
participate in the proceedings. 263 Ga., at 318, 431 S. E.
2d, at 112; see State Order 24–25. Nonetheless, the opin
ion “was adopted verbatim by the [state] court.” 263 Ga.,
at 316, 431 S. E. 2d, at 111. And while the State Supreme
Court recognized that we have “ ‘criticized’ ” such a prac
tice, it affirmed the judgment. Id., at 317, 320, 431 S. E.
