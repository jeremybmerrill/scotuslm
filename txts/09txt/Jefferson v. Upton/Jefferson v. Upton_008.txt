JEFFERSON v. UPTON
Per Curiam

failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the State
court proceeding;
“(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair,
and adequate hearing in the State court proceeding; or
“(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due
process of law in the State court proceeding;
“(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a considera
tion of [the relevant] part of the record as a whole con
cludes that such factual determination is not fairly
supported by the record.” §2254(d) (emphasis added).
As is clear from the statutory text quoted above, and as
the District Court correctly stated, if any “one of the eight
enumerated exceptions . . . applies” then “the state court’s
factfinding is not presumed correct.” 490 F. Supp. 2d, at
1280; accord, Miller, supra, at 105 (“Under 28 U. S. C.
§2254(d), state-court findings of fact ‘shall be presumed to
be correct’ in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless
one of eight enumerated exceptions applies”); see also 1 R.
Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and
Procedure §20.2c, pp. 915–918 (5th ed. 2005).
Jefferson has consistently argued that the federal courts
“should harbor serious doubts about” and should not “give
any deference to” the “findings of fact and credibility
determinations” made by the state habeas court because
those findings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys
for the State pursuant to an ex parte request from the
state-court judge, who made no such request of Jefferson,
failed to notify Jefferson of the request made to opposing
counsel, and adopted the State’s proposed opinion verba
tim even though it recounted evidence from a nonexistent
witness. See, e.g., Appeals Brief 32, n. 10; District Court
Brief 4, n. 1; Pet. for Cert. 12. These are arguments that
the state court’s process was deficient. In other words,
they are arguments that Jefferson “did not receive a full
and fair evidentiary hearing in . . . state court.” Town
