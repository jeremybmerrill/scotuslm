JEFFERSON v. UPTON
Per Curiam

federal court is not “duty-bound” to accept any and all
state-court findings that are “fairly supported by the
record.” Those words come from §2254(d)(8), which is only
one of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of
correctness. But there are seven others, see §§2254(d)(1)–
(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when
addressing Jefferson’s claim. To be sure, we have previ
ously stated in cases applying §2254(d)(8) that “a federal
court” may not overturn a state court’s factual conclusion
“unless the conclusion is not ‘fairly supported by the re
cord.’ ” Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991) (grant
ing federal habeas relief after rejecting state court’s find
ing under §2254(d)(8)); see also Demosthenes v. Baal, 495
U. S. 731 (1990) (per curiam) (applying §2254(d)(8)); cf.
post, at 10 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But in those cases
there was no suggestion that any other provisions enu
merated in §2254(d) were at issue. That is not the case
here. In treating §2254(d)(8) as the exclusive statutory
exception, and by failing to address Jefferson’s argument
that the state court’s procedures deprived its findings of
deference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and
our precedents incorrectly.
Although we have stated that a court’s “verbatim adop
tion of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties”
should be treated as findings of the court, we have also
criticized that practice. Anderson, 470 U. S., at 572. And
we have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the applica
tion of the habeas statute to, the use of such a practice
where (1) a judge solicits the proposed findings ex parte,
(2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to
criticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts
findings that contain internal evidence suggesting that
the judge may not have read them. Cf. id., at 568; Ga.
Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) (1993) (prohibit
ing ex parte judicial communications).
We decline to determine in the first instance whether
