JEFFERSON v. UPTON
SCALIA, J., dissenting

the court was “obliged to accept” the state courts’ credibil
ity determination, despite the “reasons to doubt it.” 570
F. 3d, at 1312 (opinion of Carnes, J.). The dissent did not
cite §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but instead focused on the
same question of constitutional law that occupied Jeffer
son’s briefs, the District Court’s opinion, and the major
ity’s opinion: whether, accepting the factual findings and
credibility determination of the state courts as true, Jef
ferson’s attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of coun
sel. That is only the question that occupied the courts and
the parties below.
B
It is bad enough that the Court decides an issue not
raised or resolved in the lower courts. It is much worse
that it decides an issue Jefferson has not even asked us to
address. Under this Court’s Rule 14.1(a), “[o]nly the
questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included
therein, will be considered by the Court.” We apply that
rule in all but “the most exceptional cases, where reasons
of urgency or of economy suggest the need to address the
unpresented question under consideration.” Yee v. Escon
dido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted).
Jefferson’s petition for writ of certiorari presents a
single question:
“[W]hether the majority opinion, in affording trial
counsel’s decision to limit the scope of investigation in
a death penalty case ‘higher-than-strong presumption
of reasonableness’ [sic] conflicts with this Court’s
precedent as announced in Williams v. Taylor, 529
U. S. 362 (2000), Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510
(2003), Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374 (2005), and
Porter v. McCollum, 130 S. Ct. 447 (2009).” Pet. for
