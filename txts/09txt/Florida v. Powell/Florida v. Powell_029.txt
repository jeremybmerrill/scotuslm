STEVENS, J., dissenting

it is the Court “that is guilty of attaching greater impor
tance to the form of the Miranda ritual than to the sub
stance of the message it is intended to convey.” Prysock,
453 U. S., at 366 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).
III
Whether we focus on Powell’s particular case, or the use
of the warning form as the standard used in one jurisdic
tion, it is clear that the form is imperfect. See ante, at 12.
As the majority’s decision today demonstrates, reasonable
judges may well differ over the question whether the
deficiency is serious enough to violate the Federal Consti
tution. That difference of opinion, in my judgment, falls
short of providing a justification for reviewing this case
when the judges of the highest court of the State have
decided the warning is insufficiently protective of the
rights of the State’s citizens. In my view, respect for the
independence of state courts, and their authority to set the
rules by which their citizens are protected, should result
in a dismissal of this petition.
I respectfully dissent.
