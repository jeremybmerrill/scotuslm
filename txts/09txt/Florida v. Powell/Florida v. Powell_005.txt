FLORIDA v. POWELL
Opinion of the Court

Tampa Police headquarters. Ibid. Once there, and before
asking Powell any questions, the officers read Powell the
standard Tampa Police Department Consent and Release
Form 310. Id., at 1063–1064. The form states:
“You have the right to remain silent. If you give up
the right to remain silent, anything you say can be
used against you in court. You have the right to talk
to a lawyer before answering any of our questions. If
you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be ap
pointed for you without cost and before any question

felony, but said he had nevertheless purchased and car
ried the firearm for his protection. See 969 So. 2d, at
1064; App. 29.
Powell was charged in state court with possession of a
weapon by a prohibited possessor, in violation of Fla. Stat.
Ann. §790.23(1) (West 2007).
Contending that the
Miranda warnings were deficient because they did not
adequately convey his right to the presence of an attorney
during questioning, he moved to suppress his inculpatory
statements. The trial court denied the motion, concluding
that the officers had properly notified Powell of his right to
counsel. 969 So. 2d, at 1064; App. 28. A jury convicted
Powell of the gun-possession charge. 969 So. 2d, at 1064.
On appeal, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal

statements. Id., at 1067. The Miranda warnings, the
