STEVENS, J., dissenting

when the state court’s decision indicated that under state
law, the relevant state constitutional provision is consid

497 U. S. 177, 182 (1990) (“The opinion does not rely on (or even men
tion) any specific provision of the Illinois Constitution, nor even the
Illinois Constitution generally. Even the Illinois cases cited by the
opinion rely on no constitutional provisions other than the Fourth and
Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution”); Florida v.
Riley, 488 U. S. 445, 448, n. 1 (1989) (plurality opinion) (finding Florida
Supreme Court mentioned the State Constitution three times but the
discussion “focused exclusively on federal cases dealing with the Fourth
Amendment”); Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U. S. 567, 571, n. 3 (1988)
(describing state court as resting its holding on two state cases that
each relied upon federal law); New York v. P. J. Video, Inc., 475 U. S.
868, 872, n. 4 (1986) (“Here, the New York Court of Appeals cited the
New York Constitution only once, near the beginning of its opinion . . .
[and] repeatedly referred to the ‘First Amendment’ and ‘Fourth
Amendment’ during its discussion of the merits of the case”); Oliver v.
United States, 466 U. S. 170, 175, n. 5 (1984) (“The Maine Supreme
Judicial court referred only to the Fourth Amendment . . . [and] the
prior state cases that the court cited also construed the Federal Consti

106 (2003) (“The Iowa Supreme Court’s opinion . . . says that ‘Iowa
courts are to “apply the same analysis in considering the state equal
protection clause as . . . in considering the federal equal protection
claim” ’ ”); Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U. S. 582, 588, n. 4 (1990) (state
court explained that relevant state constitutional provision “offers a
protection against self-incrimination identical to that provided by the
Fifth Amendment” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Maryland v.
Garrison, 480 U. S. 79, 83–84 (1987) (state-court opinion relied on state
cases but indicated “that the Maryland constitutional provision is
construed in pari materia with the Fourth Amendment”).
4 I do not mean to suggest that this Court has never reached out be
yond these bounds in order to decide a case. For example, in Labron,
518 U. S. 938, we found that a state court decision resting on the
“Commonwealth’s jurisprudence of the automobile exception,” Com
monwealth v. Labron, 543 Pa. 86, 100, 669 A. 2d 917, 924 (1995), was
not so clearly based on state law that the Long presumption did not
