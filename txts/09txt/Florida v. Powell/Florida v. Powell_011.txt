FLORIDA v. POWELL
Opinion of the Court

police to advise criminal suspects of their rights under the
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments before commencing
custodial interrogation.” Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S.
195, 201 (1989). Intent on “giv[ing] concrete constitutional
guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to
follow,” 384 U. S., at 441–442, Miranda prescribed the
following four now-familiar warnings:
“[A suspect] must be warned prior to any questioning
[1] that he has the right to remain silent, [2] that any
thing he says can be used against him in a court of
law, [3] that he has the right to the presence of an at
torney, and [4] that if he cannot afford an attorney
one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning
if he so desires.” Id., at 479.
Miranda’s third warning—the only one at issue here—
addresses our particular concern that “[t]he circumstances
surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very
quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of
his privilege [to remain silent] by his interrogators.” Id.,
at 469. Responsive to that concern, we stated, as “an
absolute prerequisite to interrogation,” that an individual
held for questioning “must be clearly informed that he has
the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer
with him during interrogation.” Id., at 471. The question
before us is whether the warnings Powell received satis
fied this requirement.
The four warnings Miranda requires are invariable, but
this Court has not dictated the words in which the essen
tial information must be conveyed. See California v.
Prysock, 453 U. S. 355, 359 (1981) (per curiam) (“This
Court has never indicated that the rigidity of Miranda
extends to the precise formulation of the warnings given a
criminal defendant.” (internal quotation marks omitted));
