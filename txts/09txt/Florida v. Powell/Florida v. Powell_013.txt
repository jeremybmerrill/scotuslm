FLORIDA v. POWELL
Opinion of the Court

only those accused who can afford an attorney have the
right to have one present before answering any ques
tions. ” Id., at 203 (some internal quotation marks omit
ted). We thought otherwise. Under the relevant state
law, we noted, “counsel is appointed at [a] defendant’s
initial appearance in court.” Id., at 204. The “if and when
you go to court” advice, we said, “simply anticipate[d]” a
question the suspect might be expected to ask after receiv
ing Miranda warnings, i.e., “when [will he] obtain coun
sel.” 492 U. S., at 204. Reading the “if and when” lan
guage together with the other information conveyed, we
held that the warnings, “in their totality, satisfied
Miranda.” Id., at 205.
We reach the same conclusion in this case. The Tampa
officers did not “entirely omi[t],” post, at 9, any informa
tion Miranda required them to impart. They informed
Powell that he had “the right to talk to a lawyer before
answering any of [their] questions” and “the right to use
any of [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e]
interview.” App. 3. The first statement communicated
that Powell could consult with a lawyer before answering
any particular question, and the second statement con
firmed that he could exercise that right while the interro
gation was underway. In combination, the two warnings
reasonably conveyed Powell’s right to have an attorney
present, not only at the outset of interrogation, but at all
times.5

5 JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that the Court today approves, for “the
first time[,] . . . a warning which, if given its natural reading, entirely
omitted an essential element of a suspect’s rights.” Post, at 9. See also
post, at 12 (“[T]he warning entirely failed to inform [Powell] of the
separate and distinct right ‘to have counsel present during any ques
tioning.’ ”). We find the warning in this case adequate, however, only
because it communicated just what Miranda prescribed. JUSTICE
STEVENS ascribes a different meaning to the warning Powell received,
but he cannot credibly suggest that the Court regards the warning to
have omitted a vital element of Powell’s rights.
