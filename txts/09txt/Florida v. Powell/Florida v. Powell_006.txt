Opinion of the Court

appellate court concluded, did not “adequately inform
[Powell] of his . . . right to have an attorney present
throughout [the] interrogation.” 969 So. 2d, at 1063.
Considering the issue to be “one of great public impor
tance,” the court certified the following question to the
Florida Supreme Court:
“Does the failure to provide express advice of the right
to the presence of counsel during questioning vitiate
Miranda warnings which advise of both (A) the right
to talk to a lawyer ‘before questioning’ and (B) the
‘right to use’ the right to consult a lawyer ‘at any time’
during questioning?” Id., at 1067–1068 (some capi
talization omitted).
Surveying decisions of this Court as well as Florida
precedent, the Florida Supreme Court answered the certi
fied question in the affirmative. 998 So. 2d 531, 532
(2008). “Both Miranda and article I, section 9 of the Flor
ida Constitution,”1 the Florida High Court noted, “require
that a suspect be clearly informed of the right to have a
lawyer present during questioning.” Id., at 542. The court
found that the advice Powell received was misleading
because it suggested that Powell could “only consult with
an attorney before questioning” and did not convey Pow
ell’s entitlement to counsel’s presence throughout the
interrogation. Id., at 541. Nor, in the court’s view, did the
final catchall warning—“[y]ou have the right to use any of
these rights at any time you want during this interview”—
cure the defect the court perceived in the right-to-counsel
advice: “The catch-all phrase did not supply the missing
warning of the right to have counsel present during police
questioning,” the court stated, for “a right that has never
been expressed cannot be reiterated.” Ibid.

1 Article I, §9 of the Florida Constitution states that “[n]o person shall
. . . be compelled in any criminal matter to be a witness against one
self.”
