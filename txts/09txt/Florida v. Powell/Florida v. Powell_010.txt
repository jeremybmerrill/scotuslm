Opinion of the Court

[Florida] Supreme Court must itself speak with the clarity
it sought to require of its State’s police officers.” Ohio v.
Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 45 (1996) (GINSBURG, J., concur
ring in judgment).
Powell notes that “ ‘state courts are absolutely free to
interpret state constitutional provisions to accord greater
protection to individual rights than do similar provisions
of the United States Constitution.’ ” Brief for Respondent
19–20 (quoting Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 8 (1995)).
See also, e.g., Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714, 719 (1975);
Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58, 62 (1967). Powell is
right in this regard. Nothing in our decision today, we
emphasize, trenches on the Florida Supreme Court’s
authority to impose, based on the State’s Constitution, any
additional protections against coerced confessions it deems
appropriate. But because the Florida Supreme Court’s
decision does not “indicat[e] clearly and expressly that it is
alternatively based on bona fide separate, adequate, and
independent [state] grounds,” Long, 463 U. S., at 1041, we
have jurisdiction to decide this case.

clear, however, “when . . . [the] state court decision fairly appears to . . .
be interwoven with . . . federal law,” the only way to avoid the jurisdic
tional presumption is to provide a plain statement expressing inde
pendent reliance on state law. 463 U. S., at 1040. It is this plain
statement that makes “the adequacy and independence of any possible
state law ground . . . clear from the face of the opinion.” Id., at 1040–
1041. See also Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 44 (1996) (GINSBURG, J.,
concurring in judgment) (“Long governs even when, all things consid
ered, the more plausible reading of the state court’s decision may be
that the state court did not regard the Federal Constitution alone as a
sufficient basis for its ruling.”).
