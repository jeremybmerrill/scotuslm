FLORIDA v. POWELL
Opinion of the Court

Justice Wells dissented. He considered it “unreasonable
to conclude that the broad, unqualified language read to
Powell would lead a person of ordinary intelligence to
believe that he or she had a limited right to consult with
an attorney that could only be exercised before answering
the first question posed by law enforcement.” Id., at 544.
The final sentence of the warning, he stressed, “avoid[ed]
the implication—unreasonable as it may [have] be[en]—
that advice concerning the right of access to counsel before
questioning conveys the message that access to counsel is
foreclosed during questioning.” Ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted).
Criticizing the majority’s “technical
adherence to language . . . that has no connection with
whether the person who confessed understood his or her

warning reasonably conveyed to Powell his continuing
right of access to counsel,” id., at 544.
We granted certiorari, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), and now
reverse the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.

We first address Powell’s contention that this Court
lacks jurisdiction to hear this case because the Florida
Supreme Court, by relying not only on Miranda but also

adequate and independent state ground. Brief for Peti
tioner 15–23. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,
729 (1991) (“This Court will not review a question of fed
eral law decided by a state court if the decision . . . rests
on a state law ground that is independent of the federal
question and adequate to support the judgment.”). “It is
fundamental,” we have observed, “that state courts be left
free and unfettered by us in interpreting their state con
stitutions.” Minnesota v. National Tea Co., 309 U. S. 551,
557 (1940). “But it is equally important that ambiguous or
obscure adjudications by state courts do not stand as
