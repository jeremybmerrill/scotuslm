ings . . . or their equivalent”). In determining whether
police officers adequately conveyed the four warnings, we
have said, reviewing courts are not required to examine
the words employed “as if construing a will or defining the
terms of an easement. The inquiry is simply whether the
warnings reasonably ‘conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as
required by Miranda.’ ” Duckworth, 492 U. S., at 203

Our decisions in Prysock and Duckworth inform our
judgment here. Both concerned a suspect’s entitlement to
adequate notification of the right to appointed counsel. In
Prysock, an officer informed the suspect of, inter alia, his

lawyer would be appointed “if and when [the suspect goes]
to court.” 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal
quotation marks omitted). “The Court of Appeals thought
