FLORIDA v. POWELL
STEVENS, J., dissenting

The Court relies on Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195
(1989), and Prysock, 453 U. S. 355, but in neither case did
the warning at issue completely omit one of a suspect’s
rights. In Prysock, the warning regarding the right to an
appointed attorney contained no temporal limitation, see
id., at 360–361, which clearly distinguishes that case from
Powell’s. In Duckworth, the suspect was explicitly in
formed that he had the right “to talk to a lawyer for advice
before we ask you any questions, and to have him with you
during questioning,” and that he had “this right to the
advice and presence of a lawyer even if you cannot afford
to hire one.” 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal
quotation marks omitted). The warning thus conveyed in
full the right to appointed counsel before and during the
interrogation. Although the warning was arguably under
cut by the addition of a statement that an attorney would
be appointed “if and when you go to court,” the Court
found the suspect was informed of his full rights and the
warning simply added additional, truthful information
regarding when counsel would be appointed. Ibid. (em
phasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike
the Duckworth warning, Powell’s warning did not convey
his Miranda rights in full with the addition of some ar
guably misleading statement. Rather, the warning en
tirely failed to inform him of the separate and distinct
right “to have counsel present during any questioning.”
Miranda, 384 U. S., at 470.
In sum, the warning at issue in this case did not rea
sonably convey to Powell his right to have a lawyer with
him during the interrogation. “The requirement of warn
ings . . . [is] fundamental with respect to the Fifth
Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual
to existing methods of interrogation.” Id., at 476. In
determining that the warning implied what it did not say,

U. S. 436, 471–472 (1966).
