FLORIDA v. POWELL
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Federal Constitution. See Rigterink v. State, 2 So. 3d 221,
241 (2009) (“[T]he federal Constitution sets the floor, not
the ceiling, and this Court retains the ability to interpret
the right against self-incrimination afforded by the Florida
Constitution more broadly than that afforded by its fed
eral counterpart”); Traylor, 596 So. 2d, at 961–963. In this
very case, the Florida Supreme Court may reinstate its
judgment upon remand. If the Florida Supreme Court
does so, as I expect it will, this Court’s opinion on the
merits will qualify as the sort of advisory opinion that we
should studiously seek to avoid.

The Court’s decision on the merits is also unpersuasive.
As we recognized in Miranda, “the right to have counsel
present at [an] interrogation is indispensable to the pro
tection of the Fifth Amendment privilege.” Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 469 (1966). Furthermore, “the
need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege
comprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel
prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present
during any questioning.” Id., at 470. Because the “ac
cused who does not know his rights and therefore does not
make a request may be the person who most needs coun
sel,” id., at 470–471, a defendant “must be clearly in
formed” regarding two aspects of his right to consult an
attorney: “the right to consult with a lawyer and to have
the lawyer with him during interrogation,” id., at 471.
In this case, the form regularly used by the Tampa
police warned Powell that he had “the right to talk to a
lawyer before answering any of our questions.” App. 3.
This informed him only of the right to consult with a
lawyer before questioning, the very right the Miranda
Court identified as insufficient to protect the Fifth
Amendment privilege. The warning did not say anything
about the right to have counsel present during interroga
