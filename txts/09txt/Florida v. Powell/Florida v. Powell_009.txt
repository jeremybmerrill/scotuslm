FLORIDA v. POWELL
Opinion of the Court

expressly asserted that state-law sources gave Powell
rights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in
Miranda. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044.
Beginning with the certified question—whether the
advice the Tampa police gave to Powell “vitiate[d]
Miranda,” 998 So. 2d, at 532 (some capitalization omit
ted)—and continuing throughout its opinion, the Florida
Supreme Court trained on what Miranda demands, rather
than on what Florida law independently requires. See,
e.g., 998 So. 2d, at 533 (“The issue before this Court is
whether the failure to provide express advice of the right
to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation
violates the principles espoused in Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436.”); id., at 538 (“[T]he issue of [what] Miranda
requires . . . has been addressed by several of the Florida
district courts of appeal.”); id., at 542 (Powell received a
“narrower and less functional warning than that required

rested on a state ground separate from Miranda. See
Long, 463 U. S., at 1041 (the state court “need only make
clear by a plain statement in its judgment or opinion that
the federal cases are being used only for the purpose of
guidance, and do not themselves compel the result that
the court has reached”).4 “To avoid misunderstanding, the

3 JUSTICE STEVENS suggests that these statements refer to Miranda
only in a “generic” sense to mean “the warnings suspects must be given
before interrogation.” Post, at 6. This explanation fails to account for
the Florida Supreme Court’s repeated citations to the opinion in
Miranda. In context, it is obvious that the court was attempting to
home in on what that opinion—which, of course, interpreted only the
Federal Constitution and not Florida law—requires. See, e.g., 998
So. 2d 531, 533, 534, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542 (2008).
4 JUSTICE STEVENS agrees that the Florida Supreme Court’s decision
is interwoven with federal law, post, at 7, and lacks the plain statement
contemplated by Long, post, at 3. Nevertheless, he finds it possible to
discern an independent state-law basis for the decision. As Long makes
