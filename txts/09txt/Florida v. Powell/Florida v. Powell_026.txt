FLORIDA v. POWELL
STEVENS, J., dissenting

tion the right to an attorney’s presence during interroga
tion8 have found language of the sort used in Powell’s
warning to be misleading. For instance, petitioner cites
the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Lamia,
429 F. 2d 373 (1970), as an example of a court applying
the properly flexible approach to Miranda. But in that
case, the Second Circuit expressly distinguished a warning
that a suspect “ ‘could consult an attorney prior to any
question,’ ” which was “affirmatively misleading since it
was thought to imply that the attorney could not be pre
sent during questioning.” 429 F. 2d, at 377.9 That even

8 Several Courts of Appeals have held that warnings that did not
expressly inform a suspect of his right to have counsel present during
interrogation did not adequately inform a suspect of his Miranda
rights. See, e.g., United States v. Tillman, 963 F. 2d 137, 141 (CA6
1992); United States v. Bland, 908 F. 2d 471, 474 (CA9 1990); United
States v. Anthon, 648 F. 2d 669, 672–673 (CA10 1981); Windsor v.
United States, 389 F. 2d 530, 533 (CA5 1968). And most of the Circuits
that have not required express mention of the right to an attorney’s
presence have approved only general warnings regarding the right to
an attorney; that is, warnings which did not specifically mention the
right to counsel’s presence during interrogation but which also con
tained no limiting words that might mislead a suspect as to the broad
nature of his right to counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Frankson, 83
F. 3d 79, 82 (CA4 1996); United States v. Caldwell, 954 F. 2d 496, 502
(CA8 1992); United States v. Adams, 484 F. 2d 357, 361–362 (CA7
1973). I am doubtful that warning a suspect of his “right to counsel,”
without more, reasonably conveys a suspect’s full rights under
Miranda, but at least such a general warning does not include the same
sort of misleading temporal limitation as in Powell’s warning.
9 Petitioner also cites Bridgers v. Dretke, 431 F. 3d 853 (CA5 2005), in
which the Fifth Circuit held the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did
not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in finding
adequate a warning in which a suspect was informed that “he had the
right to the presence of an attorney before any questioning commenced.”
Id., at 857 (internal quotation marks omitted). But even assuming that
warning would sufficiently apprise an individual of his right to an
attorney’s presence during interrogation, the fact that the warning
mentioned an attorney’s presence materially distinguishes it from the
warning Powell received. The Fifth Circuit quoted with approval the
