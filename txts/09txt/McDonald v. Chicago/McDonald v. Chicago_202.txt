BREYER, J., dissenting

Territory 1740 (S. Chase ed. 1835); Act of Dec. 3, 1825, ch.
CCXCII, §3, 1825 Tenn. Priv. Acts 306.
Second, States began to regulate the possession of con
cealed weapons, which were both popular and dangerous.
See, e.g., C. Cramer, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early
Republic 143–152 (1999) (collecting examples); see also
1837–1838 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 137, pp. 200–201 (banning
the wearing, sale, or giving of Bowie knives); 1847 Va.
Acts ch. 7, §8, p. 110, (“Any free person who shall habitu

State courts repeatedly upheld the validity of such laws,

La. Ann. 399, 400 (1858) (upholding concealed weapon ban
because it “prohibited only a particular mode of bearing
arms which is found dangerous to the peace of society”);
State v. Chandler, 5 La. Ann. 489, 489–490 (1850) (uphold
ing concealed weapon ban and describing the law as “abso

growing out of the habit of carrying concealed weapons”);
State v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616–617 (1840).
The Post-Civil War Nineteenth Century
It is important to read the majority’s account with the
following considerations in mind:
First, the Court today properly declines to revisit our
interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause. See
ante, at 10. The Court’s case for incorporation must thus
rest on the conclusion that the right to bear arms is “fun
