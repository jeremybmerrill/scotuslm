MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

part, to the limitations set by courts upon experimen
tation in the fields of social and economic science; and
to the discouragement to which proposals for better
ment there have been subjected otherwise. There
must be power in the States and the Nation to re
mould, through experimentation, our economic prac
tices and institutions to meet changing social and eco
nomic needs. I cannot believe that the framers of the
Fourteenth Amendment, or the States which ratified
it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct [the
social problems we face].”
There are 50 state legislatures. The fact that this Court
may already have refused to take this wise advice with
respect to Congress in Heller is no reason to make matters
worse here.
Third, the ability of States to reflect local preferences
and conditions—both key virtues of federalism—here has
particular importance. The incidence of gun ownership
varies substantially as between crowded cities and uncon
gested rural communities, as well as among the different
geographic regions of the country. Thus, approximately
60% of adults who live in the relatively sparsely populated
Western States of Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming report
that their household keeps a gun, while fewer than 15% of
adults in the densely populated Eastern States of Rhode
Island, New Jersey, and Massachusetts say the same.
The nature of gun violence also varies as between rural
communities and cities. Urban centers face significantly
greater levels of firearm crime and homicide, while rural
communities have proportionately greater problems with
nonhomicide gun deaths, such as suicides and accidents.
And idiosyncratic local factors can lead to two cities find
ing themselves in dramatically different circumstances:
For example, in 2008, the murder rate was 40 times
higher in New Orleans than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska.
