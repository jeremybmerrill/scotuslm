MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

granted to other citizens by the Constitution of the
United States.

“. . . Article II, of the amendments to the Constitution
of the United States, gives the people the right to bear
arms and states that this right shall not be infringed.
. . . All men, without distinction of color, have the
right to keep arms to defend their homes, families or
themselves.” Letter to the Editor, Loyal Georgian
(Augusta), Feb. 3, 1866, p. 3.
These statements are consistent with the arguments of
abolitionists during the antebellum era that slavery, and
the slave States’ efforts to retain it, violated the constitu
tional rights of individuals—rights the abolitionists de
scribed as among the privileges and immunities of citizen
ship.
See, e.g., J. Tiffany, Treatise on the
Unconstitutionality of American Slavery 56 (1849) (reprint
1969) (“pledg[ing] . . . to see that all the rights, privileges,
and immunities, granted by the constitution of the United
States, are extended to all”); id., at 99 (describing the
“right to keep and bear arms” as one of those rights se
cured by “the constitution of the United States”). The
problem abolitionists sought to remedy was that, under
Dred Scott, blacks were not entitled to the privileges and
immunities of citizens under the Federal Constitution and
that, in many States, whatever inalienable rights state
law recognized did not apply to blacks. See, e.g., Cooper v.
Savannah, 4 Ga. 68, 72 (1848) (deciding, just two years
after Chief Justice Lumpkin’s opinion in Nunn recognizing
the right to keep and bear arms, see supra, at 39, that
“[f]ree persons of color have never been recognized here as
citizens; they are not entitled to bear arms”).
Section 1 guaranteed the rights of citizenship in the
United States and in the several States without regard to
race. But it was understood that liberty would be assured
