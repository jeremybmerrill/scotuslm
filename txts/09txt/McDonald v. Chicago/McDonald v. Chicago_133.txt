Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211 (1916) (Seventh Amendment);
Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (Grand Jury
Clause). We have, moreover, resisted a uniform approach
to the Sixth Amendment’s criminal jury guarantee, de­
manding 12-member panels and unanimous verdicts in
federal trials, yet not in state trials. See Apodaca v. Ore­
gon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972) (plurality opinion); Williams, 399
U. S. 78. In recent years, the Court has repeatedly de­
clined to grant certiorari to review that disparity.12 While
those denials have no precedential significance, they
confirm the proposition that the “incorporation” of a provi­
sion of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment
does not, in itself, mean the provision must have precisely
the same meaning in both contexts.
It is true, as well, that during the 1960’s the Court
decided a number of cases involving procedural rights in
which it treated the Due Process Clause as if it trans­
planted language from the Bill of Rights into the Four­
teenth Amendment. See, e.g., Benton v. Maryland, 395
U. S. 784, 795 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); Pointer v.
Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 406 (1965) (Confrontation Clause).
“Jot-for-jot” incorporation was the norm in this expansion­
ary era. Yet at least one subsequent opinion suggests that
these precedents require perfect state/federal congruence
only on matters “ ‘at the core’ ” of the relevant constitutional
guarantee. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 37 (1978); see also
id., at 52–53 (Powell, J., dissenting). In my judgment, this
line of cases is best understood as having concluded that, to
ensure a criminal trial satisfies essential standards of
