Opinion of THOMAS, J.

to reexamine, and begin the process of restoring, the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment agreed upon by
those who ratified it.

(describing the “rights and liberties” of Englishmen as
“private immunities” and “civil privileges”). A number of
antebellum judicial decisions used the terms in this man
ner. See, e.g., Magill v. Brown, 16 F. Cas. 408, 428 (No.
