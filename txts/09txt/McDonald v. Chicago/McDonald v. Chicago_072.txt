MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

the first eight Amendments, see, e.g., Benton v. Maryland,
395 U. S. 784 (1969) (protection against double jeopardy),
but substantive rights as well, see, e.g., Gitlow v. New
York, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925) (right to free speech); Near
v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 707 (1931)
(same). In the process of incorporating these rights
against the States, the Court often applied them differ
ently against the States than against the Federal Gov
ernment on the theory that only those “fundamental”
aspects of the right required Due Process Clause protec
tion. See, e.g., Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455, 473 (1942)
(holding that the Sixth Amendment required the appoint

defendant was unable to retain an attorney, but that the
Due Process Clause required appointment of counsel in
state criminal cases only where “want of counsel . . . re

ness”). In more recent years, this Court has “abandoned
the notion” that the guarantees in the Bill of Rights apply
differently when incorporated against the States than they
do when applied to the Federal Government. Ante, at 17–

right is incorporated through the Due Process Clause only
if it is sufficiently “fundamental,” ante, at 37, 42–44 (plu
rality opinion)—a term the Court has long struggled to
define.
While this Court has at times concluded that a right
gains “fundamental” status only if it is essential to the
American “scheme of ordered liberty” or “ ‘deeply rooted in
this Nation’s history and tradition,’ ” ante, at 19 (plurality
opinion) (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), the Court
has just as often held that a right warrants Due Process
Clause protection if it satisfies a far less measurable range
of criteria, see Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 562
(2003) (concluding that the Due Process Clause protects
