STEVENS, J., dissenting

V
While I agree with the Court that our substantive due
process cases offer a principled basis for holding that
petitioners have a constitutional right to possess a usable
fiream in the home, I am ultimately persuaded that a
better reading of our case law supports the city of Chicago.
I would not foreclose the possibility that a particular
plaintiff—say, an elderly widow who lives in a dangerous
neighborhood and does not have the strength to operate a

sessing a handgun. But I cannot accept petitioners’
broader submission. A number of factors, taken together,
lead me to this conclusion.
First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent rela­

defend their families and property from intruders, they
can help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent
victims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far
from hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of
our communities. Amici calculate that approximately one
million Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire
in the last decade.34 Urban areas such as Chicago suffer
disproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Hand­
guns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some
homeowners may prefer handguns because of their small
size, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals
will value them for the same reasons. See Heller, 554
U. S., at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 32–33).
In recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more
than four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of
