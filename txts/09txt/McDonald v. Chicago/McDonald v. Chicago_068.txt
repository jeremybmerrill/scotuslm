MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

I
In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___ (2008),
this Court held that the Second Amendment protects an
individual right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of
self-defense, striking down a District of Columbia ordi
nance that banned the possession of handguns in the
home. Id., at __ (slip op., at 64). The question in this case
is whether the Constitution protects that right against
abridgment by the States.
As the Court explains, if this case were litigated before
the Fourteenth Amendment’s adoption in 1868, the an
swer to that question would be simple. In Barron ex rel.
Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), this
Court held that the Bill of Rights applied only to the Fed
eral Government. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice
Marshall recalled that the founding generation added the
first eight Amendments to the Constitution in response to
Antifederalist concerns regarding the extent of federal—
not state—power, and held that if “the framers of these
amendments [had] intended them to be limitations on the
powers of the state governments,” “they would have de
clared this purpose in plain and intelligible language.”
Id., at 250. Finding no such language in the Bill, Chief
Justice Marshall held that it did not in any way restrict
state authority. Id., at 248–250; see Lessee of Livingston
v. Moore, 7 Pet. 469, 551–552 (1833) (reaffirming Barron’s
holding); Permoli v. Municipality No. 1 of New Orleans, 3
How. 589, 609–610 (1845) (same).
Nearly three decades after Barron, the Nation was
splintered by a civil war fought principally over the ques
tion of slavery. As was evident to many throughout our
Nation’s early history, slavery, and the measures designed
to protect it, were irreconcilable with the principles of
equality, government by consent, and inalienable rights
proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence and em
bedded in our constitutional structure. See, e.g., 3 Records
