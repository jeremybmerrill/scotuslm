MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

in this case that some part of the Heller right applies to
the States, and then to find in later cases that other parts
of the right also apply, or apply on different terms.
As noted at the outset, the liberty interest petitioners
have asserted is the “right to possess a functional, per­
sonal firearm, including a handgun, within the home.”
Complaint ¶34, App. 23. The city of Chicago allows resi­
dents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are
registered, but it generally prohibits the possession of
handguns, sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and short­
barreled rifles. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–
050 (2009).27 Petitioners’ complaint centered on their
desire to keep a handgun at their domicile—it references
the “home” in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint ¶¶3–
4, 11–30, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19–26—as did
their supporting declarations, see, e.g., App. 34, 36, 40, 43,
49–52, 54–56. Petitioners now frame the question that
confronts us as “[w]hether the Second Amendment right to
keep and bear arms is incorporated as against the States
by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities
or Due Process Clauses.” Brief for Petitioners, p. i. But it
is our duty “to focus on the allegations in the complaint to
determine how petitioner describes the constitutional
right at stake,” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, and the
gravamen of this complaint is plainly an appeal to keep a
handgun or other firearm of one’s choosing in the home.
Petitioners’ framing of their complaint tracks the
Court’s ruling in Heller. The majority opinion contained
some dicta suggesting the possibility of a more expansive
——————
Amendment claim.
27 The village of Oak Park imposes more stringent restrictions that
may raise additional complications. See ante, at 2 (majority opinion)
(quoting Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code §§27–2–1 (2007), 27–1–1
(2009)). The Court, however, declined to grant certiorari on the Na­
tional Rifle Association’s challenge to the Oak Park restrictions.
Chicago is the only defendant in this case.
