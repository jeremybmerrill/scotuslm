Petitioners argue that the Chicago and Oak Park laws
violate the right to keep and bear arms for two reasons.
Petitioners’ primary submission is that this right is among
the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States” and that the narrow interpretation of the Privi

municipal respondents maintain that due process does not

parties’ far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting

first eight Amendments operate as limitations on the
