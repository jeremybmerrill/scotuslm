MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

federal enforcement of constitutionally enumerated rights
against the States, including the right to keep and bear
arms.
a
I turn first to public debate at the time of ratification. It
is true that the congressional debates over §1 were rela
tively brief. It is also true that there is little evidence of
extensive debate in the States. Many state legislatures
did not keep records of their debates, and the few records
that do exist reveal only modest discussion. See Curtis
145. These facts are not surprising.
First, however consequential we consider the question
today, the nationalization of constitutional rights was not
the most controversial aspect of the Fourteenth Amend
ment at the time of its ratification. The Nation had just
endured a tumultuous civil war, and §§2, 3, and 4—which
reduced the representation of States that denied voting
rights to blacks, deprived most former Confederate officers
of the power to hold elective office, and required States to
disavow Confederate war debts—were far more polarizing
and consumed far more political attention. See Wilden
thal 1600; Hardy, Original Popular Understanding of the
Fourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of
1866–1868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695, 699 (2009).
Second, the congressional debates on the Fourteenth
Amendment reveal that many representatives, and proba
bly many citizens, believed that the Thirteenth Amend
ment, the 1866 Civil Rights legislation, or some combina
tion of the two, had already enforced constitutional rights
against the States. Justice Black’s dissent in Adamson
chronicles this point in detail. 332 U. S., at 107–108
(Appendix to dissenting opinion). Regardless of whether
that understanding was accurate as a matter of constitu
tional law, it helps to explain why Congressmen had little
to say during the debates about §1. See ibid.
