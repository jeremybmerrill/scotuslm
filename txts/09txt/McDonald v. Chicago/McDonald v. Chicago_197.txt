MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

ing, is it so fundamental a matter as to require taking that
power from the people? What is it here that the people did
not know? What is it that a judge knows better?

In sum, the police power, the superiority of legislative
decisionmaking, the need for local decisionmaking, the
comparative desirability of democratic decisionmaking,
the lack of a manageable judicial standard, and the life
threatening harm that may flow from striking down regu
lations all argue against incorporation. Where the incor
poration of other rights has been at issue, some of these
problems have arisen. But in this instance all these prob
lems are present, all at the same time, and all are likely to
be present in most, perhaps nearly all, of the cases in
which the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue.
At the same time, the important factors that favor incor
poration in other instances—e.g., the protection of broader
constitutional objectives—are not present here. The up
shot is that all factors militate against incorporation—
with the possible exception of historical factors.
III
I must, then, return to history. The plurality, in seeking
to justify incorporation, asks whether the interests the
Second Amendment protects are “ ‘deeply rooted in this
Nation’s history and tradition.’ ” Ante, at 19 (quoting
Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; internal quotation marks
omitted). It looks to selected portions of the Nation’s
history for the answer. And it finds an affirmative reply.
As I have made clear, I do not believe history is the only
pertinent consideration. Nor would I read history as
broadly as the majority does. In particular, since we here
are evaluating a more particular right—namely, the right
to bear arms for purposes of private self-defense—general
historical references to the “right to keep and bear arms”
