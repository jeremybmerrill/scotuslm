Opinion of THOMAS, J. 


B

I start with the nature of the rights that §1’s Privileges
or Immunities Clause protects. Section 1 overruled Dred
Scott’s holding that blacks were not citizens of either the
United States or their own State and, thus, did not enjoy
“the privileges and immunities of citizens” embodied in the
Constitution. 19 How., at 417. The Court in Dred Scott
did not distinguish between privileges and immunities of
citizens of the United States and citizens in the several
States, instead referring to the rights of citizens generally.

full liberty of speech” and the right “to keep and carry
arms.” Ibid.
Section 1 protects the rights of citizens “of the United
States” specifically. The evidence overwhelmingly demon
strates that the privileges and immunities of such citizens
included individual rights enumerated in the Constitution,
including the right to keep and bear arms.

Amity, Settlement, and Limits, Art. 6, Feb. 22, 1819, 8
Stat. 256−258, T. S. No. 327 (entered into force Feb. 19,
1821) (cession of Florida) (“The inhabitants of the territo
ries which his Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States,
by this Treaty, shall be incorporated in the Union of the
United States, as soon as may be consistent with the
principles of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the
enjoyment of all the privileges, rights, and immunities, of
