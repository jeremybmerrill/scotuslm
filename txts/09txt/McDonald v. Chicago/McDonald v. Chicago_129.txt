STEVENS, J., dissenting

(outlawing racial segregation in District of Columbia
public schools); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510,
534–535 (1925) (vindicating right of parents to direct
upbringing and education of their children); Meyer v.
Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399–403 (1923) (striking down
prohibition on teaching of foreign languages).
Liberty
The second principle woven through our cases is that
substantive due process is fundamentally a matter of
personal liberty. For it is the liberty clause of the Four­
teenth Amendment that grounds our most important
holdings in this field. It is the liberty clause that enacts
the Constitution’s “promise” that a measure of dignity and
self-rule will be afforded to all persons. Planned Parent­
hood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 847
(1992). It is the liberty clause that reflects and renews
“the origins of the American heritage of freedom [and] the
abiding interest in individual liberty that makes certain
state intrusions on the citizen’s right to decide how he will
live his own life intolerable.” Fitzgerald v. Porter Memo­
rial Hospital, 523 F. 2d 716, 720 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.).
Our substantive due process cases have episodically in­
voked values such as privacy and equality as well, values
that in certain contexts may intersect with or complement
a subject’s liberty interests in profound ways. But as I
have observed on numerous occasions, “most of the signifi­
cant [20th-century] cases raising Bill of Rights issues
have, in the final analysis, actually interpreted the word
‘liberty’ in the Fourteenth Amendment.”8
It follows that the term “incorporation,” like the term
“unenumerated rights,” is something of a misnomer.
