MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

exercise judgment, to be sure. When answering a consti­
tutional question to which the text provides no clear an­
swer, there is always some amount of discretion; our
constitutional system has always depended on judges’
filling in the document’s vast open spaces.50 But there is
also transparency.
JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach is even less restrained in
another sense: It would effect a major break from our case
law outside of the “incorporation” area. JUSTICE SCALIA
does not seem troubled by the fact that his method is
largely inconsistent with the Court’s canonical substantive
due process decisions, ranging from Meyer, 262 U. S. 390,
and Pierce, 268 U. S. 510, in the 1920’s, to Griswold, 381
U. S. 479, in the 1960’s, to Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558, in the
2000’s. To the contrary, he seems to embrace this disso­
nance. My method seeks to synthesize dozens of cases on
which the American people have relied for decades.
JUSTICE SCALIA’s method seeks to vaporize them. So I am
left to wonder, which of us is more faithful to this Nation’s
constitutional history? And which of us is more faithful to
the values and commitments of the American people, as
they stand today? In 1967, when the Court held in Lov­
ing, 388 U. S. 1, that adults have a liberty-based as well as
equality-based right to wed persons of another race, inter­
racial marriage was hardly “deeply rooted” in American
tradition. Racial segregation and subordination were
deeply rooted. The Court’s substantive due process hold­
ing was nonetheless correct—and we should be wary of
any interpretive theory that implies, emphatically, that it
was not.
Which leads me to the final set of points I wish to make:
JUSTICE SCALIA’s method invites not only bad history, but
also bad constitutional law. As I have already explained,
in evaluating a claimed liberty interest (or any constitu­

this is truly one of our most deeply rooted legal traditions.
