Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Evening Post, Feb. 8, 1904, reprinted in R. Ginzburg, 100
Years of Lynchings 63 (1988); Negro Shot Dead for Kissing
His White Girlfriend, Chi. Defender, Feb. 31, 1915, in id.,
at 95 (reporting incident in Florida); La. Negro Is Burned
Alive Screaming “I Didn’t Do It,” Cleveland Gazette, Dec.
13, 1914, in id., at 93 (reporting incident in Louisiana).
The use of firearms for self-defense was often the only
way black citizens could protect themselves from mob
violence. As Eli Cooper, one target of such violence, is said
to have explained, “ ‘[t]he Negro has been run over for fifty
years, but it must stop now, and pistols and shotguns are
the only weapons to stop a mob.’ ” Church Burnings Fol
low Negro Agitator’s Lynching, Chicago Defender, Sept. 6,
1919, in id., at 124. Sometimes, as in Cooper’s case, self
defense did not succeed. He was dragged from his home
by a mob and killed as his wife looked on. Ibid. But at
other times, the use of firearms allowed targets of mob
violence to survive. One man recalled the night during his
childhood when his father stood armed at a jail until
morning to ward off lynchers. See Cottrol, 354. The ex
perience left him with a sense, “not ‘of powerlessness, but
of the “possibilities of salvation” ’ ” that came from stand
ing up to intimidation. Ibid.
In my view, the record makes plain that the Framers of
the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the ratifying-era
public understood—just as the Framers of the Second
Amendment did—that the right to keep and bear arms
was essential to the preservation of liberty. The record
makes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary
to include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that
the Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the
wake of the War over slavery. There is nothing about
Cruikshank’s contrary holding that warrants its retention.
