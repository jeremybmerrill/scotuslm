BREYER, J., dissenting

City Code §193–16(A) (2005); Aurora, Ill., Code of Ordi
nances §29–49(a) (2009); Buffalo, N. Y., City Code §180–
1(F) (2000); Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–24–025(a)
(2010); Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code §708–37(a)
(2008); Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinances §628.03(a)
(2008); Columbus, Ohio, City Code §2323.31 (2007); Den
ver, Colo., Municipal Code §38–130(e) (2008); Morton
Grove, Ill., Village Code §6–2–3(A); N. Y. C. Admin. Code
§10–303.1 (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Village Code §27–2–1
(2009); Rochester, N. Y., City Code §47–5(F) (2008);
Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code §549.23(a). And two States,
Maryland and Hawaii, ban assault pistols. See Haw. Rev.
Stat. Ann. §134–8; Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–303
(Lexis 2002).
Second, as I stated earlier, state courts in States with
constitutions that provide gun rights have almost uni
formly interpreted those rights as providing protection
only against unreasonable regulation of guns. See, e.g.,
Winkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the “courts of every state to
consider” a gun regulation apply the “ ‘reasonable regula
tion’ ” approach); State v. McAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238
(Wyo. 1986); Robertson v. City & County of Denver, 874
P. 2d 325, 328 (Colo. 1994).
When determining reasonableness those courts have
normally adopted a highly deferential attitude towards
legislative determinations. See Winkler, Scrutinizing 723
(identifying only six cases in the 60 years before the arti
cle’s publication striking down gun control laws: three that
banned “the transportation of any firearms for any pur
pose whatsoever,” a single “permitting law,” and two as
applied challenges in “unusual circumstances”). Hence, as
evidenced by the breadth of existing regulations, States
and local governments maintain substantial flexibility to
regulate firearms—much as they seemingly have through
out the Nation’s history—even in those States with an
arms right in their constitutions.
