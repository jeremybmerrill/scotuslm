MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

States likewise tell us little about the meaning of the word
“liberty” in the Clause or about the scope of its protection
of nonprocedural rights.
This is a substantive due process case.
I
Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment decrees that no
State shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.” The Court has filled thou­
sands of pages expounding that spare text. As I read the
vast corpus of substantive due process opinions, they
confirm several important principles that ought to guide
our resolution of this case. The principal opinion’s lengthy
summary of our “incorporation” doctrine, see ante, at 5–9,
11–19 (majority opinion), 10–11 (plurality opinion), and its
implicit (and untenable) effort to wall off that doctrine
from the rest of our substantive due process jurisprudence,

Substantive Content
The first, and most basic, principle established by our
cases is that the rights protected by the Due Process
Clause are not merely procedural in nature. At first
glance, this proposition might seem surprising, given that
the Clause refers to “process.” But substance and proce­

the text can be read to “impos[e] nothing less than an
obligation to give substantive content to the words ‘liberty’
and ‘due process of law,’ ” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521
U. S. 702, 764 (1997) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment),
lest superficially fair procedures be permitted to “destroy
the enjoyment” of life, liberty, and property, Poe v. Ull­
man, 367 U. S. 497, 541 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting),
and the Clause’s prepositional modifier be permitted to
swallow its primary command. Procedural guarantees are
hollow unless linked to substantive interests; and no
