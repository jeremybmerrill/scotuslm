Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Third, while Barron made plain that the Bill of Rights
was not legally enforceable against the States, see supra,
at 2, the significance of that holding should not be over
stated. Like the Framers, see supra, at 14–15, many 19th
century Americans understood the Bill of Rights to declare
inalienable rights that pre-existed all government. Thus,
even though the Bill of Rights technically applied only to
the Federal Government, many believed that it declared
rights that no legitimate government could abridge.
Chief Justice Henry Lumpkin’s decision for the Georgia
Supreme Court in Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. 243 (1846), illus
trates this view. In assessing state power to regulate
firearm possession, Lumpkin wrote that he was “aware
that it has been decided, that [the Second Amendment],
like other amendments adopted at the same time, is a
restriction upon the government of the United States, and
does not extend to the individual States.” Id., at 250. But
he still considered the right to keep and bear arms as “an
unalienable right, which lies at the bottom of every free
government,” and thus found the States bound to honor it.
Ibid. Other state courts adopted similar positions with
respect to the right to keep and bear arms and other enu
merated rights.16 Some courts even suggested that the
protections in the Bill of Rights were legally enforceable
against the States, Barron notwithstanding.17 A promi
nent treatise of the era took the same position. W. Rawle,
