leges and immunities’ relate to the rights of persons, place
or property; a privilege is a peculiar right, a private law,
conceded to particular persons or places”). In addition,
dictionary definitions confirm that the public shared this
understanding. See, e.g., N. Webster, An American Dic

Porter rev. 1865) (defining “privilege” as “a right or immu
