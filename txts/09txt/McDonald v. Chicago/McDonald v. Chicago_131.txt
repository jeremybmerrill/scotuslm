STEVENS, J., dissenting

In his own classic opinion in Griswold, 381 U. S., at 500
(concurring in judgment), Justice Harlan memorably
distilled these precedents’ lesson: “While the relevant
inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provi­
sions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or
any of their radiations. The Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment stands . . . on its own bottom.”10
Inclusion in the Bill of Rights is neither necessary nor
sufficient for an interest to be judicially enforceable under
the Fourteenth Amendment. This Court’s “ ‘selective
incorporation’ ” doctrine, ante, at 15, is not simply “related”
to substantive due process, ante, at 19; it is a subset
thereof.
Federal/State Divergence
The third precept to emerge from our case law flows from
the second: The rights protected against state infringement
by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause need
not be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected
against Federal Government infringement by the various
provisions of the Bill of Rights. As drafted, the Bill of

same basic approach to “incorporation,” with the Fourteenth Amend­
ment taken as a distinct source of rights independent from the first
eight Amendments. Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 322–328
(1937) (opinion for the Court by Cardozo, J.); Adamson v. California,
332 U. S. 46, 59–68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).
10 See also Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 26 (1949) (“The notion that
the ‘due process of law’ guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is
shorthand for the first eight amendments of the Constitution . . . has
been rejected by this Court again and again, after impressive consid­
eration. . . . The issue is closed”). Wolf’s holding on the exclusionary
rule was overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), but the
principle just quoted has never been disturbed. It is notable that
Mapp, the case that launched the modern “doctrine of ad hoc,” “ ‘jot-for­
jot’ ” incorporation, Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 130–131 (1970)
(Harlan, J., concurring in result), expressly held “that the exclusionary
rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend­
ments.” 367 U. S., at 657 (emphasis added).
