MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

Rights protections “are all to be enforced against the
States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the
same standards that protect those personal rights against
federal encroachment.” Id., at 10; see also Mapp v. Ohio,
367 U. S. 643, 655–656 (1961); Ker v. California, 374 U. S.
23, 33–34 (1963); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108, 110
(1964); Pointer, 380 U. S., at 406; Duncan, supra, at 149,
157–158; Benton, 395 U. S., at 794–795; Wallace v. Jaffree,
472 U. S. 38, 48–49 (1985).14
Employing this approach, the Court overruled earlier
decisions in which it had held that particular Bill of Rights
——————
14 There is one exception to this general rule. The Court has held that
although the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury requires a unani
mous jury verdict in federal criminal trials, it does not require a
unanimous jury verdict in state criminal trials. See Apodaca v. Oregon,
406 U. S. 404 (1972); see also Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356
(1972) (holding that the Due Process Clause does not require unani
mous jury verdicts in state criminal trials). But that ruling was the
result of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement
of the two-track approach to incorporation. In Apodaca, eight Justices
agreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the
Federal Government and the States. See Johnson, supra, at 395
(Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, among those eight, four Jus
tices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unani
mous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, Apodaca,
406 U. S., at 406 (plurality opinion), and four other Justices took the
view that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in
federal and state criminal trials, id., at 414–415 (Stewart, J., dissent
ing); Johnson, supra, at 381–382 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Justice
Powell’s concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded
that the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not
state, cases.
Apodaca, therefore, does not undermine the well
established rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply
identically to the States and the Federal Government. See Johnson,
supra, at 395–396 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted) (“In any
event, the affirmance must not obscure that the majority of the Court
remains of the view that, as in the case of every specific of the Bill of
Rights that extends to the States, the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial
guarantee, however it is to be construed, has identical application
against both State and Federal Governments”).
