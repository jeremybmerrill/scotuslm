right itself.” Ibid.

We turn, finally, to the two dissenting opinions.
JUSTICE STEVENS’ eloquent opinion covers ground already
addressed, and therefore little need be added in response.
JUSTICE STEVENS would “ ‘ground the prohibitions against
state action squarely on due process, without intermediate
reliance on any of the first eight Amendments.’ ” Post, at 8
(quoting Malloy, 378 U. S., at 24 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).
The question presented in this case, in his view, “is
whether the particular right asserted by petitioners ap
plies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment
itself, standing on its own bottom.” Post, at 27. He would
hold that “[t]he rights protected against state infringe
ment by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause
need not be identical in shape or scope to the rights pro
tected against Federal Government infringement by the
various provisions of the Bill of Rights.” Post, at 9.
As we have explained, the Court, for the past half
century, has moved away from the two-track approach. If
we were now to accept JUSTICE STEVENS’ theory across the
board, decades of decisions would be undermined. We
assume that this is not what is proposed. What is urged
instead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for
the individual right that Heller recognized, over vigorous
dissents.
The relationship between the Bill of Rights’ guarantees
and the States must be governed by a single, neutral
principle. It is far too late to exhume what Justice Bren
nan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as “the
notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the
States only a watered-down, subjective version of the
individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.” Malloy,
supra, at 10–11 (internal quotation marks omitted).
