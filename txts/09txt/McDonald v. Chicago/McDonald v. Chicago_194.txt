BREYER, J., dissenting

why or how Chicago’s handgun ban is different.
The fact is that judges do not know the answers to the
kinds of empirically based questions that will often deter
mine the need for particular forms of gun regulation. Nor
do they have readily available “tools” for finding and
evaluating the technical material submitted by others.
District Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Os
borne, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21); see also
Turner Broadcasting, 520 U. S., at 195–196. Judges can
not easily make empirically based predictions; they have
no way to gather and evaluate the data required to see if
such predictions are accurate; and the nature of litigation
and concerns about stare decisis further make it difficult
for judges to change course if predictions prove inaccurate.
Nor can judges rely upon local community views and
values when reaching judgments in circumstances where
prediction is difficult because the basic facts are unclear or
unknown.
At the same time, there is no institutional need to send
judges off on this “mission-almost-impossible.” Legislators
are able to “amass the stuff of actual experience and cull
conclusions from it.” United States v. Gainey, 380 U. S.
63, 67 (1965). They are far better suited than judges to
uncover facts and to understand their relevance. And
legislators, unlike Article III judges, can be held democ
ratically responsible for their empirically based and value
laden conclusions. We have thus repeatedly affirmed our
preference for “legislative not judicial solutions” to this
kind of problem, see, e.g., Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,
457 U. S. 496, 513 (1982), just as we have repeatedly
affirmed the Constitution’s preference for democratic
solutions legislated by those whom the people elect.
In New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 310–
311 (1932), Justice Brandeis stated in dissent:
