MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

to the four States that had adopted Second Amendment
analogues before ratification, nine more States adopted
state constitutional provisions protecting an individual
right to keep and bear arms between 1789 and 1820.
Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 27–30). Founding-era
legal commentators confirmed the importance of the right
to early Americans. St. George Tucker, for example, de
scribed the right to keep and bear arms as “the true palla
dium of liberty” and explained that prohibitions on the
right would place liberty “on the brink of destruction.” 1

ed. 1803); see also W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of

the inclusion of the Second Amendment in the Bill of
Rights—the fear that the National Government would
disarm the universal militia—had largely faded as a popu
lar concern, but the right to keep and bear arms was
highly valued for purposes of self-defense. See M. Doub
ler, Civilian in Peace, Soldier in War 87–90 (2003); Amar,
Bill of Rights 258–259. Abolitionist authors wrote in
support of the right. See L. Spooner, The Unconstitution
ality of Slavery 66 (1860) (reprint 1965); J. Tiffany, A
