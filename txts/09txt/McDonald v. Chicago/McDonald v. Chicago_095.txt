Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Article IV, §2. Id., at 2765. Although he did not catalogue
the precise “nature” or “extent” of those rights, he thought
“Corfield v. Coryell” provided a useful description. How
ard then submitted that
“[t]o these privileges and immunities, whatever they
may be— . . . should be added the personal rights gua
rantied and secured by the first eight amendments of
the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and of
the press; the right of the people peaceably to assem
ble and petition the Government for a redress of
grievances, [and] . . . the right to keep and to bear
arms.” Ibid. (emphasis added).
News of Howard’s speech was carried in major newspa
pers across the country, including the New York Herald,
see N. Y. Herald, May 24, 1866, p. 1, which was the best
selling paper in the Nation at that time, see A. Amar, The
Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 187 (1998)
(hereinafter Amar).13 The New York Times carried the
speech as well, reprinting a lengthy excerpt of Howard’s
remarks, including the statements quoted above. N. Y.
Times, May 24, 1866, p. 1. The following day’s Times
editorialized on Howard’s speech, predicting that “[t]o this,
the first section of the amendment, the Union party
throughout the country will yield a ready acquiescence,
and the South could offer no justifiable resistance,” sug
gesting that Bingham’s narrower second draft had not
been met with the same objections that Hale had raised
against the first. N. Y. Times, May 25, 1866, p. 4.
