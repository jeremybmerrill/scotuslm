STEVENS, J., dissenting

ment. And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been
understood by the Court to have “incorporated” the entire
Bill of Rights. There was nothing foreordained about
today’s outcome.
Although the Court’s decision in this case might be seen
as a mere adjunct to its decision in Heller, the conse­
quences could prove far more destructive—quite liter­
ally—to our Nation’s communities and to our constitu­
tional structure. Thankfully, the Second Amendment
right identified in Heller and its newly minted Fourteenth
Amendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the
home. But neither the “assurances” provided by the plu­
rality, ante, at 40, nor the many historical sources cited in
its opinion should obscure the reality that today’s ruling
marks a dramatic change in our law—or that the Justices
who have joined it have brought to bear an awesome
amount of discretion in resolving the legal question pre­
sented by this case.
I would proceed more cautiously. For the reasons set
out at length above, I cannot accept either the methodol­
ogy the Court employs or the conclusions it draws. Al­
though impressively argued, the majority’s decision to
overturn more than a century of Supreme Court precedent
and to unsettle a much longer tradition of state practice is
not, in my judgment, built “upon respect for the teachings
of history, solid recognition of the basic values that under­
lie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles
that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers
have played in establishing and preserving American
freedoms.” Griswold, 381 U. S., at 501 (Harlan, J., con­
curring in judgment).
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
