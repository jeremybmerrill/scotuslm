MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Slave Revolts 268–270 (1983). The plan was foiled, lead
ing to the swift arrest of 130 blacks, and the execution of
37, including Vesey. Id., at 271. Still, slaveowners took
notice—it was reportedly feared that as many as 6,600 to
9,000 slaves and free blacks were involved in the plot. Id.,
at 272. A few years later, the fear of rebellion was real
ized. An uprising led by Nat Turner took the lives of at
least 57 whites before it was suppressed. Id., at 300–302.
The fear generated by these and other rebellions led
Southern legislatures to take particularly vicious aim at
the rights of free blacks and slaves to speak or to keep and
bear arms for their defense. Teaching slaves to read (even
the Bible) was a criminal offense punished severely in
some States. See K. Stampp, The Peculiar Institution:
Slavery in the Ante-bellum South 208, 211 (1956). Vir
ginia made it a crime for a member of an “abolition” soci
ety to enter the State and argue “that the owners of slaves
have no property in the same, or advocate or advise the
abolition of slavery.” 1835–1836 Va. Acts ch. 66, p. 44.
Other States prohibited the circulation of literature deny
ing a master’s right to property in his slaves and passed
laws requiring postmasters to inspect the mails in search
of such material. C. Eaton, The Freedom-of-Thought
Struggle in the Old South 118–143, 199–200 (1964).
Many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting
slaves from carrying firearms18 to apply the prohibition to
free blacks as well. See, e.g., Act of Dec. 23, 1833, §7, 1833
Ga. Acts pp. 226, 228 (declaring that “it shall not be lawful
for any free person of colour in this state, to own, use, or
carry fire arms of any description whatever”); H. Ap
——————
18 See, e.g., Black Code, ch. 33, §19, 1806 La. Acts pp. 160, 162 (pro
hibiting slaves from using firearms unless they were authorized by
their master to hunt within the boundaries of his plantation); Act of
Dec. 18, 1819, 1819 S. C. Acts pp. 29, 31 (same); An Act Concerning
Slaves, §6, 1840 Tex. Laws pp. 42–43 (making it unlawful for “any slave
to own firearms of any description”).
