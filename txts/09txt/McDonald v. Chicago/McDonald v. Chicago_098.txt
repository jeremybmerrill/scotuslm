MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

toward the conclusion that the Privileges or Immunities
Clause enforces at least those fundamental rights enu
merated in the Constitution against the States, including
the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
3
Interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment in the
period immediately following its ratification help to estab
lish the public understanding of the text at the time of its
adoption.
Some of these interpretations come from Members of
Congress. During an 1871 debate on a bill to enforce the
Fourteenth Amendment, Representative Henry Dawes
listed the Constitution’s first eight Amendments, includ
ing “the right to keep and bear arms,” before explaining
that after the Civil War, the country “gave the most grand
of all these rights, privileges, and immunities, by one
single amendment to the Constitution, to four millions of
American citizens” who formerly were slaves. Cong.
Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 475–476 (1871). “It is all
these,” Dawes explained, “which are comprehended in the
words ‘American citizen.’ ” Ibid.; see also id., at 334 (re
marks of Rep. Hoar) (stating that the Privileges or Immu
nities Clause referred to those rights “declared to belong to
the citizen by the Constitution itself”). Even opponents of
Fourteenth Amendment enforcement legislation acknowl
edged that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected
constitutionally enumerated individual rights. See 2
Cong. Rec. 384–385 (1874) (remarks of Rep. Mills) (oppos
ing enforcement law, but acknowledging, in referring to
the Bill of Rights, that “[t]hese first amendments and
some provisions of the Constitution of like import embrace
the ‘privileges and immunities’ of citizenship as set forth
in article 4, section 2 of the Constitution and in the four
teenth amendment” (emphasis added)); see Curtis 166–170
(collecting examples).
