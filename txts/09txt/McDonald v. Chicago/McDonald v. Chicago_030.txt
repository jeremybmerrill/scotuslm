MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

Doc. No. 70, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 233, 236 (1866) (de

Throughout the South, armed parties, often consisting
of ex-Confederate soldiers serving in the state militias,
forcibly took firearms from newly freed slaves. In the first
session of the 39th Congress, Senator Wilson told his
colleagues: “In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who
were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting
the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and
outrages upon them; and the same things are done in
other sections of the country.” 39th Cong. Globe 40 (1865).
The Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction—
which was widely reprinted in the press and distributed
by Members of the 39th Congress to their constituents
shortly after Congress approved the Fourteenth Amend
ment19—contained numerous examples of such abuses.

18 In South Carolina, prominent black citizens held a convention to
address the State’s black code. They drafted a memorial to Congress,
in which they included a plea for protection of their constitutional right
to keep and bear arms: “ ‘We ask that, inasmuch as the Constitution of
the United States explicitly declares that the right to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed . . . that the late efforts of the Legislature of
this State to pass an act to deprive us [of] arms be forbidden, as a plain
violation of the Constitution.’ ” S. Halbrook, Freedmen, The Fourteenth
Amendment, and The Right to Bear Arms, 1866–1876, p. 9 (1998)
(hereinafter Halbrook, Freedmen) (quoting 2 Proceedings of the Black
State Conventions, 1840–1865, p. 302 (P. Foner & G. Walker eds.
1980)). Senator Charles Sumner relayed the memorial to the Senate
and described the memorial as a request that black citizens “have the
constitutional protection in keeping arms.” 39th Cong. Globe 337.

Reconstruction 265–266 (1914); Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46,
