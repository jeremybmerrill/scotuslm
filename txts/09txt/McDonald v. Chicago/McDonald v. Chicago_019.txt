Opinion of the Court

the domain of the common law.” Twining, supra, at 113.
Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to
hold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to
meet the test for inclusion within the protection of the
Due Process Clause. The Court found that some such
rights qualified. See, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S.
652, 666 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); Near v.
Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931) (same);
Powell, supra (assistance of counsel in capital cases); De
Jonge, supra (freedom of assembly); Cantwell v. Con
necticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940) (free exercise of religion).
But others did not. See, e.g., Hurtado, supra (grand jury
indictment requirement); Twining, supra (privilege
against self-incrimination).
Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights
was held to fall within the conception of due process, the
protection or remedies afforded against state infringement
sometimes differed from the protection or remedies pro
vided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To
give one example, in Betts the Court held that, although
the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of coun
sel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant
was unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause
required appointment of counsel in state criminal proceed
ings only where “want of counsel in [the] particular case
. . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental
fairness.” 316 U. S., at 473. Similarly, in Wolf v. Colo
rado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949), the Court held that the “core of
the Fourth Amendment” was implicit in the concept of
ordered liberty and thus “enforceable against the States
through the Due Process Clause” but that the exclusionary
rule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the
States. Id., at 27–28, 33.
