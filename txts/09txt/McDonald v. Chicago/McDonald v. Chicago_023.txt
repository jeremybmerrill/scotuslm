Opinion of the Court

tections remain unincorporated.13
Finally, the Court abandoned “the notion that the Four
teenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered
down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of
the Bill of Rights,” stating that it would be “incongruous”
to apply different standards “depending on whether the
claim was asserted in a state or federal court.” Malloy,
378 U. S., at 10–11 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Instead, the Court decisively held that incorporated Bill of
——————
U. S. 784 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S.
1 (1964) (privilege against self-incrimination); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co.
v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897) (Just Compensation Clause).
With respect to the Sixth Amendment, see Duncan v. Louisiana, 391
U. S. 145 (1968) (trial by jury in criminal cases); Washington v. Texas,
388 U. S. 14 (1967) (compulsory process); Klopfer v. North Carolina,
386 U. S. 213 (1967) (speedy trial); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400
(1965) (right to confront adverse witness); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372
U. S. 335 (1963) (assistance of counsel); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257
(1948) (right to a public trial).
With respect to the Eighth Amendment, see Robinson v. California,
370 U. S. 660 (1962) (cruel and unusual punishment); Schilb v. Kuebel,
404 U. S. 357 (1971) (prohibition against excessive bail).
13 In addition to the right to keep and bear arms (and the Sixth
Amendment right to a unanimous jury verdict, see n. 14, infra), the
only rights not fully incorporated are (1) the Third Amendment’s
protection against quartering of soldiers; (2) the Fifth Amendment’s
grand jury indictment requirement; (3) the Seventh Amendment right
to a jury trial in civil cases; and (4) the Eighth Amendment’s prohibi
tion on excessive fines.
We never have decided whether the Third Amendment or the Eighth
Amendment’s prohibition of excessive fines applies to the States
through the Due Process Clause. See Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,
Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 276, n. 22 (1989) (declining to
decide whether the excessive-fines protection applies to the States); see
also Engblom v. Carey, 677 F. 2d 957, 961 (CA2 1982) (holding as a
matter of first impression that the “Third Amendment is incorporated
into the Fourteenth Amendment for application to the states”).
Our governing decisions regarding the Grand Jury Clause of the
Fifth Amendment and the Seventh Amendment’s civil jury requirement
long predate the era of selective incorporation.
