MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

ing to all the citizens in every State all the privileges and
immunities of citizens, and to all the people all the sacred
rights of person.” 39th Cong. Globe 1089–1090 (1866).
Bingham emphasized that §1 was designed “to arm the
Congress of the United States, by the consent of the people
of the United States, with the power to enforce the bill of
rights as it stands in the Constitution today. It ‘hath that
extent—no more.’ ” Id., at 1088.
Bingham’s speech was printed in pamphlet form and
broadly distributed in 1866 under the title, “One Country,
One Constitution, and One People,” and the subtitle, “In
Support of the Proposed Amendment to Enforce the Bill of
Rights.”10 Newspapers also reported his proposal, with
the New York Times providing particularly extensive
coverage, including a full reproduction of Bingham’s first
draft of §1 and his remarks that a constitutional amend
ment to “enforc[e]” the “immortal bill of rights” was “abso
lutely essential to American nationality.” N. Y. Times,
Feb. 27, 1866, p. 8.
Bingham’s first draft of §1 was different from the ver
sion ultimately adopted. Of particular importance, the
first draft granted Congress the “power to make all laws
. . . necessary and proper to secure” the “citizens of each
State all privileges and immunities of citizens in the sev
eral States,” rather than restricting state power to
“abridge” the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States.11 39th Cong. Globe 1088.
