MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Union. See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 6, 30
(1865) (hereinafter 39th Cong. Globe); M. Curtis, No State
Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of
Rights 57 (1986) (hereinafter Curtis). That Committee
would ultimately recommend the adoption of the Four
teenth Amendment, justifying its recommendation by
submitting a report to Congress that extensively cata
logued the abuses of civil rights in the former slave States
and argued that “adequate security for future peace and
safety . . . can only be found in such changes of the organic
law as shall determine the civil rights and privileges of all
citizens in all parts of the republic.” See Report of the
Joint Committee on Reconstruction, S. Rep. No. 112, 39th
Cong., 1st Sess., p. 15 (1866); H. R. Rep. No. 30, 39th
Cong., 1st Sess., p. XXI (1866).
As the Court notes, the Committee’s Report “was widely
reprinted in the press and distributed by members of the
39th Congress to their constituents.” Ante, at 24; B.
Kendrick, Journal of the Joint Committee of Fifteen on
Reconstruction 264–265 (1914) (noting that 150,000 copies
of the Report were printed and that it was widely distrib
uted as a campaign document in the election of 1866). In
addition, newspaper coverage suggests that the wider
public was aware of the Committee’s work even before the
Report was issued. For example, the Fort Wayne Daily
Democrat (which appears to have been unsupportive of the
Committee’s work) paraphrased a motion instructing the
Committee to
“enquire into [the] expediency of amending the Con
stitution of the United States so as to declare with
greater certainty the power of Congress to enforce and
determine by appropriate legislation all the guaran
tees contained in that instrument.” The Nigger Con
gress!, Fort Wayne Daily Democrat, Feb. 1, 1866, p. 4
(emphasis added).
