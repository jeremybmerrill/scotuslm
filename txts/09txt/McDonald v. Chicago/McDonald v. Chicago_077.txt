companies in which they agreed “ ‘to fully merge and
consolidate the[ir] capital stock, powers, privileges, immu

483–484 (1866) (concluding that a statute did not “modify
any power, privileges, or immunity, pertaining to the
franchise of any corporation”). The nature of a privilege or
immunity thus varied depending on the person, group, or

“Privileges and Immunities” as an Antebellum Term of
Art, 98 Geo. L. J. 1241, 1256–1257 (2010) (surveying

citizenship.
This tradition begins with our country’s English roots.
Parliament declared the basic liberties of English citizens
in a series of documents ranging from the Magna Carta to
the Petition of Right and the English Bill of Rights. See 1
B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History
8−16, 19−21, 41−46 (1971) (hereinafter Schwartz). These
fundamental rights, according to the English tradition,
belonged to all people but became legally enforceable only
when recognized in legal texts, including acts of Parlia
ment and the decisions of common-law judges. See B.
Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolu
tion 77−79 (1967). These rights included many that later
