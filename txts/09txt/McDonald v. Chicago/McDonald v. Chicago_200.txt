BREYER, J., dissenting

sufficient historical support for the majority’s conclusion
that that right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history
and tradition.” Instead, I find no more than ambiguity
and uncertainty that perhaps even expert historians
would find difficult to penetrate. And a historical record
that is so ambiguous cannot itself provide an adequate
basis for incorporating a private right of self-defense and
applying it against the States.
The Eighteenth Century
The opinions in Heller collect much of the relevant 18th
century evidence. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5–32);
id., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5–31); id.,
at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4–7). In respect
to the relevant question—the “deeply rooted nature” of a
right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self
defense—that evidence is inconclusive, particularly when
augmented as follows:
First, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and JUSTICE STEVENS argued in dissent, the history discussed in
Heller shows that the Second Amendment was enacted
primarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related
rights. See supra, at 4; Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5–
31). Many of the scholars and historians who have written
on the subject apparently agree. See supra, at 2–5.
Second, historians now tell us that the right to which
Blackstone referred, an important link in the Heller ma
jority’s historical argument, concerned the right of Par
liament (representing the people) to form a militia to
oppose a tyrant (the King) threatening to deprive the
people of their traditional liberties (which did not include
an unregulated right to possess guns). Thus, 18th-century
language referring to a “right to keep and bear arms” does
not ipso facto refer to a private right of self-defense—
certainly not unambiguously so. See English Historians’
Brief 3–27; see also supra, at 2–5.
