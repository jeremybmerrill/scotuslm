others as well. Millions of Americans have answered this
question in the affirmative, not infrequently because they
believe they have an inalienable right to do so—because
they consider it an aspect of “the supreme human dignity
of being master of one’s fate rather than a ward of the
State,” Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U. S. 164, 186 (2008)
(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Many such decisions have been
based, in part, on family traditions and deeply held beliefs
that are an aspect of individual autonomy the government
may not control.29
Bolstering petitioners’ claim, our law has long recog­
nized that the home provides a kind of special sanctuary
in modern life. See, e.g., U. S. Const., Amdts. 3, 4; Law­

U. S. 573, 585–590 (1980); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S.

the privacy of the home, whether a humble cottage or a
magnificent manse. This veneration of the domestic hark­

nized a “right of habitation,” 4 Commentaries *223, and
opined that “every man’s house is looked upon by the law
to be his castle of defence and asylum,” 3 id., at *288.
Heller carried forward this legacy, observing that “the
need for defense of self, family, and property is most
acute” in one’s abode, and celebrating “the right of law­
abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of
hearth and home.” 554 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 56,
63).
While the individual’s interest in firearm possession is
thus heightened in the home, the State’s corresponding
interest in regulation is somewhat weaker. The State

statements of this view made by the distinguished actor, Charlton
