MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

As a whole, these well-circulated speeches indicate that
§1 was understood to enforce constitutionally declared
rights against the States, and they provide no suggestion
that any language in the section other than the Privileges
or Immunities Clause would accomplish that task.

When read against this backdrop, the civil rights legis
lation adopted by the 39th Congress in 1866 further sup
ports this view. Between passing the Thirteenth Amend
ment—which outlawed slavery alone—and the Fourteenth
Amendment, Congress passed two significant pieces of
legislation. The first was the Civil Rights Act of 1866,
which provided that “all persons born in the United
States” were “citizens of the United States” and that “such
citizens, of every race and color, . . . shall have the same
right” to, among other things, “full and equal benefit of all
laws and proceedings for the security of person and prop
erty, as is enjoyed by white citizens.” Ch. 31, §1, 14 Stat.
27.
Both proponents and opponents of this Act described it
as providing the “privileges” of citizenship to freedmen,
and defined those privileges to include constitutional
rights, such as the right to keep and bear arms. See 39th
Cong. Globe 474 (remarks of Sen. Trumbull) (stating that
the “the late slaveholding States” had enacted laws “de
priving persons of African descent of privileges which are
essential to freemen,” including “prohibit[ing] any negro or
mulatto from having fire-arms” and stating that “[t]he
purpose of the bill under consideration is to destroy all
these discriminations”); id., at 1266–1267 (remarks of Rep.
Raymond) (opposing the Act, but recognizing that to
“[m]ake a colored man a citizen of the United States”
would guarantee to him, inter alia, “a defined status . . . a
right to defend himself and his wife and children; a right
to bear arms”).
