MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Rights directly constrained only the Federal Government.
See Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet.
243 (1833). Although the enactment of the Fourteenth
Amendment profoundly altered our legal order, it “did not
unstitch the basic federalist pattern woven into our consti­
tutional fabric.” Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 133
(1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Nor, for that
matter, did it expressly alter the Bill of Rights. The Con­
stitution still envisions a system of divided sovereignty,
still “establishes a federal republic where local differences
are to be cherished as elements of liberty” in the vast run
of cases, National Rifle Assn. of Am. Inc. v. Chicago, 567
F. 3d 856, 860 (CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C. J.), still allo­
cates a general “police power . . . to the States and the
States alone,” United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 4) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judg­
ment). Elementary considerations of constitutional text
and structure suggest there may be legitimate reasons to
hold state governments to different standards than the
Federal Government in certain areas.11
It is true, as the Court emphasizes, ante, at 15–19, that
we have made numerous provisions of the Bill of Rights
fully applicable to the States. It is settled, for instance,
that the Governor of Alabama has no more power than the
President of the United States to authorize unreasonable
searches and seizures. Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23
(1963). But we have never accepted a “total incorporation”
theory of the Fourteenth Amendment, whereby the
Amendment is deemed to subsume the provisions of the
Bill of Rights en masse. See ante, at 15. And we have
declined to apply several provisions to the States in any

can hardly improve upon the many passionate defenses of this
position that Justice Harlan penned during his tenure on the Court.
See Williams, 399 U. S., at 131, n. 14 (opinion concurring in result)
(cataloguing opinions).
