quotation marks omitted). I certainly agree with that
requirement, see Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993),
though some cases JUSTICE STEVENS approves have not
applied it seriously, see, e.g., Lawrence, supra, at 562
(“The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its
spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions”). But if
the “careful description” requirement is used in the man­
ner we have hitherto employed, then the enterprise of
determining the Due Process Clause’s “conceptual core,”
post, at 23, is a waste of time. In the cases he cites we
sought a careful, specific description of the right at issue
in order to determine whether that right, thus narrowly
defined, was fundamental. See, e.g., Glucksberg, 521
U. S., at 722–728; Reno, supra, at 302–306; Collins v.
Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125–129 (1992); Cruzan v.
Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 269–279
(1990); see also Vacco v. Quill, 521 U. S. 793, 801–808
(1997). The threshold step of defining the asserted right
with precision is entirely unnecessary, however, if (as
JUSTICE STEVENS maintains) the “conceptual core” of the
“liberty clause,” post, at 23, includes a number of capa­
cious, hazily defined categories. There is no need to define
the right with much precision in order to conclude that it
pertains to the plaintiff’s “ability independently to define
[his] identity,” his “right to make certain unusually impor­
tant decisions that will affect his own, or his family’s,
destiny,” or some aspect of his “[s]elf-determination, bodily
integrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships,
political equality, dignity [or] respect.” Ibid. (internal
quotation marks omitted). JUSTICE STEVENS must there­
fore have in mind some other use for the careful­
description requirement—perhaps just as a means of
ensuring that courts “procee[d] slowly and incrementally,”
post, at 25. But that could be achieved just as well by
