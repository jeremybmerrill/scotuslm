MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

on the Constitutional Limitations Which Rest Upon the
Legislative Power of the State of the American Union 15–
16, and n. 3 (1868) (reprint 1972) (describing Article IV,
§2 as designed “to prevent discrimination by the several
States against the citizens and public proceedings of other
States”); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 35
(11th ed. 1867) (stating that Article IV, §2 entitles sojourn
ing citizens “to the privileges that persons of the same
description are entitled to in the state to which the re
moval is made, and to none other”). This Court adopted
the same conclusion in a unanimous opinion just one year
after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. See Paul
v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180 (1869).

The text examined so far demonstrates three points
about the meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause
in §1. First, “privileges” and “immunities” were synonyms
for “rights.” Second, both the States and the Federal
Government had long recognized the inalienable rights of
their citizens. Third, Article IV, §2 of the Constitution
protected traveling citizens against state discrimination
with respect to the fundamental rights of state citizenship.
Two questions still remain, both provoked by the textual
similarity between §1’s Privileges or Immunities Clause
and Article IV, §2. The first involves the nature of the
rights at stake: Are the privileges or immunities of “citi
zens of the United States” recognized by §1 the same as
the privileges and immunities of “citizens in the several
States” to which Article IV, §2 refers? The second involves
the restriction imposed on the States: Does §1, like Article
IV, §2, prohibit only discrimination with respect to certain
rights if the State chooses to recognize them, or does it
require States to recognize those rights? I address each
question in turn.
