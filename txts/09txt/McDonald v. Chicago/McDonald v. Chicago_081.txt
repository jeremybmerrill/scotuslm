Opinion of THOMAS, J.

generation generally did not consider many of the rights
identified in these amendments as new entitlements, but
as inalienable rights of all men, given legal effect by their
codification in the Constitution’s text. See, e.g., 1 Annals
of Cong. 431−432, 436–437, 440–442 (1834) (statement of
Rep. Madison) (proposing Bill of Rights in the first Con
gress); The Federalist No. 84, pp. 531−533 (B. Wright ed.
1961) (A. Hamilton); see also Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 19) (“[I]t has always been widely understood that

codification of these rights in the Bill made them legally
enforceable only against the Federal Government, not the
States. See 7 Pet., at 247.

leges or Immunities Clause, and it can be assumed that
the public’s understanding of the latter was informed by
its understanding of the former.
Article IV, §2 was derived from a similar clause in the
Articles of Confederation, and reflects the dual citizenship
the Constitution provided to all Americans after replacing
that “league” of separate sovereign States. Gibbons v.
Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 187 (1824); see 3 J. Story, Commentar
ies on the Constitution of the United States §1800, p. 675
(1833). By virtue of a person’s citizenship in a particular
State, he was guaranteed whatever rights and liberties
that State’s constitution and laws made available. Article
IV, §2 vested citizens of each State with an additional
