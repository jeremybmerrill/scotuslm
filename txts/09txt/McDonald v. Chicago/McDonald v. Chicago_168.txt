MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

ills associated with dangerous weapons goes to the very
core of the States’ police powers. Our precedent is crystal­
clear on this latter point. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon,
546 U. S. 243, 270 (2006) (“[T]he structure and limitations
of federalism . . . allow the States great latitude under
their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the
lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons”
(internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v.
Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000) (“[W]e can think of no
better example of the police power, which the Founders
denied the National Government and reposed in the
States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindica­
tion of its victims”); Kelley v. Johnson, 425 U. S. 238, 247
(1976) (“The promotion of safety of persons and property is
unquestionably at the core of the State’s police power”);
Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Employment Relations
Bd., 351 U. S. 266, 274 (1956) (“The dominant interest of
the State in preventing violence and property damage
cannot be questioned. It is a matter of genuine local con­
cern”). Compared with today’s ruling, most if not all of
this Court’s decisions requiring the States to comply with
other provisions in the Bill of Rights did not exact nearly

Const., Art. 1, §4, cl. 1; §8, cls. 3, 5, 14; §9, cl. 6; Art. 3, §2, cl. 2; Art. 4,
§2, cl. 3; §3, cl. 2 (using “regulate” or “Regulation” in manner suggestive
of broad, discretionary governmental authority); Art. 1, §8, cl. 16
(invoking powers of “disciplining” and “training” Militia in manner
suggestive of narrower authority); Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
6–7) (investigating Constitution’s separate references to “people” as
clue to term’s meaning in Second Amendment); cf. Cornell & DeDino, A
Well Regulated Right: The Early American Origins of Gun Control, 73
Fordham L. Rev. 487, 504 (2004) (“The authors of this curious interpre­
tation of the Second Amendment have constructed a fantasy world
where words mean their opposite, and regulation is really anti­
regulation”). But even if the assertion were correct, the point would
remain that the preamble envisions an active state role in overseeing
how the right to keep and bear arms is utilized, and in ensuring that it
is channeled toward productive ends.
