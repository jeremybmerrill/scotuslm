treacherous ground on which to build decisions written by
judges who are not expert at history.
Since Heller, historians, scholars, and judges have con
tinued to express the view that the Court’s historical
account was flawed. See, e.g., Konig, Why the Second

Finkelman, It Really Was About a Well Regulated Militia,
