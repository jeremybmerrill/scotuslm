MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

would be set forth in our Federal Bill of Rights, such as
the right to petition for redress of grievances, the right to
a jury trial, and the right of “Protestants” to “have arms
for their defence.” English Bill of Rights (1689), reprinted
in 1 Schwartz 41, 43.
As English subjects, the colonists considered themselves
to be vested with the same fundamental rights as other
Englishmen. They consistently claimed the rights of
English citizenship in their founding documents, repeat
edly referring to these rights as “privileges” and “immuni
ties.” For example, a Maryland law provided that
“[A]ll the Inhabitants of this Province being Chris
tians (Slaves excepted) Shall have and enjoy all such
rights liberties immunities priviledges and free cus
toms within this Province as any naturall born subject
of England hath or ought to have or enjoy in the
Realm of England . . . .” Md. Act for the Liberties of
the People (1639), in id., at 68 (emphasis added).3
