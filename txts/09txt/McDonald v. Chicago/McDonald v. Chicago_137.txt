suitable for substantive due process protection. Id., at
327, 325. Implicit in Justice Cardozo’s test is a recognition
that the postulates of liberty have a universal character.
Liberty claims that are inseparable from the customs that
prevail in a certain region, the idiosyncratic expectations
of a certain group, or the personal preferences of their

critical variables. They can provide evidence about which
rights really are vital to ordered liberty, as well as a spur
to judicial action.
The Court errs both in its interpretation of Palko and in
its suggestion that later cases rendered Palko’s methodol­
ogy defunct. Echoing Duncan, the Court advises that
Justice Cardozo’s test will not be satisfied “ ‘if a civilized
system could be imagined that would not accord the par­
