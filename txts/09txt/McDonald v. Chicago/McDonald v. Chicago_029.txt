Opinion of the Court

made to disarm “Free-Soilers” in “Bloody Kansas,” Senator
Charles Sumner, who later played a leading role in the
adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, proclaimed that
“[n]ever was [the rifle] more needed in just self-defense
than now in Kansas.” The Crime Against Kansas: The
Apologies for the Crime: The True Remedy, Speech of Hon.
Charles Sumner in the Senate of the United States 64–65
(1856). Indeed, the 1856 Republican Party Platform pro
tested that in Kansas the constitutional rights of the
people had been “fraudulently and violently taken from
them” and the “right of the people to keep and bear arms”
had been “infringed.” National Party Platforms 1840–
1972, p. 27 (5th ed. 1973).17
After the Civil War, many of the over 180,000 African
Americans who served in the Union Army returned to the
States of the old Confederacy, where systematic efforts
were made to disarm them and other blacks. See Heller,
554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 42); E. Foner, Reconstruction:
America’s Unfinished Revolution 1863–1877, p. 8 (1988)
(hereinafter Foner). The laws of some States formally
prohibited African Americans from possessing firearms.
For example, a Mississippi law provided that “no freed
man, free negro or mulatto, not in the military service of
the United States government, and not licensed so to do by
the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry
fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie
knife.” Certain Offenses of Freedmen, 1865 Miss. Laws
p. 165, §1, in 1 Documentary History of Reconstruction
289 (W. Fleming ed. 1950); see also Regulations for
Freedmen in Louisiana, in id., at 279–280; H. R. Exec.

17 Abolitionists and Republicans were not alone in believing that the
right to keep and bear arms was a fundamental right. The 1864
Democratic Party Platform complained that the confiscation of firearms
by Union troops occupying parts of the South constituted “the interfer
ence with and denial of the right of the people to bear arms in their
defense.” National Party Platforms 1840–1972, at 34.
