MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

tal.” To that end, many States now provide state constitu
tional protection for an individual’s right to keep and bear
arms. See Volokh, State Constitutional Rights to Keep
and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 191, 205 (2006)
(identifying over 40 States). In determining the impor
tance of this fact, we should keep the following considera
tions in mind:
First, by the end of the 20th century, in every State and
many local communities, highly detailed and complicated
regulatory schemes governed (and continue to govern)
nearly every aspect of firearm ownership: Who may sell
guns and how they must be sold; who may purchase guns
and what type of guns may be purchased; how firearms
must be stored and where they may be used; and so on.
See generally Legal Community Against Violence, Regu
lating Guns In America (2008), available at http://
www.lcav.org/publications-briefs/regulating_guns. asp (all
Internet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available
in Clerk of Court’s case file) (detailing various arms regu
lations in every State).
Of particular relevance here, some municipalities ban
handguns, even in States that constitutionally protect the
right to bear arms. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code, §8–
20–050(c) (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, §§27–2–
1, 27–1–1 (1995); Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code, ch. 549.25
(2010). Moreover, at least seven States and Puerto Rico
ban assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons. See Cal.
Penal Code Ann. §12280(b) (West Supp. 2009); Conn. Gen.
Stat. Ann. §53–202c (2007); Haw. Rev. Stat. §134–8
(1993); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–303(a) (Lexis 2002);
Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 140, §131M (West 2006); N. J. Stat.
Ann. §2C:39-5 (West Supp. 2010); N. Y. Penal Law Ann.
§265.02(7) (West Supp. 2008); 25 Laws P. R. Ann. §456m
(Supp. 2006); see also 18 U. S. C. §922(o) (federal ma
chinegun ban).
Thirteen municipalities do the same. See Albany, N. Y.,
