Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Legislation passed in furtherance of the Fourteenth
Amendment demonstrates even more clearly this under
standing. For example, Congress enacted the Civil Rights
Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, which was titled in pertinent part
“An Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,” and
which is codified in the still-existing 42 U. S. C. §1983.
That statute prohibits state officials from depriving citi
zens of “any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by
the Constitution.” Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983 (em
phasis added). Although the Judiciary ignored this provi
sion for decades after its enactment, this Court has come
to interpret the statute, unremarkably in light of its text,
as protecting constitutionally enumerated rights. Monroe
v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 171 (1961).
A Federal Court of Appeals decision written by a future
Justice of this Court adopted the same understanding of
the Privileges or Immunities Clause. See, e.g., United
States v. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 79, 82 (No. 15,282) (CC SD Ala.
1871) (Woods, J.) (“We think, therefore, that the . . . rights
enumerated in the first eight articles of amendment to the
constitution of the United States, are the privileges and
immunities of citizens of the United States”). In addition,
two of the era’s major constitutional treatises reflected the
understanding that §1 would protect constitutionally
enumerated rights from state abridgment.14 A third such
treatise unambiguously indicates that the Privileges or

United States 155–156 (E. Bennett ed. 1886) (describing §1, which the
country was then still considering, as a “needed” “remedy” for Barron ex
rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), which held that
the Bill of Rights was not enforceable against the States); T. Farrar,
Manual of the Constitution of the United States of America 58–59,
145−146, 395–397 (1867) (reprint 1993); id., at 546 (3d ed. 1872)
(describing the Fourteenth Amendment as having “swept away” the
“decisions of many courts” that “the popular rights guaranteed by the
Constitution are secured only against [the federal] government”).
