BREYER, J., dissenting

(strong enough to strike down a handgun ban) is “deeply
rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”

In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amend
ment in order to protect a private right of armed self
defense. There has been, and is, no consensus that the
right is, or was, “fundamental.” No broader constitutional
interest or principle supports legal treatment of that right
as fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional
concerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against
that treatment.
Moreover, nothing in 18th-, 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century
history shows a consensus that the right to private armed
self-defense, as described in Heller, is “deeply rooted in
this Nation’s history or tradition” or is otherwise “funda
mental.” Indeed, incorporating the right recognized in
Heller may change the law in many of the 50 States. Read
in the majority’s favor, the historical evidence is at most
ambiguous. And, in the absence of any other support for
its conclusion, ambiguous history cannot show that the
Fourteenth Amendment incorporates a private right of
self-defense against the States.
With respect, I dissent.
