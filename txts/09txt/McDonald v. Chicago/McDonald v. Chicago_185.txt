MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

historical approach).

A

In my view, taking Heller as a given, the Fourteenth
Amendment does not incorporate the Second Amendment
right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self
defense. Under this Court’s precedents, to incorporate the
private self-defense right the majority must show that the
right is, e.g., “fundamental to the American scheme of
justice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968);
see ibid., n. 14; see also ante, at 44 (plurality opinion)
(finding that the right is “fundamental” and therefore
incorporated). And this it fails to do.
The majority here, like that in Heller, relies almost
exclusively upon history to make the necessary showing.
Ante, at 20–33. But to do so for incorporation purposes is
both wrong and dangerous. As JUSTICE STEVENS points
out, our society has historically made mistakes—for ex
ample, when considering certain 18th- and 19th-century
property rights to be fundamental. Ante, at 19 (dissenting
opinion). And in the incorporation context, as elsewhere,
history often is unclear about the answers. See Part I,
supra; Part III, infra.
Accordingly, this Court, in considering an incorporation
question, has never stated that the historical status of a
right is the only relevant consideration. Rather, the Court
has either explicitly or implicitly made clear in its opin
ions that the right in question has remained fundamental
over time. See, e.g., Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404, 410
(1972) (plurality opinion) (stating that the incorporation
“inquiry must focus upon the function served” by the right
in question in “contemporary society” (emphasis added));
Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 154 (1968) (noting
that the right in question “continues to receive strong
support”); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226
