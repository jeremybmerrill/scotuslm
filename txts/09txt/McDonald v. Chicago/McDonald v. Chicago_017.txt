Opinion of the Court

Indeed, Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding
that other rights that were at issue in that case are bind
ing on the States through the Due Process Clause. In
Cruikshank, the Court held that the general “right of the
people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,” which
is protected by the First Amendment, applied only against
the Federal Government and not against the States. See
92 U. S., at 551–552. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the
Court held that the right of peaceful assembly was a “fun
damental righ[t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.” De Jonge v. Oregon, 299
U. S. 353, 364 (1937). We follow the same path here and
thus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms
applies to the States under the Due Process Clause.

In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider
whether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from
infringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See Hurtado
v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (due process does not
require grand jury indictment); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v.
Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897) (due process prohibits
States from taking of private property for public use with
out just compensation). Five features of the approach
taken during the ensuing era should be noted.
First, the Court viewed the due process question as
entirely separate from the question whether a right was a
privilege or immunity of national citizenship. See Twin
ing v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99 (1908).
Second, the Court explained that the only rights pro
tected against state infringement by the Due Process
Clause were those rights “of such a nature that they are
included in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid.

Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942); Palko v. Connecticut,
