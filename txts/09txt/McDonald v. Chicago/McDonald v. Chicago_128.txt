MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

preserve private autonomy,”6 a notion which predates the
founding and which finds reinforcement in the Constitu­
tion’s Ninth Amendment, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U. S. 479, 486–493 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring).7 The
Due Process Clause cannot claim to be the source of our
basic freedoms—no legal document ever could, see
Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 230 (1976) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting)—but it stands as one of their foundational
guarantors in our law.
If text and history are inconclusive on this point, our
precedent leaves no doubt: It has been “settled” for well
over a century that the Due Process Clause “applies to
matters of substantive law as well as to matters of proce­
dure.” Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 373 (1927)
(Brandeis, J., concurring). Time and again, we have rec­
ognized that in the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the
Fifth, the “Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair
process, and the ‘liberty’ it protects includes more than the
absence of physical restraint.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at
719. “The Clause also includes a substantive component
that ‘provides heightened protection against government
interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty
interests.’ ” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U. S. 57, 65 (2000)
(opinion of O’Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and
GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ.) (quoting Glucksberg, 521
U. S., at 720). Some of our most enduring precedents,
accepted today by virtually everyone, were substantive
due process decisions. See, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388
U. S. 1, 12 (1967) (recognizing due-process- as well as
equal-protection-based right to marry person of another
race); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 499–500 (1954)

others retained by the people.”
