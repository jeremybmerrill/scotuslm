MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

federal judges—ultimately a majority of the judges on this
Court—with unprecedented lawmaking powers in an area
in which they have no special qualifications, and in which
the give-and-take of the political process has functioned
effectively for decades. Why this “intrudes much less upon

judicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have
outlined—an approach that investigates both the intrinsic
nature of the claimed interest and the practical signifi­

reasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate con­
straints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it,
and that is willing to protect some rights even if they have
not already received uniform protection from the elected
branches—has the capacity to improve, rather than
“[im]peril,” ante, at 15, our democracy. It all depends on
judges’ exercising careful, reasoned judgment. As it al­
ways has, and as it always will.

By its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the
States; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals
outside of the militia context. The Second Amendment
was adopted to protect the States from federal encroach­
