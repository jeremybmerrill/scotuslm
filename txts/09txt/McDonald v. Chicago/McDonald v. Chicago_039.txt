Opinion of the Court
Opinion of ALITO, J.

Fifth, the 39th Congress’ response to proposals to dis
band and disarm the Southern militias is instructive.
Despite recognizing and deploring the abuses of these
militias, the 39th Congress balked at a proposal to disarm
them. See 39th Cong. Globe 914; Halbrook, Freedmen,
supra, 20–21. Disarmament, it was argued, would violate
the members’ right to bear arms, and it was ultimately
decided to disband the militias but not to disarm their
members. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, §6, 14 Stat. 485, 487;
Halbrook, Freedmen 68–69; Cramer 858–861. It cannot
be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a
substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be
ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded
manner.

Municipal respondents’ remaining arguments are at war
with our central holding in Heller: that the Second
Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear
arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense
within the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us
to treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class
right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than
the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be
incorporated into the Due Process Clause.
Municipal respondents’ main argument is nothing less
than a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation prece
dent and return (presumably for this case only) to a by
gone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due
Process Clause protects only those rights “ ‘recognized by
all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and
universal sense of [their] justice.’ ” Brief for Municipal
Respondents 9 (quoting Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S.,
at 238). According to municipal respondents, if it is possi
ble to imagine any civilized legal system that does not
recognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause
