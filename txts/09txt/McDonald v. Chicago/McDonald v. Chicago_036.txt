MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

explicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms. See
Calabresi & Agudo, Individual Rights Under State Consti
tutions when the Fourteenth Amendment was Ratified in
1868: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American His
tory and Tradition? 87 Texas L. Rev. 7, 50 (2008).26 Quite
a few of these state constitutional guarantees, moreover,
explicitly protected the right to keep and bear arms as an
individual right to self-defense. See Ala. Const., Art. I,
§28 (1868); Conn. Const., Art. I, §17 (1818); Ky. Const.,
Art. XIII, §25 (1850); Mich. Const., Art. XVIII, §7 (1850);
Miss. Const., Art. I, §15 (1868); Mo. Const., Art. I, §8
(1865); Tex. Const., Art. I, §13 (1869); see also Mont.
Const., Art. III, §13 (1889); Wash. Const., Art. I, §24
(1889); Wyo. Const., Art. I, §24 (1889); see also State v.
McAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238 (Wyo. 1986). What is
more, state constitutions adopted during the Reconstruc
tion era by former Confederate States included a right to
keep and bear arms. See, e.g., Ark. Const., Art. I, §5
(1868); Miss. Const., Art. I, §15 (1868); Tex. Const., Art. I,
§13 (1869). A clear majority of the States in 1868, there
fore, recognized the right to keep and bear arms as being
among the foundational rights necessary to our system of
Government.27

generally worded provisions in the constitutions of seven
other States may also have encompassed a right to bear arms. See
Calabresi & Agudo, 87 Texas L. Rev., at 52.
27 These state constitutional protections often reflected a lack of law
enforcement in many sections of the country. In the frontier towns that
did not have an effective police force, law enforcement often could not
pursue criminals beyond the town borders. See Brief for Rocky Moun
tain Gun Owners et al. as Amici Curiae 15. Settlers in the West and
elsewhere, therefore, were left to “repe[l] force by force when the
intervention of society . . . [was] too late to prevent an injury.” District
of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___ , ___ (2008) (slip op., at 21) (inter
nal quotation marks omitted). The settlers’ dependence on game for
food and economic livelihood, moreover, undoubtedly undergirded these
state constitutional guarantees. See id., at ___, ___, ___ (slip. op, at 26,
