VI
The preceding sections have already addressed many of
the points made by JUSTICE SCALIA in his concurrence.
But in light of that opinion’s fixation on this one, it is
appropriate to say a few words about JUSTICE SCALIA’s
broader claim: that his preferred method of substantive
due process analysis, a method “that makes the traditions
of our people paramount,” ante, at 1, is both more re­
strained and more facilitative of democracy than the
method I have outlined. Colorful as it is, JUSTICE SCALIA’s
critique does not have nearly as much force as does his
rhetoric. His theory of substantive due process, moreover,
comes with its own profound difficulties.
Although JUSTICE SCALIA aspires to an “objective,”
“neutral” method of substantive due process analysis,
ante, at 10, his actual method is nothing of the sort. Un­
der the “historically focused” approach he advocates, ante,
at 13, numerous threshold questions arise before one ever
gets to the history. At what level of generality should one
frame the liberty interest in question? See n. 25, supra.
What does it mean for a right to be “ ‘deeply rooted in this
Nation’s history and tradition,’ ” ante, at 3 (quoting
Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721)? By what standard will
that proposition be tested? Which types of sources will
count, and how will those sources be weighed and aggre­
gated? There is no objective, neutral answer to these
questions. There is not even a theory—at least, JUSTICE
SCALIA provides none—of how to go about answering
them.
Nor is there any escaping Palko, it seems. To qualify for
substantive due process protection, JUSTICE SCALIA has
stated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply
