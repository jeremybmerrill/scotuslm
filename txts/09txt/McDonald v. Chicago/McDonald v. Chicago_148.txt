MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Diego L. Rev. 437, 446–448 (1985). This does not mean
that we must define the asserted right at the most specific
level, thereby sapping it of a universal valence and a
moral force it might otherwise have.25 It means, simply,
that we must pay close attention to the precise liberty
interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate.
Our holdings should be similarly tailored. Even if the
most expansive formulation of a claim does not qualify for
substantive due process recognition, particular compo­
nents of the claim might. Just because there may not be a
categorical right to physician-assisted suicide, for exam­
ple, does not “ ‘foreclose the possibility that an individual
plaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose
assistance was sought, could prevail in a more particular­
ized challenge.’ ” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 735, n. 24
(quoting id., at 750 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg­
ments)); see also Vacco v. Quill, 521 U. S. 793, 809, n. 13
(1997) (leaving open “ ‘the possibility that some applica­
tions of the [New York prohibition on assisted suicide]
may impose an intolerable intrusion on the patient’s free­
dom’ ”). Even if a State’s interest in regulating a certain
matter must be permitted, in the general course, to trump
the individual’s countervailing liberty interest, there may

25 The

notion that we should define liberty claims at the most specific
level available is one of JUSTICE SCALIA’s signal contributions to the
theory of substantive due process. See, e.g., Michael H. v. Gerald D.,
491 U. S. 110, 127–128, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of SCALIA, J.); ante, at 7
(opinion of SCALIA, J.). By so narrowing the asserted right, this ap­
proach “loads the dice” against its recognition, Roosevelt, Forget the
Fundamentals: Fixing Substantive Due Process, 8 U. Pa. J. Const. L.
983, 1002, n. 73 (2006): When one defines the liberty interest at issue in
Lawrence as the freedom to perform specific sex acts, ante, at 2, the
interest starts to look less compelling. The Court today does not follow
JUSTICE SCALIA’s “particularizing” method, Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384
U. S. 641, 649 (1966), as it relies on general historical references to
keeping and bearing arms, without any close study of the States’
practice of regulating especially dangerous weapons.
