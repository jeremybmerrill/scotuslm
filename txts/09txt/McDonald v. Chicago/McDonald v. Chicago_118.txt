MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Court’s substantive due process jurisprudence, which
illustrates the risks of granting judges broad discretion to
recognize individual constitutional rights in the absence of
textual or historical guideposts. But I see no reason to
assume that such hazards apply to the Privileges or Im
munities Clause. The mere fact that the Clause does not
expressly list the rights it protects does not render it
incapable of principled judicial application. The Constitu
tion contains many provisions that require an examination
of more than just constitutional text to determine whether
a particular act is within Congress’ power or is otherwise
prohibited. See, e.g., Art. I, §8, cl. 18 (Necessary and
Proper Clause); Amdt. 8 (Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause). When the inquiry focuses on what the ratifying
era understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to
mean, interpreting it should be no more “hazardous” than
interpreting these other constitutional provisions by using
the same approach. To be sure, interpreting the Privileges
or Immunities Clause may produce hard questions. But
they will have the advantage of being questions the Con
stitution asks us to answer. I believe those questions are
more worthy of this Court’s attention—and far more likely
to yield discernable answers—than the substantive due
process questions the Court has for years created on its
own, with neither textual nor historical support.
Finding these impediments to returning to the original
meaning overstated, I reject Slaughter-House insofar as it
precludes any overlap between the privileges and immuni
ties of state and federal citizenship. I next proceed to the
stare decisis considerations surrounding the precedent
that expressly controls the question presented here.

Three years after Slaughter-House, the Court in Cruik
shank squarely held that the right to keep and bear arms
was not a privilege of American citizenship, thereby over
