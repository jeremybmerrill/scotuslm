STEVENS, J., dissenting

III
At this point a difficult question arises. In considering
such a majestic term as “liberty” and applying it to present
circumstances, how are we to do justice to its urgent call
and its open texture—and to the grant of interpretive
discretion the latter embodies—without injecting excessive
subjectivity or unduly restricting the States’ “broad lati­
tude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems
of vital local concern,” Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 597
(1977)? One part of the answer, already discussed, is that
we must ground the analysis in historical experience and
reasoned judgment, and never on “merely personal and
private notions.” Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 170
(1952). Our precedents place a number of additional
constraints on the decisional process. Although “guide­
posts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered
area are scarce and open-ended,” Collins v. Harker
Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992), significant guideposts
do exist.23

people throughout our history have thought.” Ibid. Where we part
ways is in his view that courts should be guided only by historical
considerations.
There is, moreover, a tension between JUSTICE SCALIA’s concern that
“courts have the last word” on constitutional questions, ante, at 3, n. 2,
on the one hand, and his touting of the Constitution’s Article V amend­
ment process, ante, at 3, on the other. The American people can of
course reverse this Court’s rulings through that same process.
23 In assessing concerns about the “open-ended[ness]” of this area of
law, Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, one does well to keep in view the malle­
ability not only of the Court’s “deeply rooted”/fundamentality standard
but also of substantive due process’ constitutional cousin, “equal
protection” analysis. Substantive due process is sometimes accused of
entailing an insufficiently “restrained methodology.” Glucksberg, 521
U. S., at 721. Yet “the word ‘liberty’ in the Due Process Clause seems to
provide at least as much meaningful guidance as does the word ‘equal’
in the Equal Protection Clause.” Post, The Supreme Court 2002

and Law, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 94, n. 440 (2003). And “[i]f the objection
