SCALIA, J., concurring

assumptions they bring to their work, post, at 52–54, are
nothing compared to the differences among the American
people (though perhaps not among graduates of prestig­
ious law schools) with regard to the moral judgments
JUSTICE STEVENS would have courts pronounce. And
whether or not special expertise is needed to answer his­
torical questions, judges most certainly have no “compara­
tive . . . advantage,” post, at 24 (internal quotation marks
omitted), in resolving moral disputes. What is more, his
approach would not eliminate, but multiply, the hard
questions courts must confront, since he would not replace
history with moral philosophy, but would have courts
consider both.
And the Court’s approach intrudes less upon the democ­
ratic process because the rights it acknowledges are those
established by a constitutional history formed by democ­
ratic decisions; and the rights it fails to acknowledge are
left to be democratically adopted or rejected by the people,
with the assurance that their decision is not subject to
judicial revision. JUSTICE STEVENS’ approach, on the
other hand, deprives the people of that power, since what­
ever the Constitution and laws may say, the list of pro­
tected rights will be whatever courts wish it to be. After
all, he notes, the people have been wrong before, post, at
55, and courts may conclude they are wrong in the future.
JUSTICE STEVENS abhors a system in which “majorities or
powerful interest groups always get their way,” post, at 56,
but replaces it with a system in which unelected and life­
tenured judges always get their way. That such usurpa­
tion is effected unabashedly, see post, at 53—with “the
judge’s cards . . . laid on the table,” ibid.—makes it even
worse. In a vibrant democracy, usurpation should have to
be accomplished in the dark. It is JUSTICE STEVENS’ ap­
proach, not the Court’s, that puts democracy in peril.
