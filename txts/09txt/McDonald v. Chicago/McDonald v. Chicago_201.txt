MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

Third, scholarly articles indicate that firearms were
heavily regulated at the time of the framing—perhaps
more heavily regulated than the Court in Heller believed.
For example, one scholar writes that “[h]undreds of indi
vidual statutes regulated the possession and use of guns
in colonial and early national America.” Churchill, Gun
Regulation, the Police Power, and the Right to Keep Arms,
25 Law & Hist. Rev. 139, 143 (2007). Among these stat
utes was a ban on the private firing of weapons in Boston,
as well as comprehensive restrictions on similar conduct
in Philadelphia and New York. See Acts and Laws of
Massachusetts, p. 208 (1746); 5 J. Mitchell, & H. Flanders,
Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania From 1682 to 1801, pp.
108–109 (1898); 4 Colonial Laws of New York ch. 1233, p.
748 (1894); see also Churchill, supra, at 162–163 (discuss
ing bans on the shooting of guns in Pennsylvania and New
York).
Fourth, after the Constitution was adopted, several
States continued to regulate firearms possession by, for
example, adopting rules that would have prevented the
carrying of loaded firearms in the city, Heller, 554 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 5–7) (BREYER, J., dissenting); see also id.,
at ___ (slip op., at 59–60). Scholars have thus concluded
that the primary Revolutionary era limitation on a State’s
police power to regulate guns appears to be only that
regulations were “aimed at a legitimate public purpose”
and “consistent with reason.” Cornell, Early American
Gun Regulation and the Second Amendment, 25 Law &
Hist. Rev. 197, 198 (2007).
The Pre-Civil War Nineteenth Century
I would also augment the majority’s account of this
period as follows:
First, additional States began to regulate the discharge
of firearms in public places. See, e.g., Act of Feb. 17, 1831,
§6, reprinted in 3 Statutes of Ohio and the Northwestern
