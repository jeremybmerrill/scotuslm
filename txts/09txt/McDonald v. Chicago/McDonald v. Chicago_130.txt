MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Whether an asserted substantive due process interest is
explicitly named in one of the first eight Amendments to
the Constitution or is not mentioned, the underlying in­
quiry is the same: We must ask whether the interest is
“comprised within the term liberty.” Whitney, 274 U. S.,
at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring). As the second Justice
Harlan has shown, ever since the Court began considering
the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the States, “the
Court’s usual approach has been to ground the prohibi­
tions against state action squarely on due process, without
intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amend­
ments.” Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 24 (1964) (dissent­
ing opinion); see also Frankfurter, Memorandum on “In­
corporation” of the Bill of Rights into the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 78 Harv. L. Rev.
746, 747–750 (1965). In the pathmarking case of Gitlow v.
New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925), for example, both the
majority and dissent evaluated petitioner’s free speech
claim not under the First Amendment but as an aspect of
“the fundamental personal rights and ‘liberties’ protected
by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
from impairment by the States.”9

general principle of free speech, it seems to me, must be taken to be
included in the Fourteenth Amendment, in view of the scope that has
been given to the word ‘liberty’ as there used, although perhaps it may
be accepted with a somewhat larger latitude of interpretation than is
allowed to Congress by the sweeping language that governs or ought to
govern the laws of the United States”). Subsequent decisions repeat­
edly reaffirmed that persons hold free speech rights against the States
on account of the Fourteenth Amendment’s liberty clause, not the First
Amendment per se. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357
U. S. 449, 460, 466 (1958); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303
(1940); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 95, and n. 7 (1940); see also
McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 336, n. 1 (1995)
(“The term ‘liberty’ in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
makes the First Amendment applicable to the States”). Classic opin­
