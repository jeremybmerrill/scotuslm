MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humours,
which” can, at times, lead to “serious oppressions of the
minor part in the community”). Judges, he thought, may
find it easier to resist popular pressure to suppress the
basic rights of an unpopular minority. See United States
v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938).
That being so, it makes sense to ask whether that particu
lar comparative judicial advantage is relevant to the case
at hand. See, e.g., J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980).

How do these considerations apply here? For one thing,
I would apply them only to the private self-defense right
directly at issue. After all, the Amendment’s militia

States and the people from any serious threat of federal
tyranny. How are state militias additionally necessary?
It is difficult to see how a right that, as the majority con

possibly be so fundamental that it would warrant incorpo
ration through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ante, at 22.
Hence, the incorporation of the Second Amendment cannot
be based on the militia-related aspect of what Heller found
to be more extensive Second Amendment rights.
For another thing, as Heller concedes, the private self
defense right that the Court would incorporate has noth
ing to do with “the reason” the Framers “codified” the right
to keep and bear arms “in a written Constitution.” 554
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26) (emphasis added). Heller
immediately adds that the self-defense right was nonethe
less “the central component of the right.” Ibid. In my
