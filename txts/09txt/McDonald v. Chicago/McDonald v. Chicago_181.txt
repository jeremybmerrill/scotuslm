MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

vate self-defense purposes. Nor can I find any justification
for interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate
regulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from
democratically elected legislatures to courts or from the
States to the Federal Government. I therefore conclude
that the Fourteenth Amendment does not “incorporate”
the Second Amendment’s right “to keep and bear Arms.”

The Second Amendment says: “A well regulated Militia,
being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of
the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”
Two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S.

Court went on to hold that the Second Amendment re
stricted Congress’ power to regulate handguns used for
self-defense, and the Court found unconstitutional the
District of Columbia’s ban on the possession of handguns
in the home. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 64).
The Court based its conclusions almost exclusively upon
its reading of history. But the relevant history in Heller
was far from clear: Four dissenting Justices disagreed
with the majority’s historical analysis. And subsequent
scholarly writing reveals why disputed history provides
