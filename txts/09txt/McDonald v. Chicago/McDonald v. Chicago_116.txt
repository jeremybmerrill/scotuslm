MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

the Slaughter-House majority feared. Id., at 78. For one
thing, Corfield listed the “elective franchise” as one of the
privileges and immunities of “citizens of the several
states,” 6 F. Cas., at 552, yet Congress and the States still
found it necessary to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment—
which protects “[t]he right of citizens of the United States
to vote”—two years after the Fourteenth Amendment’s
passage. If the Privileges or Immunities Clause were
understood to protect every conceivable civil right from
state abridgment, the Fifteenth Amendment would have
been redundant.
The better view, in light of the States and Federal Gov
ernment’s shared history of recognizing certain inalienable
rights in their citizens, is that the privileges and immuni
ties of state and federal citizenship overlap. This is not to

citizenship are the same. At the time of the Fourteenth
Amendment’s ratification, States performed many more
functions than the Federal Government, and it is unlikely
that, simply by referring to “privileges or immunities,” the
Framers of §1 meant to transfer every right mentioned in
Corfield to congressional oversight. As discussed, “privi
leges” and “immunities” were understood only as syno
nyms for “rights.” See supra, at 9–11. It was their at
tachment to a particular group that gave them content,
and the text and history recounted here indicate that the
rights of United States citizens were not perfectly identi

Swayne, one of the dissenters in Slaughter-House, made
the point clear:
“The citizen of a State has the same fundamental
rights as a citizen of the United States, and also cer
tain others, local in their character, arising from his
relation to the State, and in addition, those which be
long to the citizen of the United States, he being in
