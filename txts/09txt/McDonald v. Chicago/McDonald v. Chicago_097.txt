Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Three months later, Congress passed the Freedmen’s
Bureau Act, which also entitled all citizens to the “full and
equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning per
sonal liberty” and “personal security.” Act of July 16,
1866, ch. 200, §14, 14 Stat. 176. The Act stated expressly
that the rights of personal liberty and security protected
by the Act “includ[ed] the constitutional right to bear
arms.” Ibid.

There is much else in the legislative record. Many
statements by Members of Congress corroborate the view
that the Privileges or Immunities Clause enforced consti
tutionally enumerated rights against the States. See
Curtis 112 (collecting examples). I am not aware of any
statement that directly refutes that proposition. That
said, the record of the debates—like most legislative his
tory—is less than crystal clear. In particular, much ambi
guity derives from the fact that at least several Members
described §1 as protecting the privileges and immunities
of citizens “in the several States,” harkening back to Arti
cle IV, §2. See supra, at 28–29 (describing Sen. Howard’s
speech). These statements can be read to support the view
that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects some or
all the fundamental rights of “citizens” described in Cor
field. They can also be read to support the view that the
Privileges or Immunities Clause, like Article IV, §2, pro
hibits only state discrimination with respect to those
rights it covers, but does not deprive States of the power to
deny those rights to all citizens equally.
I examine the rest of the historical record with this
understanding. But for purposes of discerning what the
public most likely thought the Privileges or Immunities
Clause to mean, it is significant that the most widely
publicized statements by the legislators who voted on §1—
Bingham, Howard, and even Hale—point unambiguously
