MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court
Opinion of ALITO, J.

C
As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that
Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners’
claims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue,
however, that we should overrule those decisions and hold
that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the “privi
leges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” In
petitioners’ view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause
protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as
well as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15–21,
but petitioners are unable to identify the Clause’s full
scope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6, 8–11. Nor is there any consen
sus on that question among the scholars who agree that
the Slaughter-House Cases’ interpretation is flawed. See
Saenz, supra, at 522, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).
We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here.
For many decades, the question of the rights protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement
has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that
Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities
Clause. We therefore decline to disturb the SlaughterHouse holding.
At the same time, however, this Court’s decisions in
Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from
considering whether the Due Process Clause of the Four
teenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right
binding on the States. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___, n. 23
(slip op., at 48, n. 23). None of those cases “engage[d] in
the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by
our later cases.” Ibid. As explained more fully below,
Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era in
which the Court began the process of “selective incorpo
ration” under the Due Process Clause, and we have never
previously addressed the question whether the right to
keep and bear arms applies to the States under that
theory.
