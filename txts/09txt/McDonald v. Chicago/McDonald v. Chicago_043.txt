Opinion of the Court
Opinion of ALITO, J.

have divergent views on the issue of gun control. Munici
pal respondents therefore urge us to allow state and local
governments to enact any gun control law that they deem
to be reasonable, including a complete ban on the posses
sion of handguns in the home for self-defense. Brief for
Municipal Respondents 18–20, 23.
There is nothing new in the argument that, in order to
respect federalism and allow useful state experimentation,
a federal constitutional right should not be fully binding
on the States. This argument was made repeatedly and
eloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the
concept of incorporation and urged retention of the two
track approach to incorporation. Throughout the era of
“selective incorporation,” Justice Harlan in particular,
invoking the values of federalism and state experimenta
tion, fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the
two-track approach. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354
U. S. 476, 500–503 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in result
in part and dissenting in part); Mapp, supra, at 678–680
(Harlan, J., dissenting); Gideon, 372 U. S., at 352 (Harlan,
J., concurring); Malloy, 378 U. S., at 14–33 (Harlan, J.,
dissenting); Pointer, 380 U. S., at 408–409 (Harlan, J.,
concurring in result); Washington, 388 U. S., at 23–24
(Harlan, J., concurring in result); Duncan, 391 U. S., at
171–193 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Benton, 395 U. S., at
808–809 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Williams v. Florida, 399
U. S. 78, 117 (1970) (Harlan, J., dissenting in part and
concurring in result in part).
Time and again, however, those pleas failed. Unless we
turn back the clock or adopt a special incorporation test
applicable only to the Second Amendment, municipal
respondents’ argument must be rejected. Under our prece
dents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an
American perspective, then, unless stare decisis counsels
