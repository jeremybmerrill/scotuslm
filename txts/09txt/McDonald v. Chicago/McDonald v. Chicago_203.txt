BREYER, J., dissenting

support of the conclusion that Reconstruction-era Ameri
cans strongly supported a private self-defense right shows
with equal force that Americans wanted African-American
citizens to have the same rights to possess guns as did
white citizens. Ante, at 22–33. Here, for example is what
Congress said when it enacted a Fourteenth Amendment
predecessor, the Second Freedman’s Bureau Act. It wrote
