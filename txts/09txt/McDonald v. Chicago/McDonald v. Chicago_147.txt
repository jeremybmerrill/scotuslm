STEVENS, J., dissenting

46, 68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Historical
study may discipline as well as enrich the analysis. But
the inescapable reality is that no serious theory of Section
1 of the Fourteenth Amendment yields clear answers in
every case, and “[n]o formula could serve as a substitute,
in this area, for judgment and restraint.” Poe, 367 U. S.,
at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).
Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such
restraint. In the substantive due process field as in oth­
ers, the Court has applied both the doctrine of stare de­
cisis—adhering to precedents, respecting reliance inter­
ests, prizing stability and order in the law—and the
common-law method—taking cases and controversies as
they present themselves, proceeding slowly and incremen­
tally, building on what came before. This restrained
methodology was evident even in the heyday of “incorpora­
tion” during the 1960’s. Although it would have been
much easier for the Court simply to declare certain
Amendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States
in toto, the Court took care to parse each Amendment into
its component guarantees, evaluating them one by one.
This piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize
more closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reduc­
ing both the risk and the cost of error.
Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an
abstract plane, the Court has “required in substantive­
due-process cases a ‘careful description’ of the asserted
fundamental liberty interest.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at
721 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993);
Collins, 503 U. S., at 125; Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of
Health, 497 U. S. 261, 277–278 (1990)). And just as we
have required such careful description from the litigants,
we have required of ourselves that we “focus on the allega­
tions in the complaint to determine how petitioner de­
scribes the constitutional right at stake.” Collins, 503
U. S., at 125; see also Stevens, Judicial Restraint, 22 San
