Further, much as they had during the period before the
Civil War, state courts routinely upheld such restrictions.
See, e.g., English v. State, 35 Tex. 473 (1871); Hill v. State,

self-defense, without the use of the weapons which we
have held may be rightfully prescribed by this statute.
The object being to banish these weapons from the
community by an absolute prohibition for the preven

could exist, ought to be allowed to defeat this end.”

Although the majority does not discuss 20th- or 21st
century evidence concerning the Second Amendment at

recent history of the right to bear arms for private self
defense when considering whether the right is “fundamen
