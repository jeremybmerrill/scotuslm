Opinion of THOMAS, J.

phrase. They can further assist to the extent there is
evidence that these statements were disseminated to the
public. In other words, this evidence is useful not because
it demonstrates what the draftsmen of the text may have
been thinking, but only insofar as it illuminates what the
public understood the words chosen by the draftsmen to
mean.

that a constitutional amendment was necessary to provide
“an express grant of power in Congress to enforce by penal
enactment these great canons of the supreme law, secur
