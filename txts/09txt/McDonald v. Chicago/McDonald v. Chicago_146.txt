MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

physician-assisted suicide, for example, it did so in part
because “the States [were] currently engaged in serious,
thoughtful examinations of physician-assisted suicide and
other similar issues,” rendering judicial intervention both
less necessary and potentially more disruptive. Glucks­
berg, 521 U. S., at 719, 735. Conversely, we have long
appreciated that more “searching” judicial review may be
justified when the rights of “discrete and insular minori­
ties”—groups that may face systematic barriers in the
political system—are at stake. United States v. Carolene
Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). Courts have
a “comparative . . . advantage” over the elected branches
on a limited, but significant, range of legal matters. Post,
at 8.
Recognizing a new liberty right is a momentous step. It
takes that right, to a considerable extent, “outside the
arena of public debate and legislative action.” Glucksberg,
521 U. S., at 720. Sometimes that momentous step must
be taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dig­
nity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and
demand a baseline level of protection. But sensitivity to
the interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and
the practical realities of contemporary society provides an
important tool for guiding judicial discretion.
This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the
need to approach our work with humility and caution.
Because the relevant constitutional language is so “spa­
cious,” Duncan, 391 U. S., at 148, I have emphasized that
“[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to
exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break
new ground in this field.” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125. Many
of my colleagues and predecessors have stressed the same
point, some with great eloquence. See, e.g., Casey, 505
U. S., at 849; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 502–
503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Poe, 367 U. S., at 542–545
(Harlan, J., dissenting); Adamson v. California, 332 U. S.
