MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Organized terrorism like that perpetuated by Tillman
and his cohorts proliferated in the absence of federal
enforcement of constitutional rights. Militias such as the
Ku Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, the
White Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and the ’76 Associa
tion spread terror among blacks and white Republicans by
breaking up Republican meetings, threatening political
leaders, and whipping black militiamen. Era of Recon
struction, 199–200; Curtis 156. These groups raped,
murdered, lynched, and robbed as a means of intimidat
ing, and instilling pervasive fear in, those whom they
despised. A. Trelease, White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan
Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction 28–46 (1995).
Although Congress enacted legislation to suppress these
activities,23 Klan tactics remained a constant presence in
the lives of Southern blacks for decades. Between 1882
and 1968, there were at least 3,446 reported lynchings of
blacks in the South. Cottrol 351–352. They were tortured
and killed for a wide array of alleged crimes, without even
the slightest hint of due process. Emmit Till, for example,
was killed in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white
woman. S. Whitfield, A Death in the Delta: The Story of
Emmett Till 15–31 (1988). The fates of other targets of
mob violence were equally depraved. See, e.g., Lynched
Negro and Wife Were First Mutilated, Vicksburg (Miss.)

later, United States Senator. Tillman’s contributions to campaign
finance law have been discussed in our recent cases on that subject.
See Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip. op., at 2, 42, 56, 87) (discussing at
length the Tillman Act of 1907, 34 Stat. 864). His contributions to the
culture of terrorism that grew in the wake of Cruikshank had an even
more dramatic and tragic effect.
23 In an effort to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and halt this
violence, Congress enacted a series of civil rights statutes, including the
Force Acts, see Act of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 140; Act of Feb. 28, 1871,
16 Stat. 433, and the Ku Klux Klan Act, see Act of Apr. 20, 1871, 17
Stat. 13.
