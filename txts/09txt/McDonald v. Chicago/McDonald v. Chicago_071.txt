Opinion of THOMAS, J.

as an inalienable right that pre-existed the Constitution’s
adoption—was the very reason citizens could not enforce it
against States through the Fourteenth.
That circular reasoning effectively has been the Court’s
last word on the Privileges or Immunities Clause.1 In the
intervening years, the Court has held that the Clause
prevents state abridgment of only a handful of rights, such
as the right to travel, see Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 503
(1999), that are not readily described as essential to
liberty.
As a consequence of this Court’s marginalization of the
Clause, litigants seeking federal protection of fundamental
rights turned to the remainder of §1 in search of an alter
native fount of such rights. They found one in a most
curious place—that section’s command that every State
guarantee “due process” to any person before depriving
him of “life, liberty, or property.” At first, litigants argued
that this Due Process Clause “incorporated” certain proce
dural rights codified in the Bill of Rights against the
States. The Court generally rejected those claims, how
ever, on the theory that the rights in question were not
sufficiently “fundamental” to warrant such treatment.
See, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884)
(grand jury indictment requirement); Maxwell v. Dow, 176
U. S. 581 (1900) (12-person jury requirement); Twining v.
New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908) (privilege against self
incrimination).
That changed with time. The Court came to conclude
that certain Bill of Rights guarantees were sufficiently
fundamental to fall within §1’s guarantee of “due process.”
These included not only procedural protections listed in

1 In the two decades after United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542
(1876), was decided, this Court twice reaffirmed its holding that the
Privileges or Immunities Clause does not apply the Second Amendment
to the States. Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, 266–267 (1886); Miller
v. Texas, 153 U. S. 535 (1894).
