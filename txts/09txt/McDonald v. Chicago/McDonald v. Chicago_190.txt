BREYER, J., dissenting

First, on any reasonable accounting, the incorporation of
the right recognized in Heller would amount to a signifi
cant incursion on a traditional and important area of state
concern, altering the constitutional relationship between
the States and the Federal Government. Private gun
regulation is the quintessential exercise of a State’s “police
power”—i.e., the power to “protec[t] . . . the lives, limbs,
health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protec
tion of all property within the State,” by enacting “all
kinds of restraints and burdens” on both “persons and
property.” Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 62 (1873)
(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has long
recognized that the Constitution grants the States special
authority to enact laws pursuant to this power. See, e.g.,
Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 475 (1996) (noting
that States have “great latitude” to use their police powers
(internal quotation marks omitted)); Metropolitan Life Ins.
Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756 (1985). A decade
ago, we wrote that there is “no better example of the police
power” than “the suppression of violent crime.” United
States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000). And exam
ples in which the Court has deferred to state legislative
judgments in respect to the exercise of the police power
are legion. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243,
270 (2006) (assisted suicide); Washington v. Glucksberg,
521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (same); Berman v. Parker, 348
U. S. 26, 32 (1954) (“We deal, in other words, with what
traditionally has been known as the police power. An
attempt to define its reach or trace its outer limits is
fruitless . . .”).
Second, determining the constitutionality of a particular
state gun law requires finding answers to complex empiri
cally based questions of a kind that legislatures are better
able than courts to make. See, e.g., Los Angeles v. Ala
meda Books, Inc., 535 U. S. 425, 440 (2002) (plurality
opinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520
