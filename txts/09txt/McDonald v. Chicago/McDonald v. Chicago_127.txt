STEVENS, J., dissenting

amount of process can legitimize some deprivations.
I have yet to see a persuasive argument that the Fram­
ers of the Fourteenth Amendment thought otherwise. To
the contrary, the historical evidence suggests that, at least
by the time of the Civil War if not much earlier, the
phrase “due process of law” had acquired substantive
content as a term of art within the legal community.5 This
understanding is consonant with the venerable “notion
that governmental authority has implied limits which

Origins of Substantive Due Process, 16 Const. Commentary 315, 326–
327 (1999) (concluding that founding-era “American statesmen accus­
tomed to viewing due process through the lens of [Sir Edward] Coke
and [William] Blackstone could [not] have failed to understand due
process as encompassing substantive as well as procedural terms”);
Gedicks, An Originalist Defense of Substantive Due Process: Magna
Carta, Higher-Law Constitutionalism, and the Fifth Amendment, 58
Emory L. J. 585, 594 (2009) (arguing “that one widely shared under­
standing of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in the late
eighteenth century encompassed judicial recognition and enforcement
of unenumerated substantive rights”); Maltz, Fourteenth Amendment
Concepts in the Antebellum Era, 32 Am. J. Legal Hist. 305, 317–318
(1988) (explaining that in the antebellum era a “substantial number of
states,” as well as antislavery advocates, “imbued their [constitutions’]
respective due process clauses with a substantive content”); Tribe,
Taking Text and Structure Seriously: Reflections on Free-Form Method
in Constitutional Interpretation, 108 Harv. L. Rev. 1221, 1297, n. 247
(1995) (“[T]he historical evidence points strongly toward the conclusion
that, at least by 1868 even if not in 1791, any state legislature voting to
ratify a constitutional rule banning government deprivations of ‘life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law’ would have understood
that ban as having substantive as well as procedural content, given
that era’s premise that, to qualify as ‘law,’ an enactment would have to
meet substantive requirements of rationality, non-oppressiveness, and
evenhandedness”); see also Stevens, The Third Branch of Liberty, 41 U.
Miami L. Rev. 277, 290 (1986) (“In view of the number of cases that
have given substantive content to the term liberty, the burden of
demonstrating that this consistent course of decision was unfaithful to
the intent of the Framers is surely a heavy one”).
