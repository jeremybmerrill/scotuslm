MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

In keeping with this practice, the First Continental
Congress declared in 1774 that the King had wrongfully
denied the colonists “the rights, liberties, and immunities
of free and natural-born subjects . . . within the realm of
England.” 1 Journals of the Continental Congress 1774–

those rights as including the “great” “right[s]” of “trial by
jury,” “Habeas Corpus,” and “freedom of the press.” Ad

equally free and independent, and have certain natural,
inherent and inalienable rights,” including the “right to
worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their
own consciences” and the “right to bear arms for the de
fence of themselves and the state”).5
Several years later, the Founders amended the Consti

rights against interference by the Federal Government.
Consistent with their English heritage, the founding

been abiding and born within the Realm of England” (emphasis in
