OTIS MCDONALD, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. CITY OF 

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 28, 2010] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I agree with the Court that the Fourteenth Amendment
makes the right to keep and bear arms set forth in the
Second Amendment “fully applicable to the States.” Ante,
at 1. I write separately because I believe there is a more
straightforward path to this conclusion, one that is more
faithful to the Fourteenth Amendment’s text and history.
Applying what is now a well-settled test, the plurality
opinion concludes that the right to keep and bear arms
applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amend
ment’s Due Process Clause because it is “fundamental” to
the American “scheme of ordered liberty,” ante, at 19
(citing Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968)),
and “ ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradi
tion,’ ” ante, at 19 (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521
U. S. 702, 721 (1997)). I agree with that description of the
right. But I cannot agree that it is enforceable against the
States through a clause that speaks only to “process.”
Instead, the right to keep and bear arms is a privilege of
American citizenship that applies to the States through
the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities
Clause.
