MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

tia.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26, 19–20). That view in
turn rested in significant part upon Blackstone having
described the right as “ ‘the right of having and using arms
for self-preservation and defence,’ ” which reflected the
provision in the English Declaration of Right of 1689 that
gave the King’s Protestant “ ‘subjects’ ” the right to “ ‘have
Arms for their defence suitable to their Conditions, and as
allowed by law.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20) (quoting 1
W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 140
(1765) (hereinafter Blackstone) and 1 W. & M., c. 2, §7, in
3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689)). The Framers, said the
majority, understood that right “as permitting a citizen to
‘repe[l] force by force’ when ‘the intervention of society in

power” to arm the citizenry: “to defend the realm” in the
case of a foreign enemy, and to “secure the right of ‘self
preservation,’ ” or “self-defense,” should “the sovereign
usurp the English Constitution.” English Historians’ Brief
3, 8–13, 23–24 (emphasis added). Thus, the Declaration of
Right says that private persons can possess guns only “as
allowed by law.” See id., at 20–24. Moreover, when
Blackstone referred to “ ‘the right of having and using
arms for self-preservation and defence,’ ” he was referring
to the right of the people “to take part in the militia to
defend their political liberties,” and to the right of Parlia
ment (which represented the people) to raise a militia even
when the King sought to deny it that power. Id., at 4, 24–
27 (emphasis added) (quoting 1 Blackstone 140). Nor can
the historians find any convincing reason to believe that
