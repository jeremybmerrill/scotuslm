MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Immunities Clause accomplished this task. G. Paschal,
The Constitution of the United States 290 (1868) (explain
ing that the rights listed in §1 had “already been guaran
tied” by Article IV and the Bill of Rights, but that “[t]he
new feature declared” by §1 was that these rights, “which
had been construed to apply only to the national govern
ment, are thus imposed upon the States”).
Another example of public understanding comes from
United States Attorney Daniel Corbin’s statement in an
1871 Ku Klux Klan prosecution. Corbin cited Barron and
declared:
“[T]he fourteenth amendment changes all that theory,
and lays the same restriction upon the States that be
fore lay upon the Congress of the United States—that,
as Congress heretofore could not interfere with the
right of the citizen to keep and bear arms, now, after
the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, the State
cannot interfere with the right of the citizen to keep
and bear arms. The right to keep and bear arms is in
cluded in the fourteenth amendment, under ‘privi
leges and immunities.’ ” Proceedings in the Ku Klux
Trials at Columbia, S. C., in the United States Circuit
Court, November Term, 1871, p. 147 (1872).

This evidence plainly shows that the ratifying public
understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect
constitutionally enumerated rights, including the right to
keep and bear arms. As the Court demonstrates, there
can be no doubt that §1 was understood to enforce the
Second Amendment against the States. See ante, at 22–
33. In my view, this is because the right to keep and bear
arms was understood to be a privilege of American citizen
ship guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.
