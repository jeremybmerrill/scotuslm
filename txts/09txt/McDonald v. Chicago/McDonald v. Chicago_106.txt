MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

124–125 (2d ed. 1829) (reprint 2009) (arguing that certain
of the first eight Amendments “appl[y] to the state legisla
tures” because those Amendments “form parts of the
declared rights of the people, of which neither the state
powers nor those of the Union can ever deprive them”); id.,
at 125−126 (describing the Second Amendment “right of
the people to keep and bear arms” as “a restraint on both”
Congress and the States); see also Heller, 554 U. S., at __
(slip op., at 34) (describing Rawle’s treatise as “influen
tial”). Certain abolitionist leaders adhered to this view as
well. Lysander Spooner championed the popular aboli
tionist argument that slavery was inconsistent with con
stitutional principles, citing as evidence the fact that it
deprived black Americans of the “natural right of all men
‘to keep and bear arms’ for their personal defence,” which
he believed the Constitution “prohibit[ed] both Congress
and the State governments from infringing.” L. Spooner,
The Unconstitutionality of Slavery 98 (1860).
In sum, some appear to have believed that the Bill of
Rights did apply to the States, even though this Court had
squarely rejected that theory. See, e.g., supra, at 27–28
(recounting Rep. Hale’s argument to this effect). Many
others believed that the liberties codified in the Bill of
Rights were ones that no State should abridge, even
though they understood that the Bill technically did not
apply to States. These beliefs, combined with the fact that
most state constitutions recognized many, if not all, of the
individual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, made
the need for federal enforcement of constitutional liberties
against the States an afterthought. See ante, at 29 (opin
ion of the Court) (noting that, “[i]n 1868, 22 of the 37
States in the Union had state constitutional provisions
explicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms”).
That changed with the national conflict over slavery.
