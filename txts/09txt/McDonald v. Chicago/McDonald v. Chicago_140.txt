MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Duncan, 391 U. S., at 150, n. 14. That inquiry could ex­
tend back through time, but it was focused not so much on
historical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional
significance within the States’ regimes. This contextual­
ized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any
given trial-type procedure means little in the abstract. It
is only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes
with other procedures and practices in a criminal justice
system that its relationship to “liberty” and “due process”
can be determined.
Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to
recognize rights distinct from the trial context—rights
relating to the primary conduct of free individuals—
Justice Cardozo’s test has been our guide. The right to
free speech, for instance, has been safeguarded from state
infringement not because the States have always honored
it, but because it is “essential to free government” and “to
the maintenance of democratic institutions”—that is,
because the right to free speech is implicit in the concept
of ordered liberty. Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 95,
96 (1940); see also, e.g., Loving, 388 U. S., at 12 (discuss­
ing right to marry person of another race); Mapp v. Ohio,
367 U. S. 643, 650, 655–657 (1961) (discussing right to be
free from arbitrary intrusion by police); Schneider v. State
(Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 161 (1939) (discussing
right to distribute printed matter).18 While the verbal
formula has varied, the Court has largely been consistent
in its liberty-based approach to substantive interests
outside of the adjudicatory system. As the question before

18 Cf. Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660, 666–668 (1962) (invalidat­
ing state statute criminalizing narcotics addiction as “cruel and unusual
punishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment” based on nature
of the alleged “ ‘crime,’ ” without historical analysis); Brief for Respon­
dent National Rifle Association of America, Inc., et al. 29 (noting that
“lynchpin” of incorporation test has always been “the importance of the
right in question to . . . ‘liberty’ ” and to our “system of government”).
