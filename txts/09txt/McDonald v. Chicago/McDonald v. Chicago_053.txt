MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
SCALIA, J., concurring

has renamed the “liberty clause,” post, at 4–7,1 JUSTICE
STEVENS proceeds to urge readoption of the theory of
incorporation articulated in Palko v. Connecticut, 302
U. S. 319, 325 (1937), see post, at 14–20. But in fact he
does not favor application of that theory at all. For
whether Palko requires only that “a fair and enlightened
system of justice would be impossible without” the right
sought to be incorporated, 302 U. S., at 325, or requires in
addition that the right be rooted in the “traditions and
conscience of our people,” ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted), many of the rights JUSTICE STEVENS thinks are
incorporated could not pass muster under either test:
abortion, post, at 7 (citing Planned Parenthood of South
eastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 847 (1992)); homosex­
ual sodomy, post, at 16 (citing Lawrence v. Texas, 539
U. S. 558, 572 (2003)); the right to have excluded from
criminal trials evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth
Amendment, post, at 18 (citing Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S.
643, 650, 655–657 (1961)); and the right to teach one’s
children foreign languages, post, at 7 (citing Meyer v.
Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399–403 (1923)), among others.
That JUSTICE STEVENS is not applying any version of
Palko is clear from comparing, on the one hand, the rights
he believes are covered, with, on the other hand, his con­
clusion that the right to keep and bear arms is not cov­
ered. Rights that pass his test include not just those
“relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family
relationships, and child rearing and education,” but also
rights against “[g]overnment action that shocks the con­

1 I do not entirely understand JUSTICE STEVENS’ renaming of the Due
Process Clause. What we call it, of course, does not change what the
Clause says, but shorthand should not obscure what it says. Accepting
for argument’s sake the shift in emphasis—from avoiding certain
deprivations without that “process” which is “due,” to avoiding the
deprivations themselves—the Clause applies not just to deprivations of
“liberty,” but also to deprivations of “life” and even “property.”
