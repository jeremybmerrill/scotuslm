MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

Although one scholar implies that state courts are less
willing to permit total gun prohibitions, see Volokh, Im
plementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for SelfDefense: An Analytical Framework and a Research
Agenda, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware
of no instances in the past 50 years in which a state court
has struck down as unconstitutional a law banning a
particular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.
Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitu
tional (under their state constitutions) firearms regula
tions that have included handgun bans. See Kalodimos v.
Village of Morton Grove, 103 Ill. 2d 483, 499, 470 N. E. 2d
266, 273 (1984) (upholding a handgun ban because the
arms right is merely a right “to possess some form of
weapon suitable for self-defense or recreation”); Cleveland
v. Turner, No. 36126, 1977 WL 201393, *5 (Ohio Ct. App.,
Aug. 4, 1977) (handgun ban “does not absolutely interfere
with the right of the people to bear arms, but rather pro
scribes possession of a specifically defined category of
handguns”); State v. Bolin 378 S. C. 96, 99, 662 S. E. 2d
38, 39 (2008) (ban on handgun possession by persons
under 21 did not infringe arms right because they can
“posses[s] other types of guns”). Thus, the majority’s
decision to incorporate the private self-defense right rec
ognized in Heller threatens to alter state regulatory re
gimes, at least as they pertain to handguns.
Third, the plurality correctly points out that only a few
state courts, a “paucity” of state courts, have specifically
upheld handgun bans. Ante, at 39. But which state courts
have struck them down? The absence of supporting in
formation does not help the majority find support. Cf.
United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496 (1997) (noting
that it is “treacherous to find in congressional silence
alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Silence does not show or tend
to show a consensus that a private self-defense right
