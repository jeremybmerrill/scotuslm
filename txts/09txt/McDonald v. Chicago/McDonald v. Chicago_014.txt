MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

Clause to “a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished
nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the
people on its passage.” Id., at 96; see also id., at 104.
Justice Field opined that the Privileges or Immunities
Clause protects rights that are “in their nature . . . funda
mental,” including the right of every man to pursue his
profession without the imposition of unequal or discrimi
natory restrictions. Id., at 96–97. Justice Bradley’s dis
sent observed that “we are not bound to resort to implica
tion . . . to find an authoritative declaration of some of the
most important privileges and immunities of citizens of
the United States. It is in the Constitution itself.” Id., at
118. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges
or Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated
in the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights.
Id., at 119. Justice Swayne described the majority’s nar
row reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as
“turn[ing] . . . what was meant for bread into a stone.” Id.,
at 129 (dissenting opinion).
Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of
the narrow Slaughter-House interpretation. See, e.g.,
Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 522, n. 1, 527 (1999) (THOMAS,
J., dissenting) (scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment
agree “that the Clause does not mean what the Court said
it meant in 1873”); Amar, Substance and Method in the
Year 2000, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 601, 631, n. 178 (2001)
(“Virtually no serious modern scholar—left, right, and
center—thinks that this [interpretation] is a plausible
reading of the Amendment”); Brief for Constitutional Law
Professors as Amici Curiae 33 (claiming an “overwhelming
consensus among leading constitutional scholars” that the
opinion is “egregiously wrong”); C. Black, A New Birth of
Freedom 74–75 (1997).
Three years after the decision in the Slaughter-House
Cases, the Court decided Cruikshank, the first of the three
19th-century cases on which the Seventh Circuit relied.
