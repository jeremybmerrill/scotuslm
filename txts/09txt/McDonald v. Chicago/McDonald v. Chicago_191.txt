MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
BREYER, J., dissenting

U. S. 180, 195–196 (1997). And it may require this kind of
analysis in virtually every case.
Government regulation of the right to bear arms nor
mally embodies a judgment that the regulation will help
save lives. The determination whether a gun regulation is
constitutional would thus almost always require the
weighing of the constitutional right to bear arms against
the “primary concern of every government—a concern for
the safety and indeed the lives of its citizens.” United
States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 755 (1987). With respect
to other incorporated rights, this sort of inquiry is some
times present. See, e.g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S.
444, 447 (1969) (per curiam) (free speech); Sherbert v.
Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 403 (1963) (religion); Brigham City
v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403–404 (2006) (Fourth Amend
ment); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984)
(Fifth Amendment); Salerno, supra, at 755 (bail). But
here, this inquiry—calling for the fine tuning of protective
rules—is likely to be part of a daily judicial diet.
Given the competing interests, courts will have to try to
answer empirical questions of a particularly difficult kind.
Suppose, for example, that after a gun regulation’s adop
tion the murder rate went up. Without the gun regulation
would the murder rate have risen even faster? How is this
conclusion affected by the local recession which has left
numerous people unemployed? What about budget cuts
that led to a downsizing of the police force? How effective
was that police force to begin with? And did the regula
tion simply take guns from those who use them for lawful
purposes without affecting their possession by criminals?
Consider too that countless gun regulations of many
shapes and sizes are in place in every State and in many
local communities. Does the right to possess weapons for
self-defense extend outside the home? To the car? To
work? What sort of guns are necessary for self-defense?
Handguns? Rifles? Semiautomatic weapons? When is a
