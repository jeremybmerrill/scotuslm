MCDONALD v. CHICAGO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

ticular protection.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting 391 U. S., at 149,
n. 14). Palko does contain some language that could be
read to set an inordinate bar to substantive due process
recognition, reserving it for practices without which “nei­
ther liberty nor justice would exist.” 302 U. S., at 326.
But in view of Justice Cardozo’s broader analysis, as well
as the numerous cases that have upheld liberty claims
under the Palko standard, such readings are plainly over­
readings. We have never applied Palko in such a draco­
nian manner.
Nor, as the Court intimates, see ante, at 16, did Duncan
mark an irreparable break from Palko, swapping out
liberty for history. Duncan limited its discussion to “par­
ticular procedural safeguard[s]” in the Bill of Rights relat­
ing to “criminal processes,” 391 U. S., at 149, n. 14; it did
not purport to set a standard for other types of liberty
interests. Even with regard to procedural safeguards,
Duncan did not jettison the Palko test so much as refine it:
The judge is still tasked with evaluating whether a prac­
tice “is fundamental . . . to ordered liberty,” within the
context of the “Anglo-American” system. Duncan, 391
U. S., at 149–150, n. 14. Several of our most important
recent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive
due process analysis—from which, once again, “incorpora­
tion” analysis derives—must not be wholly backward
looking. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 572
(2003) (“[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but
not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due
process inquiry” (internal quotation marks omitted));

(1989) (garnering only two votes for history-driven meth­
odology that “consult[s] the most specific tradition avail­
able”); see also post, at 6–7 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (ex­
plaining that post-Duncan “incorporation” cases continued
