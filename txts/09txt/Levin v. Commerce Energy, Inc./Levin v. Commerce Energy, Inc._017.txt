Opinion of the Court

tence of lower federal courts counsel that they refrain from
taking up cases of this genre, so long as state courts are
equipped fairly to adjudicate them.8
B
Comity considerations, as the District Court deter­
mined, warrant dismissal of respondents’ suit. Assuming,
arguendo, that respondents could prevail on the merits of
the suit,9 the most obvious way to achieve parity would be
to reduce respondents’ tax liability. Respondents did not
seek such relief, for the TIA stands in the way of any
decree that would “enjoin . . . collection of [a] tax under
State law.” 28 U. S. C. §1341.10 A more ambitious solu­
tion would reshape the relevant provisions of Ohio’s tax
code. Were a federal court to essay such relief, however,
the court would engage in the very interference in state
taxation the comity doctrine aims to avoid. Cf. State
Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 614–615 (1876). Re­
spondents’ requested remedy, an order invalidating the
exemptions enjoyed by LDCs, App. 20–21, may be far from
——————
ings by adopting “narrowing constructions that might obviate the
constitutional problem and intelligently mediate federal constitutional
concerns and state interests.” Moore v. Sims, 442 U. S. 415, 429–430
(1979).
8 Any substantial federal question, of course, “could be reviewed when
the case [comes to this Court] through the hierarchy of state courts.”
McNeese, 373 U. S., at 673.
9 But see General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 279–280
(1997) (determining, at a time IMs could not compete with LDCs for the
Ohio residential “captive” market, that IMs and LDCs were not “simi­
larly situated”; and rejecting industrial IM customer’s dormant Com­
merce Clause and equal protection challenges to LDCs’ exemption from
sales and use taxes).
10 Previous language restricting the district courts’ “jurisdiction” was
removed in the 1948 revision of Title 28. Compare 28 U. S. C. §41(1)
(1940 ed.) with §1341, 62 Stat. 932. This Court and others have con­
tinued to regard the Act as jurisdictional. See, e.g., post, at 1 (THOMAS,
J., concurring in judgment).
