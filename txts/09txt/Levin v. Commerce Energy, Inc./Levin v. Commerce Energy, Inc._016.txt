LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.
Opinion of the Court

543 (1942). But see, e.g., Levy v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 68
(1968).
In particular, when this Court—on review of a state
high court’s decision—finds a tax measure constitutionally
infirm, “it has been our practice,” for reasons of “federal­
state comity,” “to abstain from deciding the remedial
effects of such a holding.” American Trucking Assns., Inc.
v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 176 (1990) (plurality opinion).6 A
“State found to have imposed an impermissibly discrimi­
natory tax retains flexibility in responding to this deter­
mination.” McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Bever­
ages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496
U. S. 18, 39–40 (1990). Our remand leaves the interim
solution in state-court hands, subject to subsequent defini­
tive disposition by the State’s legislature.
If lower federal courts were to give audience to the
merits of suits alleging uneven state tax burdens, how­
ever, recourse to state court for the interim remedial
determination would be unavailable. That is so because
federal tribunals lack authority to remand to the state
court system an action initiated in federal court. Federal
judges, moreover, are bound by the TIA; absent certain
exceptions, see, e.g., Department of Employment v. United
States, 385 U. S. 355, 357–358 (1966), the Act precludes
relief that would diminish state revenues, even if such
relief is the remedy least disruptive of the state legisla­
ture’s design.7 These limitations on the remedial compe­
