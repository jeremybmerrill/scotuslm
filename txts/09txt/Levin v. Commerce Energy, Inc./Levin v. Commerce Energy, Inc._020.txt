LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.
Opinion of the Court

with the legitimate activities of the States.” Younger, 401
U. S., at 44. A confluence of factors in this case, absent in
Hibbs, leads us to conclude that the comity doctrine con­
trols here. First, respondents seek federal-court review of
commercial matters over which Ohio enjoys wide regula­
tory latitude; their suit does not involve any fundamental
right or classification that attracts heightened judicial
scrutiny. Second, while respondents portray themselves
as third-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional
tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an
endeavor to improve their competitive position. Third, the
Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal coun­
terparts to correct any violation because they are more
familiar with state legislative preferences and because the
TIA does not constrain their remedial options. Individu­
ally, these considerations may not compel forbearance on
the part of federal district courts; in combination, how­
ever, they demand deference to the state adjudicative
process.
C
The Sixth Circuit expressed concern that application of
the comity doctrine here would render the TIA “effectively
superfluous.” 554 F. 3d, at 1099; see id., at 1102. This
concern overlooks Congress’ point in enacting the TIA.
The Act was passed to plug two large loopholes courts had
opened in applying the comity doctrine. See supra, at 7,
and n. 3. By closing these loopholes, Congress secured the
doctrine against diminishment. Comity, we further note,
is a prudential doctrine. “If the State voluntarily chooses
to submit to a federal forum, principles of comity do not
demand that the federal court force the case back into the
State’s own system.” Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs.
