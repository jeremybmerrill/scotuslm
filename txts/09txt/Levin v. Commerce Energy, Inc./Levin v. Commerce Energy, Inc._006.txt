LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.

A

Historically, all natural gas consumers in Ohio pur­
chased gas from the public utility, known as a local distri­
bution company (LDC), serving their geographic area. In
addition to selling gas as a commodity, LDCs own and
operate networks of distribution pipelines to transport and
deliver gas to consumers. LDCs offer customers a single,
bundled product comprising both gas and delivery.
Today, consumers in Ohio’s major metropolitan areas
can alternatively contract with an independent marketer
(IM) that competes with LDCs for retail sales of natural
gas. IMs do not own or operate distribution pipelines;
they use LDCs’ pipelines. When a customer goes with an
IM, therefore, she purchases two “unbundled” products:
gas (from the IM) and delivery (from the LDC).
Ohio treats LDCs and IMs differently for tax purposes.
Relevant here, Ohio affords LDCs three tax exemptions
that IMs do not receive. First, LDCs’ natural gas sales are
exempt from sales and use taxes. Ohio Rev. Code Ann.
§5739.02(B)(7) (Lexis Supp. 2010); §§5739.021(E), .023(G),
.026(F) (Lexis 2008); §§5741.02(C), .021(A), .022(A),
.023(A) (Lexis 2008). LDCs owe instead a gross receipts
excise tax, §5727.24, which is lower than the sales and use
taxes IMs must collect. Second, LDCs are not subject to
the commercial activities tax imposed on IMs’ taxable
gross receipts. §§5751.01(E)(2), .02 (Lexis Supp. 2010).
Finally, Ohio law excludes inter-LDC natural gas sales
from the gross receipts tax, which IMs must pay when
they purchase gas from LDCs. §5727.33(B)(4) (Lexis
2008).
