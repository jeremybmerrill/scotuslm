LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.
Opinion of the Court

did the action in Hibbs.” Brief for Respondents 42. As we
explain below, however, the two cases differ markedly in
ways bearing on the comity calculus. We have had no
prior occasion to consider, under the comity doctrine, a
taxpayer’s complaint about allegedly discriminatory state
taxation framed as a request to increase a competitor’s tax
burden. Now squarely presented with the question, we
hold that comity precludes the exercise of original federal­
court jurisdiction in cases of the kind presented here.

A

Respondents complain that they are taxed unevenly in
comparison to LDCs and their customers. Under either an
equal protection or dormant Commerce Clause theory,
respondents’ root objection is the same: State action,
respondents contend, “selects [them] out for discrimina­
tory treatment by subjecting [them] to taxes not imposed
on others of the same class.” Hillsborough v. Cromwell,
326 U. S. 620, 623 (1946) (equal protection); see Dennis v.
Higgins, 498 U. S. 439, 447–448 (1991) (dormant Com­
merce Clause).
When economic legislation does not employ classifica­
tions subject to heightened scrutiny or impinge on funda­
mental rights,5 courts generally view constitutional chal­
lenges with the skepticism due respect for legislative
choices demands. See, e.g., Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S.
314, 331–332 (1981); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla.,
Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 488–489 (1955). And “in taxation,
even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the
greatest freedom in classification.” Madden v. Kentucky,

ginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996). On the federal courts’ role in safeguarding
human rights, see, e.g., Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U. S. 241, 245–248
(1967); McNeese v. Board of Ed. for Community Unit School Dist. 187,
373 U. S. 668, 672–674, and n. 6 (1963).
