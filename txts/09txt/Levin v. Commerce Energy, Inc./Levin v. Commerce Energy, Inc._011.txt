Opinion of the Court

Statutes conferring federal jurisdiction, we have repeat­
edly cautioned, should be read with sensitivity to “federal­
state relations” and “wise judicial administration.”
Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 716 (1996)
(internal quotation marks omitted). But by 1937, in state
tax cases, the federal courts had moved in a different
direction: they “had become free and easy with injunc­
tions.” Fair Assessment, 454 U. S., at 129 (Brennan, J.,
concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omit­
ted).3 Congress passed the TIA to reverse this trend. Id.,
at 109–110 (opinion of the Court).
Our post-Act decisions, however, confirm the continuing
sway of comity considerations, independent of the Act.
Plaintiffs in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman,
319 U. S. 293 (1943), for example, sought a federal judg­
ment declaring Louisiana’s unemployment compensation
tax unconstitutional. Writing six years after the TIA’s
passage, we emphasized the Act’s animating concerns: A
“federal court of equity,” we reminded, “may in an appro­
priate case refuse to give its special protection to private
rights when the exercise of its jurisdiction would be preju­
dicial to the public interest, [and] should stay its hand in
the public interest when it reasonably appears that pri­
vate interests will not suffer.” Id., at 297–298 (citations
omitted). In enacting the TIA, we noted, “Congress recog­

3 Two features of federal equity practice accounted for the courts’
willingness to grant injunctive relief. First, the Court had held that,
although “equity jurisdiction does not lie where there exists an ade­
quate legal remedy[,] . . . the ‘adequate legal remedy’ must be one
cognizable in federal court.” Fair Assessment, 454 U. S., at 129, n. 15
(Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original). Second,
federal courts, “construing strictly the requirement that the remedy
available at law be ‘plain, adequate and complete,’ had frequently
concluded that the procedures provided by the State were not ade­
quate.” Ibid. (citation omitted).
