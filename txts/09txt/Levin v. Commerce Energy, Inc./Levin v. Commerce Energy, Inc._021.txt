Opinion of the Court

IV
Because we conclude that the comity doctrine justifies
dismissal of respondents’ federal-court action, we need not
decide whether the TIA would itself block the suit. See
Great Lakes, 319 U. S., at 299, 301 (reserving judgment on
TIA’s application where comity precluded suit). See also
Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp., 549
U. S. 422, 431 (2007) (federal court has flexibility to choose
among threshold grounds for dismissal).13

For the reasons stated, the Sixth Circuit’s judgment is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

13 The

District Court and Court of Appeals concluded that our deci­
sion in Hibbs placed the controversy outside the TIA’s domain. That
conclusion, we note, bears reassessment in light of this opinion’s
discussion of the significant differences between Hibbs and this case.
