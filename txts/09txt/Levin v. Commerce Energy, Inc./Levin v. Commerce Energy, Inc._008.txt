LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.
Opinion of the Court

(internal quotation marks omitted). Such relief, the court
said, would draw federal judges into “a particularly inap­
propriate involvement in a state’s management of its fiscal
operations.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). A
state court, the District Court recognized, could extend the
exemptions to IMs, but the TIA proscribed this revenue­
reducing relief in federal court. “Where there would be
two possible remedies,” the Court concluded, a federal
court should not “impose its own judgment on the state
legislature mandating which remedy is appropriate.” Ibid.
The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit re­
versed. 554 F. 3d 1094 (2009). While agreeing that the
TIA did not bar respondents’ suit, the Sixth Circuit re­
jected the District Court’s comity ruling. A footnote in
Hibbs, the Court of Appeals believed, foreclosed the Dis­
trict Court’s “expansive reading” of this Court’s comity
precedents. 554 F. 3d, at 1098. The footnote stated that
the Court “has relied upon ‘principles of comity’ to pre­
clude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plain­
tiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or
countermand state tax collection.” Hibbs, 542 U. S., at
107, n. 9 (citation omitted). A broad view of the comity
cases, the Sixth Circuit feared, would render the TIA
“effectively superfluous,” and would “sub silentio overrule
a series of important cases” presenting challenges to state
tax measures. 554 F. 3d, at 1099, 1102 (citing Milliken v.
Bradley, 433 U. S. 267 (1977); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S.
388 (1983)); 554 F. 3d, at 1099–1100.
In so ruling, the Sixth Circuit agreed with the Seventh
and Ninth Circuits, which had similarly read Hibbs to rein
in the comity doctrine, see Levy v. Pappas, 510 F. 3d 755
(CA7 2007); Wilbur v. Locke, 423 F. 3d 1101 (CA9 2005),
and it disagreed with the Fourth Circuit, which had con­
cluded that Hibbs left comity doctrine untouched, see
DIRECTV, Inc. v. Tolson, 513 F. 3d 119 (2008). Noting
that respondents “challenge[d] only a few limited exemp­
