nized and gave sanction to this practice.” Id., at 298. We
could not have thought Congress intended to cabin the
comity doctrine, for we went on to instruct dismissal in
Great Lakes on comity grounds without deciding whether
the Act reached declaratory judgment actions. Id., at 299,
301–302.4
Decades later, in Fair Assessment, we ruled, based on
comity concerns, that 42 U. S. C. §1983 does not permit
federal courts to award damages in state taxation cases
when state law provides an adequate remedy. 454 U. S.,
at 116. We clarified in Fair Assessment that “the principle
of comity which predated the Act was not restricted by its
passage.” Id., at 110. And in National Private Truck
Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm’n, 515 U. S. 582, 590
(1995), we said, explicitly, that “the [TIA] may be best
understood as but a partial codification of the federal
reluctance to interfere with state taxation.”

Although our precedents affirm that the comity doctrine
is more embracive than the TIA, several Courts of Ap­
peals, including the Sixth Circuit in the instant case, have
comprehended Hibbs to restrict comity’s compass. See
supra, at 4–5. Hibbs, however, has a more modest reach.
Plaintiffs in Hibbs were Arizona taxpayers who chal­
lenged a state law authorizing tax credits for payments to
organizations that disbursed scholarship grants to chil­
dren attending private schools. 542 U. S., at 94–96.
These organizations could fund attendance at institutions
that provided religious instruction or gave admissions
preference on the basis of religious affiliation. Id., at 95.
Ranking the credit program as state subsidization of
religion, incompatible with the Establishment Clause,
