RICHARD A. LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO,
PETITIONER v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
[June 1, 2010]

JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether a federal dis­
trict court may entertain a complaint of allegedly dis­
criminatory state taxation, framed as a request to increase
a commercial competitor’s tax burden. Relevant to our
inquiry is the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U. S. C.
§1341, which prohibits lower federal courts from restrain­
ing “the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under
State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may
be had in the courts of such State.” More embracive than
the TIA, the comity doctrine applicable in state taxation
cases restrains federal courts from entertaining claims for
relief that risk disrupting state tax administration. See
Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454
U. S. 100 (1981). The comity doctrine, we hold, requires
that a claim of the kind here presented proceed originally
in state court. In so ruling, we distinguish Hibbs v. Winn,
542 U. S. 88 (2004), in which the Court held that neither
the TIA nor the comity doctrine barred a federal district
court from adjudicating an Establishment Clause chal­
lenge to a state tax credit that allegedly funneled public
