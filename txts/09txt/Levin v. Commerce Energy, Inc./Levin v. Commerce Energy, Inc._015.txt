Opinion of the Court

309 U. S. 83, 88 (1940).
Of key importance, when unlawful discrimination in­
fects tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions,
the Constitution simply calls for equal treatment. How
equality is accomplished—by extension or invalidation of
the unequally distributed benefit or burden, or some other
measure—is a matter on which the Constitution is silent.
See Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 740 (1984)
(“[W]hen the right invoked is that to equal treatment, the
appropriate remedy is a mandate of equal treatment, a
result that can be accomplished” in more than one way.
(quoting Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, 284 U. S.
239, 247 (1931); internal quotation marks omitted)).
On finding unlawful discrimination, we have affirmed,
courts may attempt, within the bounds of their institu­
tional competence, to implement what the legislature
would have willed had it been apprised of the constitu­
tional infirmity. Mathews, 465 U. S., at 739, n. 5; Califano
v. Westcott, 443 U. S. 76, 92–93 (1979); see Stanton v.
Stanton, 421 U. S. 7, 17–18 (1975) (how State eliminates
unconstitutional discrimination “plainly is an issue of
state law”); cf. United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 246
(2005) (“legislative intent” determines cure for constitu­
tional violation). The relief the complaining party re­
quests does not circumscribe this inquiry. See Westcott,
443 U. S., at 96, n. 2 (Powell, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (“This issue should turn on the intent
of [the legislature], not the interests of the parties.”). With
the State’s legislative prerogative firmly in mind, this
Court, upon finding impermissible discrimination in a
State’s allocation of benefits or burdens, generally re­
mands the case, leaving the remedial choice in the hands
of state authorities. See, e.g., Wengler v. Druggists Mut.
Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 152–153 (1980); Orr v. Orr, 440
U. S. 268, 283–284 (1979); Stanton, 421 U. S., at 17–18;
Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535,
