RICHARD A. LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO,
PETITIONER v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
[June 1, 2010]

JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that principles of comity bar the
present action. I am doubtful about the Court’s efforts to
distinguish Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (2004), but
whether today’s holding undermines Hibbs’ foundations is
a question that can be left for another day.
