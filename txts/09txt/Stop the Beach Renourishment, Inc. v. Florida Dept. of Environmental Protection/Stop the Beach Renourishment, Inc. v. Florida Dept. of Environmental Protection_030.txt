STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- 

IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

Opinion of the Court 


(same). Second, as we described supra, at 3–4, if an avul
sion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had
previously been submerged, that land belongs to the State
even if it interrupts the littoral owner’s contact with the
water. See Bryant, 238 So. 2d, at 837, 838–839. The issue
here is whether there is an exception to this rule when the
State is the cause of the avulsion. Prior law suggests
there is not. In Martin v. Busch, 93 Fla. 535, 112 So. 274
(1927), the Florida Supreme Court held that when the
State drained water from a lakebed belonging to the State,
causing land that was formerly below the mean high
water line to become dry land, that land continued to
belong to the State. Id., at 574, 112 So., at 287; see also
Bryant, supra, at 838–839 (analogizing the situation in
Martin to an avulsion). “ ‘The riparian rights doctrine of
accretion and reliction,’ ” the Florida Supreme Court later
explained, “ ‘does not apply to such lands.’ ” Bryant, supra,
at 839 (quoting Martin, supra, at 578, 112 So., at 288
(Brown, J., concurring)). This is not surprising, as there can
be no accretions to land that no longer abuts the water.
Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below
allowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the result
ing sudden exposure of previously submerged land was
treated like an avulsion for purposes of ownership. The
right to accretions was therefore subordinate to the State’s
right to fill. Thiesen v. Gulf, Florida & Alabama R. Co.
suggests the same result. That case involved a claim by a
riparian landowner that a railroad’s state-authorized
filling of submerged land and construction of tracks upon
it interfered with the riparian landowners’ rights to access
and to wharf out to a shipping channel. The Florida Su
preme Court determined that the claimed right to wharf
out did not exist in Florida, and that therefore only the
right of access was compensable. 75 Fla., at 58–65, 78 So.,
at 501–503. Significantly, although the court recognized
that the riparian-property owners had rights to accretion,
