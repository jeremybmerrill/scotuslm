STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- 

IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

Syllabus 

vant precedents,” Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290, 296 (Stewart,
J., concurring)—is misdirected. What counts is not whether there is
precedent for the allegedly confiscatory decision, but whether the
property right allegedly taken was well established. Pp. 20–24.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, agreed that the
Florida Supreme Court did not take property without just compensa
tion, but concluded that this case does not require the Court to de
termine whether, or when, a judicial decision determining property
owners’ rights can violate the Takings Clause. If and when future
cases show that the usual principles, including constitutional ones
that constrain the judiciary like due process, are inadequate to pro
tect property owners, then the question whether a judicial decision
can effect a taking would be properly presented. Pp. 1–10.
JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, agreed that no un
constitutional taking occurred here, but concluded that it is unneces
sary to decide more than that to resolve this case. Difficult questions
of constitutional law—e.g., whether federal courts may review a state
court’s decision to determine if it unconstitutionally takes private
property without compensation, and what the proper test is for evalu
ating whether a state-court property decision enacts an unconstitu
tional taking—need not be addressed in order to dispose “of the im
mediate case.” Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366,
373. Such questions are better left for another day. Pp. 1–3.
