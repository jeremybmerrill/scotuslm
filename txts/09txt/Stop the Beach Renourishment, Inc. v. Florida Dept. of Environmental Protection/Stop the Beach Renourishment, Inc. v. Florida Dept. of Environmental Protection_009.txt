Opinion of the Court

boundary between privately owned littoral property and
state property. §161.191(1). Once the erosion-control line
is recorded, the common law ceases to increase upland
property by accretion (or decrease it by erosion).
§161.191(2). Thus, when accretion to the shore moves the
mean high-water line seaward, the property of beachfront
landowners is not extended to that line (as the prior law
provided), but remains bounded by the permanent erosion
control line. Those landowners “continue to be entitled,”
however, “to all common-law riparian rights” other than
the right to accretions. §161.201. If the beach erodes back
landward of the erosion-control line over a substantial
portion of the shoreline covered by the project, the Board
may, on its own initiative, or must, if asked by the owners
or lessees of a majority of the property affected, direct the
agency responsible for maintaining the beach to return the
beach to the condition contemplated by the project. If that
is not done within a year, the project is canceled and the
erosion-control line is null and void. §161.211(2), (3).
Finally, by regulation, if the use of submerged land would
“unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” the project
cannot proceed unless the local governments show that
they own or have a property interest in the upland prop
erty adjacent to the project site. Fla. Admin. Code Rule
18–21.004(3)(b) (2009).

In 2003, the city of Destin and Walton County applied
for the necessary permits to restore 6.9 miles of beach
within their jurisdictions that had been eroded by several
hurricanes. The project envisioned depositing along that
shore sand dredged from further out. See Walton Cty. v.
Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc., 998 So. 2d 1102, 1106
(Fla. 2008). It would add about 75 feet of dry sand sea
ward of the mean high-water line (to be denominated the
erosion-control line). The Department issued a notice of
