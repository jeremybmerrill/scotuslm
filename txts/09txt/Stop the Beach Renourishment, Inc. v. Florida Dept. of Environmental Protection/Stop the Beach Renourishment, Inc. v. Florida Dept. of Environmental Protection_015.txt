the Court
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

One cannot know whether a takings claim is invalid with
out knowing what standard it has failed to meet.6 Which
means that JUSTICE BREYER must either (a) grapple with
the artificial question of what would constitute a judicial
taking if there were such a thing as a judicial taking
(reminiscent of the perplexing question how much wood
would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck
wood?), or (b) answer in the negative what he considers to
be the “unnecessary” constitutional question whether
there is such a thing as a judicial taking.
It is not true that deciding the constitutional question in
this case contradicts our settled practice. To the contrary,
we have often recognized the existence of a constitutional
right, or established the test for violation of such a right
(or both), and then gone on to find that the claim at issue
fails. See, e.g., New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 333,
341–343 (1985) (holding that the Fourth Amendment
applies to searches and seizures conducted by public
school officials, establishing the standard for finding a
violation, but concluding that the claim at issue failed);
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 687, 698–700
(1984) (recognizing a constitutional right to effective assis
tance of counsel, establishing the test for its violation, but
holding that the claim at issue failed); Hill v. Lockhart,
474 U. S. 52, 58–60 (1985) (holding that a Strickland
claim can be brought to challenge a guilty plea, but reject
ing the claim at issue); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307,
313–320, 326 (1979) (recognizing a due process claim
based on insufficiency of evidence, establishing the govern
ing test, but concluding that the claim at issue failed);
Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 390,
——————
6 Thus,

the landmark case of Penn Central Trans. Co. v. New York,
438 U. S. 104, 124–128, 138 (1978), held that there was no taking only
after setting forth a multi-factor test for determining whether a regula
tion restricting the use of property effects a taking.
