STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- 

IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

Opinion of KENNEDY, J. 


press most of their judicial takings claims before state
courts, which are “presumptively competent . . . to adjudi
cate claims arising under the laws of the United States.”
Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990). If and when
future cases show that the usual principles, including
constitutional principles that constrain the judiciary like
due process, are somehow inadequate to protect property
owners, then the question whether a judicial decision can
effect a taking would be properly presented. In the mean
time, it seems appropriate to recognize that the substan
tial power to decide whose property to take and when to
take it should be conceived of as a power vested in the
political branches and subject to political control.
