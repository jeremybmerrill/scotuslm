STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- 

IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

the Court
Opinion of SCALIA, J. 


fer of property to the State or to another private party by
eminent domain, the Takings Clause applies to other state
actions that achieve the same thing. Thus, when the
government uses its own property in such a way that it
destroys private property, it has taken that property. See
United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256, 261–262 (1946);
Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, 177–178 (1872).
Similarly, our doctrine of regulatory takings “aims to
identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent
to the classic taking.” Lingle v. Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 544
U. S. 528, 539 (2005). Thus, it is a taking when a state
regulation forces a property owner to submit to a perma
nent physical occupation, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhat
tan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 425–426 (1982), or de
prives him of all economically beneficial use of his
property, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505
U. S. 1003, 1019 (1992). Finally (and here we approach
the situation before us), States effect a taking if they
recharacterize as public property what was previously
private property. See Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v.
Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 163–165 (1980).
The Takings Clause (unlike, for instance, the Ex Post
Facto Clauses, see Art. I, §9, cl. 3; §10, cl. 1) is not ad
dressed to the action of a specific branch or branches. It is
concerned simply with the act, and not with the govern
mental actor (“nor shall private property be taken” (em
phasis added)). There is no textual justification for saying
that the existence or the scope of a State’s power to expro
priate private property without just compensation varies
according to the branch of government effecting the expro
priation. Nor does common sense recommend such a
principle. It would be absurd to allow a State to do by
judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by
legislative fiat. See Stevens v. Cannon Beach, 510 U. S.
1207, 1211–1212 (1994) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from denial
of certiorari).
