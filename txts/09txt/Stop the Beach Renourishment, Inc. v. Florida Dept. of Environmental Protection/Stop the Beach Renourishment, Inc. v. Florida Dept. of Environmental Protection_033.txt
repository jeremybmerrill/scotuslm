Opinion of the Court

rejecting it.12
V
Because the Florida Supreme Court’s decision did not
contravene the established property rights of petitioner’s
Members, Florida has not violated the Fifth and Four
teenth Amendments. The judgment of the Florida Su
preme Court is therefore affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS took no part in the decision of this
case.

——————
12 Petitioner also argues that the Members’ other littoral rights have
been infringed because the Act replaces their common-law rights with
inferior statutory versions. Petitioner has not established that the
statutory versions are inferior; and whether the source of a property
right is the common law or a statute makes no difference, so long as the
property owner continues to have what he previously had.
