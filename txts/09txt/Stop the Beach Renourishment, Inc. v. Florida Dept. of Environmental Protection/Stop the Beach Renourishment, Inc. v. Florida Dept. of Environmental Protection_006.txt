STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- 

IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

Opinion of the Court 


public the land permanently submerged beneath naviga
ble waters and the foreshore (the land between the low
tide line and the mean high-water line). Fla. Const.,
Art. X, §11; Broward v. Mabry, 58 Fla. 398, 407–409, 50
So. 826, 829–830 (1909). Thus, the mean high-water line
(the average reach of high tide over the preceding 19
years) is the ordinary boundary between private beach
front, or littoral1 property, and state-owned land. See
Miller v. Bay-To-Gulf, Inc., 141 Fla. 452, 458–460, 193 So.
425, 427–428 (1940) (per curiam); Fla. Stat. §§177.27(14)–
(15), 177.28(1) (2007).
Littoral owners have, in addition to the rights of the
public, certain “special rights” with regard to the water
and the foreshore, Broward, 58 Fla., at 410, 50 So., at 830,
rights which Florida considers to be property, generally
akin to easements, see ibid.; Thiesen v. Gulf, Florida &
Alabama R. Co., 75 Fla. 28, 57, 78, 78 So. 491, 500, 507
(1918) (on rehearing). These include the right of access to
the water, the right to use the water for certain purposes,
the right to an unobstructed view of the water, and the
right to receive accretions and relictions to the littoral
property. Id., at 58–59, 78 So., at 501; Board of Trustees
of Internal Improvement Trust Fund v. Sand Key Assoc.,
Ltd., 512 So. 2d 934, 936 (Fla. 1987). This is generally in
accord with well-established common law, although the
precise property rights vary among jurisdictions. Com
pare Broward, supra, at 409–410, 50 So., at 830, with 1 J.
Lewis, Law of Eminent Domain §100 (3d ed. 1909); 1 H.
Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights §62, pp. 278–
——————
1 Many cases and statutes use “riparian” to mean abutting any body
of water. The Florida Supreme Court, however, has adopted a more
precise usage whereby “riparian” means abutting a river or stream and
“littoral” means abutting an ocean, sea, or lake. Walton Cty. v. Stop the
Beach Renourishment, Inc., 998 So. 2d 1102, 1105, n. 3 (2008). When
speaking of the Florida law applicable to this case, we follow the
Florida Supreme Court’s terminology.
