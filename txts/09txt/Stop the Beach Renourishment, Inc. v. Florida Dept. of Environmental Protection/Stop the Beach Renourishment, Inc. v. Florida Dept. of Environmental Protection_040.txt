Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

changes in property rights that are beneficial, or thought
to be so, are fair and proper because just compensation
will be paid. The judiciary historically has not had the
right or responsibility to say what property should or
should not be taken.
Indeed, it is unclear whether the Takings Clause was
understood, as a historical matter, to apply to judicial
decisions. The Framers most likely viewed this Clause as
applying only to physical appropriation pursuant to the
power of eminent domain. See Lucas v. South Carolina
Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1028, n. 15 (1992). And it
appears these physical appropriations were traditionally
made by legislatures. See 3 J. Story, Commentaries on
the Constitution of the United States §1784, p. 661 (1833).
Courts, on the other hand, lacked the power of eminent
domain. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 135 (W.
Lewis ed. 1897). The Court’s Takings Clause jurispru
dence has expanded beyond the Framers’ understanding,
as it now applies to certain regulations that are not physi
cal appropriations. See Lucas, supra, at 1014 (citing
Mahon, 260 U. S. 393). But the Court should consider
with care the decision to extend the Takings Clause in
a manner that might be inconsistent with historical
practice.
There are two additional practical considerations that
the Court would need to address before recognizing judi
cial takings. First, it may be unclear in certain situations
how a party should properly raise a judicial takings claim.
“[I]t is important to separate out two judicial actions—the
decision to change current property rules in a way that
would constitute a taking, and the decision to require
compensation.”
Thompson, Judicial Takings, 76 Va.
L. Rev. 1449, 1515 (1990). In some contexts, these issues
could arise separately. For instance, assume that a state
court opinion explicitly holds that it is changing state
property law, or that it asserts that is not changing the
