STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- 

IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

Opinion of the Court 


added to the shore by avulsion, the littoral owner has no
right to subsequent accretions. Those accretions no longer
add to his property, since the property abutting the water
belongs not to him but to the State. See Maloney §126.6,
at 393; 1 Farnham §71a, at 328.

In 1961, Florida’s Legislature passed the Beach and
Shore Preservation Act, 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 61–246, as
amended, Fla. Stat. §§161.011–161.45 (2007). The Act
establishes procedures for “beach restoration and nour
ishment projects,” §161.088, designed to deposit sand on
eroded beaches (restoration) and to maintain the deposited
sand (nourishment). §§161.021(3), (4). A local govern
ment may apply to the Department of Environmental
Protection for the funds and the necessary permits to
restore a beach, see §§161.101(1), 161.041(1). When the
project involves placing fill on the State’s submerged
lands, authorization is required from the Board of Trus
tees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, see
§253.77(1), which holds title to those lands, §253.12(1).
Once a beach restoration “is determined to be under
taken,” the Board sets what is called “an erosion control
line.” §§161.161(3)–(5). It must be set by reference to the
existing mean high-water line, though in theory it can be
located seaward or landward of that.2 See §161.161(5).
Much of the project work occurs seaward of the erosion
control line, as sand is dumped on what was once sub
merged land. See App. 87–88. The fixed erosion-control
line replaces the fluctuating mean high-water line as the
——————
2 We assume, as the parties agree we should, that in this case the
erosion-control line is the pre-existing mean high-water line. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 11–12. Respondents concede that, if the erosion-control line
were established landward of that, the State would have taken prop
erty. Brief for Respondent Department et al. 15; Brief for Respondent
