Opinion of the Court

see id., at 64–65, 78 So., at 502–503, the only rights it
even suggested would be infringed by the railroad were
the right of access (which the plaintiff had claimed) and
the rights of view and use of the water (which it seems the
plaintiff had not claimed), see id., at 58–59, 78, 78 So., at
501, 507.
The Florida Supreme Court decision before us is consis
tent with these background principles of state property
law. Cf. Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1028–1029; Scranton v.
Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141, 163 (1900). It did not abolish the
Members’ right to future accretions, but merely held that
the right was not implicated by the beach-restoration
project, because the doctrine of avulsion applied. See 998
So. 2d, at 1117, 1120–1121. The Florida Supreme Court’s
opinion describes beach restoration as the reclamation by
the State of the public’s land, just as Martin had described
the lake drainage in that case. Although the opinion does
not cite Martin and is not always clear on this point, it
suffices that its characterization of the littoral right to
accretion is consistent with Martin and the other relevant
principles of Florida law we have discussed.
What we have said shows that the rule of Sand Key,
which petitioner repeatedly invokes, is inapposite. There
the Florida Supreme Court held that an artificial accretion
does not change the right of a littoral-property owner to
claim the accreted land as his own (as long as the owner
did not cause the accretion himself). 512 So. 2d, at 937–
938. The reason Martin did not apply, Sand Key ex
plained, is that the drainage that had occurred in Martin
did not lower the water level by “ ‘imperceptible degrees,’ ”
and so did not qualify as an accretion. 512 So. 2d, at 940–
941.
The result under Florida law may seem counter
intuitive. After all, the Members’ property has been de
prived of its character (and value) as oceanfront property
by the State’s artificial creation of an avulsion. Perhaps
