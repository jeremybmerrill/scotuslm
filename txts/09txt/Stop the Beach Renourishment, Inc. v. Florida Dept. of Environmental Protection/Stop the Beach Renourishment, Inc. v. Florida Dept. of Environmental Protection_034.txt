STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC., 

PETITIONER v. FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF 

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

FLORIDA

[June 17, 2010] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR
joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
The Court’s analysis of the principles that control own
ership of the land in question, and of the rights of peti
tioner’s members as adjacent owners, is correct in my
view, leading to my joining Parts I, IV, and V of the
Court’s opinion. As JUSTICE BREYER observes, however,
this case does not require the Court to determine whether,
or when, a judicial decision determining the rights of
property owners can violate the Takings Clause of the
Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. This
separate opinion notes certain difficulties that should be
considered before accepting the theory that a judicial
decision that eliminates an “established property right,”
ante, at 21, constitutes a violation of the Takings Clause.
The Takings Clause is an essential part of the constitu
tional structure, for it protects private property from
expropriation without just compensation; and the right to
own and hold property is necessary to the exercise and
preservation of freedom. The right to retain property
without the fact or even the threat of that sort of expro
priation is, of course, applicable to the States under the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chi
