the Court
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

The Florida Supreme Court answered the certified
question in the negative, and quashed the First District’s
remand. Id., at 1121. It faulted the Court of Appeal for
not considering the doctrine of avulsion, which it con
cluded permitted the State to reclaim the restored beach
on behalf of the public. Id., at 1116–1118. It described the
right to accretions as a future contingent interest, not a
vested property right, and held that there is no littoral
right to contact with the water independent of the littoral
right of access, which the Act does not infringe. Id., at
1112, 1119–1120. Petitioner sought rehearing on the
ground that the Florida Supreme Court’s decision itself
effected a taking of the Members’ littoral rights contrary
to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal
Constitution.4 The request for rehearing was denied. We
granted certiorari, 557 U. S. ___ (2009).

Before coming to the parties’ arguments in the present
case, we discuss some general principles of our takings
jurisprudence. The Takings Clause—“nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensa
tion,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5—applies as fully to the taking
of a landowner’s riparian rights as it does to the taking of
an estate in land.5 See Yates v. Milwaukee, 10 Wall. 497,
504 (1871). Moreover, though the classic taking is a trans

4 We ordinarily do not consider an issue first presented to a state
court in a petition for rehearing if the state court did not address it.
See Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 89, n. 3 (1997) (per curiam). But
where the state-court decision itself is claimed to constitute a violation
of federal law, the state court’s refusal to address that claim put for
ward in a petition for rehearing will not bar our review. See Brinker
hoff-Faris Trust & Sav. Co. v. Hill, 281 U. S. 673, 677–678 (1930).
5 We thus need not resolve whether the right of accretion is an ease
ment, as petitioner claims, or, as Florida claims, a contingent future
interest.
