Opinion of the Court

280 (1904) (hereinafter Farnham).
At the center of this case is the right to accretions and
relictions. Accretions are additions of alluvion (sand,
sediment, or other deposits) to waterfront land; relictions
are lands once covered by water that become dry when the
water recedes. F. Maloney, S. Plager, & F. Baldwin, Wa
ter Law and Administration: The Florida Experience §126,
pp. 385–386 (1968) (hereinafter Maloney); 1 Farnham §69,
at 320. (For simplicity’s sake, we shall refer to accretions
and relictions collectively as accretions, and the process
whereby they occur as accretion.) In order for an addition
to dry land to qualify as an accretion, it must have oc
curred gradually and imperceptibly—that is, so slowly
that one could not see the change occurring, though over
time the difference became apparent. Sand Key, supra, at
936; County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 66–67
(1874). When, on the other hand, there is a “sudden or
perceptible loss of or addition to land by the action of the
water or a sudden change in the bed of a lake or the course
of a stream,” the change is called an avulsion. Sand Key,
supra, at 936; see also 1 Farnham §69, at 320.
In Florida, as at common law, the littoral owner auto
matically takes title to dry land added to his property by
accretion; but formerly submerged land that has become
dry land by avulsion continues to belong to the owner of
the seabed (usually the State). See, e.g., Sand Key, supra,
at 937; Maloney §126.6, at 392; 2 W. Blackstone, Commen
taries on the Laws of England 261–262 (1766) (hereinafter
Blackstone). Thus, regardless of whether an avulsive
event exposes land previously submerged or submerges
land previously exposed, the boundary between littoral
property and sovereign land does not change; it remains
(ordinarily) what was the mean high-water line before the
event. See Bryant v. Peppe, 238 So. 2d 836, 838–839 (Fla.
1970); J. Gould, Law of Waters §158, p. 290 (1883). It
follows from this that, when a new strip of land has been
