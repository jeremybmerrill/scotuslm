STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- 

IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

the Court
Opinion of SCALIA, J. 


395–397 (1926) (recognizing that block zoning ordinances
could constitute a taking, but holding that the challenged
ordinance did not do so); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chi
cago, 166 U. S. 226, 241, 255–257 (1897) (holding that the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohib
its uncompensated takings, but concluding that the court
below made no errors of law in assessing just compensa
tion). In constitutional-tort suits against public officials,
we have found the defendants entitled to immunity only
after holding that their action violated the Constitution.
See, e.g., Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 605–606 (1999).
Indeed, up until last Term, we required federal courts to
address the constitutional question before the immunity
question. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001),
overruled by Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 10).
“Assuming without deciding” would be less appropriate
here than it was in many of those earlier cases, which
established constitutional rights quite separate from any
that had previously been acknowledged. Compared to
Strickland’s proclamation of a right to effective assistance
of counsel, for example, proclaiming that a taking can
occur through judicial action addresses a point of relative
detail.
In sum, JUSTICE BREYER cannot decide that petitioner’s
claim fails without first deciding what a valid claim would
consist of. His agreement with Part IV of our opinion
necessarily implies agreement with the test for a judicial
taking (elaborated in Part II–A) which Part IV applies:
whether the state court has “declare[d] that what was
once an established right of private property no longer
exists,” supra, at 10. JUSTICE BREYER must either agree
with that standard or craft one of his own. And agreeing
to or crafting a hypothetical standard for a hypothetical
constitutional right is sufficiently unappealing (we have
eschewed that course many times in the past) that
