the Court
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

JUSTICE BREYER might as well acknowledge the right as
well. Or he could avoid the need to agree with or craft a
hypothetical standard by denying the right. But embrac
ing a standard while being coy about the right is, well,
odd; and deciding this case while addressing neither the
standard nor the right is quite impossible.
JUSTICE BREYER responds that he simply advocates
resolving this case without establishing “the precise stan
dard under which a party wins or loses.” Post, at 3 (em
phasis added). But he relies upon no standard at all,
precise or imprecise. He simply pronounces that this is
not a judicial taking if there is such a thing as a judicial
taking. The cases he cites to support this Queen-of-Hearts
approach provide no precedent. In each of them the exis
tence of the right in question was settled,7 and we faced a
choice between competing standards that had been applied
by the courts.8 We simply held that the right in question
had not been infringed under any of them. There is no
established right here, and no competing standards.

7 See Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9–16)
(ineffective assistance of counsel); Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246,
255 (1978) (equal protection); Mercer v. Theriot, 377 U. S. 152, 155
(1964) (per curiam) (right to judgment notwithstanding the verdict
where evidence is lacking).
8 See Spisak, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16). Quilloin’s cryptic rejection
of the claim “[u]nder any standard of review,” 434 U. S., at 256, could
only refer to the various levels of scrutiny—such as “strict” or “rational
basis”—that we had applied to equal-protection claims, see Loving v.
Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1967). And in Mercer, which found the
evidence “sufficient under any standard which might be appropriate—
state or federal,” 377 U. S., at 156, one of the parties had argued for an
established standard under Louisiana law, and the other for an estab
lished federal standard. Compare Brief for Petitioner in Mercer v.
Theriot, O. T. 1963, No. 336, pp. 18–22, with Brief for Respondent in
Mercer v. Theriot, p. 5.
