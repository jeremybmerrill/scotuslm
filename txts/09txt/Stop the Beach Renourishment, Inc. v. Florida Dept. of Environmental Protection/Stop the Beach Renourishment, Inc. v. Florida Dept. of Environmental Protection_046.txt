Opinion of BREYER, J.

The plurality criticizes me for my cautious approach,
and states that I “cannot decide that petitioner’s claim
fails without first deciding what a valid claim would con
sist of.” Ante, at 12. But, of course, courts frequently find
it possible to resolve cases—even those raising constitu
tional questions—without specifying the precise standard
under which a party wins or loses. See, e.g., Smith v.
Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16) (“With or
without such deference, our conclusion is the same”);
Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 256 (1978) (rejecting an
equal protection claim “[u]nder any standard of review”);
Mercer v. Theriot, 377 U. S. 152, 156 (1964) (per curiam)
(finding evidence sufficient to support a verdict “under any
standard”). That is simply what I would do here.
In the past, Members of this Court have warned us that,
when faced with difficult constitutional questions, we
should “confine ourselves to deciding only what is neces
sary to the disposition of the immediate case.” Whitehouse
v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 373 (1955); see
also Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn.,
485 U. S. 439, 445 (1988) (“A fundamental and longstand
ing principle of judicial restraint requires that courts
avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the
necessity of deciding them”); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S.
288, 346–347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (“The Court
will not anticipate a question of constitutional law in
advance of the necessity of deciding it. It is not the habit
of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature
unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case”
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). I heed
this advice here. There is no need now to decide more
than what the Court decides in Parts IV and V, namely,
that the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in this case did
not amount to a “judicial taking.”
