legislature and the executive—not the courts. See First
English, supra, at 321 (“[T]he decision to exercise the
power of eminent domain is a legislative function”).
If a judicial decision, as opposed to an act of the execu
tive or the legislature, eliminates an established property
right, the judgment could be set aside as a deprivation of
property without due process of law. The Due Process
Clause, in both its substantive and procedural aspects, is a
central limitation upon the exercise of judicial power. And
this Court has long recognized that property regulations
can be invalidated under the Due Process Clause. See,
e.g., Lingle v. Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 544 U. S. 528, 542
(2005); Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 591, 592–
593 (1962); Demorest v. City Bank Farmers Trust Co., 321
U. S. 36, 42–43 (1944); Broad River Power Co. v. South
Carolina ex rel. Daniel, 281 U. S. 537, 539, 540–541
(1930); Washington ex rel. Seattle Title Trust Co. v.
Roberge, 278 U. S. 116, 121 (1928); Nectow v. Cambridge,
277 U. S. 183, 188 (1928); Village of Euclid v. Ambler
Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 395 (1926); see also Pennsyl
vania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 413 (1922) (there
must be limits on government’s ability to diminish prop
erty values by regulation “or the contract and due process
clauses are gone”). It is thus natural to read the Due
Process Clause as limiting the power of courts to eliminate
or change established property rights.
The Takings Clause also protects property rights, and it
“operates as a conditional limitation, permitting the gov
ernment to do what it wants so long as it pays the charge.”
Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, 545 (1998)
(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in
part). Unlike the Due Process Clause, therefore, the
Takings Clause implicitly recognizes a governmental
power while placing limits upon that power. Thus, if the
Court were to hold that a judicial taking exists, it would
presuppose that a judicial decision eliminating established
