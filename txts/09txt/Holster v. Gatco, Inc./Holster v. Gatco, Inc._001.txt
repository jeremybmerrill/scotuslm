GINSBURG, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
CHARLES E. HOLSTER, III v. GATCO, INC. DBA FOLIO
ASSOCIATES
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 08–1307. Decided April 19, 2010 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
dissenting.
Petitioner Charles Holster filed this putative class
action against Gatco, Inc., in federal court, invoking the
court’s jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act of

as a class action.” §901(b). The District Court noted that,
pursuant to §901(b), New York courts had closed their
doors to class actions seeking statutory damages under the
TCPA. 485 F. Supp. 2d 179, 185 (EDNY 2007).
Adopting its prior decision in Bonime v. Avaya, Inc., 547
F. 3d 497 (2008), the Second Circuit summarily affirmed.
Bonime held that §901(b) barred TCPA claims brought as
