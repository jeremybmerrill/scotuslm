HOLSTER v. GATCO, INC.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938). 547 F. 3d, at
501–502.
As a “second, independent” ground for its holding, the
Bonime panel stated:
“The private right of action created by the TCPA al
lows a person or entity to, ‘if otherwise permitted by
the laws or rules of court of a State, bring . . .’ an ac
tion for a violation of the TCPA. See 47 U. S. C.
§227(b)(3) (emphasis added). This statutory language
is unambiguous—a claim under the TCPA cannot be
brought if not permitted by state law. ‘In determining
the proper interpretation of a statute, this court will
look first to the plain language of a statute and inter
pret it by its ordinary, common meaning. If the statu
tory terms are unambiguous, our review generally
ends and the statute is construed according to the
plain meaning of its words.’ Tyler v. Douglas, 280
F. 3d 116, 122 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations, quo
tation marks, and alteration omitted). This provision
constitutes an express limitation on the TCPA which
federal courts are required to respect.” Id., at 502.
Judge Calabresi concurred, joining only the second
ground “identified by the majority for its conclusion.” Ibid.
As Judge Calabresi explained:
“A state law that bars suit in state court, like
C. P. L. R. 901(b), . . . effectively eliminates the cause
of action created under the TCPA because it elimi
nates the ‘may’ and the rest of the phrase that follows
(‘bring . . . an action’). Federal law (the TCPA’s cause
of action) directs courts to look to ‘the laws’ and ‘rules
of court’ of a state. Thus, when a state refuses to rec
ognize a cause of action, there remains no cause of ac
tion to which any grant of federal court jurisdiction
could attach.” Id., at 503.
