GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Although Shady Grove may bear on the Second Circuit’s
Erie analysis,* nothing in Shady Grove calls for a reading
of §227(b)(3) that fails fully to honor “the laws [and] rules
of court of [New York] State.” The Second Circuit’s inter
pretation of the TCPA’s private-right-of-action authoriza
tion stands on its own footing as an adequate and inde
pendent ground for dismissing Holster’s suit. I would
spare the Court of Appeals the necessity of revisiting—
and, presumably, reinstating—its TCPA-grounded ruling.

——————
* Holster, however, arguably forfeited the argument, accepted in
Shady Grove, that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 preempts §901(b);
the District Court concluded that Rule 23 and §901(b) did not conflict
and noted that Holster “d[id] not dispute” that point. 485 F. Supp. 2d
179, 185, n. 3 (EDNY 2007).
