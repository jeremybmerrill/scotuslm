Opinion of the Court

trates that traditional coupling. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 98–
65, p. 9 (1983) (discussing the practice of “ ‘loading up’ [on
debt] in contemplation of bankruptcy”); Report of the
Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States,
H. R. Doc. No. 93–137, pt. I, p. 11 (1973) (“[T]he most
serious abuse of consumer bankruptcy is the number of
instances in which individuals have purchased a sizable
quantity of goods and services on credit on the eve of
bankruptcy in contemplation of obtaining a discharge”).
The Government also points to early American and Eng
lish judicial decisions to corroborate its contention that “in
contemplation of” bankruptcy signifies abusive conduct.
See, e.g., In re Pearce, 19 F. Cas. 50, 53 (No. 10,873) (D. Vt.
1843); Morgan v. Brundrett, 5 B. Ad. 288, 296–297, 110
Eng. Rep. 798, 801 (K. B. 1833) (Parke, J.).
To bolster its textual claim, the Government relies on
§526(a)(4)’s immediate context. According to the Govern
ment, the other three subsections of §526(a) are designed
to protect debtors from abusive practices by debt relief
agencies: §526(a)(1) requires debt relief agencies to per
form all promised services; §526(a)(2) prohibits them from
making or advising debtors to make false or misleading
statements in bankruptcy; and §526(a)(3) prohibits them
from misleading debtors regarding the costs or benefits of
bankruptcy. When §526(a)(4) is read in context of these
debtor-protective provisions, the Government argues,
construing it to prevent debt relief agencies from giving
advice that is beneficial to both debtors and their creditors
seems particularly nonsensical.
Finally, the Government contends that the BAPCPA’s
remedies for violations of §526(a)(4) similarly corroborate
its narrow reading. Section 526(c) provides remedies for a
debt relief agency’s violation of §526, §527, or §528.
Among the actions authorized, a debtor may sue the at
torney for remittal of fees, actual damages, and reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs; a state attorney general may sue
