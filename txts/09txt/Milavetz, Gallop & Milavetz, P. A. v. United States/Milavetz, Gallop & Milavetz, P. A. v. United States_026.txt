Opinion of the Court

lous as the result of which Milavetz complains. Once
again, we decline Milavetz’s invitation to adopt a view of
the statute that is contrary to its plain meaning and would
produce an absurd result.
Because §528’s requirements that Milavetz identify
itself as a debt relief agency and include certain informa
tion about its bankruptcy-assistance and related services
are “reasonably related to the [Government’s] interest in
preventing deception of consumers,” Zauderer, 471 U. S.,
at 651, we uphold those provisions as applied to Milavetz.
IV
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is affirmed as to §§101(12A)
and 528 and reversed as to §526(a)(4), and the cases are
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
