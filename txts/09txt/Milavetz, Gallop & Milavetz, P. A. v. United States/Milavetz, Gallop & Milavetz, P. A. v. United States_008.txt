Opinion of the Court

ruptcy laws, 541 F. 3d, at 793, the majority held that
§526(a)(4) could not withstand either strict or intermedi
ate scrutiny. In dissent, Judge Colloton argued that
§526(a)(4) should be read narrowly to prevent only advice

constitutional.

who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted
person” in return for payment. §101(12A). By definition,
“bankruptcy assistance” includes several services com

United States ex rel. Mukasey, 553 F. 3d 743, 761, 764 (CA5 2008)
(holding that §526(a)(4) can be narrowly construed to prohibit only
advice to abuse or manipulate the bankruptcy system and that, so
construed, it is constitutional).
