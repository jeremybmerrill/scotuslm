Opinion of the Court

to exclude attorneys in order to forestall serious doubts as
to the validity of §§526 and 528. The avoidance canon,
however, “is a tool for choosing between competing plausi
ble interpretations of a statutory text.” Clark v. Martinez,
543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005). In applying that tool, we will
consider only those constructions of a statute that are
“ ‘fairly possible.’ ” United States v. Security Industrial
Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 78 (1982). For the reasons already
discussed, the text and statutory context of §101(12A)
foreclose a reading of “debt relief agency” that excludes
attorneys. Accordingly, we hold that attorneys who pro

Having concluded that attorneys are debt relief agencies
when they provide qualifying services, we next address the
scope and validity of §526(a)(4). Characterizing the stat

interest in restricting, the Eighth Circuit found the rule
substantially overbroad. 541 F. 3d, at 793–794, and n. 10.
For the reasons that follow, we reject that conclusion.
Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from
“advis[ing] an assisted person” either “to incur more debt
in contemplation of” filing for bankruptcy “or to pay an
attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for
services” performed in preparation for filing. Only the
first of these prohibitions is at issue. In debating the
correctness of the Court of Appeals’ decision, the parties
first dispute the provision’s scope. The Court of Appeals
concluded that “§526(a)(4) broadly prohibits a debt relief
agency from advising an assisted person . . . to incur any
additional debt when the assisted person is contemplating
bankruptcy.” Id., at 793. Under that reading, an attorney
