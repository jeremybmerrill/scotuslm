Opinion of THOMAS, J.

sures.1 Because no party asks us to do so here, however, I
agree with the Court that the Zauderer standard governs
our review of the challenge to §528 brought by the Milav
etz law firm and the other plaintiffs in this action (herein
after Milavetz).
Yet even under Zauderer, we “have not presumptively
endorsed” laws requiring the use of “government-scripted
disclaimers” in commercial advertising. See Borgner v.
Florida Bd. of Dentistry, 537 U. S. 1080, 1082 (2002)
(THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Zaud
erer upheld the imposition of sanctions against an attor
ney under a rule of professional conduct that required
advertisements for contingency-fee services to disclose
that losing clients might be responsible for litigation fees
and costs. See 471 U. S., at 650–653. Importantly, how
ever, Zauderer’s advertisement was found to be misleading
on its face, and the regulation in that case did not man
date the specific form or text of the disclosure. Ibid. Thus,
Zauderer does not stand for the proposition that the gov
ernment can constitutionally compel the use of a scripted
disclaimer in any circumstance in which its interest in

1 I have no quarrel with the principle that advertisements that are
false or misleading, or that propose an illegal transaction, may be
proscribed. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 520
(1996) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
Furthermore, I acknowledge this Court’s longstanding assumption that
a consumer-fraud regulation that compels the disclosure of certain
factual information in advertisements may intrude less significantly on
First Amendment interests than an outright prohibition on all adver
tisements that have the potential to mislead. See, e.g., Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,
771–772 (1976); Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, 651–652, n. 14 (1985); Riley v. National
Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796, n. 9 (1988);
Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447
U. S. 557, 565 (1980). But even if that assumption is correct, I doubt
that it justifies an entirely different standard of review for regulations
that compel, rather than suppress, commercial speech.
