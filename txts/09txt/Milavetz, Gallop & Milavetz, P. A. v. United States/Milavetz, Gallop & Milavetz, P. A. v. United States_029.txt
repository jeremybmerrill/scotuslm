Opinion of SCALIA, J.

where the statutory text is unambiguously in their favor;
and to attack an unambiguous text that is against them.
If legislative history is relevant to confirm that a clear text
means what it says, it is presumably relevant to show that
an apparently clear text does not mean what it seems to
say. Even for those who believe in the legal fiction that
committee reports reflect congressional intent, footnote 3
is a bridge too far.
