MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED 

STATES

Opinion of THOMAS, J. 


Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626 (1985), that laws that require
the disclosure of factual information in commercial adver
tising may be upheld so long as they are “reasonably
related” to the government’s interest in preventing con
sumer deception, id., at 651.
I am skeptical of the premise on which Zauderer rests—
that, in the commercial-speech context, “the First Amend
ment interests implicated by disclosure requirements are
substantially weaker than those at stake when speech is
actually suppressed,” id., at 652, n. 14; see id., at 650
(citing “material differences between disclosure require
ments and outright prohibitions on speech”). We have
refused in other contexts to attach any “constitutional
significance” to the difference between regulations that
compel protected speech and regulations that restrict it.
See, e.g., Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C.,
Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796–797 (1988). I see no reason why
that difference should acquire constitutional significance
merely because the regulations at issue involve commer
cial speech. See Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott,
Inc., 521 U. S. 457, 480–481 (1997) (Souter, J., dissenting)
(arguing that “commercial speech is . . . subject to [this]
First Amendment principle: that compelling cognizable
speech officially is just as suspect as suppressing it, and is
typically subject to the same level of scrutiny”); id., at 504
(THOMAS, J., dissenting); cf. United States v. United Foods,
Inc., 533 U. S. 405, 419 (2001) (THOMAS, J., concurring)
(stating that regulations that compel funding for commer
cial advertising “must be subjected to the most stringent
First Amendment scrutiny”).
Accordingly, I would be willing to reexamine Zauderer
and its progeny in an appropriate case to determine
whether these precedents provide sufficient First Amend
ment protection against government-mandated disclo
