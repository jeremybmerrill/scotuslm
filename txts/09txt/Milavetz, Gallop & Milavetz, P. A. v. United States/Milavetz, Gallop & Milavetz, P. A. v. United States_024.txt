Opinion of the Court

the restrictions as insufficiently tailored to any substan
tial state interest, 455 U. S., at 205–206. In so holding,
the Court emphasized that States retain authority to
regulate inherently misleading advertisements, particu
larly through disclosure requirements, and it noted that
advertisements for professional services pose a special risk
of deception. See id., at 203, 207.
Milavetz makes much of the fact that the Government
in these consolidated cases has adduced no evidence that
its advertisements are misleading. Zauderer forecloses
that argument: “When the possibility of deception is as
self-evident as it is in this case, we need not require the
State to ‘conduct a survey of the . . . public before it [may]
determine that the [advertisement] had a tendency to
mislead.’ ” 471 U. S., at 652–653 (quoting FTC v. ColgatePalmolive Co., 380 U. S. 374, 391–392 (1965)). Evidence
in the congressional record demonstrating a pattern of
advertisements that hold out the promise of debt relief
without alerting consumers to its potential cost, see 1998
Hearings, pt. III, at 86, 90–94, is adequate to establish
that the likelihood of deception in this case “is hardly a
speculative one,” 471 U. S., at 652.
Milavetz alternatively argues that the term “debt relief
agency” is confusing and misleading and that requiring its
inclusion in advertisements cannot be “reasonably related”
to the Government’s interest in preventing consumer
deception, as Zauderer requires. Id., at 651. This conten
tion amounts to little more than a preference on Milavetz’s
part for referring to itself as something other than a “debt
relief agency”—e.g., an attorney or a law firm. For several
reasons, we conclude that this preference lacks any consti
tutional basis. First, Milavetz offers no evidence to sup
port its claim that the label is confusing. Because §528 by
its terms applies only to debt relief agencies, the disclo
sures are necessarily accurate to that extent: Only debt
relief agencies must identify themselves as such in their
