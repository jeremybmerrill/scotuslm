provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person
. . . or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.” §101(12A)
(emphasis added). The provision’s silence regarding at
torneys thus avails Milavetz little. Cf. Heintz v. Jenkins,
514 U. S. 291, 294 (1995) (holding that “debt collector” as
used in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U. S. C.
§1692a(6), includes attorneys notwithstanding the defini
tion’s lack of an express reference to lawyers or litigation).
Milavetz’s other arguments for excluding attorneys
similarly fail to persuade us to disregard the statute’s
plain language.
Milavetz contends that 11 U. S. C.
§526(d)(2)’s instruction that §§526, 527, and 528 should
not “be deemed to limit or curtail” States’ authority to
“determine and enforce qualifications for the practice of
law” counsels against reading “debt relief agency” to in
clude attorneys, as the surest way to protect the States’
role in regulating the legal profession is to make the
BAPCPA’s professional conduct rules inapplicable to
lawyers. We find that §526(d)(2) supports the opposite
conclusion, as Congress would have had no reason to enact
that provision if the debt-relief-agency provisions did not
apply to attorneys. Milavetz’s broader claim that reading
§101(12A) to include attorneys impermissibly trenches on
an area of traditional state regulation also lacks merit.
Congress and the bankruptcy courts have long overseen
aspects of attorney conduct in this area of substantial
federal concern. See, e.g., Conrad, Rubin & Lesser v.
Pender, 289 U. S. 472, 477–479 (1933) (finding broad
authorization in former §96(d) (1934 ed.) (repealed 1978)
for courts to examine the reasonableness of a debtor’s
prepetition attorney’s fees).
Milavetz next argues that §101(12A)’s exception for any
“officer, director, employee, or agent of a person who pro
vides” bankruptcy assistance is revealing for its failure to
include “partners.” §101(12A)(A). In light of that omis
sion, it contends, treating attorneys as debt relief agencies
