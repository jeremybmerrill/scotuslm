Syllabus
quirement rather than an affirmative limitation on speech, the less
exacting scrutiny set out in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel
of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, governs. There, the Court
found that, while unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure re
quirements offend the First Amendment, “an advertiser’s rights are
adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasona
bly related to the State’s interest in preventing deception of consum
ers.” Id., at 651. Section 528’s requirements share the essential fea
tures of the rule challenged in Zauderer. The disclosures are
intended to combat the problem of inherently misleading commercial
advertisements, and they entail only an accurate statement of the
advertiser’s legal status and the character of the assistance provided.
Moreover, they do not prevent debt relief agencies from conveying
any additional information through their advertisements. In re R. M.
J., 455 U. S. 191, distinguished. Because §528’s requirements are
“reasonably related” to the Government’s interest in preventing con
sumer deception, the Court upholds those provisions as applied to Mi
lavetz. Pp. 18–23.
541 F. 3d 785, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,
C. J., and STEVENS, KENNEDY, GINSBURG, BREYER, and ALITO, JJ.,
joined, in which SCALIA, J., joined except for n. 3, and in which THOMAS,
J., joined except for Part III–C. SCALIA, J., and THOMAS, J., filed opin
ions concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
