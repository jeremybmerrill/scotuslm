CORCORAN v. LEVENHAGEN
Per Curiam

additional attacks on his sentence. But the Court of Ap
peals denied rehearing, again without referring to Cor
coran’s undecided claims.
We now grant certiorari and hold that the Seventh
Circuit erred in disposing of Corcoran’s other claims with
out explanation of any sort. The Seventh Circuit should
have permitted the District Court to consider Corcoran’s
unresolved challenges to his death sentence on remand, or
should have itself explained why such consideration was
unnecessary.
In its brief in opposition, the State argues that Cor
coran’s claims were waived, and that they were in any
event frivolous, so that a remand would be wasteful. Brief
in Opposition 9–10. Nothing in the Seventh Circuit’s
opinion, however, suggests that this was the basis for that
court’s order that the writ be denied.
The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to
proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of
the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is vacated,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings consis
tent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
