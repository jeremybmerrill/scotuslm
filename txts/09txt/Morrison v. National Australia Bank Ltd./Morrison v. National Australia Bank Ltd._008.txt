Opinion of the Court

514 (2006), in turn quoting United States v. Cotton, 535
U. S. 625, 630 (2002)). It presents an issue quite separate
from the question whether the allegations the plaintiff
makes entitle him to relief. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.
678, 682 (1946). The District Court here had jurisdiction
under 15 U. S. C. §78aa3 to adjudicate the question
whether §10(b) applies to National’s conduct.
In view of this error, which the parties do not dispute,
petitioners ask us to remand. We think that unnecessary.
Since nothing in the analysis of the courts below turned on
the mistake, a remand would only require a new Rule
12(b)(6) label for the same Rule 12(b)(1) conclusion. As we
have done before in situations like this, see, e.g., Romero v.
International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 359,
381–384 (1959), we proceed to address whether petition­
ers’ allegations state a claim.

Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949)). This principle
represents a canon of construction, or a presumption about
a statute’s meaning, rather than a limit upon Congress’s
power to legislate, see Blackmer v. United States, 284
U. S. 421, 437 (1932). It rests on the perception that
Congress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic,

“The district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive
jurisdiction of violations of [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regula­
