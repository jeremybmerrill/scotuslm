Opinion of the Court

IV 

A

Petitioners argue that the conclusion that §10(b) does
not apply extraterritorially does not resolve this case.
They contend that they seek no more than domestic appli­
cation anyway, since Florida is where HomeSide and its
senior executives engaged in the deceptive conduct of
manipulating HomeSide’s financial models; their com­
plaint also alleged that Race and Hughes made misleading
public statements there. This is less an answer to the
presumption against extraterritorial application than it is
an assertion—a quite valid assertion—that that presump­
tion here (as often) is not self-evidently dispositive, but its
application requires further analysis. For it is a rare case
of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all
contact with the territory of the United States. But the
presumption against extraterritorial application would be
a craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel
whenever some domestic activity is involved in the case.
The concurrence seems to imagine just such a timid senti­
nel, see post, at 7–8, but our cases are to the contrary. In
Aramco, for example, the Title VII plaintiff had been hired
in Houston, and was an American citizen. See 499 U. S.,
at 247. The Court concluded, however, that neither that
territorial event nor that relationship was the “focus” of
congressional concern, id., at 255, but rather domestic
employment. See also Foley Bros., 336 U. S., at 283, 285–
286.
Applying the same mode of analysis here, we think that
the focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where
the deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of
securities in the United States. Section 10(b) does not
punish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct “in
connection with the purchase or sale of any security regis­
tered on a national securities exchange or any security not
so registered.” 15 U. S. C. §78j(b). See SEC v. Zandford,
