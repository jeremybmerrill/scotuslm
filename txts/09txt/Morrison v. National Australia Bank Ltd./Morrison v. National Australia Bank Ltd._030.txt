MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

frauds fall within the statute’s compass. As those types of
frauds became more common in the latter half of the 20th
century, the federal courts were increasingly called upon
to wrestle with that question. The Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit, located in the Nation’s financial cen­
ter, led the effort. Beginning in earnest with Schoenbaum
v. Firstbrook, 405 F. 2d 200, rev’d on rehearing on other
grounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (1968) (en banc), that court strove,
over an extended series of cases, to “discern” under what
circumstances “Congress would have wished the precious
resources of the United States courts and law enforcement
agencies to be devoted to [transnational] transactions,”
547 F. 3d 167, 170 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit­
ted). Relying on opinions by Judge Henry Friendly,1 the
Second Circuit eventually settled on a conduct-and-effects
test. This test asks “(1) whether the wrongful conduct
occurred in the Unites States, and (2) whether the wrong­
ful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or
upon United States citizens.” Id., at 171. Numerous cases
flesh out the proper application of each prong.
The Second Circuit’s test became the “north star” of
§10(b) jurisprudence, ante, at 8, not just regionally but
nationally as well. With minor variations, other courts
converged on the same basic approach.2 See Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 15 (“The courts have

2 I acknowledge that the Courts of Appeals have differed in their ap­
plications of the conduct-and-effects test, with the consequence that
their respective rulings are not perfectly “cohesive.” Ante, at 10, n. 4.
It is nevertheless significant that the other Courts of Appeals, along
with the other branches of Government, have “embraced the Second
Circuit’s approach,” ante, at 9. If this Court were to do likewise, as I
would have us do, the lower courts would of course cohere even more
tightly around the Second Circuit’s rule.
