MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
Opinion of the Court

(CA3 1977); Continental Grain, 592 F. 2d, at 421–422;
Grunenthal GmbH v. Hotz, 712 F. 2d 421, 424–425 (CA9
1983); Kauthar SDN BHD v. Sternberg, 149 F. 3d 659, 667
(CA7 1998). While applying the same fundamental meth­
odology of balancing interests and arriving at what
seemed the best policy, they produced a proliferation of
vaguely related variations on the “conduct” and “effects”
tests. As described in a leading Seventh Circuit opinion:
“Although the circuits . . . seem to agree that there are
some transnational situations to which the antifraud
provisions of the securities laws are applicable, agreement
appears to end at that point.”4 Id., at 665. See also id., at
665–667 (describing the approaches of the various Circuits
and adopting yet another variation).
At least one Court of Appeals has criticized this line of
cases and the interpretive assumption that underlies it.
In Zoelsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 824 F. 2d 27, 32
(1987) (Bork, J.), the District of Columbia Circuit observed
that rather than courts’ “divining what ‘Congress would
have wished’ if it had addressed the problem[, a] more
natural inquiry might be what jurisdiction Congress in
——————
4 The principal concurrence (see post, p. 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in
judgment) (hereinafter concurrence)) disputes this characterization,
launching into a Homeric simile which takes as its point of departure
(and mistakes for praise rather than condemnation) then-Justice
Rehnquist’s statement in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421
U. S. 723, 737 (1975) that “[w]hen we deal with private actions under
Rule 10b–5, we deal with a judicial oak which has grown from little
more than a legislative acorn.” Post, at 3. The concurrence seemingly
believes that the Courts of Appeals have carefully trimmed and
sculpted this “judicial oak” into a cohesive canopy, under the watchful
eye of Judge Henry Friendly, the “master arborist,” ibid. See post, at
2–3. Even if one thinks that the “conduct” and “effects” tests are
numbered among Judge Friendly’s many fine contributions to the law,
his successors, though perhaps under the impression that they nurture
the same mighty oak, are in reality tending each its own botanically
distinct tree. It is telling that the concurrence never attempts its own
synthesis of the various balancing tests the Circuits have adopted.
