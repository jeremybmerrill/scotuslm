function if the Act did not apply in the first instance to
securities transactions that occur abroad.” Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 14.
We are not convinced. In the first place, it would be odd
for Congress to indicate the extraterritorial application of
the whole Exchange Act by means of a provision imposing
a condition precedent to its application abroad. And if the
whole Act applied abroad, why would the Commission’s

statement of extraterritorial effect. Its explicit provision
for a specific extraterritorial application would be quite
superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied
to transactions on foreign exchanges—and its limitation of
