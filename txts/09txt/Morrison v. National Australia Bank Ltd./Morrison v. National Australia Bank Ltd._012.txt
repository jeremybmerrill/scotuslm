Opinion of the Court

unable to respond,” 519 F. 2d, at 993.
As they developed, these tests were not easy to adminis­
ter. The conduct test was held to apply differently de­
pending on whether the harmed investors were Americans
or foreigners: When the alleged damages consisted of
losses to American investors abroad, it was enough that
acts “of material importance” performed in the United
States “significantly contributed” to that result; whereas
those acts must have “directly caused” the result when
losses to foreigners abroad were at issue. See Bersch, 519
F. 2d, at 993. And “merely preparatory activities in the
United States” did not suffice “to trigger application of the
securities laws for injury to foreigners located abroad.”
Id., at 992. This required the court to distinguish between
mere preparation and using the United States as a “base”
for fraudulent activities in other countries. Vencap, supra,
at 1017–1018. But merely satisfying the conduct test was
sometimes insufficient without “ ‘some additional factor
tipping the scales’ ” in favor of the application of American
law. Interbrew v. Edperbrascan Corp., 23 F. Supp. 2d 425,
432 (SDNY 1998) (quoting Europe & Overseas Commodity
Traders, S. A. v. Banque Paribas London, 147 F. 3d 118,
129 (CA2 1998)). District courts have noted the difficulty
of applying such vague formulations. See, e.g., In re
Alstom SA, 406 F. Supp. 2d 346, 366–385 (SDNY 2005).
There is no more damning indictment of the “conduct” and
“effects” tests than the Second Circuit’s own declaration
that “the presence or absence of any single factor which
was considered significant in other cases . . . is not neces­
sarily dispositive in future cases.” IIT v. Cornfeld, 619
F. 2d 909, 918 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Other Circuits embraced the Second Circuit’s approach,
though not its precise application. Like the Second Cir­
cuit, they described their decisions regarding the extrater­
ritorial application of §10(b) as essentially resolving mat­
ters of policy. See, e.g., SEC v. Kasser, 548 F. 2d 109, 116
