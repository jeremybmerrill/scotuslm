MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
Opinion of the Court

not foreign matters. Smith v. United States, 507 U. S.
197, 204, n. 5 (1993). Thus, “unless there is the affirma­
tive intention of the Congress clearly expressed” to give a
statute extraterritorial effect, “we must presume it is
primarily concerned with domestic conditions.” Aramco,
supra, at 248 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
canon or presumption applies regardless of whether there
is a risk of conflict between the American statute and a
foreign law, see Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509
U. S. 155, 173–174 (1993). When a statute gives no clear
indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.
Despite this principle of interpretation, long and often
recited in our opinions, the Second Circuit believed that,
because the Exchange Act is silent as to the extraterrito­
rial application of §10(b), it was left to the court to “dis­
cern” whether Congress would have wanted the statute to
apply. See 547 F. 3d, at 170 (internal quotation marks
omitted). This disregard of the presumption against ex­
traterritoriality did not originate with the Court of Ap­
peals panel in this case. It has been repeated over many
decades by various courts of appeals in determining the
application of the Exchange Act, and §10(b) in particular,
to fraudulent schemes that involve conduct and effects
abroad. That has produced a collection of tests for divin­
ing what Congress would have wanted, complex in formu­
lation and unpredictable in application.
As of 1967, district courts at least in the Southern Dis­
trict of New York had consistently concluded that, by
reason of the presumption against extraterritoriality,
§10(b) did not apply when the stock transactions underly­
ing the violation occurred abroad. See Schoenbaum v.
Firstbrook, 268 F. Supp. 385, 392 (1967) (citing Ferraoli v.
Cantor, CCH Fed. Sec. L. Rep. ¶91615 (SDNY 1965) and
Kook v. Crang, 182 F. Supp. 388, 390 (SDNY 1960)).
