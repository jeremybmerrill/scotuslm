MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

judicial usurpation. Congress invited an expansive role
for judicial elaboration when it crafted such an open-ended
statute in 1934. And both Congress and the Commission
subsequently affirmed that role when they left intact the
relevant statutory and regulatory language, respectively,
throughout all the years that followed. See Brief for

Ins. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 294 (1993) (inferring from
recent legislation Congress’ desire to “acknowledg[e]” the
10b–5 action without “entangling” itself in the precise

U. S., at 293, 294; see also id., at 292 (noting with ap­
proval that “federal courts have accepted and exercised
the principal responsibility for the continuing elaboration
of the scope of the 10b–5 right and the definition of the
duties it imposes”). Indeed, we have unanimously en­

§10(b)—ridiculed by the Court today—of striving to “di­
