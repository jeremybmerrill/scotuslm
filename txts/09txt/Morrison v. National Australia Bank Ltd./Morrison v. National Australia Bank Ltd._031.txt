STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

uniformly agreed that Section 10(b) can apply to a trans­
national securities fraud either when fraudulent conduct
has effects in the United States or when sufficient conduct
relevant to the fraud occurs in the United States”); see
also 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the
United States §416 (1986) (setting forth conduct-and­
effects test). Neither Congress nor the Securities Ex­
change Commission (Commission) acted to change the
law. To the contrary, the Commission largely adopted the
Second Circuit’s position in its own adjudications. See
ante, at 23–24.
In light of this history, the Court’s critique of the deci­
sion below for applying “judge-made rules” is quite mis­
placed. Ante, at 11. This entire area of law is replete with
judge-made rules, which give concrete meaning to Con­
gress’ general commands.3 “When we deal with private
actions under Rule 10b–5,” then-Justice Rehnquist wrote
many years ago, “we deal with a judicial oak which has
grown from little more than a legislative acorn.” Blue
Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 737
(1975). The “ ‘Mother Court’ ” of securities law tended to
that oak. Id., at 762 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (describing
the Second Circuit). One of our greatest jurists—the judge
who, “without a doubt, did more to shape the law of securi­
ties regulation than any [other] in the country”4—was its
master arborist.
The development of §10(b) law was hardly an instance of

3 It is true that “when it comes to ‘the scope of [the] conduct prohib­
ited by [Rule 10b–5 and] §10(b), the text of the statute [has] control[led]
our decision[s].’ ” Ante, at 12, n. 5 (quoting Central Bank of Denver, N.
A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994);
some brackets in original). The problem, when it comes to transna­
tional securities frauds, is that the text of the statute does not provide a
great deal of control. As with any broadly phrased, longstanding
statute, courts have had to fill in the gaps.
