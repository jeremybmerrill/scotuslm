tion that application of §10(b) abroad would produce, and
urge the adoption of a clear test that will avoid that conse­

The Solicitor General suggests a different test, which
petitioners also endorse: “[A] transnational securities
fraud violates [§]10(b) when the fraud involves significant

Brief for Petitioners 26. Neither the Solicitor General nor
petitioners provide any textual support for this test. The
Solicitor General sets forth a number of purposes such a
test would serve: achieving a high standard of business
ethics in the securities industry, ensuring honest securi­
ties markets and thereby promoting investor confidence,
and preventing the United States from becoming a “Bar­

markets. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16–17.
But it provides no textual support for the last of these
purposes, or for the first two as applied to the foreign
securities industry and securities markets abroad. It is
our function to give the statute the effect its language
suggests, however modest that may be; not to extend it to
admirable purposes it might be used to achieve.
If, moreover, one is to be attracted by the desirable
consequences of the “significant and material conduct”
test, one should also be repulsed by its adverse conse­

United States has become the Barbary Coast for those
perpetrating frauds on foreign securities markets, some
fear that it has become the Shangri-La of class-action
litigation for lawyers representing those allegedly cheated
