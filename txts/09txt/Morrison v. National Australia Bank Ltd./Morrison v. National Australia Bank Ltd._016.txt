Opinion of the Court

not extend beyond conduct encompassed by §10(b)’s prohi­
bition.” United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651
(1997). Therefore, if §10(b) is not extraterritorial, neither
is Rule 10b–5.
On its face, §10(b) contains nothing to suggest it applies
abroad:
“It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indi­
rectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility
of any national securities exchange . . . [t]o use or em­
ploy, in connection with the purchase or sale of any
security registered on a national securities exchange
or any security not so registered, . . . any manipulat­
ive or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention
of such rules and regulations as the [Securities and
Exchange] Commission may prescribe . . . .”

merce,” a term used in §10(b), which includes “trade,
commerce, transportation, or communication . . . between
any foreign country and any State.”

§78c(a)(17). But “we have repeatedly held that even stat­
utes that contain broad language in their definitions of
‘commerce’ that expressly refer to ‘foreign commerce’ do
not apply abroad.” Aramco, 499 U. S., at 251; see id., at
251–252 (discussing cases). The general reference to
foreign commerce in the definition of “interstate com­
merce” does not defeat the presumption against extraterri­

The Second Circuit considered petitioners’ appeal to raise only a
claim under Rule 10b–5(b), since it found their claims under subsec­
tions (a) and (c) to be forfeited. 547 F. 3d, at 176, n. 7. We do likewise.
