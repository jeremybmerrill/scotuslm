Opinion of the Court

repayment unrealistically low in order to cause the mort­
gage-servicing rights to appear more valuable than they
really were. The complaint also alleges that National and
Cicutto were aware of this deception by July 2000, but did
nothing about it.
As relevant here, petitioners Russell Leslie Owen and
Brian and Geraldine Silverlock, all Australians, purchased
National’s Ordinary Shares in 2000 and 2001, before the
write-downs.1 They sued National, HomeSide, Cicutto,
and the three HomeSide executives in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York for
alleged violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §§78j(b)
and 78t(a), and SEC Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5
(2009), promulgated pursuant to §10(b).2 They sought to
represent a class of foreign purchasers of National’s Ordi­
nary Shares during a specified period up to the September
write-down. 547 F. 3d, at 169.

1 Robert Morrison, an American investor in National’s ADRs, also
brought suit, but his claims were dismissed by the District Court
because he failed to allege damages. In re National Australia Bank
Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ. 6537 (BSJ), 2006 WL 3844465, *9
(SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006). Petitioners did not appeal that decision, 547
F. 3d 167, 170, n. 3 (CA2 2008) (case below), and it is not before us.
Inexplicably, Morrison continued to be listed as a petitioner in the
Court of Appeals and here.
2 The relevant text of §10(b) and SEC Rule 10b–5 are set forth later in
this opinion. Section 20(a), 48 Stat. 899, provides:
“Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable
under any provision of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation
thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the
same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such
controlled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good
faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constitut­
ing the violation or cause of action.”
Liability under §20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some
other provision of the Exchange Act; §10(b) is the only basis petitioners
asserted.
