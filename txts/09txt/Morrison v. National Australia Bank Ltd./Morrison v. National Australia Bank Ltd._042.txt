MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

construction of the statutory text. In so doing, it pays
short shrift to the United States’ interest in remedying
frauds that transpire on American soil or harm American
citizens, as well as to the accumulated wisdom and experi­
ence of the lower courts. I happen to agree with the result
the Court reaches in this case. But “I respectfully dis­
sent,” once again, “from the Court’s continuing campaign
to render the private cause of action under §10(b)
toothless.” Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 175 (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting).
