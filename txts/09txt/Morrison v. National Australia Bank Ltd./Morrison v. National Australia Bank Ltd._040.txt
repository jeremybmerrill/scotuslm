MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

Court’s opinion, it seems, is not the presumption against
extraterritoriality but rather the Court’s belief that trans­
actions on domestic exchanges are “the focus of the Ex­
change Act” and “the objects of [its] solicitude.” Ante, at
17, 18. In reality, however, it is the “public interest” and
“the interests of investors” that are the objects of the
statute’s solicitude. Europe & Overseas Commodity Trad
ers, S. A. v. Banque Paribas London, 147 F. 3d 118, 125
(CA2 1998) (citing H. R. Rep. No. 1838, 73d Cong., 2d
Sess., 32–33 (1934)); see also Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485
U. S. 224, 230 (1988) (“The 1934 Act was designed to
protect investors against manipulation of stock prices”
(citing S. Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1–5 (1934));
Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 195 (1976)
(“The 1934 Act was intended principally to protect inves­
tors . . . ”); S. Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 68 (1934)
(“The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 aims to protect the
interests of the public against the predatory operations of
directors, officers, and principal stockholders of corpora­
tions . . . ”). And while the clarity and simplicity of the
Court’s test may have some salutary consequences, like all
bright-line rules it also has drawbacks.
Imagine, for example, an American investor who buys
shares in a company listed only on an overseas exchange.
That company has a major American subsidiary with
executives based in New York City; and it was in New
York City that the executives masterminded and imple­
mented a massive deception which artificially inflated the
stock price—and which will, upon its disclosure, cause the
——————
United States as Amicus Curiae 12–13, but they also pose a lesser
threat to international comity, id., at 26–27; cf. Empagran, 542 U. S., at
171 (“ ‘[P]rivate plaintiffs often are unwilling to exercise the degree of
self-restraint and consideration of foreign governmental sensibilities
generally exercised by the U. S. Government’ ” (quoting Griffin, Extra­
territoriality in U. S. and EU Antitrust Enforcement, 67 Antitrust L. J.
159, 194 (1999); alteration in original)).
