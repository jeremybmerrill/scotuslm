ROBERT MORRISON, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK 

LTD. ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
applies to fraud “in connection with” two categories of
transactions: (1) “the purchase or sale of any security
registered on a national securities exchange” or (2) “the
purchase or sale of . . . any security not so registered.” 15
U. S. C. §78j(b). In this case, the purchased securities are
listed only on a few foreign exchanges, none of which has
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
as a “national securities exchange.” See §78f. The first
category therefore does not apply. Further, the relevant
purchases of these unregistered securities took place
entirely in Australia and involved only Australian inves
tors. And in accordance with the presumption against
extraterritoriality, I do not read the second category to
include such transactions. Thus, while state law or other
federal fraud statutes, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1341 (mail
fraud), §1343 (wire fraud), may apply to the fraudulent
activity alleged here to have occurred in the United States,
I believe that §10(b) does not. This case does not require
us to consider other circumstances.
To the extent the Court’s opinion is consistent with
these views, I join it.
