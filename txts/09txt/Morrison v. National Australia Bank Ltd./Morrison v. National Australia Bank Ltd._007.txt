MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
Opinion of the Court

Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)
and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The
District Court granted the motion on the former ground,
finding no jurisdiction because the acts in this country
were, “at most, a link in the chain of an alleged overall
securities fraud scheme that culminated abroad.” In re
National Australia Bank Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ.
6537 (BSJ), 2006 WL 3844465, *8 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006).
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on
similar grounds. The acts performed in the United States
did not “compris[e] the heart of the alleged fraud.” 547
F. 3d, at 175–176. We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___
(2009).
II
Before addressing the question presented, we must
correct a threshold error in the Second Circuit’s analysis.
It considered the extraterritorial reach of §10(b) to raise a
question of subject-matter jurisdiction, wherefore it af­
firmed the District Court’s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1).
See 547 F. 3d, at 177. In this regard it was following
Circuit precedent, see Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405
F. 2d 200, 208, modified on other grounds en banc, 405
F. 2d 215 (1968). The Second Circuit is hardly alone in
taking this position, see, e.g., In re CP Ships Ltd. Securi
ties Litigation, 578 F. 3d 1306, 1313 (CA11 2009); Conti
nental Grain (Australia) PTY. Ltd. v. Pacific Oilseeds, Inc.,
592 F. 2d 409, 421 (CA8 1979).
But to ask what conduct §10(b) reaches is to ask what
conduct §10(b) prohibits, which is a merits question.
Subject-matter jurisdiction, by contrast, “refers to a tribu­
nal’s ‘ “power to hear a case.” ’ ” Union Pacific R. Co. v.
