STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

price to plummet. Or, imagine that those same executives
go knocking on doors in Manhattan and convince an unso­
phisticated retiree, on the basis of material misrepresen­

securities. Both of these investors would, under the
Court’s new test, be barred from seeking relief under
§10(b).
The oddity of that result should give pause. For in
walling off such individuals from §10(b), the Court nar­

and alarm generations of American investors—and, I am
convinced, the Congress that passed the Exchange Act.
Indeed, the Court’s rule turns §10(b) jurisprudence (and
the presumption against extraterritoriality) on its head,
by withdrawing the statute’s application from cases in
which there is both substantial wrongful conduct that
occurred in the United States and a substantial injurious
effect on United States markets and citizens.

In my judgment, if petitioners’ allegations of fraudulent
misconduct that took place in Florida are true, then re­
spondents may have violated §10(b), and could potentially
be held accountable in an enforcement proceeding brought
by the Commission. But it does not follow that sharehold­
ers who have failed to allege that the bulk or the heart of
the fraud occurred in the United States, or that the fraud
had an adverse impact on American investors or markets,
may maintain a private action to recover damages they
suffered abroad. Some cases involving foreign securities
transactions have extensive links to, and ramifications for,
this country; this case has Australia written all over it.
Accordingly, for essentially the reasons stated in the Court
of Appeals’ opinion, I would affirm its judgment.
The Court instead elects to upend a significant area of
securities law based on a plausible, but hardly decisive,
