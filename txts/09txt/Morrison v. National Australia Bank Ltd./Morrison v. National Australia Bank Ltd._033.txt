“Our task,” we have said, is “to attempt to infer how the
1934 Congress would have addressed the issue.” Musick,
Peeler, 508 U. S., at 294.
Thus, while the Court devotes a considerable amount of
attention to the development of the case law, ante, at 6–
10, it draws the wrong conclusions. The Second Circuit
refined its test over several decades and dozens of cases,
with the tacit approval of Congress and the Commission
and with the general assent of its sister Circuits. That
history is a reason we should give additional weight to the
Second Circuit’s “judge-made” doctrine, not a reason to
denigrate it. “The longstanding acceptance by the courts,
coupled with Congress’ failure to reject [its] reasonable
interpretation of the wording of §10(b), . . . argues signifi­

530 (1974) (Douglas, J., joined by Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ.,
dissenting) (“It has been recognized that the 1934 Act, including the
protections of Rule 10b–5, applies when foreign defendants have
defrauded American investors, particularly when . . . they have profited
by virtue of proscribed conduct within our boundaries. This is true
even when the defendant is organized under the laws of a foreign
country, is conducting much of its activity outside the United States,
and is therefore governed largely by foreign law” (citing, inter alia,
Leasco, 468 F. 2d, at 1334–1339, and Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405
F. 2d 200, rev’d on rehearing on other grounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (CA2
1968) (en banc))).
