MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
Opinion of the Court

that application to securities of domestic issuers would be
inoperative. Even if that were not true, when a statute
provides for some extraterritorial application, the pre­
sumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that
provision to its terms. See Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp.,
550 U. S. 437, 455–456 (2007). No one claims that §30(a)
applies here.
The concurrence claims we have impermissibly nar­
rowed the inquiry in evaluating whether a statute applies
abroad, citing for that point the dissent in Aramco, see
post, at 6. But we do not say, as the concurrence seems to
think, that the presumption against extraterritoriality is a
“clear statement rule,” ibid., if by that is meant a re­
quirement that a statute say “this law applies abroad.”
Assuredly context can be consulted as well. But whatever
sources of statutory meaning one consults to give “the
most faithful reading” of the text, post, at 7, there is no
clear indication of extraterritoriality here. The concur­
rence does not even try to refute that conclusion, but
merely puts forward the same (at best) uncertain indica­
tions relied upon by petitioners and the Solicitor General.
As the opinion for the Court in Aramco (which we prefer to
the dissent) shows, those uncertain indications do not
suffice.8
In short, there is no affirmative indication in the Ex­
change Act that §10(b) applies extraterritorially, and we
therefore conclude that it does not.

8 The concurrence notes that, post-Aramco, Congress provided explic­
itly for extraterritorial application of Title VII, the statute at issue in
Aramco. Post, at 6, n. 6. All this shows is that Congress knows how to
give a statute explicit extraterritorial effect—and how to limit that
effect to particular applications, which is what the cited amendment
did. See Civil Rights Act of 1991, §109, 105 Stat. 1077.
