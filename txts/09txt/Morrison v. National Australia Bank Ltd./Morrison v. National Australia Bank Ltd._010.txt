Opinion of the Court

shares (but not, of course, its treasury shares) were listed
on both the American Stock Exchange and the Toronto
Stock Exchange. Invoking the presumption against extra­
territoriality, the court held that §10(b) was inapplicable
(though it incorrectly viewed the defect as jurisdictional).
268 F. Supp., at 391–392, 393–394. The decision in
Schoenbaum was reversed, however, by a Second Circuit
opinion which held that “neither the usual presumption
against extraterritorial application of legislation nor the
specific language of [§]30(b) show Congressional intent to
preclude application of the Exchange Act to transactions
regarding stocks traded in the United States which are
effected outside the United States . . . .” Schoenbaum, 405
F. 2d, at 206. It sufficed to apply §10(b) that, although the
transactions in treasury shares took place in Canada, they
affected the value of the common shares publicly traded in
the United States. See id., at 208–209. Application of
§10(b), the Second Circuit found, was “necessary to protect
American investors,” id., at 206.
The Second Circuit took another step with Leasco Data
Processing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326 (1972),
which involved an American company that had been
fraudulently induced to buy securities in England. There,
unlike in Schoenbaum, some of the deceptive conduct had
occurred in the United States but the corporation whose
securities were traded (abroad) was not listed on any
domestic exchange. Leasco said that the presumption
against extraterritoriality apples only to matters over
which the United States would not have prescriptive
jurisdiction, 468 F. 2d, at 1334. Congress had prescriptive
jurisdiction to regulate the deceptive conduct in this coun­
try, the language of the Act could be read to cover that
conduct, and the court concluded that “if Congress had
thought about the point,” it would have wanted §10(b) to
apply. Id., at 1334–1337.
