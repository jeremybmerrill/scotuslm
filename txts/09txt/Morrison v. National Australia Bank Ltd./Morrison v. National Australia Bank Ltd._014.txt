fact thought about and conferred.” Although tempted to
apply the presumption against extraterritoriality and be
done with it, see id., at 31–32, that court deferred to the
Second Circuit because of its “preeminence in the field of
securities law,” id., at 32. See also Robinson v. TCI/US
West Communications Inc., 117 F. 3d 900, 906–907 (CA5
1997) (expressing agreement with Zoelsch’s criticism of
the emphasis on policy considerations in some of the
cases).
Commentators have criticized the unpredictable and
inconsistent application of §10(b) to transnational cases.
See, e.g., Choi & Silberman, Transnational Litigation and
Global Securities Class-Action Lawsuits, 2009 Wis. L. Rev.
465, 467–468; Chang, Multinational Enforcement of U. S.
Securities Laws: The Need for the Clear and Restrained
Scope of Extraterritorial Subject-Matter Jurisdiction, 9

(1992). Some have challenged the premise underlying the
Courts of Appeals’ approach, namely that Congress did not
consider the extraterritorial application of §10(b) (thereby
leaving it open to the courts, supposedly, to determine
what Congress would have wanted). See, e.g., Sachs, The
International Reach of Rule 10b–5: The Myth of Congres­
sional Silence, 28 Colum. J. Transnat’l L. 677 (1990) (ar­
guing that Congress considered, but rejected, applying the
Exchange Act to transactions abroad). Others, more
fundamentally, have noted that using congressional si­
lence as a justification for judge-made rules violates the
traditional principle that silence means no extraterritorial
application. See, e.g., Note, Let There Be Fraud (Abroad):
A Proposal for A New U. S. Jurisprudence with Regard to
the Extraterritorial Application of the Anti-Fraud Provi­
sions of the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts, 28 Law & Pol’y
