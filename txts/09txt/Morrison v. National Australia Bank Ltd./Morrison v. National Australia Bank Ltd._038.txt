MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

shared by most scholars that Congress, in passing the
Exchange Act, “expected U. S. securities laws to apply to
certain international transactions or conduct.” Buxbaum,

Law: Managing Jurisdictional Conflict, 46 Colum. J.
Transnat’l L. 14, 19 (2007); see also Leasco Data Process
ing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326, 1336 (CA2
1972) (Friendly, J.) (detailing evidence that Congress

(presumption against extraterritoriality not controlling

And it strikes a reasonable balance between the goals of
