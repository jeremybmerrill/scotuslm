MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
Opinion of the Court

company headquartered in Florida. HomeSide’s business
was to receive fees for servicing mortgages (essentially the
administrative tasks associated with collecting mortgage
payments, see J. Rosenberg, Dictionary of Banking and
Financial Services 600 (2d ed. 1985)). The rights to re­
ceive those fees, so-called mortgage-servicing rights, can
provide a valuable income stream. See 2 The New Pal­
grave Dictionary of Money and Finance 817 (P. Newman,
M. Milgate, & J. Eatwell eds. 1992). How valuable each of
the rights is depends, in part, on the likelihood that the
mortgage to which it applies will be fully repaid before it is
due, terminating the need for servicing. HomeSide calcu­

it was writing down the value of HomeSide’s assets by
$450 million; and then again on September 3, by another
$1.75 billion. The prices of both Ordinary Shares and
ADRs slumped. After downplaying the July write-down,
National explained the September write-down as the
result of a failure to anticipate the lowering of prevailing
interest rates (lower interest rates lead to more refinanc­
ings, i.e., more early repayments of mortgages), other
mistaken assumptions in the financial models, and the
loss of goodwill. According to the complaint, however,
HomeSide, Race, Harris, and another HomeSide senior
executive who is also a respondent here had manipulated
HomeSide’s financial models to make the rates of early
