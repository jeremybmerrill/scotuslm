Opinion of the Court

S. E. C. 92, 95, n. 14, 96, n. 16 (1994); In re Robert F.
Lynch, Exchange Act Release No. 11737, 8 S. E. C. Docket
75, 77, n. 15 (1975). We need “accept only those agency
interpretations that are reasonable in light of the princi­
ples of construction courts normally employ.” Aramco, 499
U. S., at 260 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). Since the Commission’s interpretations
relied on cases we disapprove, which ignored or discarded
the presumption against extraterritoriality, we owe them
no deference.

Section 10(b) reaches the use of a manipulative or de­
ceptive device or contrivance only in connection with the
purchase or sale of a security listed on an American stock
exchange, and the purchase or sale of any other security in
the United States. This case involves no securities listed
on a domestic exchange, and all aspects of the purchases
complained of by those petitioners who still have live
claims occurred outside the United States. Petitioners
have therefore failed to state a claim on which relief can
be granted. We affirm the dismissal of petitioners’ com­
plaint on this ground.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
