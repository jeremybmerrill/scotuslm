MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
Opinion of the Court

Int’l Bus. 477, 492–493 (1997).
The criticisms seem to us justified. The results of judi­
cial-speculation-made-law—divining what Congress would
have wanted if it had thought of the situation before the
court—demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption
against extraterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in
each case, we apply the presumption in all cases, preserv­
ing a stable background against which Congress can legis­
late with predictable effects.5

5 The concurrence urges us to cast aside our inhibitions and join in
the judicial lawmaking, because “[t]his entire area of law is replete with
judge-made rules,” post, at 3. It is doubtless true that, because the
implied private cause of action under §10(b) and Rule 10b–5 is a thing
of our own creation, we have also defined its contours. See, e.g., Blue
Chip Stamps, supra. But when it comes to “the scope of [the] conduct
prohibited by [Rule 10b–5 and] §10(b), the text of the statute controls
our decision.” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of
Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994). It is only with respect to the
additional “elements of the 10b–5 private liability scheme” that we
“have had ‘to infer how the 1934 Congress would have addressed the
issue[s] had the 10b–5 action been included as an express provision in
the 1934 Act.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers
Ins. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 294 (1933)).
6 Rule 10b–5 makes it unlawful:
“for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility
of any national securities exchange,
“(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,
“(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, or
“(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which
operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.”
17 CFR
§240.10b–5 (2009).
