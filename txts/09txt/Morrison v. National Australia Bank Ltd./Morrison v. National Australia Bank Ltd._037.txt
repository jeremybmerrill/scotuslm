STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

swer. The text of the Exchange Act indicates that §10(b)
extends to at least some activities with an international
component, but, again, it is not pellucid as to which ones.9
The Second Circuit draws the line as follows: §10(b) ex­
tends to transnational frauds “only when substantial acts
in furtherance of the fraud were committed within the
United States,” SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 193 (CA2
2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), or when the
fraud was “ ‘intended to produce’ ” and did produce “ ‘det­
rimental effects within’ ” the United States, Schoenbaum,
405 F. 2d, at 206.10
This approach is consistent with the understanding

its terms, §10(b) regulates “interstate commerce,” 15 U. S. C.
§78j, which the Exchange Act defines to include “trade, commerce,
transportation, or communication . . . between any foreign country and
any State, or between any State and any place or ship outside thereof.”
§78c(a)(17). Other provisions of the Exchange Act make clear that
Congress contemplated some amount of transnational application. See,
e.g., §78b(2) (stating, in explaining necessity for regulation, that “[t]he
prices established and offered in [securities] transactions are generally
disseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign
countries and constitute a basis for determining and establishing the
prices at which securities are bought and sold”); §78dd(b) (exempting
from regulation foreign parties “unless” they transact business in
securities “in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Com­
mission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate to prevent the
evasion of this chapter” (emphasis added)); see also Schoenbaum, 405
F. 2d, at 206–208 (reviewing statutory text and legislative history).
The Court finds these textual references insufficient to overcome the
presumption against extraterritoriality, ante, at 13–15, but as ex­
plained in the main text, that finding rests upon the Court’s misappli­
cation of the presumption.
10 The Government submits that a “transnational securities fraud
violates Section 10(b) if significant conduct material to the fraud’s
success occurs in the United States.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 6. I understand the Government’s submission to be largely a
repackaging of the “conduct” prong of the Second Circuit’s test. The
Government expresses no view on that test’s “effects” prong, as the
decision below considered only respondents’ conduct. See id., at 15,
n. 2; 547 F. 3d 167, 171 (CA2 2008).
