MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.
Opinion of the Court

Circuit had excised the presumption against extraterrito­
riality from the jurisprudence of §10(b) and replaced it
with the inquiry whether it would be reasonable (and
hence what Congress would have wanted) to apply the
statute to a given situation. As long as there was pre­
scriptive jurisdiction to regulate, the Second Circuit ex­
plained, whether to apply §10(b) even to “predominantly
foreign” transactions became a matter of whether a court
thought Congress “wished the precious resources of United
States courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted
to them rather than leave the problem to foreign coun­
tries.” Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F. 2d 974, 985
(1975); see also IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F. 2d 1001, 1017–
1018 (CA2 1975).
The Second Circuit had thus established that applica­
tion of §10(b) could be premised upon either some effect on
American securities markets or investors (Schoenbaum) or
significant conduct in the United States (Leasco). It later
formalized these two applications into (1) an “effects test,”
“whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in
the United States or upon United States citizens,” and (2)
a “conduct test,” “whether the wrongful conduct occurred
in the United States.” SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 192–
193 (CA2 2003). These became the north star of the Sec­
ond Circuit’s §10(b) jurisprudence, pointing the way to
what Congress would have wished. Indeed, the Second
Circuit declined to keep its two tests distinct on the
ground that “an admixture or combination of the two often
gives a better picture of whether there is sufficient United
States involvement to justify the exercise of jurisdiction by
an American court.” Itoba Ltd. v. Lep Group PLC, 54
F. 3d 118, 122 (1995). The Second Circuit never put for­
ward a textual or even extratextual basis for these tests.
As early as Bersch, it confessed that “if we were asked to
point to language in the statutes, or even in the legislative
history, that compelled these conclusions, we would be
