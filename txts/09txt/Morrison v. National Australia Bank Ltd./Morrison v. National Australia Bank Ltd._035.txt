STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA’s personal view of statutory
interpretation, that evidence legitimately encompasses
more than the enacted text. Hence, while the Court’s
dictum that “[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of
an extraterritorial application, it has none,” ante, at 6,
makes for a nice catchphrase, the point is overstated. The
presumption against extraterritoriality can be useful as a
theory of congressional purpose, a tool for managing in­
ternational conflict, a background norm, a tiebreaker. It
does not relieve courts of their duty to give statutes the
most faithful reading possible.
Second, and more fundamentally, the Court errs in
suggesting that the presumption against extraterritorial­
ity is fatal to the Second Circuit’s test. For even if the
presumption really were a clear statement (or “clear indi­
cation,” ante, at 6, 16) rule, it would have only marginal
relevance to this case.
It is true, of course, that “this Court ordinarily construes
——————
(1993) (declining to apply presumption in assessing question of
Sherman Act extraterritoriality); Smith v. United States, 507 U. S. 197,
201–204 (1993) (opinion for the Court by Rehnquist, C. J.) (considering
presumption “[l]astly,” to resolve “any lingering doubt,” after consider­
ing structure, legislative history, and judicial interpretations of Federal
Tort Claims Act); cf. Sale, 509 U. S., at 188 (stating that presumption
“has special force when we are construing treaty and statutory provi­
sions that,” unlike §10(b), “may involve foreign and military affairs for
which the President has unique responsibility”); Dodge, Understanding
the Presumption Against Extraterritoriality, 16 Berkeley J. Int’l L. 85,
110 (1998) (explaining that lower courts “have been unanimous in
concluding that the presumption against extraterritoriality is not a
clear statement rule”). The Court also relies on Microsoft Corp. v.
AT&T Corp., 550 U. S. 437, 455–456 (2007). Ante, at 16. Yet Micro
soft’s articulation of the presumption is a far cry from the Court’s rigid
theory. “As a principle of general application,” Microsoft innocuously
observed, “we have stated that courts should ‘assume that legislators
take account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when
they write American laws.’ ” 550 U. S., at 455 (quoting F. Hoffmann-La
Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U. S. 155, 164 (2004)).
