As case support for the “significant and material con­
duct” test, the Solicitor General relies primarily on
Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349 (2005).11 In
——————
11 Discussed in Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22–23. The
Solicitor General also cites, without description, a number of antitrust
cases to support the proposition that domestic conduct with conse­
quences abroad can be covered even by a statute that does not apply
extraterritorially: Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon
Corp., 370 U. S. 690 (1962); United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., 274
U. S. 268 (1927); Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U. S. 66 (1917); United States
v. Pacific & Arctic R. & Nav. Co., 228 U. S. 87 (1913). These are no
longer of relevance to the point (if they ever were), since Continental
Ore overruled the holding of American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co.,
213 U. S. 347, 357 (1909), that the antitrust laws do not apply extrater­
ritorially. See W. S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics
Corp. Int’l, 493 U. S. 400, 407–408 (1990).
Moreover, the preContinental Ore cases all involved conspiracies to restrain trade in the
United States, see Sisal Sales, supra, at 274–276; Thomsen, supra, at
88; Pacific & Arctic, supra, at 105–106. And although a final case cited
by the Solicitor General, Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U. S. 280,
287–288 (1952), might be read to permit application of a nonextraterri­
torial statute whenever conduct in the United States contributes to a
violation abroad, we have since read it as interpreting the statute at
issue—the Lanham Act—to have extraterritorial effect, EEOC v.
Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 252 (1991) (quoting 15
U. S. C. §1127).
