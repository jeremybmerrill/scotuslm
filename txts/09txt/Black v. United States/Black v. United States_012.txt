CONRAD M. BLACK, JOHN A. BOULTBEE, AND MARK
S. KIPNIS, PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I join the Court’s opinion with two exceptions. First, I
do not join in its reliance, ante, at 7, on the Notes of the
Advisory Committee in determining the meaning of Fed
eral Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(d). The Committee’s
view is not authoritative. See Krupski v. Costa Crociere
S. p. A., 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). The
Court accurately quotes the text of the Rule, see ante, at 7,
the meaning of which is obvious. No more should be said.
Second, I agree with the Court, ante, at 5, 8, that the
District Court’s honest-services-fraud instructions to the
jury were erroneous, but for a quite different reason. In
my view, the error lay not in instructing inconsistently
with the theory of honest-services fraud set forth in Skill
ing v. United States, ante, p. ___, but in instructing the
jury on honest-services fraud at all. For the reasons set
forth in my opinion in that case, 18 U. S. C. §1346 is un
constitutionally vague. Skilling, ante, p. ___ (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
