CONRAD M. BLACK, JOHN A. BOULTBEE, AND MARK
S. KIPNIS, PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I join the Court’s opinion except for those parts stating
that 18 U. S. C. §1346 “criminalizes only schemes to de
fraud that involve bribes or kickbacks.” Ante, at 5. For
the reasons set forth in JUSTICE SCALIA’s separate opinion
in Skilling v. United States, ante, p. ___ (opinion concur
ring in part and concurring in judgment), §1346 is uncon
stitutionally vague. To convict a defendant based on an
honest-services-fraud theory, even one limited to bribes or
kickbacks, would violate his or her rights under the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
