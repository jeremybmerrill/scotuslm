honest-services deprivation theories advanced by the
Government. Id., at 235a. As to the latter, the District

been proven beyond a reasonable doubt (check all that apply):
“Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its
shareholders of money or property ____
“Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its
shareholders of their intangible right to honest services ____.” App.
