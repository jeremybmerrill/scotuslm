Opinion of the Court

ing general verdicts instead, the Seventh Circuit con
cluded, Defendants had “forfeited their objection to the
[honest-services] instruction[s].” Id., at 603. Defendants’
suggestion of postverdict interrogatories did not, in the
Court of Appeals’ view, overcome the forfeiture, for
“[q]uestioning the jurors after they have handed down
their verdict is not a good procedure and certainly not one
that a district judge is required to employ.” Ibid.6
We granted certiorari in this case, 556 U. S. ___ (2009),
along with Skilling v. United States, 558 U. S. ___ (2009),
and Weyhrauch v. United States, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), to
determine what conduct Congress rendered criminal by
proscribing, in §1346, fraudulent deprivation of “the in
tangible right of honest services.” We also agreed to con
sider in this case the question whether Defendants for
feited their objection to the honest-services jury
instructions by opposing the Government’s request for
special verdicts.
II
We decided in Skilling that §1346, properly confined,
criminalizes only schemes to defraud that involve bribes or
kickbacks. See ante, p. __. That holding renders the
honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect,7
and brings squarely before us the question presented by
the Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling: Did Defendants, by
failing to acquiesce in the Government’s request for spe
cial verdicts, forfeit their objection, timely made at trial, to
the honest-services instructions?

e.g., Jacobs Mfg. Co. v. Sam Brown Co., 19 F. 3d 1259, 1267
(CA8 1994) (“Postverdict interrogatories may imply the jury’s verdict is
unjustified and cause the jury to answer the interrogatories in a man
ner inconsistent with the verdict.”); cf. Yeager v. United States, 557
U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11) (“Courts properly avoid . . . explora
tions into the jury’s sovereign space.”).
7 The scheme to defraud alleged here did not involve any bribes or
kickbacks.
