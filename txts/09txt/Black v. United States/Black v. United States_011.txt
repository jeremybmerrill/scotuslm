BLACK v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

F. 3d, at 603.13 To boot, the Court of Appeals applied the
sanction to Defendants, although they lacked any notice
that forfeiture would attend their resistance to the Gov
ernment’s special-verdict request. There is a Rule de
signed to ward off judicial invention of the kind present
here. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b) admon
ishes: “No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed
for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law
[or] federal rules . . . unless the alleged violator was fur
nished with actual notice of the requirement before the
noncompliance.”
We hold, in short, that, by properly objecting to the
honest-services jury instructions at trial, Defendants
secured their right to challenge those instructions on
appeal. They did not forfeit that right by declining to
acquiesce in the Government-proposed special-verdict
forms. Our decision in Skilling makes it plain that the
honest-services instructions in this case were indeed
incorrect. As in Skilling, ante, at 40–41, we express no
opinion on the question whether the error was ultimately
harmless, but leave that matter for consideration on
remand.14

For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the
Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed
ings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

13 Rendering

the Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling all the more
anomalous, at the time the trial court settled on the general verdict
form, the Government was no longer pressing its special-verdict re
quest. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 228a.
14 Black contends that spillover prejudice from evidence introduced on
the mail-fraud counts requires reversal of his obstruction-of-justice
conviction. Brief for Petitioners 47–49. That question, too, is one on
which we express no opinion.
