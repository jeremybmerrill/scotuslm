RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON
STEVENS, J., dissenting

arbitration agreement is but one part of a broader em
ployment agreement between the parties, just as the
arbitration clause in Prima Paint was but one part of a
broader contract for services between those parties. Thus,
that the subject matter of the agreement is exclusively
arbitration makes all the difference in the Prima Paint
analysis.
I
Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C.
§§1–16, parties generally have substantial leeway to
define the terms and scope of their agreement to settle
disputes in an arbitral forum. “[A]rbitration is,” after all,
“simply a matter of contract between the parties; it is a
way to resolve those disputes—but only those disputes—
that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.”
First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938,
943 (1995). The FAA, therefore, envisions a limited role
for courts asked to stay litigation and refer disputes to
arbitration.
Certain issues—the kind that “contracting parties would
likely have expected a court to have decided”—remain
within the province of judicial review. Howsam v. Dean
Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002); see also
Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U. S. 444, 452
(2003) (plurality opinion); AT&T Technologies, Inc. v.
Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986).
These issues are “gateway matter[s]” because they are
necessary antecedents to enforcement of an arbitration
agreement; they raise questions the parties “are not likely
to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator
would” decide. Howsam, 537 U. S., at 83. Quintessential
gateway matters include “whether the parties have a valid
arbitration agreement at all,” Bazzle, 539 U. S., at 452
(plurality opinion); “whether the parties are bound by a
given arbitration clause,” Howsam, 537 U. S., at 84; and
