STEVENS, J., dissenting

one and the same.
The Court, however, reads the delegation clause as a
distinct mini-arbitration agreement divisible from the
contract in which it resides—which just so happens also to
be an arbitration agreement. Ante, at 6–7. Although the
Court simply declares that it “makes no difference” that
the underlying subject matter of the agreement is itself an
arbitration agreement, ante, at 7, that proposition does not
follow from—rather it is at odds with—Prima Paint’s
severability rule.
Had the parties in this case executed only one contract,
on two sheets of paper—one sheet with employment
terms, and a second with arbitration terms—the contract
would look much like the one in Buckeye. There would be
some substantive terms, followed by some arbitration
terms, including what we now call a delegation clause—
i.e., a sentence or two assigning to the arbitrator any
disputes related to the validity of the arbitration provi
sion. See Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 442. If respondent then
came into court claiming that the contract was illegal as a
whole for some reason unrelated to the arbitration provi
sion, the Prima Paint rule would apply, and such a gen
eral challenge to the subject matter of the contract would
go to the arbitrator. Such a challenge would not call into
question the making of the arbitration agreement or its
invalidity per se.
Before today, however, if respondent instead raised a
challenge specific to “the validity of the agreement to
arbitrate”—for example, that the agreement to arbitrate
was void under state law—the challenge would have gone
to the court. That is what Buckeye says. See 546 U. S., at
444. But the Court now declares that Prima Paint’s plead
—————— 

that must be arbitrated, the fee provision, and the discovery provision, 

so permeate the Defendant’s arbitration agreement that it would be

impossible to sever the offending provisions.” App. 45.
