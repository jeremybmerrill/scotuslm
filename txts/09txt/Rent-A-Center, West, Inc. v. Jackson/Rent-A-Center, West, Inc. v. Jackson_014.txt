RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON
Opinion of the Court

(emphasis added).
In his brief to this Court, Jackson made the contention,
not mentioned below, that the delegation provision itself is
substantively unconscionable because the quid pro quo he
was supposed to receive for it—that “in exchange for ini
tially allowing an arbitrator to decide certain gateway
questions,” he would receive “plenary post-arbitration
judicial review”—was eliminated by the Court’s subse
quent holding in Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel,
Inc., 552 U. S. 576 (2008), that the nonplenary grounds for
judicial review in §10 of the FAA are exclusive. Brief for
Respondent 59–60. He brought this challenge to the
delegation provision too late, and we will not consider it.5
See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(slip op., at 24).

We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit.
It is so ordered.

5 Hall

Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576 (2008),
was decided after Jackson submitted his brief to the Ninth Circuit, but
that does not change our conclusion that he forfeited the argument.
Jackson could have submitted a supplemental brief during the year and
a half between this Court’s decision of Hall Street on March 25, 2008
and the Ninth Circuit’s judgment on September 9, 2009. Moreover,
Hall Street affirmed a rule that had been in place in the Ninth Circuit
since 2003. Id., at 583–584, and n. 5.
