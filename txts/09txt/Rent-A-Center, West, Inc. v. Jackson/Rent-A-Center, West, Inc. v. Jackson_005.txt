Opinion of the Court

reversed on the question of who (the court or arbitrator)
had the authority to decide whether the Agreement is
enforceable. It noted that “Jackson does not dispute that
the language of the Agreement clearly assigns the arbitra

“a party challenges an arbitration agreement as uncon
scionable, and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully

that the fee-sharing provision was not substantively un
conscionable and remanded for consideration of Jackson’s
other unconscionability arguments. Id., at 919–920, and
n. 3. Judge Hall dissented on the ground that “the ques

gone to the arbitrator, as the parties ‘clearly and unmis
takably provide[d]’ in their agreement.” Id., at 921.
We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___ (2010).

save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for

The FAA thereby places arbitration agreements on an
equal footing with other contracts, Buckeye, supra, at 443,
and requires courts to enforce them according to their
