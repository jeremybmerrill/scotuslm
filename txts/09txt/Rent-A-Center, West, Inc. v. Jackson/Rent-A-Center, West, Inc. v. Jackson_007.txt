Opinion of the Court

sion.
The delegation provision is an agreement to arbitrate
threshold issues concerning the arbitration agreement.
We have recognized that parties can agree to arbitrate
“gateway” questions of “arbitrability,” such as whether the
parties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their agree
ment covers a particular controversy. See, e.g., Howsam,
537 U. S., at 83–85; Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle,
539 U. S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion). This line of
cases merely reflects the principle that arbitration is a
matter of contract.1 See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.
——————
1 There is one caveat. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514
U. S. 938, 944 (1995), held that “[c]ourts should not assume that the
parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is ‘clea[r] and
unmistakabl[e]’ evidence that they did so.” The parties agree the
heightened standard applies here. See Brief for Petitioner 21; Brief for
Respondent 54. The District Court concluded the “Agreement to
Arbitrate clearly and unmistakenly [sic] provides the arbitrator with
the exclusive authority to decide whether the Agreement to Arbitrate is
enforceable.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The Ninth Circuit noted that
Jackson did not dispute that the text of the Agreement was clear and
unmistakable on this point. 581 F. 3d 912, 917 (2009). He also does
not dispute it here. What he argues now, however, is that it is not
“clear and unmistakable” that his agreement to that text was valid,
because of the unconscionability claims he raises. See Brief for Re
spondent 54–55. The dissent makes the same argument. See post, at
5–8 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).
This mistakes the subject of the First Options “clear and unmistak
able” requirement. It pertains to the parties’ manifestation of intent,
not the agreement’s validity. As explained in Howsam v. Dean Witter
Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002), it is an “interpretive rule,” based
on an assumption about the parties’ expectations. In “circumstance[s]
where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have
decided the gateway matter,” ibid., we assume that is what they agreed
to. Thus, “[u]nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide
otherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to
be decided by the court, not the arbitrator.” AT&T Technologies, Inc. v.
Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986).
The validity of a written agreement to arbitrate (whether it is legally
binding, as opposed to whether it was in fact agreed to—including, of
