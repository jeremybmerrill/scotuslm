RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON
STEVENS, J., dissenting

First Options rule: Does the arbitration agreement at
issue “clearly and unmistakably” evince petitioner’s and
respondent’s intent to submit questions of arbitrability to
the arbitrator?6 The answer to that question is no. Re
spondent’s claim that the arbitration agreement is uncon
scionable undermines any suggestion that he “clearly” and
“unmistakably” assented to submit questions of arbitrabil
ity to the arbitrator. See Restatement (Second) of Con
tracts §208, Comment d (1979) (“[G]ross inequality of
bargaining power, together with terms unreasonably
favorable to the stronger party, may confirm indications
that the transaction involved elements of deception or
compulsion, or may show that the weaker party had no
meaningful choice, no real alternative, or did not in fact
assent or appear to assent to the unfair terms”); American
Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219, 249 (1995)
(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in
part) (“[A] determination that a contract is ‘unconscion
able’ may in fact be a determination that one party did not
intend to agree to the terms of the contract”).7 The fact

has challenged whether he “meaningfully agreed to the
terms of the form Agreement to Arbitrate, which he contends is proce
durally and substantively unconscionable.” 581 F. 3d 912, 917 (CA9
2009). Even if First Options relates only to “manifestations of intent,”
as the Court states, see ante, at 5–6, n. 1 (emphasis deleted), whether
there has been meaningful agreement surely bears some relation to
whether one party has manifested intent to be bound to an agreement.
7 The question of unconscionability in this case is one of state law.
See, e.g., Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492, n. 9 (1987). Under
Nevada law, unconscionability requires a showing of “ ‘both procedural
and substantive unconscionability,’ ” but “less evidence of substantive
unconscionability is required in cases involving great procedural
unconscionability.” D. R. Horton, Inc. v. Green, 120 Nev. 549, 553–554,
96 P. 3d 1159, 1162 (2004). I understand respondent to have claimed,
in accord with Nevada law, that the arbitration agreement contained
substantively unconscionable provisions, and was also the product of
procedural unconscionability as a whole. See Brief for Respondent 3
