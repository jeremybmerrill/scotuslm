Opinion of the Court

that the fee-sharing and discovery procedures rendered
the entire Agreement invalid.
Jackson’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit confirms that he
did not contest the validity of the delegation provision in
particular. His brief noted the existence of the delegation
provision, Brief for Appellant in No. 07–16164, p. 3, but
his unconscionability arguments made no mention of it,
id., at 3–7. He also repeated the arguments he had made
before the District Court, see supra, at 9, that the “entire
agreement” favors Rent-A-Center and that the limitations
on discovery further his “contention that the arbitration
agreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable,”
Brief for Appellant 7–8. Finally, he repeated the argu
ment made in his District Court filings, that under state
law the unconscionable clauses could not be severed from
the arbitration agreement, see id., at 8–9.4 The point of
this argument, of course, is that the Agreement as a whole
is unconscionable under state law.
Jackson repeated that argument before this Court. At
oral argument, counsel stated: “There are certain elements
of the arbitration agreement that are unconscionable and,
under Nevada law, which would render the entire arbitra
tion agreement unconscionable.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (em
phasis added). And again, he stated, “we’ve got both
certain provisions that are unconscionable, that under
Nevada law render the entire agreement unconscionable
. . . , and that’s what the Court is to rely on.” Id., at 43–44

4 Jackson’s argument fails. The severability rule is a “matter of sub
stantive federal arbitration law,” and we have repeatedly “rejected the
view that the question of ‘severability’ was one of state law, so that if
state law held the arbitration provision not to be severable a challenge
to the contract as a whole would be decided by the court.” Buckeye, 546
U. S., at 445 (citing Prima Paint, 388 U. S., at 400, 402–403; Southland
Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 10–14 (1984); Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.
v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 270–273 (1995)). For the same reason, the
Agreement’s statement that its provisions are severable, see App. 37,
does not affect our analysis.
