challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole.
Nowhere in his opposition to Rent-A-Center’s motion to
compel arbitration did he even mention the delegation
provision. See App. 39–47. Rent-A-Center noted this fact
in its reply: “[Jackson’s response] fails to rebut or other
wise address in any way [Rent-A-Center’s] argument that

Court, Jackson describes his challenge in the District
Court as follows: He “opposed the motion to compel on the
ground that the entire arbitration agreement, including the
delegation clause, was unconscionable.” Brief for Respon

under Nevada law, see 581 F. 3d, at 919, he contended
that the Agreement was both procedurally and substan
