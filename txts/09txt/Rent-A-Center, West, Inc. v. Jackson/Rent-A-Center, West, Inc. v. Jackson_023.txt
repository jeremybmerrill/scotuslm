STEVENS, J., dissenting

arbitration clause is nested. In the latter circumstance,
we assume there is no infirmity per se with the arbitration
agreement, i.e., there are no grounds for revocation of the
arbitration agreement itself under §2 of the FAA. Accord

The claim in Prima Paint was that one party would not

known the second party was insolvent (a fact known but
not disclosed at the time of contracting). 388 U. S., at 398.
There was, therefore, allegedly fraud in the inducement of
the contract—a contract which also delegated disputes to
an arbitrator. Despite the fact that the claim raised would
have, if successful, rendered the embedded arbitration
clause void, the Court held that the merits of the dispute
were for the arbitrator, so long as the claim of “fraud in
the inducement” did not go to validity of “the arbitration
clause itself.” Id., at 403 (emphasis added). Because, in
Prima Paint, “no claim ha[d] been advanced by Prima
Paint that [respondent] fraudulently induced it to enter
into the agreement to arbitrate,” and because the arbitra
tion agreement was broad enough to cover the dispute, the
arbitration agreement was enforceable with respect to the
controversy at hand. Id., at 406.
The Prima Paint rule has been denominated as one

contract’s validity is considered by the arbitrator in
the first instance.” 546 U. S., at 445–446.
