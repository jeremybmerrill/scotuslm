LUX v. RODRIGUES
Opinion in Chambers

Board of Elections refused to count those signatures. Lux
unsuccessfully sought an injunction requiring the Board to
do so from the District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia and from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit.
To obtain injunctive relief from a Circuit Justice, an
applicant must demonstrate that “the legal rights at issue
are ‘indisputably clear.’ ” Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
v. FCC, 507 U. S. 1301, 1303 (1993) (Rehnquist, C. J., in
chambers) (quoting Communist Party of Ind. v. Whitcomb,
409 U. S. 1235 (1972) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)). A
Circuit Justice’s issuance of an injunction “does not simply
suspend judicial alteration of the status quo but grants
judicial intervention that has been withheld by lower
courts,” and therefore “demands a significantly higher
justification” than that required for a stay. Ohio Citizens
for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313
(1986) (SCALIA, J., in chambers).
Lux does not meet this standard. He may very well be
correct that the Fourth Circuit precedent relied on by the
District Court—Libertarian Party of Va. v. Davis, 766
F. 2d 865 (1985)—has been undermined by our more
recent decisions addressing the validity of petition circula
tion restrictions. See Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 422,
428 (1988) (invalidating a law criminalizing circulator
compensation and describing petition circulation as “core
political speech”); Buckley v. American Constitutional Law
Foundation, Inc., 525 U. S. 182, 186–187 (1999) (holding
unconstitutional a requirement that initiative petition
circulators be registered voters). At the same time, we
were careful in American Constitutional Law Foundation
to differentiate between registration requirements, which
were before the Court, and residency requirements, which
were not. Id., at 197. Lux himself notes that the courts of
appeals appear to be reaching divergent results in this
area, at least with respect to the validity of state residency
