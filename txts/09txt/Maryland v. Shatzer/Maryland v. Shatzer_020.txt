MARYLAND v. SHATZER
Opinion of the Court

promise to provide counsel were the touchstone, Edwards
would not have applied in Minnick, where the suspect in
continuing custody actually met with appointed counsel.
The concurrence’s rule is also entirely unrelated to the
existence of a break in custody. While that may relieve
the accumulated coercive pressures of custody that are the
foundation for Edwards, it is hard to see how it bolsters
the suspect’s confidence that if he asks for counsel he will
get one.
And secondly, the concurrence differs from us in declin­
ing to say how long after a break in custody the termina­
tion of Edwards protection occurs. Two and one-half
years, it says, is clearly enough—but it gives law enforce­
ment authorities no further guidance. The concurrence
criticizes our use of 14 days as arbitrary and unexplained,
post, at 5, and n. 7. But in fact that rests upon the same
basis as the concurrence’s own approval of a 21⁄2-year
break in custody: how much time will justify “treating the
second interrogation as no more coercive than the first,”
post, at 10. Failure to say where the line falls short of 21⁄2
years, and leaving that for future case-by-case determina­
tion, is certainly less helpful, but not at all less arbitrary.

Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda cus­
tody lasting more than two weeks between the first and
second attempts at interrogation, Edwards does not man­
date suppression of his March 2006 statements. Accord­
ingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals of
Maryland, and remand the case for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
