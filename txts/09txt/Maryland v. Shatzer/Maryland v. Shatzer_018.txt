MARYLAND v. SHATZER
Opinion of the Court

tention after the 2003 interrogation did not depend on
what he said (or did not say) to Detective Blankenship,
and he has not alleged that he was placed in a higher level
of security or faced any continuing restraints as a result of
the 2003 interrogation. The “inherently compelling pres­
sures” of custodial interrogation ended when he returned
to his normal life.

A few words in response to JUSTICE STEVENS’ concur­
rence: It claims we ignore that “[w]hen police tell an indi­
gent suspect that he has the right to an attorney” and
then “reinterrogate” him without providing a lawyer, “the
suspect is likely to feel that the police lied to him and that
he really does not have any right to a lawyer.” Post, at 2

rence). See also post, at 4, 7, n. 11, 11, n. 16. The fallacy
here is that we are not talking about “reinterrogating” the
suspect; we are talking about asking his permission to be
interrogated. An officer has in no sense lied to a suspect
when, after advising, as Miranda requires, “You have the
right to remain silent, and if you choose to speak you have
the right to the presence of an attorney,” he promptly ends
the attempted interrogation because the suspect declines
to speak without counsel present, and then, two weeks
later, reapproaches the suspect and asks, “Are you now
willing to speak without a lawyer present?”
The “concer[n] that motivated the Edwards line of
cases,” post, at 2–3, n. 2, is that the suspect will be coerced
into saying yes. That concern guides our decision today.
Contrary to the concurrence’s conclusion, post, at 3, 5–6,
there is no reason to believe a suspect will view confession
as “ ‘the only way to end his interrogation’ ” when, before
the interrogation begins, he is told that he can avoid it by
simply requesting that he not be interrogated without
counsel present—an option that worked before. If, as the
