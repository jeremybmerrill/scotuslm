MARYLAND v. SHATZER
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

The many problems with the Court’s new rule are exac­
erbated in the very situation in this case: a suspect who is
in prison. Even if, as the Court assumes, a trip to one’s
home significantly changes the Edwards calculus, a trip to
one’s prison cell is not the same. A prisoner’s freedom is
severely limited, and his entire life remains subject to
government control. Such an environment is not condu­
cive to “shak[ing] off any residual coercive effects of his
prior custody.” Ante, at 11.12 Nor can a prisoner easily
“seek advice from an attorney, family members, and
friends,” ante, at 8, especially not within 14 days; prison­
ers are frequently subject to restrictions on communica­
tions. Nor, in most cases, can he live comfortably knowing
that he cannot be badgered by police; prison is not like a
normal situation in which a suspect “is in control, and
need only shut his door or walk away to avoid police badg­
ering.” Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(slip op., at 16). Indeed, for a person whose every move is
controlled by the State, it is likely that “his sense of de­
pendence on, and trust in, counsel as the guardian of his
interests in dealing with government officials intensified.”
United States v. Green, 592 A. 2d 985, 989 (D. C. 1991); cf.
Minnick, 498 U. S., at 153 (explaining that coercive pres­
sures “may increase as custody is prolonged”).13 The Court
——————
12 Cf. Orozco v. Texas, 394 U. S. 324, 326 (1969) (holding that a sus­
pect was in custody while being held in own home, despite his comfort
and familiarity with the surroundings); Mathis v. United States, 391
U. S. 1, 5 (1968) (holding that a person serving a prison sentence for
one crime was in custody when he was interrogated in prison about
another, unrelated crime); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 478
(1966) (“[W]hen an individual is . . . deprived of his freedom by the
authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, the
privilege against self-incrimination is jeopardized”).
13 Prison also presents a troubling set of incentives for police. First,
because investigators know that their suspect is also a prisoner, there
is no need formally to place him under arrest. Thus, police generally
can interview prisoners even without probable cause to hold them.
