Opinion of the Court

determined that the defendant pleading Edwards has
been out of custody for two weeks before the contested
interrogation, the court is spared the fact-intensive in­
quiry into whether he ever, anywhere, asserted his
Miranda right to counsel.
III
The facts of this case present an additional issue. No
one questions that Shatzer was in custody for Miranda
purposes during the interviews with Detective
Blankenship in 2003 and Detective Hoover in 2006. Like­
wise, no one questions that Shatzer triggered the Edwards
protections when, according to Detective Blankenship’s
notes of the 2003 interview, he stated that “ ‘he would not
talk about this case without having an attorney present,’ ”
405 Md., at 589, 954 A. 2d, at 1120. After the 2003 inter­
view, Shatzer was released back into the general prison
population where he was serving an unrelated sentence.
The issue is whether that constitutes a break in Miranda
custody.
We have never decided whether incarceration consti­
tutes custody for Miranda purposes, and have indeed
explicitly declined to address the issue. See Perkins, 496
U. S., at 299. See also Bradley v. Ohio, 497 U. S. 1011,
1013 (1990) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of certio­
rari). Whether it does depends upon whether it exerts the
coercive pressure that Miranda was designed to guard
against—the “danger of coercion [that] results from the
interaction of custody and official interrogation.” Perkins,
supra, at 297 (emphasis added). To determine whether a
suspect was in Miranda custody we have asked whether
“there is a ‘formal arrest or restraint on freedom of move­
ment’ of the degree associated with a formal arrest.” New
York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984); see also Stans
bury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322 (1994) (per curiam).
This test, no doubt, is satisfied by all forms of incarcera­
