Opinion of the Court

tal effect of “conserv[ing] judicial resources which would
otherwise be expended in making difficult determinations
of voluntariness.” Minnick, supra, at 151. Its fundamen­
tal purpose, however, is to “[p]reserv[e] the integrity of an
accused’s choice to communicate with police only through
counsel,” Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291 (1988), by
“prevent[ing] police from badgering a defendant into waiv­
ing his previously asserted Miranda rights,” Harvey,
supra, at 350. Thus, the benefits of the rule are measured
by the number of coerced confessions it suppresses that
otherwise would have been admitted. See Montejo, supra,
at ___ (slip op., at 14).
It is easy to believe that a suspect may be coerced or
badgered into abandoning his earlier refusal to be ques­
tioned without counsel in the paradigm Edwards case.
That is a case in which the suspect has been arrested for a
particular crime and is held in uninterrupted pretrial
custody while that crime is being actively investigated.
After the initial interrogation, and up to and including the
second one, he remains cut off from his normal life and
companions, “thrust into” and isolated in an “unfamiliar,”
“police-dominated atmosphere,” Miranda, 384 U. S., at
456–457, where his captors “appear to control [his] fate,”
Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297 (1990). That was the
situation confronted by the suspects in Edwards,
Roberson, and Minnick, the three cases in which we have
held the Edwards rule applicable. Edwards was arrested
pursuant to a warrant and taken to a police station, where
he was interrogated until he requested counsel. Edwards,
451 U. S., at 478–479. The officer ended the interrogation
and took him to the county jail,2 but at 9:15 the next

is a “local government’s detention center where persons await­
ing trial or those convicted of misdemeanors are confined.” Black’s Law
Dictionary 910 (9th ed. 2009). Prison, by contrast, is a “state or federal
facility of confinement for convicted criminals, esp. felons.” Id., at 1314.
