MARYLAND v. SHATZER
Opinion of the Court

tion. Our cases make clear, however, that the freedom-of­
movement test identifies only a necessary and not a suffi­
cient condition for Miranda custody. We have declined to
accord it “talismanic power,” because Miranda is to be
enforced “only in those types of situations in which the
concerns that powered the decision are implicated.”
Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 437 (1984). Thus, the
temporary and relatively nonthreatening detention in­
volved in a traffic stop or Terry stop, see Terry v. Ohio, 392
U. S. 1 (1968), does not constitute Miranda custody.
McCarty, supra, at 439–440. See also Perkins, supra, at
296.
Here, we are addressing the interim period during
which a suspect was not interrogated, but was subject to a
baseline set of restraints imposed pursuant to a prior
conviction. Without minimizing the harsh realities of
incarceration, we think lawful imprisonment imposed
upon conviction of a crime does not create the coercive
pressures identified in Miranda.
Interrogated suspects who have previously been con­
victed of crime live in prison. When they are released
back into the general prison population, they return to
their accustomed surroundings and daily routine—they
regain the degree of control they had over their lives prior
to the interrogation. Sentenced prisoners, in contrast to
the Miranda paradigm, are not isolated with their accus­
ers. They live among other inmates, guards, and workers,
and often can receive visitors and communicate with
people on the outside by mail or telephone.
Their detention, moreover, is relatively disconnected
from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investi­
gation. The former interrogator has no power to increase
the duration of incarceration, which was determined at
sentencing.8 And even where the possibility of parole
