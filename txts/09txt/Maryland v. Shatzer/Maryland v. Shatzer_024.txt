MARYLAND, PETITIONER v. MICHAEL BLAINE

SHATZER, SR. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF

MARYLAND

[February 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.
While I agree that the presumption from Edwards v.
Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), is not “eternal,” ante, at 9–
10, and does not mandate suppression of Shatzer’s state­
ment made after a 2½-year break in custody, I do not
agree with the Court’s newly announced rule: that Ed
wards always ceases to apply when there is a 14-day
break in custody, ante, at 11.
In conducting its “cost-benefit” analysis, the Court
demeans Edwards as a “ ‘second layer’ ” of “judicially pre­
scribed prophylaxis,” ante, at 5, 6, 12, n. 7; see also ante, at
6 (describing Edwards as “ ‘our rule, not a constitutional
command’ ” (quoting Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675,
688 (1988) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting))). The source of the
holdings in the long line of cases that includes both Ed
wards and Miranda, however, is the Fifth Amendment’s
protection against compelled self-incrimination applied to
the “compulsion inherent in custodial” interrogation,
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 458 (1966), and the
“significan[ce]” of “the assertion of the right to counsel,”
Edwards, 451 U. S., at 485.1 The Court’s analysis today is
