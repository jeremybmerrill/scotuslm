Opinion of the Court

cused,” Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98 (1984) (per cu
riam), than did the first such request at the original at­
tempted interrogation—which is of course not deemed
coercive. His change of heart is less likely attributable to
“badgering” than it is to the fact that further deliberation
in familiar surroundings has caused him to believe
(rightly or wrongly) that cooperating with the investiga­
tion is in his interest. Uncritical extension of Edwards to
this situation would not significantly increase the number
of genuinely coerced confessions excluded. The “justifica­
tion for a conclusive presumption disappears when appli­
cation of the presumption will not reach the correct result
most of the time.” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,
737 (1991).
At the same time that extending the Edwards rule
yields diminished benefits, extending the rule also in­
creases its costs: the in-fact voluntary confessions it ex­
cludes from trial, and the voluntary confessions it deters
law enforcement officers from even trying to obtain. Vol­
untary confessions are not merely “a proper element in
law enforcement,” Miranda, supra, at 478, they are an
“unmitigated good,” McNeil, 501 U. S., at 181, “ ‘essential
to society’s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and
punishing those who violate the law,’ ” ibid. (quoting
Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 426 (1986)).
The only logical endpoint of Edwards disability is ter­
mination of Miranda custody and any of its lingering
effects. Without that limitation—and barring some purely
arbitrary time-limit4—every Edwards prohibition of cus­
todial interrogation of a particular suspect would be eter­

State’s alternative argument in the present case is that the
substantial lapse in time between the 2003 and 2006 attempts at
interrogation independently ended the Edwards presumption. Our
disposition makes it unnecessary to address that argument.
