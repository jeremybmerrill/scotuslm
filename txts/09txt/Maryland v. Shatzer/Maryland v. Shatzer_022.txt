MARYLAND v. SHATZER
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

sible generally and advisable for some period following a
break in custody,1 the Court’s 14-day rule fails to satisfy
the criteria our precedents establish for the judicial crea
tion of such a safeguard.
Our precedents insist that judicially created prophylac
tic rules like those in Edwards and Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436 (1966), maintain “the closest possible fit”
between the rule and the Fifth Amendment interests they
seek to protect. United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630,
640–641 (2004) (plurality opinion); see generally Montejo
v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 18);
Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S. 760, 772 (2003) (plurality
opinion). The Court’s 14-day rule does not satisfy this
test. The Court relates its 14-day rule to the Fifth
Amendment simply by asserting that 14 days between
release and recapture should provide “plenty of time for
the suspect . . . to shake off any residual coercive effects of
his prior custody,” ante, at 11.
——————
1 At a minimum the latter proposition is questionable. I concede that
some police officers might badger a suspect during a subsequent inter
rogation after a break in custody, or might use catch-and-release tactics
to suggest they will not take no for an answer. But if a suspect reenters
custody after being questioned and released, he need only invoke his
right to counsel to ensure Edwards’ protection for the duration of the
subsequent detention. And, if law enforcement officers repeatedly
release and recapture a suspect to wear down his will—such that his
participation in a subsequent interrogation is no longer truly volun
tary—the “high standar[d] of proof for the waiver of constitutional
rights [set forth in] Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938),” will
protect against the admission of the suspect’s statements in court.
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 475 (1966). The Zerbst inquiry
takes into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the
waiver—including any improper pressures by police. See id., at 464; cf.
ante, at 11–12, n. 6 (stating that “[e]ven without [Edwards’] second
layer of prophylaxis, a defendant is still free to claim the prophylactic
protection of Miranda—arguing that his waiver of Miranda rights was
in fact involuntary under Johnson v. Zerbst” (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted)).
