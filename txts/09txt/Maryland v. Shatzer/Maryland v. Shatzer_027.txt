MARYLAND v. SHATZER
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

Edwards, 451 U. S., at 485. As the Court today acknowl­
edges, the right to counsel, like the right to remain silent,
is one that police may “coerc[e] or badge[r],” ante, at 7, a
suspect into abandoning.4 However, as discussed above,
the Court ignores the effects not of badgering but of rein­
terrogating a suspect who took the police at their word
that he need not answer questions without an attorney
present. See Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686. The Court,
moreover, ignores that when a suspect asks for counsel,
until his request is answered, there are still the same
“inherently compelling” pressures of custodial interroga­
tion on which the Miranda line of cases is based, see 486
U. S., at 681,5 and that the concern about compulsion is
especially serious for a detainee who has requested a
lawyer, an act that signals his “inability to cope with the

Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 719 (1979). Counsel can curb an officer’s
overbearing conduct, advise a suspect of his rights, and ensure that
there is an accurate record of any interrogation. “Because of this
special ability of the lawyer to help the client preserve his Fifth
Amendment rights once the client becomes enmeshed in the adversary
process, the Court found that the right to have counsel present at the
interrogation is indispensible to the protection of the Fifth Amendment
privilege.” Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 682, n. 4 (1988) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Thus, “once the accused has requested
counsel,” courts must be especially wary of “coercive form[s] of custodial
interrogation.” Bradshaw, 462 U. S., at 1051 (Powell, J., concurring in
judgment).
4 See Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350 (1990) (subsequent con­
fession suggests the police “badger[ed] a defendant into waiving his
previously asserted Miranda rights”).
5 See Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 155 (1990) (“[N]either
admissions nor waivers are effective unless there are both particular
and systemic assurances that the coercive pressures of custody were
not the inducing cause”); cf. Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98 (1984)
(per curiam) (“[T]he authorities through ‘badger[ing]’ or ‘overreach­
ing’—explicit or subtle, deliberate or unintentional—might otherwise
wear down the accused and persuade him to incriminate himself
notwithstanding his earlier request for counsel’s assistance”).
