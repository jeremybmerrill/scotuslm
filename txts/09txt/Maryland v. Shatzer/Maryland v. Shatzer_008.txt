MARYLAND v. SHATZER
Opinion of the Court

counsel. The implicit assumption, of course, is that the
subsequent requests for interrogation pose a significantly
greater risk of coercion. That increased risk results not
only from the police’s persistence in trying to get the sus­
pect to talk, but also from the continued pressure that
begins when the individual is taken into custody as a
suspect and sought to be interrogated—pressure likely to
“increase as custody is prolonged,” Minnick v. Mississippi,
498 U. S. 146, 153 (1990). The Edwards presumption of
involuntariness ensures that police will not take advan­
tage of the mounting coercive pressures of “prolonged
police custody,” Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686, by repeatedly
attempting to question a suspect who previously requested
counsel until the suspect is “badgered into submission,”
id., at 690 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).
We have frequently emphasized that the Edwards rule
is not a constitutional mandate, but judicially prescribed
prophylaxis. See, e.g., Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___,
___ (2009) (slip op., at 7–8); Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S.
344, 349 (1990); Solem v. Stumes, 465 U. S. 638, 644, n. 4
(1984). Because Edwards is “our rule, not a constitutional
command,” “it is our obligation to justify its expansion.”
Roberson, supra, at 688 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Lower
courts have uniformly held that a break in custody ends
the Edwards presumption, see, e.g., People v. Storm, 28
Cal. 4th 1007, 1023–1024, and n. 6, 52 P. 3d 52, 61–62,
and n. 6 (2002) (collecting state and federal cases), but we
have previously addressed the issue only in dicta, see
McNeil, supra, at 177 (Edwards applies “assuming there
has been no break in custody”).
A judicially crafted rule is “justified only by reference to
its prophylactic purpose,” Davis v. United States, 512 U. S.
452, 458 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted), and
applies only where its benefits outweigh its costs, Montejo,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). We begin with the benefits.
Edwards’ presumption of involuntariness has the inciden­
