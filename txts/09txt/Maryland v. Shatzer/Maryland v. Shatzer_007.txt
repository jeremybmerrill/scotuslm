Opinion of the Court

waive these rights. Id., at 475. To establish a valid
waiver, the State must show that the waiver was knowing,
intelligent, and voluntary under the “high standar[d] of
proof for the waiver of constitutional rights [set forth in]
Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938).” Id., at 475.
In Edwards, the Court determined that Zerbst’s tradi­
tional standard for waiver was not sufficient to protect a
suspect’s right to have counsel present at a subsequent
interrogation if he had previously requested counsel;
“additional safeguards” were necessary. 451 U. S., at 484.
The Court therefore superimposed a “second layer of
prophylaxis,” McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176
(1991). Edwards held:
“[W]hen an accused has invoked his right to have
counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid
waiver of that right cannot be established by showing
only that he responded to further police-initiated cus­
todial interrogation even if he has been advised of his
rights. . . . [He] is not subject to further interrogation
by the authorities until counsel has been made avail­
able to him, unless the accused himself initiates fur­
ther communication, exchanges, or conversations with
the police.” 451 U. S., at 484–485.
The rationale of Edwards is that once a suspect indicates
that “he is not capable of undergoing [custodial] question­
ing without advice of counsel,” “any subsequent waiver
that has come at the authorities’ behest, and not at the
suspect’s own instigation, is itself the product of the ‘in­
herently compelling pressures’ and not the purely volun­
tary choice of the suspect.” Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S.
675, 681 (1988). Under this rule, a voluntary Miranda
waiver is sufficient at the time of an initial attempted
interrogation to protect a suspect’s right to have counsel
present, but it is not sufficient at the time of subsequent
attempts if the suspect initially requested the presence of
