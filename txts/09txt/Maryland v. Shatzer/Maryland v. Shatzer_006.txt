guendo, a break-in-custody exception to Edwards existed,
Shatzer’s release back into the general prison population
between interrogations did not constitute a break in cus­

The Fifth Amendment, which applies to the States by
virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan,
378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964), provides that “[n]o person . . . shall
be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. In Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436 (1966), the Court adopted a set of prophylac­

present. Id., at 474. Critically, however, a suspect can
