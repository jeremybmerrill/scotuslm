ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA 

Opinion of the Court 


B

Because the Compact does not authorize the Commis­
sion to impose monetary sanctions, Plaintiffs’ second
exception—that North Carolina could not avoid monetary
sanctions by withdrawing from the Compact—is moot.
The third exception also pertains to the Commission’s
sanctions resolution: that North Carolina forfeited its
right to object to a monetary penalty by failing to partici­

this was a forfeit. We deem the exception abandoned. It
was wisely abandoned, because it is meritless. North
Carolina opposed the sanctions resolution and denied that
the Commission had jurisdiction to impose sanctions
against it.

there is “an explicit provision or other clear indicatio[n]” in
the Compact making the Commission the “sole arbiter of
disputes” regarding a party State’s compliance with the
Compact. Id., at 569–570. Plaintiffs assert there is such a
provision, the second sentence of Article 7(C), which
states: “The Commission is the judge of the qualifications
of the party [S]tates and of its members and of their com­
pliance with the conditions and requirements of this com­
pact and the laws of the party [S]tates relating to the
enactment of this compact.” 99 Stat. 1879.
Plaintiffs greatly overread this provision. The limited
nature of the authority to “judge” that it confers upon the
