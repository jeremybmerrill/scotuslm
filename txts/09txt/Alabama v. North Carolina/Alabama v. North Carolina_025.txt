Opinion of the Court

and nothing in the Compact suggests the parties under­
stood there were “certain purposes for which the expressly
conferred power . . . could not be employed.” Tymshare,
Inc. v. Covell, 727 F. 2d 1145, 1153 (CADC 1984) (opinion
for the court by Scalia, J.). Moreover, Article 3 ensures
that no such restrictions may be implied, since it provides
that the Compact shall not be “construed to infringe upon,
limit or abridge” the sovereign rights of a party State.
A comparison of the Compact with other, contemporane­
ously enacted, compacts confirms there is no such limita­
tion on North Carolina’s right to withdraw. See Texas v.
New Mexico, supra, at 565. In contrast to the Compact,
several other compacts concerning the creation of regional
facilities for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste
contain express good-faith limitations upon a State’s
exercise of its rights.
See, e.g., Central Compact,
Art. III(f), 99 Stat. 1865; Central Midwest Compact,
Art. V(a), id., at 1886; Midwest Interstate Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Management Compact, Art. V(a), id., at
1897.
III
North Carolina submits two exceptions—one to the
Special Master’s Second Report and one to his Preliminary
Report.
A
North Carolina takes exception to the recommendation
of the Second Report to deny without prejudice its motion
for summary judgment on the merits of Plaintiffs’ equita­
ble claims in Counts III–V. North Carolina’s motion was
based on the ground that, as a matter of law, its obliga­
tions are governed entirely by the Compact. The Special
Master recommended denying the motion without preju­
dice, because the claims in Counts III–V “requir[e] further
briefing and argument, and possibly further discovery.”
