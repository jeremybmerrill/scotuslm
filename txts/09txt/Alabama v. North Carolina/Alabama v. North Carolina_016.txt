ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

Commission as the sole arbiter” regarding North Caro­
lina’s compliance with its obligations under the Compact,
Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 569, we are not bound
to follow the Commission’s findings.
Plaintiffs argue that we nonetheless owe deference to
the Commission’s conclusion. But unless the text of an
interstate compact directs otherwise, we do not review the
actions of a compact commission “on the deferential model
of judicial review of administrative action by a federal
agency.” Id., at 566–567. The terms of this Compact do
not establish that “this suit may be maintained only as
one for judicial review of the Commission’s” determination
of breach. Id., at 567. Accordingly, we do not apply ad­
ministrative-law standards of review, but exercise our
independent judgment as to both fact and law in executing
our role as the “exclusive” arbiter of controversies between
the States, §1251(a).
D
Plaintiffs’ next two exceptions are to the Special Mas­
ter’s recommendations to deny their motion for summary
judgment on their breach-of-contract claims, and to grant
North Carolina’s motion for summary judgment on those
claims. In resolving motions for summary judgment in
cases within our original jurisdiction, we are not techni­
cally bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but
we use Rule 56 as a guide. This Court’s Rule 17.2; Ne
braska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584, 590 (1993). Hence,
summary judgment is appropriate where there “is no
genuine issue as to any material fact” and the moving
party is “entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.

317, 322 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S.
242, 248 (1986).
