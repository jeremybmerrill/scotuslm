Opinion of the Court

adopting a resolution, which declared it was both “appro­
priate and necessary” for the Commission “to provide
financial assistance” to North Carolina. App. 63. To that
end, the Commission created a “Host States Assistance
Fund” to help North Carolina with the “financial costs and
burdens” of “preliminary planning, the administrative
preparation, and other pre-operational” activities. Id., at
64.
The estimate in 1989 was that it would cost approxi­
mately $21 million and take two years to obtain a license
for North Carolina’s regional-disposal facility.
That
proved to be wildly optimistic. By 1990, the cost estimate
had ballooned to $45.8 million, and the estimated date for
obtaining a license now extended far into 1993. At the
beginning of 1994 there still was no license, and the esti­
mated cost had grown to $87.1 million. By end of 1994 the
estimate was $112.5 million, and issuance of a license was
not anticipated until 1997. And by December 1996 the
estimated cost had increased by another $27 million and
the projected date to receive a license had become August
2000.
North Carolina’s own appropriations—approximately
$27 million from Fiscal Year 1988 through Fiscal Year
(FY) 1995—did not cover the costs of the licensing phase.
But during the same time period, the Commission pro­
vided North Carolina with approximately $67 million.
The funds came from surcharges and access fees collected
for that purpose from generators disposing of low-level
radioactive waste at the pre-existing Barnwell facility.
Id., at 71–74, 145.
In July 1995, however, South Carolina withdrew from
the Compact, thereby depriving the Commission of contin­
ued revenues from the Barnwell facility. In 1996, the
Commission accordingly informed North Carolina that it
would no longer be able to provide financial support for
licensing activities. The Governor of North Carolina
