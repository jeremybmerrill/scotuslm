Opinion of the Court

obtaining a license.
In June 1999, after attempts to resolve the funding
impasse had failed, Florida and Tennessee filed with the
Commission a complaint for sanctions against North

fulfill its obligations under the Compact, and requested
(among other things) return of the almost $80 million paid

of future revenue (surcharges and access fees) it would
have received had a facility been completed in North
Carolina; and pay the Commission’s attorney’s fees. North
Carolina did not comply.
