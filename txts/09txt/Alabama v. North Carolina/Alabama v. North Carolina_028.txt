ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

inconsistent with our decisions construing state sovereign
immunity as a “personal privilege.” College Savings Bank
v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527
U. S. 666, 675 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also Alden, 527 U. S., at 758. But nothing in those
cases suggests that Arizona v. California has been implic­
itly overruled.6 See Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long
Term Care, Inc., 529 U. S. 1, 18 (2000). Neither of them
arose under our original jurisdiction, and neither cited
Arizona v. California or discussed—at all—the sovereign
immunity issue that case addressed. That sovereign
immunity is a personal privilege of the States says noth­
ing about whether that privilege “is not compromised,”
Arizona v. California, supra, at 614, by an additional,
nonsovereign plaintiff’s bringing an entirely overlapping
claim for relief that burdens the State with no additional
defense or liability.7
North Carolina contends that Arizona v. California
cannot apply to the Commission’s claims, because the
Commission does not—indeed, cannot—assert the same
claims or seek the same relief as the plaintiff States. We
disagree. In the bill of complaint, the States and the
Commission assert the same claims and request the same
relief. Bill of Complaint ¶¶62–86 and Prayer for Relief.

Carolina has not asked us to overrule Arizona v. California,
460 U. S. 605 (1983). We decline to do so on our own motion and
without argument. We therefore do not address the merits of THE
CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent.
7 North Carolina also asserts that our decisions in Pennhurst State
School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89 (1984), and County of
Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226 (1985), under­
mine Arizona v. California, supra, at 614. They do not. In neither case
were there entirely overlapping claims for relief between sovereign and
nonsovereign plaintiffs. See Pennhurst, supra, at 103, n. 12. Indeed, in
County of Oneida there was no sovereign plaintiff.
