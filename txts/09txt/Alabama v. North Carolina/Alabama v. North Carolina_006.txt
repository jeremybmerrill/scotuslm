ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

term disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated
within the region. Art. 1, id., at 1872. The Compact was
to be administered by a Southeast Interstate Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Management Commission (Commis­
sion), composed of two voting members from each party
State. Art. 4(A), id., at 1874.
A pre-existing facility in Barnwell, South Carolina was
to serve as the initial facility for regional generators to
dispose of their low-level radioactive waste. Art. 2(10), id.,
at 1873. That facility was scheduled to close as the re­
gional-disposal facility for the Compact by the end of 1992,
ibid., and so the Compact required the Commission to
develop “procedures and criteria for identifying . . . a host
[S]tate for the development of a second regional disposal
facility,” and to “seek to ensure that such facility is li­

Compact authorized the Commission to “designate” a
party State as a host State for the facility. Art. 4(E)(7),
ibid.
In September 1986, the Commission designated North
Carolina as the host for the second facility. North Caro­

to ensure that an application for a license to construct and
operate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is
filed with and issued by the appropriate authority.” Art.
5(C), id., at 1877. In 1987, North Carolina’s General
Assembly created the North Carolina Low-Level Radioac­
tive Waste Management Authority (Authority) to fulfill
the State’s obligation. N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G (1987), 1987
N. C. Sess. Laws ch. 850.
Although “[t]he Commission is not responsible for any
costs associated with,” among other things, “the creation of
any facility,” Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876, North Carolina
asked the Commission for financial assistance with build­
ing and licensing costs. The Commission responded by
