ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

not seek to bring new claims or issues, . . . our judicial
power over the controversy is not enlarged . . . , and the
States’ sovereign immunity protected by the Eleventh
Amendment is not compromised.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting
Arizona, supra, at 614).
That statement is contrary to the language of the Con
stitution. The Eleventh Amendment provides:
“The Judicial power of the United States shall not
be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,
commenced or prosecuted against one of the United
States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or
Subjects of any Foreign State.”
The immunity conferred is against the “commence[ment]
or prosecut[ion]” of “any suit in law or equity.” There is no
carve-out for suits “prosecuted” by private parties so long
as those parties “ ‘do not seek to bring new claims or is
sues.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting Arizona, supra, at 614).
Understandably, the Court’s opinion leans heavily on
Arizona, which has never been squarely overruled. Ante,
at 23–24. But Arizona itself is built on sand. The relevant
portion of that opinion is almost wholly unreasoned. It
cites only a footnote in a prior case, the pertinent para
graph of which failed even to discuss the State’s immunity
from private suit. See 460 U. S., at 614 (citing Maryland
v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 745, n. 21 (1981)). That para
graph addressed only intervention, not sovereign immu
nity, and the two issues are distinct. See South Carolina
v. North Carolina, 558 U. S. ___, ___, n. 5 (2010) (slip op.,
at 10, n. 5).
Most importantly, the subsequent development of our
sovereign immunity jurisprudence has only undermined
Arizona’s already weak foundations. We recognized in
Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 718 (1999), that the Consti
tution left intact the States’ pre-existing “immunity from
private suits”; as the Eleventh Amendment confirms, the
