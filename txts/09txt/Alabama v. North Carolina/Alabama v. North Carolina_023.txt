Opinion of the Court

commit a breach that would of itself give the obligee a
claim for damages for total breach,” Restatement §250(a),
or performs “a voluntary affirmative act which renders the
obligor unable or apparently unable to perform without
such a breach,” id., §250(b). Neither event occurred here.
North Carolina never informed the Commission (or any
party State) that it would not fulfill its Article 5(C) obliga­
tion to take appropriate steps toward obtaining a license.
Rather, it refused to take further steps that were not
appropriate. Nor did North Carolina take an affirmative
act that rendered it unable to perform. To the contrary, it
continued to fund the Authority for almost two years; it
maintained the records of the Authority; and it preserved
the work completed to date while waiting for alternative
funding sources that would enable resumption of the
project. Plaintiffs further argue that a repudiation was
effected by North Carolina’s refusal to take further steps
toward licensing “except on conditions which go beyond”
the terms of the Compact, Restatement §250, Comment b
(internal quotation marks omitted)—i.e., the provision of
external-financial assistance. But, as we have discussed,
external-financial assistance was contemplated by the
Compact.

Plaintiffs’ final exception is to the Special Master’s
recommendation to deny their motion for summary judg­
ment, and to grant North Carolina’s cross-motion for
summary judgment, on their claim that North Carolina
violated the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing
when it withdrew from the Compact in July 1999. Plain­
tiffs concede that North Carolina could withdraw from the
Compact, but contend it could not do so in “bad faith.”
And, they assert, its withdrawal after accepting $80 mil­
lion from the Commission, and with monetary sanctions
pending against it, was the epitome of bad faith.
