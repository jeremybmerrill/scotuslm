ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of BREYER, J.

App. 315. In response, North Carolina concluded that it
was unwilling to fund the rest of the project itself. See id.,
at 317–319. And the Court agrees that it would have been
“imprudent” for North Carolina to spend further funds, in
light of the Commission’s refusal to do so also. Ante, at
15–16.
But this is an odd excuse. If a builder promises to “take
appropriate steps” to build me a house, the fact that he
runs out of funds would not normally excuse his breaking
his promise—at least if it is he, and not I, who is responsi­
ble for financing the project. See 2 E. Farnsworth, Con­
tracts §9.6, p. 638 (3d ed. 2004) (Farnsworth) (courts
“generally” conclude that “additional expense” “does not
rise to the level of impracticability” so as to excuse a party
from performance). And here it is North Carolina, and not
anyone else, who bears ultimate responsibility for finding
the funds.
The text, structure, and purpose of the Compact all
demonstrate this fact. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 2,
the Compact expressly provides that the Commission “is
not responsible for any costs associated with . . . the crea­
tion of any facility,” Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876. Rather,
the Compact States determined that each “party state”
should take a turn as the “host state,” during which time
that State would be obligated to build a facility and then
operate it for 20 years. See Art. 3(A), id., at 1873; Art.
5(A), id., at 1877; Art. 5(C), ibid.; Art. 5(E), 103 Stat. 1289;
see also Art. 3(C), 99 Stat. 1873–1874 (“Host states are
responsible for the availability, the subsequent post­
closure observation and maintenance, and the extended
institutional control of their regional facilities”). The host
State would then recover its upfront construction expenses
from the considerable fees and surcharges charged to the
waste generators served by the facility. N. C. Gen. Stat.
