Opinion of the Court

Commission is clear from its context. The first sentence of
Article 7(C) states that an eligible State “shall be de­
clared” a party State “upon enactment of this compact into
law by the [S]tate and upon [the] payment of” a $25,000
fee, as “required by Article 4(H)(1).” Ibid. The second
sentence makes the Commission the “judge” of four mat­
ters, all of which concern status as a party State or Com
mission member. First, the Commission is the judge of the
“qualifications” of a State to become a party State (the
qualifications set forth in Article 7(A) for the initial party
States and in Article 7(B) for States that subsequently
petition to join). Second, the Commission is the judge of
the qualifications of the members of the Commission,
which are specified in Article 4(A). Third, the Commission
is the judge of a party State’s compliance with the “condi­
tions” and “requirements” of the Compact. The former
term is an obvious reference to Article 7(B): “The Commis­
sion may establish such conditions as it deems necessary
and appropriate to be met by a [S]tate wishing . . . to
become a party [S]tate to this [C]ompact.” Id., at 1878.
The accompanying term “requirements” also refers to
Article 7’s prescriptions for prospective party States, such
as paying the “fees required” under Article 7(C), id., at
1879, and obtaining, as Article 7(B) requires, a two-thirds
vote of the Commission in favor of admission. Finally, the
Commission is the judge of the “laws of the party [S]tates
relating to the enactment of this compact.” Art. 7(C), ibid.
Again, that concerns status as a party State, which re­
quires that the State “enac[t] . . . this compact into law,”
ibid. The Commission is the “judge” of only these specific
matters.
This is not to say the Commission lacks authority to
interpret the Compact or to say whether a party State has
violated its terms. That is of course implicit in its power
to sanction under Article 7(F). But because “the express
terms of the [Southeast] Compact do not constitute the
