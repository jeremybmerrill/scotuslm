ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

Nor may the Court entertain private claims without
“compromis[ing]” “the States’ sovereign immunity.” Ari
zona, 460 U. S., at 614. As a party, the Commission enjoys
legally enforceable rights against the defendant State: It
may object to settlement, seek taxation of costs, advance
arguments we are obliged to consider, and plead the
judgment as res judicata in future litigation. If the Com
mission truly sought nothing for itself—other than “a full
exposition of the issues,” Preliminary Report of the Special
Master 14—it could have participated as an amicus.
The Commission and North Carolina know that more is
at stake if the Commission is allowed to sue the State. It
is precisely the Commission’s status as a party, its attempt
to “prosecut[e]” a “suit in law or equity . . . against one of
the United States,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 11, that sovereign
immunity forbids.
I would sustain North Carolina’s first exception to the
Special Master’s reports.*

save Parts II–D and III–B. JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part III–B of
the Court’s opinion.
