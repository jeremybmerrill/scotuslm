Opinion of the Court

Preliminary Report 5. But he recommended denying
North Carolina’s motion to dismiss “at this point in the
proceedings.” Ibid.
The Special Master relied upon our decision in Arizona
v. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983), which held that the
Eleventh Amendment did not bar the participation of
several Indian Tribes in an original action concerning the
allocation of rights to the waters of the Colorado River.
The United States had already intervened, in its capacity
as trustee for several Indian Tribes; but the Tribes moved
to intervene as well, and the States opposed. We granted
the Tribes’ motion, stating that the States do not enjoy
sovereign immunity against the United States, and “[t]he
Tribes do not seek to bring new claims or issues against
the States, but only ask leave to participate in an adjudi­
cation of their vital water rights that was commenced by
the United States.” Id., at 614. Thus, “our judicial power
over the controversy is not enlarged by granting leave to
intervene, and the States’ sovereign immunity protected
by the Eleventh Amendment is not compromised.” Ibid.
Relying on this holding, the Special Master held that
sovereign immunity does not bar the Commission’s suit, so
long as the Commission asserts the same claims and seeks
the same relief as the other plaintiffs. Whether that is so,
he said, “cannot be resolved without further factual and
legal development[s],” Preliminary Report 6, and so North
Carolina is free to renew its motion at a later point, id., at
13–14. See Second Report 45–48.
Assuming (as the Special Master did) that the Commis­
sion’s claims against North Carolina implicate sovereign
immunity, we agree with his disposition. North Carolina
contends that making application of the Constitution’s
waiver of sovereign immunity turn upon whether a
nonsovereign party seeks to expand the relief sought is
—————— 

an entity’s suit against a State is barred by sovereign immunity.
