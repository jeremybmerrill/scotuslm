Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

States did not “ ‘surrender . . . this immunity in the plan of
the convention.’ ” Id., at 717 (quoting The Federalist No.
81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)); see also
Alden, supra, at 718–722, 755–756. There is no reason to
suppose that the States, at the founding, made an excep
tion for private suits that happen to mimic other plaintiffs’
claims—and neither Arizona nor the Court today suggests
otherwise.
Whether or not a plaintiff “seeks the same relief” or
imposes any “additional defense or liability,” ante, at 23–
24, simply does not matter in light of our recognition that
sovereign immunity provides an “immunity from suit,” not
a “defense to . . . liability.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v.
South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 766 (2002).
As we have explained, “the relief sought by a plaintiff
suing a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit
is barred.” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44,
58 (1996). Indeed, we have suggested that private parties
may not sue even if a court is “precluded . . . from award
ing them any relief.” Federal Maritime Comm’n, supra, at
766 (emphasis added) (dictum). It is the fact that a pri
vate party is allowed to sue a sovereign State—not the
burden of litigation or the relief sought—that infringes the
immunity of the State. “The Eleventh Amendment is
concerned not only with the States’ ability to withstand
suit, but with their privilege not to be sued.” Puerto Rico
Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.,
506 U. S. 139, 147, n. 5 (1993).
It is therefore impossible for the Court to hear private
claims against a nonconsenting State without expanding
“our judicial power over the controversy.” Arizona, supra,
at 614. Sovereign immunity is a limitation on that power.
The similarity of claims may be relevant to joinder or
intervention, but those are procedural means of processing
claims, not fonts of judicial authority. See Henderson v.
United States, 517 U. S. 654, 664 (1996).
