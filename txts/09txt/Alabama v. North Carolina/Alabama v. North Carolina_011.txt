Opinion of the Court

the parties engaged in partial discovery and subsequently
filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Special
Master’s Second Report recommended denying Plaintiffs’
motion for summary judgment on Count II, Second Report
8–35, and granting North Carolina’s motion for summary
judgment on Count II, id., at 35–40. Finally, he recom­

authority may be found elsewhere—in the first paragraph
of Article 7(F), which provides in relevant part:
“Any party [S]tate which fails to comply with the
provisions of this compact or to fulfill the obligations
incurred by becoming a party [S]tate to this compact
