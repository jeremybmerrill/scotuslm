Opinion of the Court

can impose. But they do establish “illustrative applica­
tion[s] of the general principle,” Federal Land Bank of St.
Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941),
which underlies the kinds of sanctions the Commission
can impose. It is significant that both these specifically
authorized sanctions are prospective and nonmonetary in
nature.
Moreover, Article 3 of the Compact provides: “The rights
granted to the party [S]tates by this compact are addi­
tional to the rights enjoyed by sovereign states, and noth­
ing in this compact shall be construed to infringe upon,
limit, or abridge those rights.” 99 Stat. 1873. Construing
Article 7(F) to authorize monetary sanctions would violate
this provision, since the primeval sovereign right is im­
munity from levies against the government fisc. See, e.g.,
Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 750–751 (1999).
Finally, a comparison of the Compact’s terms with those
of “[o]ther interstate compacts, approved by Congress
contemporaneously,” Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554,
565 (1983), confirms that Article 7(F) does not authorize
monetary sanctions. At the same time Congress consented
to this Compact, it consented to three other interstate
compacts that expressly authorize their commissions to
impose monetary sanctions against the parties to the
compacts. See Northeast Interstate Low-Level Radioac­
tive Waste Management Compact, Art. IV(i)(14), 99 Stat.
1915 (hereinafter Northeast Compact); Central Midwest
Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art.
VIII(f), 99 Stat. 1891 (hereinafter Central Midwest Com­
pact); Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Compact, Art. VII(e), 99 Stat. 1870 (hereinafter Central
Compact). The Compact “clearly lacks the features of
these other compacts, and we are not free to rewrite it” to
empower the Commission to impose monetary sanctions.
Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 565.
