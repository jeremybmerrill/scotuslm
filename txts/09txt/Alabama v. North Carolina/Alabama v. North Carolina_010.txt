ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

fall within our exclusive original jurisdiction over “contro­
versies between two or more States.” §1251(a). We denied
the Commission’s motion. 533 U. S. 926 (2001).
In June 2002, the States of Alabama, Florida, Tennes­
see, and Virginia, joined by the Commission (collectively
Plaintiffs), moved for leave to file a bill of complaint
against North Carolina. North Carolina opposed the
motion, and we again sought the views of the Solicitor
General. 537 U. S. 806 (2002). The United States urged
that we grant Plaintiffs’ motion, which we did. 539 U. S.
925 (2003). The bill of complaint contains five counts:
violation of the party States’ rights under the Compact
(Count I); breach of contract (Count II); unjust enrichment
(Count III), promissory estoppel (Count IV); and money
had and received (Count V). Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief
requests a declaration that North Carolina is subject to
sanctions and that the Commission’s sanctions resolution
is valid and enforceable, as well as the award of damages,
costs, and other relief.
We assigned the case to a Special Master, 540 U. S.
1014 (2003), who has conducted proceedings and now has
filed two reports. The Master’s Preliminary Report ad­
dressed three motions filed by the parties. He recom­
mended denying without prejudice North Carolina’s mo­
tion to dismiss the Commission’s claims against North
Carolina on the grounds of sovereign immunity. Prelimi­
nary Report 4–14. He recommended denying Plaintiffs’
motion for summary judgment on Count I, which sought
enforcement of the Commission’s sanctions resolution. Id.,
at 14–33. He recommended granting North Carolina’s
cross-motion to dismiss Count I and other portions of the
bill of complaint that sought enforcement of the sanctions
resolution. Id., at 33–34. And he recommended denying
North Carolina’s motion to dismiss the claims in Counts
II–V. Id., at 34–43.
After the Special Master issued his Preliminary Report,
