Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

draw; imposes no limitation on this right; and explicitly
provides that the Compact shall not be construed to
abridge the sovereign rights of any party State. See ante,
at 20–21. Federalism concerns also counsel reluctance to
find that a State has implicitly restricted its sovereignty in
such a manner.
The Court is therefore correct to reject plaintiffs’ final
exception. With these observations, I join the Court’s
opinion with the exception of Part II–E.
