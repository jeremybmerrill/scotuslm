ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of BREYER, J.

authorizing a state agency to “site, finance, [and] build” a
waste disposal facility. N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G–4 (1987)
(repealed 2000). Pursuant to this legislation, a new facil­
ity was to be completed by January 1, 1993. Ibid.
From August 1987 until December 1997, North Carolina
took a series of steps to prepare for the construction of the
storage facility. See Brief for North Carolina in Support of
Exceptions to Reports of the Special Master 6–8. And
while doing so it continually assured its Compact partners
that it “remain[ed] committed to fulfilling its obligations to
the Compact to serve as the next host state.” App. 92

gubernatorial letters, and other statements made by
North Carolina expressing its commitment to its Compact

a new facility. See Second Report of Special Master 2–3
(hereinafter Second Report). Eventually, the State simply
stopped trying: On December 19, 1997, North Carolina
informed its fellow member States that it would “com­
mence the orderly shutdown” of the waste disposal “pro­
ject.” App. 319. After this point, North Carolina admit­
tedly took no further steps toward obtaining a license or
building a facility before withdrawing from the Compact in
July 1999. Id., at 460 (North Carolina Admissions ¶11
(North Carolina “did not [after 1997] take additional steps
to . . . license a waste disposal facility”)); Second Report 10
(“The parties do not dispute that North Carolina did not
take additional steps to pursue a license for a waste facil­

Whatever one might think of the sufficiency of North
Carolina’s activities during the previous decade, I do not
