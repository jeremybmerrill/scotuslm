ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

1879.
The sanctions expressly identified in Article 7(F)—
“suspension” of rights and “revocation” of party-state
status—flow directly from the Commission’s power in
Articles 4(E)(7) and (11) to revoke a party State’s member­
ship. That can fairly be understood to include the lesser
power to suspend a party State’s rights. There is no simi­
lar grounding in Article 4(E) of authority to impose mone­
tary sanctions, and the absence is significant.
According to Plaintiffs, however, the word “sanctions” in
Article 7(F) naturally “includ[es]” monetary sanctions.
Since the Compact contains no definition of “sanctions,”
we give the word its ordinary meaning. A “sanction” (in
the sense the word is used here) is “[t]he detriment loss of
reward, or other coercive intervention, annexed to a viola­
tion of a law as a means of enforcing the law.” Webster’s
New International Dictionary 2211 (2d ed. 1957) (herein­
after Webster’s Second); see Black’s Law Dictionary 1458
(9th ed. 2009) (“A penalty or coercive measure that results
from failure to comply with a law, rule, or order”). A
monetary penalty is assuredly one kind of “sanction.” See
generally Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607,
621 (1992). But there are many others, ranging from the
withholding of benefits, or the imposition of a nonmone­
tary obligation, to capital punishment. The Compact
surely does not authorize the Commission to impose all of
them.
Ultimately, context dictates precisely which “sanctions”
are authorized under Article 7(F), and nothing in the
Compact suggests that these include monetary measures.
The only two “sanctions” specifically identified as being
included within Article 7(F) are “suspension” of a State’s
rights under the Compact and “revocation” of its status as
a party State. These are arguably merely examples, and
may not exhaust the universe of sanctions the Commission
