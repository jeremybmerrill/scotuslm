STATE OF ALABAMA, STATE OF FLORIDA, STATE OF

TENNESSEE, COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, AND

SOUTHEAST INTERSTATE LOW-LEVEL RADIO- 

ACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT COMMISSION, 

PLAINTIFFS v. STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA

ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRELIMINARY AND SECOND REPORTS
OF THE SPECIAL MASTER
[June 1, 2010]

JUSTICE BREYER, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I join Parts I, II–A, II–B, and III of the Court’s opinion.
Unlike the Court, however, I believe that North Carolina
breached the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Management Compact (Compact) when it sus­
pended its efforts toward building a waste disposal facility.
(THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins all but Parts II–D and III–B of
the Court’s opinion.)
Article 5(C) is the critical term of the Compact. It states:
“Each party state designated as a host state for a re­
gional facility shall take appropriate steps to ensure
that an application for a license to construct and op­
erate a facility . . . is filed with and issued by the ap­
propriate authority.” Omnibus Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Interstate Compact Consent Act (Consent Act),
99 Stat. 1877.
In September 1986, North Carolina was “designated as a
host state for a regional” low-level nuclear waste disposal
“facility.” Ibid.; see also App. 417, 432. Soon thereafter,
North Carolina’s General Assembly enacted legislation
