Opinion of the Court

debtor’s] claimed exemption” in certain property is an
amount within the limits the Code prescribes. The Dis­
trict Court rejected Schwab’s argument, and the Court of
Appeals affirmed. See In re Reilly, 534 F. 3d 173 (CA3
2008).
The Court of Appeals agreed with the Bankruptcy Court
that by equating on Schedule C the total value of her
exemptions in her business equipment with the equip­

in the same amount. Such an identical listing put

claiming the “full amount,” whatever it turns out to
be.’ ” 534 F. 3d, at 178−179.
Relying on this “unstated premise,” the Court of Appeals
held that Schwab’s failure to object to Reilly’s claimed
exemptions entitled Reilly to the equivalent of an in-kind
interest in her business equipment, even though the value
of that exemption exceeded the amount that Reilly de­
clared on Schedule C and the amount that the Code al­
lowed her to withdraw from the bankruptcy estate. Ibid.
As noted, the Court of Appeals’ decision adds to dis­
