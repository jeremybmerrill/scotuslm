SCHWAB v. REILLY
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

day period allowed for “objection[s] to the list of property
claimed as exempt.” Rule 4003(b). Instead, according to
the Court, no time limit constrains the trustee’s (or a
creditor’s) prerogative to place at issue the debtor’s
evaluation of the property as fully exempt.
The Court’s decision drastically reduces Rule 4003’s
governance, for challenges to valuation have been, until
today, the most common type of objection leveled against
exemption claims. See 9 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶4003.04,
p. 4003–15 (rev. 15th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Collier) (“Nor­
mally, objections to exemptions will focus primarily on
issues of valuation.”). In addition to departing from the
prevailing understanding and practice, the Court’s deci­
sion exposes debtors to protracted uncertainty concerning
their right to retain exempt property, thereby impeding
the “fresh start” exemptions are designed to foster. In
accord with the courts below, I would hold that a debtor’s
valuation of exempt property counts and becomes conclu­
sive absent a timely objection.
