dent 46, n. 7 (citing Sup. Ct. Bkrtcy. Form 20 (1877)).13
Indeed, it was not until 1991 that Schedule B–4 was re­
designated as Schedule C and amended to require the
estimate of market value on which Reilly so heavily relies.
See Schedule C. This amendment was not occasioned by
legislative changes that altered the Code’s definition of
“the property claimed as exempt” in this case as an “inter­
est,” not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in Reilly’s
business equipment.14 Accordingly, we agree with Schwab
and the United States that this recent amendment to the
exemption form does not compel Reilly’s view of Schwab’s
statutory obligations, or render the claimed exemptions in
this case objectionable under the Code. See Reply Brief
for Petitioner 9–11; Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 16–17.15

14 The precise reason for the amendment is unclear. See Communica­
tion from THE CHIEF JUSTICE of the United States Transmitting
Amendments to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure Prescribed
by the Court, Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. 2075, H. R. Doc. 102–80, p. 558,
reprinted in 11 Bankruptcy Rules Documentary History (1990–1991)
(referencing only the fact of the amendment). It may have been to
consolidate and reconcile the separate forms debtors were previously
required to file in Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 cases, see, e.g., In re
Beshirs, 236 B. R. 42, 46−47 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 1999), or simply to make
it easier for trustees to evaluate whether certain assets were viable
candidates for liquidation. Whatever the case, it did not result from
statutory changes to the Code provisions that govern this dispute.
15 Because the Code provisions we rely upon to resolve this case do
not obligate trustees to object under Rule 4003(b) to a debtor’s estimate
of the market value of an asset in which the debtor claims an exempt
interest, our analysis does not depend on whether the schedule of
“property claimed as exempt” (currently Schedule C) calls for such an
estimate or not. We engage the point only because Reilly suggests that
the 1991 schedule revisions requiring debtors to provide such an
estimate on the schedule of “property claimed as exempt” means that
