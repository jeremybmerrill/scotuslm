GINSBURG, J., dissenting

a monetary cap.5 Those prescriptions, the Court points
out, “define the ‘property’ a debtor may ‘clai[m] as exempt’
as the debtor’s ‘interest’—up to a specified dollar
amount—in the assets described in the category, not as
the assets themselves.” Ante, at 10. So long as a debtor
values her claimed exemption at a dollar amount below
the statutory cap, the Court reasons, the claim is on-its­
face permissible no matter the market value she ascribes
to the asset. To evaluate the propriety of Reilly’s declared
“interest” in her kitchen equipment, the Court concludes,
Schwab was obliged promptly to inspect “three, and only
three, entries on Reilly’s Schedule C: the description of the
business equipment . . . ; the Code provisions governing
the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in
the column titled ‘value of claimed exemption.’ ” Ante, at
12–13.6
——————
5 Section 522(d) catalogs exemptions of two types. Most exemptions—
and all of those Reilly invoked—place a monetary limit on the value of
the property the debtor may reclaim. See, e.g., §522(d)(2) (“motor
vehicle”); §522(d)(3) (“household furnishings, household goods, wearing
apparel, appliances, books, animals, crops, or musical instruments”);
§522(d)(4) (“jewelry”). For certain exemptions not at issue here, the
Bankruptcy Code authorizes reclamation of the property in full without
any cap on value. See, e.g., §522(d)(7) (“unmatured life insurance
contract”); §522(d)(9) (“[p]rofessionally prescribed health aids”);
§522(d)(11)(A) (“award under a crime victim’s reparation law”).
6 In support of its view that market value is not relevant to determin­
ing the “property claimed as exempt” for purposes of Rule 4003(b)’s
timely objection mandate, the Court observes that Schedule C did not
require the debtor to list this information until 1991. Ante, at 14–15.
Prior to 1991, however, debtors recorded market value on a different
schedule. See Interim Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Sched­
ule B–2 (1979) (requiring debtor to list the “[m]arket value of [her]
interest [in personal property] without deduction for . . . exemptions
claimed”). Trustees assessing the “property claimed as exempt,”
therefore, have always been able, from the face of the debtor’s filings, to
compare the value of the claimed exemption to the property’s declared
market value. See Brief for National Association of Consumer Bank­
ruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 34.
