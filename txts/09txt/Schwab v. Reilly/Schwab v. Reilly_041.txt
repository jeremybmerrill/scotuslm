SCHWAB v. REILLY
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Ante, at 20–21 (internal quotation marks omitted). See
also Tr. of Oral Arg. 6–7, 26–29; In re Hyman, 967 F. 2d
1316, 1319–1320, n. 6 (CA9 1992) (Trustees must be able
to assess the validity of an exemption from the face of a
debtor’s schedules.). Our decision in Taylor v. Freeland &
Kronz, the Court notes, is instructive. In Taylor, the
debtor recorded the term “$ unknown” as the value of a
claimed exemption, which, the Court observes, raised a
“warning fla[g]” because the value “was not plainly within
the limits the Code allows.” Ante, at 17.
True, a debtor’s schedules must give notice sufficient to
cue the trustee that an objection may be in order. But a
“warning flag” is in the eye of the beholder: If a debtor
lists identical amounts as the market value of exempted
property and the value of her claimed exemption, she has,
on the face of her schedules, reclaimed the entire asset just
as surely as if she had recorded “100% of FMV” in Sched­
ule C’s value-of-claimed-exemption column. See Brief for
Respondent 36. See also 9 Collier ¶4003.03[3], p. 4003–14
(“Only when a debtor’s schedules specifically value the
debtor’s interest in the property at an amount higher than
the amount claimed as exempt can it be argued that a part
of the debtor’s interest in property has not been ex­
empted.” (emphasis added)).
In this case, by specifying $10,718 as both the current
market value of her kitchen equipment and the value of
her claimed exemptions, Reilly gave notice that she had
reclaimed the listed property in full. See supra, at 2–6.
To borrow the Court’s terminology, Reilly waved a “warn­
ing flag” that should have prompted Schwab to object if he
believed the equipment could not be reclaimed in its en­
tirety because its value exceeded the statutory cap. 534
F. 3d, at 179. See 4 Collier ¶522.05[2][b], p. 522–33 (“Nor­
mally, if a debtor lists an asset as having a particular
value in the schedules and then exempts that value, the
schedules should be read as a claim of exemption for the
