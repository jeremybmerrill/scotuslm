tion”; and the fourth, “Current Market Value of Property
Without Deducting Exemptions.” Id., at 57a. In the first
column of Schedule C, Reilly wrote, as she did in Schedule
B’s description-of-property column: “See attached list of
business equipment.” Id., at 58a. On the list appended to
Schedules B and C, Reilly set out by hand a 31-item inven­
tory of her restaurant-plus-catering-venture equipment.
Next to each item, e.g., “Dough Mixer,” “Gas stove,”
“Hood,” she specified, first, the purchase price and, next,
“Today’s Market Value,” which added up to $10,718 for the
entire inventory. Id., at 51a–55a.1
As the laws securing exemption of her kitchen equip­
ment, Reilly specified in the second Schedule C column,
§552(d)(6), the exemption covering trade tools, and
§552(d)(5), the “wildcard” exemption. Id., at 58a.2 In the
value-of-claimed-exemption column, she listed $1,850,
then the maximum trade-tools exemption, and $8,868,
drawn from her wildcard exemption, amounts adding up
to $10,718. Ibid. And in the fourth, current-market­
value, column, she recorded $10,718, corresponding to the
total market value she had set out in her inventory and
reported in Schedule B. Ibid.
Before the 30-day clock on filing objections had begun to
run, an appraiser told Schwab that Reilly’s equipment was
worth at least $17,000. Brief for Petitioner 15; App. 164a.
Nevertheless, Schwab did not object to the $10,718 market
value Reilly attributed to her business equipment in

forms, are reproduced in an Appendix to this opinion.
2 Unlike exemptions that describe the specific property debtors may
preserve, e.g., 11 U. S. C. §522(d)(6) (debtor may exempt her “aggregate
interest, not to exceed [$1,850] in value, in any implements, profes­
sional books, or tool[s] of [her] trade”), the “wildcard” exemption per­
mits a debtor to shield her “aggregate interest in any property” she
chooses, up to a stated dollar limit, §522(d)(5); In re Smith, 640 F. 2d
888, 891 (CA7 1981).
