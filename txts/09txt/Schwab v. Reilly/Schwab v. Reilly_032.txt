GINSBURG, J., dissenting

“A party in interest may file an objection to the list of
property claimed as exempt only within 30 days after
the meeting of creditors held under §341(a) is con­
cluded . . . . The court may, for cause, extend the time
for filing objections if, before the time to object ex­
pires, a party in interest files a request for an exten­

Schwab having filed no objection within the allowable
30 days, each of the tribunals below ruled that the entire
inventory of Reilly’s business equipment qualified as
exempt in full. App. 168a; 403 B. R., at 339; 534 F. 3d, at
178. The leading treatise on bankruptcy, the Court of
Appeals noted, id., at 180, n. 4, is in accord:
“Normally, if the debtor lists property as exempt,
that listing is interpreted as a claim for exemption of
the debtor’s entire interest in the property, and the
debtor’s valuation of that interest is treated as the
amount of the exemption claimed. Were it other­
wise—that is, if the listing were construed to claim as
exempt only that portion of the property having the
value stated—the provisions finalizing exemptions if
no objections are filed would be rendered meaningless.
The trustee or creditors could [anytime] claim that the
debtor’s interest in the property was greater than the
value claimed as exempt and [then] object to the
debtor exempting his or her entire interest in the
property after the deadline for objections had passed.”

Agreeing with the courts below, I would hold that Reilly,
by her precise identification of the exempt property, and
her specification of $10,718 as both the current market
value of her kitchen equipment and the value of the

and designated Rule 4003(b)(1).
