GINSBURG, J., dissenting

threat looming until discharge, “[h]ow can debtors rea­

Brief 25. See In re Polis, 217 F. 3d 899, 903 (CA7 2000)
(Posner, J.) (“If the assets sought to be exempted by the
debtor were not valued at a date early in the bankruptcy
proceeding, neither the debtor nor the creditors would
know who had the right to them.”).

The Court and Schwab raise three concerns about read­
ing Rule 4003 to require timely objection to the debtor’s
estimate of an exempt asset’s market value: Would trus­
tees face an untoward administrative burden? Would
trustees lack fair notice of the need to object? And would
debtors be tempted to undervalue their property in an
effort to avoid the monetary cap on exemptions? In my

utility to a debtor, who will have to pay more to replace the item. See
H. R. Rep. No. 95–595, p. 127 (1977) (noting that “household goods have
little resale value” but “replacement costs of the goods are generally
high”).
12 This concern is questionable in light of the prevailing practice, for,
as earlier noted, valuation objections are the most common Rule
4003(b) challenge. See supra, at 2. By lopping off valuation disagree­
ments from the timely objection requirement, see, e.g., ante, at 10–11,
n. 8, the Court so severely shrinks the Rule’s realm that this question
