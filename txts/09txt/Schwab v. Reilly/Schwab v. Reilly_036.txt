GINSBURG, J., dissenting

the character of the interest the debtor is asserting in that
asset, Rule 4003(b) is properly read to require objections to
valuation within 30 days, just as the Rule requires timely
objections to the debtor’s description of the property, the
asserted legal basis for the exemption, and the claimed
value of the exemption. See 4 Collier ¶522.05[1], p. 522–
28 (rev. 15th ed. 2005) (“[T]o evaluate the propriety of the
debtor’s claim of exemption,” trustees need the informa­
tion in all four columns of Schedule C; “[market] value” is
“essential” to judging whether the claim is proper because
“[e]xemption provisions often are limited according to . . .
[the property’s] value.”). 9
C
Requiring objections to market valuation notably facili­
tates the debtor’s fresh start, and thus best fulfills the
prime purpose of the exemption prescriptions. See, e.g.,
Burlingham v. Crouse, 228 U. S. 459, 473 (1913) (Bank­
ruptcy provisions “must be construed” in light of policy “to
give the bankrupt a fresh start.”). See also Rousey v.

that this interpretation of Rule 4003(b) “lacks statutory
support,” ante, at 13, n. 11, the Court repeatedly emphasizes that the
Bankruptcy Code defines the “property claimed as exempt,” to which a
trustee must object, as “the debtor’s ‘interest’—up to a specified dollar
amount—in the assets described in [capped exemption] categor[ies],”
ante, at 10; see, e.g., ante, at 11; ibid., n. 9; ante, at 21, n. 19. But the
commonly understood definition of a property “interest” is “[a] legal
share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right
in property. . . . Collectively, the word includes any aggregation of
[such] rights.” Black’s Law Dictionary 828 (8th ed. 2004). Schwab,
therefore, could not comprehend whether Reilly claimed a monetary or
an in-kind “interest” in her kitchen equipment without comparing her
market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed exemp­
tion. See supra, at 8–9. In line with the statutory text, a debtor’s
market valuation is an essential factor in determining the nature of the
“interest” a debtor lists as exempt. Bankruptcy “forms, rules, treatise
excerpts, and policy considerations,” ante, at 7, n. 5, corroborate, rather
than conflict with, this reading of the Code.
