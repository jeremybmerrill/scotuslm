GINSBURG, J., dissenting

If the trustee needs more than 30 days to assess market
value, moreover, the time period is eminently extendable.
Rule 4003(b) prescribes that a trustee may, for cause, ask
the court for an extension of the objection period. Alterna­
tively, the trustee can postpone the conclusion of the
meeting of creditors, from which the 30-day clock runs,
simply by adjourning the meeting to a future date. Rule
2003(e). A trustee also may examine the debtor under
oath at the creditors’ meeting, Rule 2003(b)(1); if he gath­
ers information impugning her exemption claims, he may
ask the bankruptcy court to hold a hearing to determine
valuation issues, Rule 4003(c). See Taylor, 503 U. S., at
644 (“If [the trustee] did not know the value of [a claimed
exemption], he could have sought a hearing on the issue
. . . or . . . asked the Bankruptcy Court for an extension of
time to object.”). See also NACBA Brief 19, 21–23 (listing
ways trustees may enlarge the limitations period for
objections). Trustees, in sum, have ample mechanisms at
their disposal to gain the time and information they need
to lodge objections to valuation.
B
On affording trustees fair notice of the need to object,
the Court emphasizes that a debtor must list her claimed
exemptions “in a manner that makes the scope of the
exemption clear.” Ante, at 20. If a debtor wishes to ex­
empt property in its entirety, for example, the Court coun­
sels her to write “full fair market value (FMV)” or “100% of
FMV” in Schedule C’s value-of-claimed-exemption column.

“WHEREFORE Trustee prays that the court determine that debtor is
not entitled to . . . the exemptio[n] claimed by him, that the [property
claimed as exempt] which [is] disallowed be turned over to the trustee
herein as property of the estate, and that he have such other and
further relief as is just.” 13A Collier §CS17.14, p. CS 17–22 (rev. 15th
