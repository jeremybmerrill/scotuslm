SCHWAB v. REILLY
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

claimed exemptions, had made her position plain: She
claimed as exempt the listed property itself—not the
dollar amount, up to $10,718, that sale of the property by

Pursuant to §522(l), Reilly filed a list of property she
claimed as exempt from the estate-in-bankruptcy. Her

to file a timely objection to the exemption Reilly claimed,
and indeed could auction off her cooking equipment any­

the language of exemption prescriptions that are subject to
