SCHWAB v. REILLY
Opinion of the Court

agreement among the Circuits about what constitutes a
claim of exemption to which an interested party must
object under §522(l).4 We granted certiorari to resolve this
conflict. See 556 U. S. ___ (2009). We conclude that the
Court of Appeals’ approach fails to account for the text of
the relevant Code provisions and misinterprets our deci­
sion in Taylor. Accordingly, we reverse.
II
The starting point for our analysis is the proper inter­
pretation of Reilly’s Schedule C. If we read the Schedule
Reilly’s way, she claimed exemptions in her business
equipment that could exceed statutory limits, and thus
claimed exemptions to which Schwab should have objected
if he wished to enforce those limits for the benefit of the

In re Williams, 104 F. 3d 688, 690 (CA4 1997) (holding
that interested parties have no duty to object to a claimed exemption
where the dollar amount the debtor assigns the exemption is facially
within the range the Code allows for the type of property in issue); In re
Wick, 276 F. 3d 412 (CA8 2002) (employing reasoning similar to Wil
liams, but stopping short of articulating a clear rule), with In re Green,
31 F. 3d 1098, 1100 (CA11 1994) (“A debtor who exempts the entire
reported value of an asset is claiming the [asset’s] ‘full amount,’ what­
ever it turns out to be”); In re Anderson, 377 B. R. 865 (Bkrtcy. App.
Panel CA6 2007) (similar); and In re Barroso-Herrans, 524 F. 3d 341,
344 (CA1 2008) (focusing on “how a reasonable trustee would have
understood the filings under the circumstances”); In re Hyman, 967
F. 2d 1316 (CA9 1992) (applying an analogous totality-of-the­
circumstances approach).
