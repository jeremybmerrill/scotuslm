Opinion of the Court

App. 58a. The total value of these claimed exemptions
($10,718) equaled the value Reilly separately listed on
Schedules B and C as the equipment’s estimated market
value, see id., at 49a, 58a.
Subject to exceptions not relevant here, the Federal
Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require interested parties
to object to a debtor’s claimed exemptions within 30 days
after the conclusion of the creditors’ meeting held pursu­
ant to Rule 2003(a). See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b).
If an interested party fails to object within the time al­
lowed, a claimed exemption will exclude the subject prop­
erty from the estate even if the exemption’s value exceeds
what the Code permits. See, e.g., §522(l); Taylor v. Free
land & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 642–643 (1992).
Petitioner William G. Schwab, the trustee of Reilly’s
bankruptcy estate, did not object to Reilly’s claimed ex­
emptions in her business equipment because the dollar
value Reilly assigned each exemption fell within the limits
that §§522(d)(5) and (6) prescribe. App. 163a. But be­
cause an appraisal revealed that the total market value of
Reilly’s business equipment could be as much as $17,200,2
Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for permission to
auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718
she claimed as exempt, and the estate could distribute the
equipment’s remaining value (approximately $6,500) to
Reilly’s creditors. App. 141a–143a.
——————
an “aggregate interest in any property, not to exceed in value $800 plus
up to $7,500 of any unused amount of the [homestead or burial plot]
exemption provided under [§522(d)(1)].”
In 2004, pursuant to
§104(b)(2), the Judicial Conference of the United States published
notice that §522(d)(5) would impose the $975 and $9,250 ($10,225 total)
limits that governed Reilly’s April 2005 petition. See 69 Fed. Reg. 8482
(Table). In 2007 and 2010 the limits were again increased. See 72 id.,
at 7082 (Table); 75 id., at 8748 (Table).
2 Schwab concedes that the appraisal occurred before Rule 4003(b)’s
30-day window for objecting to the claimed exemptions had passed. See
Brief for Petitioner 15.
