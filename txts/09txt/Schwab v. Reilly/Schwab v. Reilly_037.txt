SCHWAB v. REILLY
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325 (2005); United States v. Secu
rity Industrial Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 72, n. 1 (1982); ante, at
19. The 30-day deadline for objections, this Court has
recognized, “prompt[s] parties to act and . . . produce[s]
finality.” Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 644
(1992). As “there can be no possibility of further objection
to the exemptions” after this period elapses, the principal
bankruptcy treatise observes, “if the debtor is not yet in
possession of the property claimed as exempt, it should be
turned over to [her] at this time to effectuate fully the
fresh start purpose of the exemptions.”

With the benefit of closure, and the certainty it brings,
the debtor may, at the end of the 30 days, plan for her
future secure in the knowledge that the possessions she
has exempted in their entirety are hers to keep. See 534
F. 3d, at 180. If she has reclaimed her car from the estate,
for example, she may accept a job not within walking
distance. See Brief for National Association of Consumer
Bankruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 2–3 (herein­
after NACBA Brief). Or if she has exempted her kitchen
equipment, she may launch a new catering venture. See
App. 138a (Reilly “wishe[d] to continue in restaurant and
catering as her occupation” postbankruptcy.).
By permitting trustees to challenge a debtor’s valuation
of exempted property anytime before discharge, the Court
casts a cloud of uncertainty over the debtor’s use of assets
reclaimed in full. If the trustee gains a different opinion of
an item’s value months, even years, after the debtor has
filed her bankruptcy petition,10 he may seek to repossess
the asset, auction it off, and hand the debtor a check for
