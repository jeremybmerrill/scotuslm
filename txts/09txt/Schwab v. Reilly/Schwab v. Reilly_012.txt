SCHWAB v. REILLY
Opinion of the Court

argue that the value of the property claimed exempt, i.e.,
the value of the debtor’s exempt interest in the asset,
should be judged on the value the debtor assigns the
interest, not on the value the debtor assigns the asset.
The point of disagreement is best illustrated by the rele­
vant portion of Reilly’s Schedule C:
Schedule C─Property Claimed as Exempt

According to Reilly, Schwab was required to treat the
estimate of market value she entered in column four as
part of her claimed exemption in identifying the “property
claimed as exempt” under §522(l). See Brief for Respon­
dent 22–28. Relying on this premise, Reilly argues that
where, as here, a debtor equates the total value of her
claimed exemptions in a certain asset (column three) with
her estimate of the asset’s market value (column four), she
establishes the “property claimed as exempt” as the full
value of the asset, whatever that turns out to be. See ibid.
Accordingly, Reilly argues that her Schedule C clearly put
Schwab on notice that she “intended” to claim an exemp­
tion for the full value of her business equipment, and that
Schwab’s failure to oppose the exemption in a timely
manner placed the full value of the equipment outside the
estate’s reach.
Schwab does not dispute that columns three and four
apprised him that Reilly equated the total value of her
claimed exemptions in the equipment ($1,850 plus $8,868)
