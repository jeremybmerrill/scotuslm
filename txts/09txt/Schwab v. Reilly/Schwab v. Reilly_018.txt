SCHWAB v. REILLY
Opinion of the Court

Our interpretation of Schwab’s statutory obligations is
not only consistent with the governing Code provisions; it
is also consistent with the historical treatment of bank­
ruptcy exemptions. Congress has permitted debtors to
exempt certain property from their bankruptcy estates for
more than two centuries. See Act of Apr. 4, 1800, ch. 19,
§5, 2 Stat. 23.12 Throughout these periods, debtors have
validly exempted property based on forms that required
the debtor to list the value of a claimed exemption without
also estimating the market value of the asset in which the
——————
market value, because then it might be necessary to “compar[e] [the
debtor’s] market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed
exemption” to determine the exemption’s propriety. Post, at 9, n. 9.
But the Code does not phrase the exemption cap in such terms. More­
over, even accepting that the equivalent Schedule C entries the dissent
relies upon represent a claim to exempt an asset’s full value, the
dissent does not explain why this equivalence precludes a trustee from
relying on the dollar amount the debtor expressly assigns both entries.
According to the dissent, a trustee faced with such entries should
assume not only that the debtor reclaims from the estate what she
believes to be the full value of an asset in which the Code allows her to
exempt an interest “not to exceed” a certain dollar amount, e.g.,
§522(d)(6), but also that the debtor would continue to claim the asset’s
full value as exempt even if that value exceeds her estimate to a point
that would cause her claim to violate the Code. The schedule entries
themselves do not compel this assumption, and the Code provisions
they invoke undercut it. The evidence that the debtor in this case
would have chosen that course is external to her exemption schedule.
See, e.g., supra, at 4 (citing statements in Reilly’s motion to dismiss);
post, at 4, n. 3, 6 (same). And in the ordinary case, particularly if the
equivalent entries the dissent relies upon result from a software de­
fault, see n. 10, supra, there is no reason to assume that a debtor would
want to violate the Code or jeopardize other exemptions if her market
value estimate turns out to be wrong.
