SCHWAB v. REILLY
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

at 644. Among those measures: The debtor files her
exemption claim under penalty of perjury. See Rule
1008. She risks judicial sanction for signing documents
not well grounded in fact. Rule 9011. And proof of fraud
subjects her to criminal prosecution, 18 U. S. C. §152;
extends the limitations period for filing objections to
Schedule C, Rule 4003(b); and authorizes denial of dis­
charge, 11 U. S. C. §727(a)(4)(B). See also NACBA Brief
29–33 (detailing additional checks against inadequate or
inaccurate filings).
Furthermore, the objection procedure is itself a safe­
guard against debtor undervaluation. If a trustee sus­
pects that the market value of property claimed as exempt
may exceed a debtor’s estimate, he should do just what
Rule 4003(b) prescribes: “[F]ile an objection . . . within 30
days after the meeting of creditors.”

For the reasons stated, I would affirm the Third Cir­
cuit’s judgment.
