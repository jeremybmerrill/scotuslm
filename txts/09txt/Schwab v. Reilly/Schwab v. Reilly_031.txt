SCHWAB v. REILLY
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Schedule C and the attached inventory. Instead, he al­
lowed the limitations period to lapse and then moved,
unsuccessfully, for permission to sell the equipment at
auction. Id., at 141a–143a.3
From Reilly’s filings, the Bankruptcy Judge found it
evident that Reilly had claimed the property itself, not its
dollar value, as exempt. Id., at 168a–169a (“I know there’s
an argument . . . that . . . the property identified as exempt
is really the [valuation] column, [i.e., $10,718,] but that’s
not what the forms say. The forms say property declared
as exempt and to see attached list. So, they’re exempting
all the property. . . . If the Trustee believes that . . . all the
property cannot be exempt, [he] should object to it.”).
The District Court and Court of Appeals similarly con­
cluded that, by listing the identical amount, $10,718, as
the property’s market value and the value of the claimed
exemptions, Reilly had signaled her intention to safeguard
all of her kitchen equipment from inclusion in the bank­
ruptcy estate. In re Reilly, 403 B. R. 336, 338–339 (MD
Pa. 2006); In re Reilly, 534 F. 3d 173, 178 (CA3 2008).
Both courts looked to §522(l) and Federal Rule of Bank­
ruptcy Procedure 4003(b), which state, respectively:
“The debtor shall file a list of property that the
debtor claims as exempt . . . . Unless a party in inter­
est objects, the property claimed as exempt on such
list is exempt.” §522(l).

3 Schwab informed Reilly at the meeting of creditors that he planned
to sell all of her business equipment. App. 137a. She promptly moved
to dismiss her bankruptcy petition, stating that her “business equip­
ment . . . is necessary to her livelihood and art, and was a gift to her
from her parents.” Id., at 138a. She “d[id] not desire to continue with
the bankruptcy,” she added, because “she wishe[d] to continue in
restaurant and catering as her occupation.” Ibid. The Bankruptcy
Court denied Reilly’s dismissal motion simultaneously with Schwab’s
motion to sell Reilly’s equipment. Id., at 149a–170a.
