Opinion of the Court

with the equipment’s market value ($10,718). He simply
disagrees with Reilly that this “identical listing put [him]
on notice that Reilly intended to exempt the property
fully,” regardless whether its value exceeded the exemp­
tion limits the Code prescribes. 534 F. 3d, at 178. Schwab
and amicus United States instead contend that the Code
defines the “property” Reilly claimed as exempt under
§522(l) as an “interest” whose value cannot exceed a cer­
tain dollar amount. Brief for Petitioner 20–26; Reply Brief
for Petitioner 3–6; Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 12–18. Construing Reilly’s Schedule C in light of
this statutory definition, they contend that Reilly’s
claimed exemption was facially unobjectionable because
the “property claimed as exempt” (i.e., two interests in her
business equipment worth $8,868 and $1,850, respec­
tively) is property Reilly was clearly entitled to exclude
from her estate under the Code provisions she referenced
in column 2. See supra, at 8 (citing §§522(d)(5) and (6)).
Accordingly, Schwab and the United States conclude that
Schwab had no obligation to object to the exemption in
order to preserve for the estate any value in Reilly’s busi­
ness equipment beyond the total amount ($10,718) Reilly
properly claimed as exempt.
We agree. The portion of §522(l) that resolves this case
is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision stating that the
“property claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is exempt”
unless an interested party objects. Rather, it is the por­
tion of §522(l) that defines the target of the objection,
namely, the portion that says Schwab has a duty to object
to the “list of property that the debtor claims as exempt
under subsection (b).” (Emphasis added.) That subsec­
tion, §522(b), does not define the “property claimed as
exempt” by reference to the estimated market value on
which Reilly and the Court of Appeals rely. Brief for
Respondent 22–23; 534 F. 3d, at 178. Section 522(b)
refers only to property defined in §522(d), which in turn
