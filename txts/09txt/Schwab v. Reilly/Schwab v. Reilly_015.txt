Opinion of the Court

Although we may look to dictionaries and the Bankruptcy
Rules to determine the meaning of words the Code does
not define, see, e.g., Rousey, supra, at 330, the Code’s
definition of the “property claimed as exempt” in this case
is clear. As noted above, §§522(d)(5) and (6) define the
“property claimed as exempt” as an “interest” in Reilly’s
business equipment, not as the equipment per se. Sections
522(d)(5) and (6) further and plainly state that claims to
exempt such interests are statutorily permissible, and
thus unobjectionable, if the value of the claimed interest is
below a particular dollar amount.9 That is the case here,
and Schwab was entitled to rely upon these provisions in
evaluating whether Reilly’s exemptions were objectionable
under the Code. See Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540
U. S. 526, 534 (2004); Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v.
Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000). The
Court of Appeals’ contrary holding not only fails to account
for the Code’s definition of the “property claimed as ex­
empt.” It also fails to account for the provisions in §522(d)
that permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind or
in full regardless of value. See, e.g., §§522(d)(9) (profes­
sionally prescribed health aids), (10)(C) (disability bene­
fits), (7) (unmatured life insurance contracts). We decline
to construe Reilly’s claimed exemptions in a manner that
——————
this point. Accordingly, our holding does not “reduc[e] Rule 4003’s
governance,” nor does it express any judgment on what constrains
objections to the type of “market value” estimates, post, at 1, the
dissent equates with the dollar value a debtor assigns the “property
claimed as exempt” as defined by the Code, see, e.g., post, at 2, 6.
9 Treating such claims as unobjectionable is consistent with our pre­
cedents. See, e.g., Rousey, 544 U. S., at 325. It also accords with
bankruptcy court decisions holding that where, as here, a debtor claims
an exemption pursuant to provisions that (like §522(d)(6)) permit the
debtor to exclude from the estate only an “interest” in certain property,
the “property” that becomes exempt absent objection, §522(l), is only
the “partial interest” claimed as exempt and not “the asset as a whole,”
e.g., In re Soost, 262 B. R. 68, 72 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA8 2001).
