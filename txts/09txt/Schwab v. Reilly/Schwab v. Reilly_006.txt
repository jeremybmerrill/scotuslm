SCHWAB v. REILLY
Opinion of the Court

[the] claimed exemption” in that asset to be an amount
within the limits that the Code prescribes. Fed. Rule
Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Schedule C (1991) (hereinaf­
ter Schedule C). We hold that, in cases such as this, an
interested party need not object to an exemption claimed
in this manner in order to preserve the estate’s ability to
recover value in the asset beyond the dollar value the
debtor expressly declared exempt.

Respondent Nadejda Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bank­
ruptcy when her catering business failed. She supported
her petition with various schedules and statements, two of
which are relevant here: Schedule B, on which the Bank­
ruptcy Rules require debtors to list their assets (most of
which become property of the estate), and Schedule C, on
which the Rules require debtors to list the property they
wish to reclaim as exempt. The assets Reilly listed on
Schedule B included an itemized list of cooking and other
kitchen equipment that she described as “business equip­
ment,” and to which she assigned an estimated market
value of $10,718. App. 40a, 49a–55a.
On Schedule C, Reilly claimed two exempt interests in
this equipment pursuant to different sections of the Code.
Reilly claimed a “tool[s] of the trade” exemption of $1,850
in the equipment under §522(d)(6), which permits a debtor
to exempt his “aggregate interest, not to exceed $1,850 in
value, in any implements, professional books, or tools, of
[his] trade.” See also 69 Fed. Reg. 8482 (2004) (Table).
And she claimed a miscellaneous exemption of $8,868 in
the equipment under §522(d)(5), which, at the time she
filed for bankruptcy, permitted a debtor to take a “wild­
card” exemption equal to the “debtor’s aggregate interest
in any property, not to exceed” $10,225 “in value.”1 See
