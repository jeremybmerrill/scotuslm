GINSBURG, J., dissenting

entire asset, to which the trustee should object if the
trustee believes the asset has been undervalued.”).
Training its attention on trustees’ needs, moreover, the
Court overlooks the debtor’s plight. As just noted, the
Court counsels debtors wishing to exempt an asset in full
to write “100% of FMV” or “full FMV” in the value-of­
claimed-exemption column. But a debtor following the
instructions that accompany Schedule C would consider
such a response nonsensical, for those instructions direct
her to “state the dollar value of the claimed exemption in
the space provided.” Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form
6, Schedule C, Instruction 5 (1991) (emphasis added).
Chapter 7 debtors are often unrepresented. How are they
to know they must ignore Schedule C’s instructions and
employ the “warning flag” described today by the Court, if
they wish to trigger the trustee’s obligation to object to
their market valuation in a timely fashion? See In re
Anderson, 377 B. R. 865, 875 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA6

Schwab finally urges that requiring timely objections to
a debtor’s market-value estimations “would give debtors a
perverse incentive to game the system by undervaluing
their assets.” Brief for Petitioner 35; see Brief for United

ment along these lines in Taylor, and should follow suit
here. Multiple measures, Taylor explained, discourage
undervaluation of property claimed as exempt. 503 U. S.,

in contrast, are repeat players in bankruptcy court; if this
Court required timely objections to market valuation, trustees would,
no doubt, modify their practices in response.

Kronz, 503 U. S. 638 (1992)], trustees rarely fail to closely scrutinize
vague exemption claims.”). Moreover, because valuation objections are
already the norm, see supra, at 2, and 11, n. 12, few trustees would
have to adjust their behavior.
