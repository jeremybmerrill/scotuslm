SCHWAB v. REILLY
Opinion of the Court

lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim as
exempt. As we have recognized, most of these categories
(and all of the categories applicable to Reilly’s exemptions)
define the “property” a debtor may “clai[m] as exempt” as
the debtor’s “interest”—up to a specified dollar amount—
in the assets described in the category, not as the assets
themselves. §§522(d)(5)–(6); see also §§522(d)(1)–(4), (8);
Rousey v. Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325 (2005); Owen v.
Owen, 500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). Viewing Reilly’s form
entries in light of this definition, we agree with Schwab
and the United States that Schwab had no duty to object
to the property Reilly claimed as exempt (two interests in
her business equipment worth $1,850 and $8,868) because
the stated value of each interest, and thus of the “prop­
erty claimed as exempt,” was within the limits the Code
allows.7
Reilly’s contrary view of Schwab’s obligations under
§522(l) does not withstand scrutiny because it defines the
target of a trustee’s objection—the “property claimed as
exempt”—based on language in Schedule C and dictionary
definitions of “property,” see Brief for Respondent 24–25,
40–41, that the definition in the Code itself overrides.8
——————
7 Schwab’s statutory duty to object to the exemptions in this case
turns solely on whether the value of the property claimed as exempt
exceeds statutory limits because the parties agree that Schwab had no
cause to object to Reilly’s attempt to claim exemptions in the equipment
at issue, or to the applicability of the Code provisions Reilly cited in
support of her exemptions.
8 The dissent’s approach suffers from a similar flaw, and misstates
our holding in critiquing it. See post, at 1−2 (asserting that by refusing
to subject “challenges to the debtor’s valuation of exemptible assets” to
the “30-day” objection period in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure
4003(b), we “drastically reduc[e] Rule 4003’s governance”). Challenges
to the valuation of what the dissent terms “exemptible assets” are not
covered by Rule 4003(b) in the first place. Post, at 1. Challenges to
“property claimed as exempt” as defined by the Code are covered by
Rule 4003(b), but in this case that property is not objectionable, so the
lack of an objection did not violate the Rule. Our holding is confined to
