Opinion of the Court

objection deadline we enforced in Taylor is inapplicable
here.
IV
In a final effort to defend the Court of Appeals’ judg­
ment, Reilly asserts that her approach to §522(l) is neces­
sary to vindicate the Code’s goal of giving debtors a fresh
start, and to further its policy of discouraging trustees and
creditors from sleeping on their rights. See Brief for Re­
spondent 21, 55–68. Although none of Reilly’s policy
arguments can overcome the Code provisions or the as­
pects of Taylor that govern this case, our decision fully
accords with all of the policies she identifies. We agree
that “exemptions in bankruptcy cases are part and parcel
of the fundamental bankruptcy concept of a ‘fresh start.’ ”
Brief for Respondent 21 (quoting Rousey, 544 U. S., at
325); see Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., 549 U. S.
365, 367 (2007). We disagree that this policy required
Schwab to object to a facially valid claim of exemption on
pain of forfeiting his ability to preserve for the estate any
value in Reilly’s business equipment beyond the value of
the interest she declared exempt. This approach threat­
ens to convert a fresh start into a free pass.
As we emphasized in Rousey, “[t]o help the debtor obtain
a fresh start, the Bankruptcy Code permits him to with
draw from the estate certain interests in property, such as
his car or home, up to certain values.” 544 U. S., at 325
(emphasis added). The Code limits exemptions in this
fashion because every asset the Code permits a debtor to
withdraw from the estate is an asset that is not available
to his creditors. See §522(b)(1). Congress balanced the
difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors
with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors,
and it is not for us to alter this balance by requiring trus­
tees to object to claimed exemptions based on form entries
beyond those that govern an exemption’s validity under
