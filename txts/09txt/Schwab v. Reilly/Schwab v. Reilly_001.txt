SCHWAB v. REILLY
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 08–538.

Argued November 3, 2009—Decided June 17, 2010

Respondent Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy when her catering
business failed. She supported her petition with, inter alia, Schedule
B, on which debtors must list their assets, and Schedule C, on which
they must list the property they wish to reclaim as exempt. Her
Schedule B assets included cooking and other kitchen equipment, to
which she assigned an estimated market value of $10,718. On
Schedule C, she claimed two exempt interests in this “business
equipment”: a “tool[s] of the trade” exemption for the statutory
maximum “$1,850 in value,” 11 U. S. C. §522(d)(6); and $8,868 under
the statutory provisions allowing miscellaneous, or “wildcard,” ex
emptions up to $10,225 in value. The claimed exemptions’ total value
($10,718) equaled Reilly’s estimate of the equipment’s market value.
Property claimed as exempt will be excluded from the bankruptcy es
tate “[u]nless a party in interest” objects, §522(l), within a certain 30
day period, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b). Absent an objection,
the property will be excluded from the estate even if the exemption’s
value exceeds what the Code permits. See, e.g., §522(l); Taylor v.
Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 642–643.
Although an appraisal revealed that the equipment’s total market
value could be as much as $17,200, petitioner Schwab, the bank
ruptcy estate’s trustee, did not object to the claimed exemptions be
cause the dollar value Reilly assigned to each fell within the limits of
§§522(d)(5) and (6). Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for per
mission to auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718
she claimed exempt and the estate could distribute the remaining
value to her creditors. Reilly countered that by equating on Schedule
C the total value of her claimed exemptions in the equipment with
the equipment’s estimated market value, she had put Schwab and
