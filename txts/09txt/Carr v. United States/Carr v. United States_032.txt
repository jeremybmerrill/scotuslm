ALITO, J., dissenting

torney General in 2007 issued an interim rule providing
that SORNA applies to pre-enactment convictions. 72
Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR §72.3).7
Petitioner contends that, if Congress had wanted to
make §2250(a) applicable to sex offenders who traveled in
interstate commerce before SORNA took effect, Congress
could have referred in §2250(a)(2)(B) to a person who
“traveled,” “has traveled,” or, at the time of the statute’s
enactment, “had traveled” in interstate commerce. Brief
for Petitioner 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). Any
such phrasing, however, would have strongly suggested
that §2250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex
offense convictions—the very question that Congress chose
not to decide but instead to leave for the Attorney General.
A brief explanation is needed to make clear why word
ing §2250(a)(2)(B) in the past tense (or the present perfect
or past perfect tense) would have had such an effect. The
Court and I agree that §2250(a) applies only to persons
who travel in interstate commerce after they are convicted
of a qualifying sex offense. See ante, at 6; infra, at 11–12.
Therefore, if §2250(a) had been phrased in the past tense
(or the present perfect or past perfect tense), it would
——————
414–415, 419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F. 3d 222, 226–
229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008)
(case below); United States v. Madera, 528 F. 3d 852, 856–859 (CA11
2008). Those Courts of Appeals in the latter group, in my view, have
the better of the argument. Section 113(d) of SORNA delegates to the
Attorney General the “authority to specify the applicability of the
requirements of [Title I of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the
enactment of [the] Act.” 120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S. C. §16913(d). The clear
negative implication of that delegation is that, without such a determi
nation by the Attorney General, the Act would not apply to those with
pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.
7 Although not controlling, it is worth noting that one of the two ex
amples the Attorney General included in his February 2007 rule
contemplated that pre-SORNA travel would be sufficient to satisfy
§2250(a)(2)(B)’s interstate-travel requirement. See 28 CFR §72.3
(Example 2).
