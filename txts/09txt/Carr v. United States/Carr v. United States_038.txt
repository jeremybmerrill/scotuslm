ALITO, J., dissenting

and I submit that there is none.10
IV
For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the
Seventh Circuit, and I therefore respectfully dissent.

——————
swer to point to Congress’ decision to delegate to the Attorney General
the responsibility of deciding whether §2250(a) should reach persons
with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions. Of course, that delegation
created the possibility that the Attorney General would decide that
§2250(a) should not apply to such offenders, and if he had so decided it
would likely follow that post-SORNA interstate travel would also be
required. (This is the case because, as previously explained, there is a
strong argument that §2250(a) requires interstate travel that comes
after a qualifying conviction.)
Now that the Attorney General has decided that §2250(a) reaches
persons with pre-SORNA sex offense convictions, however, the relevant
question is this: Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted
to draw a distinction between (1) persons with pre-SORNA convictions
and pre-SORNA travel and (2) persons with pre-SORNA convictions
and post-SORNA travel? And to this question, the Court offers no
plausible answer.
10 Petitioner makes the additional argument that interpreting
§2250(a)(2)(B) to reach pre-enactment travel renders the statute an
unlawful ex post facto law. See U. S. Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 3. Petitioner
remained unregistered in Indiana five months after the promulgation
of the regulation making SORNA applicable to persons with preSORNA sex-offense convictions. For essentially the reasons explained
by the Court of Appeals, see United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d, at 585–
587, I would reject petitioner’s ex post facto argument.
