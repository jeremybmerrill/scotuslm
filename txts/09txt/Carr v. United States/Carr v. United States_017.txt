Opinion of the Court

enforcement mechanisms by subjecting to federal prosecu
tion any covered sex offender who “changes address to a
State other than the State in which the person resided at
the time of the immediately preceding registration” and
“knowingly fails to” register as required. Pam Lychner
Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996,
Pub. L. 104–236, §2, 110 Stat. 3095, 3096, 42 U. S. C.
§§14072(g)(3), (i).7 The prospective orientation of this
provision is apparent. No statutory gap necessitated
coverage of unregistered offenders who “change[d] ad
dress” before the statute’s enactment; the prosecution of
such persons remained the province of the States.
In enacting SORNA, Congress preserved this basic
allocation of enforcement responsibilities. To strengthen
state enforcement of registration requirements, Congress
established, as a funding condition, that “[e]ach jurisdic
tion, other than a Federally recognized Indian tribe, shall
provide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term
of imprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure
of a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this
subchapter.” §16913(e).8 Meanwhile, Congress in §2250
exposed to federal criminal liability, with penalties of up
to 10 years’ imprisonment, persons required to register
under SORNA over whom the Federal Government has a
direct supervisory interest or who threaten the efficacy of
the statutory scheme by traveling in interstate commerce.

law also exposed to federal criminal liability any person
whose State “ha[d] not established a minimally sufficient sexual
offender registration program” and who was thus required to register
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). See 42 U. S. C.
§§14072(c), (g)(2), (i). SORNA does not include a similar FBI registra
tion requirement, presumably because, by the time of the statute’s
enactment, “every State . . . had enacted some” type of registration
system. Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 90 (2003).
8 The law in Indiana, Carr’s State of residence, makes the failure to
register a Class D felony, which carries a prison term of up to three
years’ imprisonment. Ind. Code §§11–8–8–17(a), 35–50–2–7(a) (2009).
