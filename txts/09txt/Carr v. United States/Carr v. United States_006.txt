CARR v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court 


I

In May 2004, petitioner Thomas Carr pleaded guilty in
Alabama state court to first-degree sexual abuse. He was
sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment, with all but two
years suspended. Receiving credit for time previously
served, Carr was released on probation on July 3, 2004,
and he registered as a sex offender as required by Ala
bama law.
In late 2004 or early 2005, prior to SORNA’s enactment,
Carr relocated from Alabama to Indiana. He did not
comply with Indiana’s sex-offender registration require
ments. In July 2007, Carr came to the attention of law
enforcement in Fort Wayne, Indiana, following his in
volvement in a fight.
On August 22, 2007, federal prosecutors filed an indict
ment in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Indiana charging Carr with failing to register in
violation of §2250. Carr moved to dismiss the indictment,
asserting that because he traveled to Indiana prior to
SORNA’s effective date, it would violate the Ex Post Facto
Clause to prosecute him under §2250. The District Court
denied Carr’s motion, and Carr entered a conditional
guilty plea, preserving his right to appeal. He received a
30-month prison sentence.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit consolidated Carr’s appeal with that of a similarly
situated defendant, who, in addition to raising an ex post
facto claim, asserted that §2250, by its terms, does not
apply to persons whose interstate travel preceded
SORNA’s enactment. Beginning with the statutory argu
ment, the Court of Appeals held that §2250 “does not
require that the defendant’s travel postdate the Act.”
United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 582 (2008). The
court relied principally on its understanding of SORNA’s
underlying purpose:
