THOMAS CARR, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 1, 2010]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
Since 1994, federal law has required States, as a condi
tion for the receipt of certain law enforcement funds, to
maintain federally compliant systems for sex-offender
registration and community notification. In an effort to
make these state schemes more comprehensive, uniform,
and effective, Congress in 2006 enacted the Sex Offender
Registration and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) as part
of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, Pub.
L. 109–248, Tit. I, 120 Stat. 590. Among its provisions,
the Act established a federal criminal offense covering,
inter alia, any person who (1) “is required to register
under [SORNA],” (2) “travels in interstate or foreign com
merce,” and (3) “knowingly fails to register or update a
registration.” 18 U. S. C. §2250(a). At issue in this case is
whether §2250 applies to sex offenders whose interstate
travel occurred prior to SORNA’s effective date and, if so,
whether the statute runs afoul of the Constitution’s prohi
bition on ex post facto laws. See Art. I, §9, cl. 3. Liability
under §2250, we hold, cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA
travel. We therefore do not address the ex post facto
question.
