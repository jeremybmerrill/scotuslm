CARR v. UNITED STATES

ALITO, J., dissenting 


C

Petitioner’s present-tense argument is particularly
perverse in light of the context in which §2250(a) was
adopted. When SORNA was enacted, Congress elected not
to decide for itself whether the Act’s registration require
ments—and thus §2250(a)’s criminal penalties—would
apply to persons who had been convicted of qualifying sex
offenses before SORNA took effect. Instead, Congress
delegated to the Attorney General the authority to decide
that question. See §113(d), 120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S. C.
§16913(d) (“The Attorney General shall have the authority
to specify the applicability of the requirements of [Title I
of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the enact
ment of this Act”).6 Pursuant to this delegation, the At
——————
violation” of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permit. In Gwaltney, the permit holder had violated its permit between
1981 and 1984, but the permit holder claimed that it had ceased all
violations by the time the suit was filed. 484 U. S., at 53–55. This
Court held that the phrase “alleged to be in violation” showed that the
provision was meant to apply only where an ongoing violation is al
leged. Id., at 59.
The provision at issue in Gwaltney differs from §2250(a) in that it
specifies the relevant temporal point of reference, namely, the point in
time when the allegation of an ongoing violation is made. Section
2250(a) contains no similar specification. Moreover, the Gwaltney
Court did not read the provision at issue there as speaking at the time
when the provision was enacted. As noted above, however, the silent
premise of petitioner’s argument is that §2250(a) must be read as
speaking as of the time of SORNA’s enactment.
6 To be sure, at least two Courts of Appeals have held that SORNA’s
registration requirements apply by the Act’s own terms to those indi
viduals with sex-offense convictions that predate SORNA’s enactment.
See United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d 926, 929–935 (CA10 2008);
United States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912, 918–919 (CA8 2008). Other
Courts of Appeals, however, have disagreed, reasoning that SORNA’s
explicit grant of authority to the Attorney General to determine the
Act’s applicability to offenders with pre-SORNA convictions implies
that the Act would not apply to those sex offenders absent the Attorney
General’s regulation. See, e.g., United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d 408,
