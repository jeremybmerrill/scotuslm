ALITO, J., dissenting

at which he is registered to confirm that he still resides
there. And even if he moves without warning to some
other address in the State, they can try to track him down.
Once this offender leaves State A, however, the authorities
in that State are severely limited in their ability to moni
tor his movements. And because the State B authorities
have no notice of his entry into their State, they are at a
great disadvantage in trying to enforce State B’s registra
tion law. Congress enacted §2250(a) in order to punish
and deter interstate movement that seriously undermines
the enforcement of sex-offender-registration laws.
The second case is the same as the first in all respects
except that the sex offender travels from State A to State
B before SORNA’s enactment. In other words, the sex
offender is convicted and later released in State A; prior to
SORNA’s enactment, he moves to State B; and then, after
SORNA takes effects, he fails to register in State B, as
SORNA requires.
Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted to
treat the second case any differently from the first? In
both cases, a sex offender’s interstate movement frustrates
enforcement of SORNA’s registration requirements. In
both cases, as a result of that interstate travel, the sex
offender’s new neighbors in State B are unaware of the
presence of a potentially dangerous person in their com
munity, and the State B law enforcement authorities are
hampered in their ability to protect the public. The second
case is the case now before the Court, and the Court offers
no plausible explanation why Congress might have
wanted to treat this case any differently from the first.
If the text of §2250(a) commanded this result, we would,
of course, be obligated to heed that command. But the text
of §2250(a) dictates no such thing. On the contrary, when
properly read, it reaches both cases.
Section 2250(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:
