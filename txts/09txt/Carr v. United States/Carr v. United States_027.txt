CARR v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

“Whoever—
“(1) is required to register under the Sex Offender
Registration and Notification Act . . .
“(2) . . . (B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce
. . . ; and
“(3) knowingly fails to register or update a registra
tion as required by the Sex Offender Registration and
Notification Act;
“shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more
than 10 years, or both.” (Emphasis added.)
As I read this language, neither the use of the present
tense in paragraph (2)(B) nor the sequence in which the
elements are listed provides any basis for limiting the
provision to those sex offenders who move from one State
to another after SORNA’s enactment.

A

The dominant theme of petitioner’s argument is that the
use of the present tense in §2250(a)(2)(B) (“travels in
interstate . . . commerce”) indisputably means that an
offender’s interstate travel must occur after SORNA took
effect. “There is no mystery about the meaning of the
word ‘travels,’ ” petitioner tells us. Brief for Petitioner 15.
“[I]n ordinary usage it refers to present or future travel.”
Ibid. According to petitioner, our “inquiry in this case
should go no further than the plain language of
§ 2250(a)(2)(B), which applies to a person who ‘travels’ in
interstate commerce. Congress’s use of the present tense
is unambiguous, and the statutory language accordingly
should be the end of the matter.” Id., at 16–17; see also
id., at 17 (use of the present tense “travels” is “disposi
tive”); id., at 18 (“[T]he use of the present tense in the
statute should be decisive”); id., at 21 (use of the present
tense “is enough to dispose of this case”).
