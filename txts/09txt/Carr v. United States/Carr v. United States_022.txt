CARR v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

At the very least, the close correspondence between the
Committee’s discussion of missing sex offenders and its
recognition of the travel element’s prospective application
would seem to confirm that reading §2250 to reach only
postenactment travel does not contravene SORNA’s un
derlying purposes, let alone result in an absurdity that
would compel us to disregard the statutory text. Cf. Ar
lington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548
U. S. 291, 296 (2006) (“We have stated time and again that
courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute
what it means and means in a statute what it says there.
When the statutory language is plain, the sole function of
the courts—at least where the disposition required by the
text is not absurd—is to enforce it according to its terms”
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).

Having concluded that §2250 does not extend to preen
actment travel, we need not consider whether such a
construction would present difficulties under the Constitu
tion’s Ex Post Facto Clause. The judgment of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is re
versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
