ALITO, J., dissenting

B
A bad argument does not improve with repetition. And
petitioner’s argument fails because it begs the relevant
question. Petitioner belabors the obvious—that the pre
sent tense is not used to refer to events that occurred in
the past—but studiously avoids the critical question: At
what point in time does §2250(a) speak? Does it speak as
of the time when SORNA took effect? Or does it speak as
of the time when the proscribed conduct occurs? Without
knowing the point in time at which the law speaks, it is
impossible to tell what is past and what is present or
future.
The unspoken premise of petitioner’s argument is that
§2250(a) speaks as of the time when it became law. And if
that premise is accepted, it follows that the use of the
present tense in §2250(a)(2)(B) means that the requisite
interstate travel must occur after, not before, SORNA took
effect. Petitioner’s premise, however, flies in the face of
the widely accepted modern legislative drafting convention
that a law should not be read to speak as of the date of
enactment. The United States Senate Legislative Draft
ing Manual directly addresses this point: “A legislative
provision speaks as of any date on which it is read (rather
than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).”
Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Draft
ing Manual §103(a), p. 4 (1997) (emphasis added). The
House Manual makes the same point:
“Your draft should be a movable feast—that is, it
speaks as of whatever time it is being read (rather
than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).”
House Legislative Counsel’s Manual on Drafting
Style, HLC No. 104–1, §102(c), p. 2 (1995).
In accordance with this convention, modern legislative
drafting manuals teach that, except in unusual circum
stances, all laws, including penal statutes, should be
