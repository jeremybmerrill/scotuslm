Opinion of the Court

II
As relevant here, §2250 provides:
“(a) IN GENERAL.—Whoever—
“(1) is required to register under the Sex Offender
Registration and Notification Act;
“(2)(A) is a sex offender as defined for the purposes
of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act
by reason of a conviction under Federal law (including
the Uniform Code of Military Justice), the law of the
District of Columbia, Indian tribal law, or the law of
any territory or possession of the United States; or
“(B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce, or
enters or leaves, or resides in, Indian country; and
“(3) knowingly fails to register or update a registra
tion as required by the Sex Offender Registration and
Notification Act;
“shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more
than 10 years, or both.”
For a defendant to violate this provision, Carr and the
Government agree, the statute’s three elements must “be
satisfied in sequence, culminating in a post-SORNA fail
——————
2006. See, e.g., May, 535 F. 3d, at 915–919; United States v. Hinckley,
550 F. 3d 926, 929–935 (CA10 2008). Because Carr traveled from
Alabama to Indiana before both the enactment of SORNA and the
Attorney General’s regulation, we have no occasion to consider whether
a pre-SORNA sex offender whose travel and failure to register occurred
between July 2006 and February 2007 is subject to liability under
§2250, and we express no view on that question. We similarly express
no view as to whether §72.3 was properly promulgated—a question that
has also divided the Circuits. Compare Cain, 583 F. 3d, at 419–424
(holding that the Attorney General lacked good cause for issuing the
interim regulation without adhering to the notice-and-comment and
publication requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)),
with United States v. Dean, No. 09–13115, 2010 WL 1687618, *3–*8
(CA11, Apr. 28, 2010) (finding no APA violation); United States v.
Gould, 568 F. 3d 459, 469–470 (CA4 2009) (same).
