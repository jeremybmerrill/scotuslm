CARR v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

Interpreting §2250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment
travel severely impairs §2250(a)’s effectiveness. As inter
preted by the Court, §2250(a) applies to a pre-SORNA sex
offender only if that offender traveled in interstate com
merce at some point after SORNA’s enactment. As the
examples discussed at the beginning of this opinion illus
trate, however, there is no apparent reason why Congress
would have wanted to impose such a requirement. To the
contrary, under the Court’s interpretation, the many sex
offenders who had managed to avoid pre-existing registra
tion regimes, mainly by moving from one State to another
before SORNA’s enactment, are placed beyond the reach of
the federal criminal laws. It surely better serves the
enforcement of SORNA’s registration requirements to
apply §2250(a) to all pre-SORNA sex offenders, regardless
of whether their interstate travel occurred before or after
the statute’s enactment.
The Court provides only a weak defense of the result its
analysis produces. The Court suggests that enhanced
information collection and sharing and state enforcement
of registration laws were the sole weapons that Congress
chose to wield in order to deal with those convicted sex
offenders whose whereabouts were unknown when
SORNA was passed. See ante, at 14–16. I see no basis for
this conclusion. There can be no dispute that the enact
ment of §2250(a) shows that Congress did not think these
measures were sufficient to deal with persons who have
qualifying sex-offense convictions and who move from
State to State after SORNA’s enactment. And in light of
that congressional judgment, is there any plausible reason
to think that Congress concluded that these same meas
ures would be adequate for those with qualifying sex
offense convictions who had already disappeared at the
time of SORNA’s enactment?9 The Court has no answer,
