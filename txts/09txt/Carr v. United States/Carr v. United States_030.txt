ALITO, J., dissenting

mission, Rule Drafting Manual 47 (4th ed. 2006),
http://www.lsc.state.oh.us/rules/rdm06_06.pdf (“Use pre
sent tense. The majority of rules have a continuing effect
in that they apply over time. They speak at the time of
reading, not merely at the time of their adoption. The
present tense therefore includes the future tense”).
Once it is recognized that §2250(a) should not be read as
speaking as of the date when SORNA went into effect,
petitioner’s argument about the use of the present tense
collapses. In accordance with current drafting conven
tions, §2250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the law
went into effect, but as of the time when the first act
necessary for conviction is committed. In the case of
§2250(a), that occurs when an individual is convicted of a
qualifying sex offense, for it is that act that triggers the
requirement to register under SORNA.4 For present
purposes, we must proceed on the assumption that this
event may have occurred before SORNA was enacted.
Viewed as of the time when such a pre-SORNA conviction
takes place, every subsequent act, including movement
from State to State, occurs in the future and is thus prop
erly described using the present tense. Accordingly,
§2250(a)(2)(B)’s use of the present tense (“travels”) sup
ports the application of the statute to a sex offender, like
petitioner, who moved from State to State after conviction
but before SORNA went into effect.5

4 Under

42 U. S. C. §16913, a “sex offender” is required to register,
and the term “sex offender” is defined as a person who was convicted of
a “sex offense.” §16911(1). The Court relies on the artificial argument
that the first act necessary for conviction under 18 U. S. C. §2250(a) is
the failure to register, ante, at 6–7, and n. 4, but in real-world terms the
first necessary act is plainly the commission of a qualifying offense.
5 Contrary to the Court’s interpretation, see ante, at 8–9, Gwaltney of
Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49
(1987), does not support petitioner’s argument. Gwaltney involved a
civil action brought under §505 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C.
§1365(a), which authorizes suit against any person “alleged to be in
