ALITO, J., dissenting

suggests is that the interstate travel must come after the
sex-offense conviction. And because, under the regulation
promulgated by the Attorney General, §2250(a) reaches
pre-SORNA convictions, this argument does not support
the Court’s conclusion that the interstate travel needed
under §2250(a) must have occurred after SORNA was
enacted.
III
When an interpretation of a statutory text leads to a
result that makes no sense, a court should at a minimum
go back and verify that the textual analysis is correct.
Here, not only are the Court’s textual arguments unsound
for the reasons explained above, but the indefensible
results produced by the Court’s interpretation should have
led the Court to doublecheck its textual analysis.
SORNA was a response to a dangerous gap in the then
existing sex-offender-registration laws. In the years prior
to SORNA’s enactment, the Nation had been shocked by
cases in which children had been raped and murdered by
persons who, unbeknownst to their neighbors or the police,
were convicted sex offenders. In response, Congress and
state legislatures passed laws requiring the registration of
sex offenders. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89–90
(2003); Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and
Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Tit. 17, 108
Stat. 2038; Megan’s Law, 110 Stat. 1345. Despite those
efforts, by 2006 an estimated 100,000 convicted sex of
fenders—nearly one-fifth of the Nation’s total sex-offender
population—remained unregistered. H. R. Rep. No. 109–
218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005). The principal problem, a House
Report determined, was that sex offenders commonly
moved from one State to another and then failed to regis
ter in their new State of residence. Ibid. In other words,
interstate travel was dangerously undermining the effec
tiveness of state sex-offender-registration laws.
