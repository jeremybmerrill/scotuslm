Opinion of the Court

“The evil at which [the Act] is aimed is that convicted
sex offenders registered in one state might move to
another state, fail to register there, and thus leave the
public unprotected. The concern is as acute in a case
in which the offender moved before the Act was
passed as in one in which he moved afterward.” Ibid.
(citation omitted).
The court drew an analogy to 18 U. S. C. §922(g), which
prohibits convicted felons from “possess[ing] in or affecting
commerc[e] any firearm or ammunition.” “The danger
posed by such a felon is unaffected by when the gun
crossed state lines . . . , and so it need not have crossed
after the statute was passed.” 551 F. 3d, at 582 (citing
Scarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563 (1977)).
According to the court, §2250(a), like §922(g), uses move
ment in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element
“to establish a constitutional predicate for the statute . . .
rather than to create a temporal requirement.” 551 F. 3d,
at 583.
Reading §2250 to encompass pre-SORNA travel, the
Seventh Circuit recognized, created a conflict with the
Tenth Circuit’s decision in United States v. Husted, 545
F. 3d 1240 (2008). In holding that §2250’s coverage “is
limited to those individuals who travel in interstate com
merce after the Act’s effective date,” the Tenth Circuit
emphasized “Congress’s use of the present tense form of
the verb ‘to travel’ . . . , which according to ordinary Eng
lish grammar, does not refer to travel that has already
occurred.” Id., at 1243–1244. Rejecting this analysis, the
Seventh Circuit characterized Congress’ choice of tenses
as “ ‘not very revealing.’ ” 551 F. 3d, at 583 (quoting Scar
borough, 431 U. S., at 571).
Having dispensed with the statutory question, the
Seventh Circuit considered the claim of Carr and his co
appellant that predicating a §2250 prosecution on pre
