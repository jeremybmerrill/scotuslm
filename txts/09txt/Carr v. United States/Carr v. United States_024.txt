THOMAS CARR, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 1, 2010]


JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and
JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.
The Court’s decision misinterprets and hobbles 18
U. S. C. §2250(a), a provision of the Sex Offender Registra

Court does not address the separate question whether §2250(a) may
validly be applied to a person who was convicted of a qualifying offense
before SORNA was enacted. Congress delegated to the Attorney
General the authority to decide whether the Act’s registration require
