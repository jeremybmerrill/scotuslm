CARR v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

SORNA travel violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Reliance
on a defendant’s pre-SORNA travel, the court concluded,
poses no ex post facto problem so long as the defendant
had “reasonable time” to register after SORNA took effect
but failed to do so. 551 F. 3d, at 585. Noting that Carr
remained unregistered five months after SORNA became
applicable to him, the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convic
tion. Id., at 586–587. The court reversed the conviction of
Carr’s co-appellant, finding that he had not been given a
sufficient grace period to register.
In view of the division among the Circuits as to the
meaning of §2250’s “travel” requirement,1 we granted
certiorari, 557 U. S. __ (2009), to decide the statute’s
applicability to pre-SORNA travel and, if necessary, to
consider the statute’s compliance with the Ex Post Facto
Clause.2

1 While the Seventh and Tenth Circuits have confronted the question
directly, other Circuits have also touched on it. Aligning itself with the
Seventh Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit has analogized 18 U. S. C.
§2250(a) to the felon-in-possession statute, §922(g), and applied it to a
sex offender who traveled before SORNA became applicable to him.
United States v. Dumont, 555 F. 3d 1288, 1291–1292 (2009) (per cu
riam). In contrast, the Eighth Circuit has stated in dictum that
§2250(a) “punishes convicted sex offenders who travel in interstate
commerce after the enactment of SORNA.” United States v. May, 535
F. 3d 912, 920 (2008) (emphasis added).
2 There is a separate conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to when
SORNA’s registration requirements became applicable to persons
convicted of sex offenses prior to the statute’s enactment. Several
Circuits, including the Seventh, have taken the position that the Act
did not apply to such sex offenders until the Attorney General provided
for their inclusion by issuing an interim regulation, 28 CFR §72.3, 72
Fed. Reg. 8897, on February 28, 2007. See, e.g., United States v.
Hatcher, 560 F. 3d 222, 226–229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Cain, 583
F. 3d 408, 414–419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578,
582 (CA7 2008) (case below); United States v. Madera, 528 F. 3d 852,
857–859 (CA11 2008) (per curiam). Other Circuits have held that
persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions became subject to the
Act’s registration requirements upon the statute’s enactment in July
