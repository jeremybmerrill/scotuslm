CARR v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Understanding the act of travel as an aspect of the harm
Congress sought to punish serves to distinguish §2250
from the felon-in-possession statute to which the Seventh
Circuit analogized. See 551 F. 3d, at 582–583. In Scar
borough, this Court held that a prior version of the stat
ute, which imposed criminal liability on any convicted
felon who “ ‘possesses . . . in commerce or affecting com
merce . . . any firearm,’ ” 431 U. S., at 564 (quoting 18
U. S. C. App. §1202(a) (1970 ed.)), did not require the
Government to prove postenactment movement of the
firearm across state lines. According to the Court, Con
gress had given “no indication of any concern with either
the movement of the gun or the possessor or with the time
of acquisition.” 431 U. S., at 572. Its aim was simply “to
keep guns out of the hands of” convicted felons, ibid., and,
by using the phrase “in commerce or affecting commerce,”
it invoked the full breadth of its Commerce Clause author
ity to achieve that end. No one in Scarborough disputed,
however, that the act of possession had to occur post
enactment; a felon who “possess[ed]” a firearm only pre
enactment was plainly outside the statute’s sweep. In this
case, the proper analogy is not, as the Seventh Circuit
suggested, between the travel of a sex offender and the
movement of a firearm; it is between the sex offender who
“travels” and the convicted felon who “possesses.” The act
of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a juris
dictional predicate for §2250, but it is also, like the act of
possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim.

In a final effort to justify its position, the Government
invokes one of SORNA’s underlying purposes: to locate sex
offenders who had failed to abide by their registration
obligations.
SORNA, the Government observes, was
motivated at least in part by Congress’ concern about
these “missing” sex offenders—a problem the House
