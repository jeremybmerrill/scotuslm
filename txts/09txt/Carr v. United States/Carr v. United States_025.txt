CARR v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

and traveled before SORNA took effect but violated the
registration requirement after that date.
The Court’s answer is that §2250(a) applies only to sex
offenders who moved from State to State after SORNA
became law. The Court reaches this conclusion for two
reasons: (1) the verb tense used in §2250(a)(2)(B); and (2)
the sequence in which the elements of the offense are
listed.
As I will attempt to show, the Court’s textual arguments
are thoroughly unsound. And the conclusion that the
Court reaches makes no sense. To appreciate the folly of
the Court’s interpretation, consider the following two
cases.
The first involves a situation in which, for present pur
poses, I assume that §2250(a) applies.3 A man convicted
in State A for sexual abuse is released from custody in
that State and then, after the enactment of SORNA,
moves to State B and fails to register as required by State
B law. Section 2250(a) makes this offender’s failure to
register in State B a federal crime because his interstate
movement frustrates SORNA’s registration requirements.
Because this offender is convicted and then released from
custody in State A, the State A authorities know of his
presence in their State and are thus in a position to try to
ensure that he remains registered. At the time of his
release, they can ascertain where he intends to live, and
they can make sure that he registers as required by state
law. Thereafter, they can periodically check the address
——————
ments—and thus §2250(a)’s criminal penalties—should apply to per
sons in the latter category, 42 U. S. C. §16913(d), and the Attorney
General has promulgated a regulation providing that they do, 72 Fed.
Reg. 8897 (2007) (codified at 28 CFR §72.3 (2009)). Because the Court
does not address the validity of this regulation, I proceed on the as
sumption that 18 U. S. C. §2250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA
sex-offense convictions.
