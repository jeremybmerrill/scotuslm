MOHAMED ALI SAMANTAR, PETITIONER v. BASHE

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[June 1, 2010]


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.
The Court’s admirably careful textual analysis, ante, at
7–13, demonstrates that the term “foreign state” in the
provision “a foreign state shall be immune from the juris
diction of the courts of the United States and of the
States,” 28 U. S. C. §1604, does not include foreign offi

that it should “ ‘never’ ” be used. Ante, at 10, n. 9 (quoting
Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597,
611–612, n. 4 (1991)). Surely that is damning by faint

the Court’s use of it today. The past practice was “not the
practice of using legislative history for the purpose of
giving authoritative content to the meaning of a statutory
text,” Mortier, supra, at 622 (SCALIA, J., concurring in
