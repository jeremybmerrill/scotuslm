Opinion of the Court

foreign sovereigns.” The Court’s specific holding in Schoo
ner Exchange was that a federal court lacked jurisdiction
over “a national armed vessel . . . of the emperor of
France,” id., at 146, but the opinion was interpreted as
extending virtually absolute immunity to foreign sover
eigns as “a matter of grace and comity,” Verlinden, 461
U. S., at 486.
Following Schooner Exchange, a two-step procedure
developed for resolving a foreign state’s claim of sovereign
immunity, typically asserted on behalf of seized vessels.
See, e.g., Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U. S. 30, 34–
36 (1945); Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, 587–589 (1943);
Compania Espanola de Navegacion Maritima, S. A. v. The
Navemar, 303 U. S. 68, 74–75 (1938). Under that proce
dure, the diplomatic representative of the sovereign could
request a “suggestion of immunity” from the State De
partment. Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 581. If the request
was granted, the district court surrendered its jurisdic
tion. Id., at 588; see also Hoffman, 324 U. S., at 34. But
“in the absence of recognition of the immunity by the
Department of State,” a district court “had authority to
decide for itself whether all the requisites for such immu
nity existed.” Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 587; see also
Compania Espanola, 303 U. S., at 75 (approving judicial
inquiry into sovereign immunity when the “Department of
State . . . declined to act”); Heaney v. Government of Spain,
445 F. 2d 501, 503, and n. 2 (CA2 1971) (evaluating sov
ereign immunity when the State Department had not
responded to a request for its views). In making that
decision, a district court inquired “whether the ground of
immunity is one which it is the established policy of the
[State Department] to recognize.” Hoffman, 324 U. S., at
36. Although cases involving individual foreign officials as
defendants were rare, the same two-step procedure was
typically followed when a foreign official asserted immu
nity. See, e.g., Heaney, 445 F. 2d, at 504–505; Waltier v.
