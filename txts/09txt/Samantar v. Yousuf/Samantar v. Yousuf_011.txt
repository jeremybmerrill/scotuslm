SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF
Opinion of the Court

sion of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality
of a foreign state as defined in subsection (b).
“(b) An ‘agency or instrumentality of a foreign state’
means any entity—
“(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or
otherwise, and
“(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political
subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or
other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or
political subdivision thereof, and
“(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the
United States as defined in section 1332(c) and (e) of
this title, nor created under the laws of any third

The term “foreign state” on its face indicates a body
politic that governs a particular territory. See, e.g., Re
statement §4 (defining “state” as “an entity that has a
defined territory and population under the control of a
government and that engages in foreign relations”). In
§1603(a), however, the Act establishes that “foreign state”
has a broader meaning, by mandating the inclusion of the
state’s political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentali
ties. Then, in §1603(b), the Act specifically delimits what
counts as an agency or instrumentality. Petitioner argues
that either “foreign state,” §1603(a), or “agency or instru
mentality,” §1603(b), could be read to include a foreign
official. Although we agree that petitioner’s interpretation
is literally possible, our analysis of the entire statutory
text persuades us that petitioner’s reading is not the
meaning that Congress enacted.
We turn first to the term “agency or instrumentality of a
foreign state,” §1603(b). It is true that an individual
official could be an “agency or instrumentality,” if that
term is given the meaning of “any thing or person through
which action is accomplished,” In re Terrorist Attacks on
