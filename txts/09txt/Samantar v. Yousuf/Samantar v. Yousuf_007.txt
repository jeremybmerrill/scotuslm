SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF
Opinion of the Court

among the Circuits that “the FSIA applies to individual
officials of a foreign state.” 552 F. 3d 371, 378 (CA4
2009).4 It disagreed with that view, however, and con
cluded, “based on the language and structure of the stat
ute, that the FSIA does not apply to individual foreign
government agents like [petitioner].” Id., at 381.5 Having
found that the FSIA does not govern whether petitioner
enjoys immunity from suit, the Court of Appeals re
manded the case for further proceedings, including a
determination of whether petitioner is entitled to immu
nity under the common law. Id., at 383–384. We granted
certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).
II
The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity developed as
a matter of common law long before the FSIA was enacted
in 1976. In Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,
461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983), we explained that in Schooner
Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116 (1812), “Chief Jus
tice Marshall concluded that . . . the United States had
impliedly waived jurisdiction over certain activities of

immunity of individual foreign officials), and Enahoro v. Abubakar, 408
F. 3d 877, 881–882 (CA7 2005) (same), with Chuidian v. Philippine
Nat. Bank, 912 F. 2d 1095, 1103 (CA9 1990) (concluding that a suit
against an individual official for acts committed in his official capacity
must be analyzed under the FSIA), In re Terrorist Attacks on September
11, 2001, 538 F. 3d 71, 83 (CA2 2008) (same), Keller v. Central Bank of
Nigeria, 277 F. 3d 811, 815 (CA6 2002) (same), Byrd v. Corporacion
Forestal y Industrial de Olancho S. A., 182 F. 3d 380, 388 (CA5 1999)
(same), and El-Fadl v. Central Bank of Jordan, 75 F. 3d 668, 671
(CADC 1996) (same).
5 As an alternative basis for its decision, the Court of Appeals held
that even if a current official is covered by the FSIA, a former official is
not. See 552 F. 3d, at 381–383. Because we agree with the Court of
Appeals on its broader ground that individual officials are not covered
by the FSIA, petitioner’s status as a former official is irrelevant to our
analysis.
