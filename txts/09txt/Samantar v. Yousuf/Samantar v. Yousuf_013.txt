SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF
Opinion of the Court

terms Congress chose simply do not evidence the intent to
include individual officials within the meaning of “agency
or instrumentality.”9 Cf. Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538
U. S. 468, 474 (2003) (describing §1603(b) as containing
“indicia that Congress had corporate formalities in mind”).
Petitioner proposes a second textual route to including
an official within the meaning of “foreign state.” He ar
gues that the definition of “foreign state” in §1603(a) sets
out a nonexhaustive list that “includes” political subdivi
sions and agencies or instrumentalities but is not so lim
ited. See Brief for Petitioner 22–23. It is true that use of
the word “include” can signal that the list that follows is
meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.10 And, to

9 Nor does anything in the legislative history suggest that Congress
intended the term “agency or instrumentality” to include individuals.
On the contrary, the legislative history, like the statute, speaks in
terms of entities. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 94–1487, p. 15 (1976) (here
inafter H. R. Rep.) (“The first criterion, that the entity be a separate
legal person, is intended to include a corporation, association, founda
tion, or any other entity which, under the law of the foreign state where
it was created, can sue or be sued in its own name”).
JUSTICE SCALIA may well be correct that it is not strictly necessary to
confirm our reading of the statutory text by consulting the legislative
history, see post, at 1–2 (opinion concurring in judgment). But as the
Court explained some years ago in an opinion authored by Justice
White:
“As for the propriety of using legislative history at all, common sense
suggests that inquiry benefits from reviewing additional information
rather than ignoring it. As Chief Justice Marshall put it, ‘[w]here the
mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every
thing from which aid can be derived.’ United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch
358, 386 (1805). Legislative history materials are not generally so
misleading that jurists should never employ them in a good-faith effort
to discern legislative intent. Our precedents demonstrate that the
Court’s practice of utilizing legislative history reaches well into its past.
See, e.g., Wallace v. Parker, 6 Pet. 680, 687–690 (1832). We suspect
that the practice will likewise reach well into the future.” Wisconsin
Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597, 611–612, n. 4 (1991) (altera
tion in original).
