SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

“position-based individual immunities” in general but only
“consular and diplomatic immunity,” which is not at issue
here. Unless consular and diplomatic immunity, on the
one hand, and, on the other hand, what is at issue here—
state-agent immunity—are always treated the same

Third, and finally, the Court points to legislative history
to establish the purpose of the statute. See ante, at 17,
and n. 19. This is particularly puzzling, because the en
acted statutory text itself includes findings and a declara
