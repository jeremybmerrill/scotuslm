Opinion of the Court

that party has “an interest relating to the subject of the
action” and “disposing of the action in the person’s absence
may . . . as a practical matter impair or impede the per
son’s ability to protect the interest.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
19(a)(1)(B). If this is the case, and the entity is immune
from suit under the FSIA, the district court may have to
dismiss the suit, regardless of whether the official is im
mune or not under the common law. See Republic of
Philippines v. Pimentel, 553 U. S. 851, 867 (2008)
(“[W]here sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims
of the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action
must be ordered where there is a potential for injury to
the interests of the absent sovereign”). Or it may be the
case that some actions against an official in his official
capacity should be treated as actions against the foreign
state itself, as the state is the real party in interest. Cf.
Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159, 166 (1985) (“[A]n
official-capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to
be treated as a suit against the entity. It is not a suit
against the official personally, for the real party in inter
est is the entity” (citation omitted)).
We are thus not persuaded that our construction of the
statute’s text should be affected by the risk that plaintiffs
may use artful pleading to attempt to select between
application of the FSIA or the common law. And we think
this case, in which respondents have sued petitioner in his
personal capacity and seek damages from his own pockets,
is properly governed by the common law because it is not a
claim against a foreign state as the Act defines that term.
Although Congress clearly intended to supersede the
common-law regime for claims against foreign states, we
find nothing in the statute’s origin or aims to indicate that
Congress similarly wanted to codify the law of foreign
official immunity.
