Opinion of the Court

be sure, there are fewer textual clues within §1603(a) than
within §1603(b) from which to interpret Congress’ silence
regarding foreign officials. But even if the list in §1603(a)
is merely illustrative, it still suggests that “foreign state”
does not encompass officials, because the types of defen
dants listed are all entities. See Russell Motor Car Co. v.
United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923) (“[A] word may be
known by the company it keeps”).
Moreover, elsewhere in the FSIA Congress expressly
mentioned officials when it wished to count their acts as
equivalent to those of the foreign state, which suggests
that officials are not included within the unadorned term
“foreign state.” Cf. Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.
85, 103 (2007) (“Drawing meaning from silence is particu
larly inappropriate . . . [when] Congress has shown that it
knows how to [address an issue] in express terms”). For
example, Congress provided an exception from the general
grant of immunity for cases in which “money damages are
sought against a foreign state” for an injury in the United
States “caused by the tortious act or omission of that
foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign
state while acting within the scope of his office.”
§1605(a)(5) (emphasis added). The same reference to
officials is made in a similar, later enacted exception. See
28 U. S. C. A. §1605A(a)(1) (Supp. 2009) (eliminating
immunity for suits “in which money damages are sought
against a foreign state” for certain acts “engaged in by an
official, employee, or agent of such foreign state while
acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or
agency”); see also §1605A(c) (creating a cause of action
against the “foreign state” and “any official, employee, or

§47.7, p. 305 (7th ed. 2007) (“[T]he word ‘includes’ is usually a term of 

enlargement, and not of limitation” (some internal quotation marks

omitted)).
