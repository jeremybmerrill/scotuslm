SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF
SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

tion of purpose—the very same purpose (surprise!) that
the Court finds evidenced in the legislative history. See
28 U. S. C. §1602. To make matters worse, the Court
itself notes this statutory declaration of purpose twice
earlier, in the body of its opinion, see ante, at 6, 13. If
those textual references to the statute itself were deleted,
the footnoted citation of legislative history would at least
perform some function. As it is, however, it adds nothing
except the demonstration of assiduous law-clerk research.
It should be no cause for wonder that, upon careful
examination, all of the opinion’s excerpts from legislative
history turn out to be, at best, nonprobative or entirely
duplicative of text. After all, legislative history is almost
never the real reason for the Court’s decision—and make
weights do not deserve a lot of the Court’s time.
