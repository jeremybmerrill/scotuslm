MOHAMED ALI SAMANTAR, PETITIONER v. BASHE 

ABDI YOUSUF ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[June 1, 2010]


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I join the Court’s opinion except for those parts relying
on the legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immu
nities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. §§1330, 1602, et seq. In my
view, the Court’s textual analysis is sufficient to resolve this case. See post, at 1–4 (SCALIA, J., concurring in
judgment).
