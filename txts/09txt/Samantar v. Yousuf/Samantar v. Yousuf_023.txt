SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF 

Opinion of the Court 


V

Our review of the text, purpose, and history of the FSIA
leads us to the conclusion that the Court of Appeals cor
rectly held the FSIA does not govern petitionerâ€™s claim of
immunity. The Act therefore did not deprive the District
Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. We emphasize, how
ever, the narrowness of our holding. Whether petitioner
may be entitled to immunity under the common law, and
whether he may have other valid defenses to the grave
charges against him, are matters to be addressed in the
first instance by the District Court on remand. The judg
ment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
