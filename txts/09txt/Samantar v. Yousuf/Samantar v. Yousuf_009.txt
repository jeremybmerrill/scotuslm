SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF
Opinion of the Court

Thomson, 189 F. Supp. 319 (SDNY 1960).6
Prior to 1952, the State Department followed a general
practice of requesting immunity in all actions against
friendly sovereigns, but in that year the Department
announced its adoption of the “restrictive” theory of sover
eign immunity. Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 486–487; see also
Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, Depart
ment of State, to Acting Attorney General Philip B.
Perlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull.
984–985 (1952). Under this theory, “immunity is confined
to suits involving the foreign sovereign’s public acts, and
does not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state’s
strictly commercial acts.” Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 487.
This change threw “immunity determinations into some
disarray,” because “political considerations sometimes led
the Department to file ‘suggestions of immunity in cases
where immunity would not have been available under the
restrictive theory.’ ” Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541
U. S. 677, 690 (2004) (quoting Verlinden, 461 U. S., at
487).
Congress responded to the inconsistent application of
sovereign immunity by enacting the FSIA in 1976.
Altmann, 541 U. S., at 690–691; see also Verlinden, 461
U. S., at 487–488. Section 1602 describes the Act’s two
primary purposes: (1) to endorse and codify the restrictive
theory of sovereign immunity, and (2) to transfer primary
responsibility for deciding “claims of foreign states to
immunity” from the State Department to the courts.7

and consular officers could also claim the “specialized
immunities” accorded those officials, Restatement (Second) of Foreign
Relations Law of the United States §66, Comment b (1964–1965)
(hereinafter Restatement), and officials qualifying as the “head of state”
could claim immunity on that basis, see Schooner Exchange v. McFad
don, 7 Cranch 116, 137 (1812) (describing “the exemption of the person
of the sovereign” from “a jurisdiction incompatible with his dignity”).
