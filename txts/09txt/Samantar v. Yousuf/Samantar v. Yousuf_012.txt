Opinion of the Court

Sept. 11, 2001, 538 F. 3d 71, 83 (CA2 2008). But Congress
has specifically defined “agency or instrumentality” in the
FSIA, and all of the textual clues in that definition cut
against such a broad construction.
First, the statute specifies that “ ‘agency or instrumen
tality . . .’ means any entity” matching three specified
characteristics, §1603(b) (emphasis added), and “entity”
typically refers to an organization, rather than an individ
ual. See, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed. 2009).
Furthermore, several of the required characteristics apply
awkwardly, if at all, to individuals. The phrase “separate
legal person, corporate or otherwise,” §1603(b)(1), could
conceivably refer to a natural person, solely by virtue of
the word “person.” But the phrase “separate legal person”
typically refers to the legal fiction that allows an entity to
hold personhood separate from the natural persons who
are its shareholders or officers. Cf. First Nat. City Bank v.
Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611,
625 (1983) (“Separate legal personality has been described
as ‘an almost indispensable aspect of the public corpora
tion’ ”). It is similarly awkward to refer to a person as an
“organ” of the foreign state. See §1603(b)(2). And the
third part of the definition could not be applied at all to a
natural person. A natural person cannot be a citizen of a
State “as defined in section 1332(c) and (e),” §1603(b)(3),
because those subsections refer to the citizenship of corpo
rations and estates. Nor can a natural person be “created
under the laws of any third country.” Ibid.8 Thus, the

points out that §1603(b)(3) describes only which defen
dants cannot be agencies or instrumentalities. He suggests that it
therefore tells us nothing about which defendants can be covered by
that term. Brief for Petitioner 46. Even if so, reading §1603(b) as
petitioner suggests would leave us with the odd result that a corpora
tion that is the citizen of a state is excluded from the definition under
§1603(b)(3), and thus not immune, whereas a natural person who is the
citizen of a state is not excluded, and thus retains his immunity.
