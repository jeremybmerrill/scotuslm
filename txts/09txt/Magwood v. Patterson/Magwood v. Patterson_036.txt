MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

sentence”); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 314, n. 2 (1989)
(“As we have often stated, a criminal judgment necessarily
includes the sentence imposed upon the defendant”). This
well-established principle applies in the federal habeas
context, where petitioner is “in custody pursuant to the
judgment.” §2254(b). A person cannot be held in custody
“pursuant to” a sentence, but only pursuant to “the” (e.g.,
one) judgment, which includes both the conviction and
sentence. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, 156–157
(2007) (per curiam) (explaining that AEDPA’s statute of
limitations did not run until the judgment—“both his
conviction and sentence became final” (internal quotation
marks omitted)).
Under this principle, the Court’s holding today would
allow a challenger in Magwood’s position to raise any
challenge to the guilt phase of the criminal judgment
against him in his second application, since a “new” judg
ment—consisting of both the conviction and sentence—has
now been reentered and all of the errors have (apparently)
occurred anew. As an illustration, the state trial court
here reentered the following judgment after resentencing:
“IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED BY
THE COURT that Billy Joe Magwood is guilty of the
offense of aggravated murder . . . and that Billy Joe Mag
wood is sentenced to death.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a.
This would mean that Magwood’s attorney could dig
through anything that occurred from voir dire to the cross
examination of witnesses to the jury’s guilty verdict, and
raise any alleged errors for the first time in his second
habeas application, all because the trial court did not
properly consider two mitigating factors during Magwood’s
first sentencing proceeding.
Second, and alternatively, the Court could retreat even
further from the statutory text and conclude that only
some parts of the reentered judgment are open to chal
lenge by way of a second habeas application. Magwood,
