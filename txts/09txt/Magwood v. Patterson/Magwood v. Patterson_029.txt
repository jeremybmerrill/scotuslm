KENNEDY, J., dissenting

(second application barred for claims that “could and
should have been raised in [the] first petition”); Delo v.
Stokes, 495 U. S. 320, 321 (1990) (per curiam) (subsequent
application barred for a claim that “could have been raised
in his first petition for federal habeas corpus”). As
McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991), explained, “a
petitioner can abuse the writ by raising a claim in a sub
sequent petition that he could have raised in his first,
regardless of whether the failure to raise it earlier
stemmed from a deliberate choice.” See also Habeas Cor
pus Rule 2(c) (instructing habeas petitioners to “specify all
the grounds for relief available to [them]” and to “state the
facts supporting each ground”); Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S.
298, 317–323 (1995) (describing adoption in habeas,
through legislation and judicial decision, of modified res
judicata (claim preclusion) doctrine); 18 C. Wright, A.
Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure
§4406, p. 138 (2d ed. 2002) (claim preclusion aspect of res
judicata doctrine bars “matters that [were not, but] ought
to have been raised” in prior litigation).
Second, if the petitioner had no fair opportunity to raise
the claim in the prior application, a subsequent applica
tion raising that claim is not “second or successive,” and
§2244(b)(2)’s bar does not apply. This can occur where the
claim was not yet ripe at the time of the first petition, see,
e.g., Panetti, supra, at 947, or where the alleged violation
occurred only after the denial of the first petition, such as
the State’s failure to grant the prisoner parole as required
by state law, see, e.g., Hill v. Alaska, 297 F. 3d 895, 898–
899 (CA9 2002); Crouch v. Norris, 251 F. 3d 720, 723–725
(CA8 2001); In re Cain, 137 F. 3d 234, 236 (CA5 1998).
And to respond to the Court’s concern, see ante, at 20, if
the applicant in his second petition raises a claim that he
raised in his first petition but the District Court left unad
dressed at its own discretion, the second application would
not be “second or successive.” Reraising a previously
