KENNEDY, J., dissenting

approach to determining whether an application is “second
or successive.” Second, it imposes an atextual exception to
§2244(b)’s bar against “second or successive” applications,
requiring that the second-in-time application be brought
against the same judgment. This second error is under
scored by the fact that the Court refuses to deal with the
logical implications of its newly created rule.
A
The Court concludes that because AEDPA refers to
“second or successive” applications rather than “second or
successive” claims, the nature of the claims raised in the
second application is irrelevant. See ante, at 13 (“[A]l

under §2244(b) focus on claims, that does not entitle us to
rewrite the statute to make the phrase ‘second or succes

plained above, Panetti establishes that deciding whether
an application itself is “second or successive” requires
looking to the nature of the claim that the application
raises to determine whether the petitioner had a full and
fair opportunity to raise that claim in his earlier petition.
Indeed, the only way Panetti could have concluded that
the application there was not “second or successive” was to
look at the underlying claim the application raised. 551

While the Court asserts it is not calling Panetti into
doubt, see ante, at 14, n. 11, it does not even attempt to
explain how its analysis is consistent with that opinion, cf.
Panetti, 551 U. S., at 964 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (“Before
AEDPA’s enactment, the phrase ‘second or successive’
meant the same thing it does today—any subsequent
federal habeas application challenging a state-court judg
ment”). The best that can be said is the Court is limiting
its new doctrine so it has no applicability to previously
unexhausted Ford claims, confining the holding of Panetti
