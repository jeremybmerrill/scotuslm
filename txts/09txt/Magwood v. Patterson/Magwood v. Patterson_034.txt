MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

to the facts of that case. 551 U. S., at 968 (THOMAS, J.,
dissenting) (“Today’s decision thus stands only for the
proposition that Ford claims somehow deserve a special
(and unjustified) exemption from the statute’s plain
import”).
Failing to consider the nature of the claim when decid
ing whether an application is barred as “second or succes
sive” raises other difficulties. Consider a second-in-time
habeas petition challenging an alleged violation that
occurred entirely after the denial of the first petition; for
example, a failure to grant a prisoner parole at the time
promised him by state law or the unlawful withdrawal of
good-time credits. See supra, at 3. Under the Court’s
rule, it would appear that a habeas application challeng
ing those alleged violations would be barred as “second or
successive” because it would be a second-in-time applica
tion challenging custody pursuant to the same judgment.
That result would be inconsistent with abuse-of-the-writ
principles and might work a suspension of the writ of
habeas corpus.
B
Having unmoored the phrase “second or successive”
from its textual and historical underpinnings, the Court
creates a new puzzle for itself: If the nature of the claim is
not what makes an application “second or successive,”
then to what should a court look? Finding no reference
point in §2244(b)’s text, the Court searches in AEDPA for
a different peg.
The Court believes that it finds its peg in a different
provision:
“[A] district court shall entertain an application for a
writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody
pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the
ground that he is in custody in violation of the Consti
tution or laws or treaties of the United States.”
