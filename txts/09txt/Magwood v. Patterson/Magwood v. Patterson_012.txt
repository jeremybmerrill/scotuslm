Opinion of the Court

“(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a
new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to
cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that
was previously unavailable; or
“(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not
have been discovered previously through the exercise
of due diligence; and
“(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and
viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be
sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evi
dence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable
factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the
underlying offense.”
This case turns on the meaning of the phrase “second or
successive” in §2244(b). More specifically, it turns on
when a claim should be deemed to arise in a “second or
successive habeas corpus application.” §§2244(b)(1), (2).
If an application is “second or successive,” the petitioner
must obtain leave from the Court of Appeals before filing
it with the district court. See §2244(b)(3)(A). The district
court must dismiss any claim presented in an authorized
second or successive application unless the applicant
shows that the claim satisfies certain statutory require
ments. See §2244(b)(4). Thus, if Magwood’s application
was “second or successive,” the District Court should have
dismissed it in its entirety because he failed to obtain the
requisite authorization from the Court of Appeals. If,
however, Magwood’s application was not second or succes
sive, it was not subject to §2244(b) at all, and his fair
warning claim was reviewable (absent procedural default).
The State contends that although §2244(b), as amended
by AEDPA, applies the phrase “second or successive” to
“application[s],” it “is a claim-focused statute,” Brief for
Respondents 22–24, and “[c]laims, not applications, are
barred by §2244(b),” id., at 24 (citing Artuz v. Bennett, 531
