MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
Opinion of the Court

July 22, 1983, Magwood filed a coram nobis petition and
an application for a stay of execution. The trial court held
a hearing on the petition and denied relief on July 18,
1983.4
Eight days before his scheduled execution, Magwood
filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28
U. S. C. §2254, and the District Court granted a stay of
execution. After briefing by the parties, the District Court
upheld Magwood’s conviction but vacated his sentence and
conditionally granted the writ based on the trial court’s
failure to find statutory mitigating circumstances relating
to Magwood’s mental state.5 See Magwood v. Smith, 608
F. Supp. 218, 225–226, 229 (MD Ala. 1985). The Court of
Appeals affirmed. See Magwood v. Smith, 791 F. 2d 1438,
1450 (CA11 1986).
In response to the conditional writ, the state trial court
held a new sentencing proceeding in September 1986.
This time, the judge found that Magwood’s mental state,
as well as his age and lack of criminal history, qualified as

found that Magwood’s capital felony under §13–11–2(a)(5)
included sufficient aggravation to render him death eligi

that Magwood’s offense rendered him death eligible, but
argued that a death sentence would be inappropriate in
light of the mitigating factors. The trial court imposed a

Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals subsequently affirmed the
denial of Magwood’s coram nobis petition, see Magwood v. State, 449
So. 2d 1267 (1984), and the Alabama Supreme Court denied Magwood’s
motion to file an out-of-time appeal from that decision, see Ex parte
Magwood, 453 So. 2d 1349 (1984).

following: . . . (2) The capital felony was committed while the defendant
was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance
. . . . (6) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of
his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was
substantially impaired”).
