Opinion of the Court

We have described the phrase “second or successive” as
a “term of art.” Id., at 486. To determine its meaning, we
look first to the statutory context. The limitations im
posed by §2244(b) apply only to a “habeas corpus applica
tion under §2254,” that is, an “application for a writ of
habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to
the judgment of a State court,” §2254(b)(1) (emphasis
added). The reference to a state-court judgment in
§2254(b) is significant because the term “application”
cannot be defined in a vacuum. A §2254 petitioner is
applying for something: His petition “seeks invalidation
(in whole or in part) of the judgment authorizing the pris
oner’s confinement,” Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83
(2005) (emphasis added). If his petition results in a dis
trict court’s granting of the writ, “the State may seek a
new judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing
proceeding).” Ibid. (emphasis in original). Thus, both
§2254(b)’s text and the relief it provides indicate that the
phrase “second or successive” must be interpreted with
respect to the judgment challenged.
The State disagrees, contending that if the cross
reference to §2254 is relevant, we should focus not on the
statute’s reference to a “judgment” but on its reference to
“custody,” Brief for Respondents 53; compare §§2254(a),
(b) (establishing rules for review of “an application for a
writ of habeas corpus” on “behalf of a person in custody
pursuant to the judgment of a State court” (emphasis
added)) with §2254(a) (specifying that an application may
be entertained “only on the ground that [the petitioner] is
in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or trea
ties of the United States” (emphasis added)). The State
explains that unlawful “custody” is the key “ ‘substance

AEDPA.” 529 U. S., at 473, 486. Courts have followed Slack in post-

AEDPA cases, and the State agrees it is relevant to the question

presented here. See Brief for Respondents 36, n. 13.
