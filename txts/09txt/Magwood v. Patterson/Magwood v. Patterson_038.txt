MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

though strengthened by a new decision from this Court or
based upon newly discovered evidence, is still “second or
successive.” Thus this subsequent application would only
be permitted if it qualified under the pertinent subsection
(b)(2) exception. In fact, it is the Court’s approach that
limits the relevance of the subsection (b)(2) exceptions.
Under the Court’s theory, the “second or successive” bar
does not apply at all to applications filed by petitioners in
Magwood’s situation, and thus the subsection (b)(2) excep
tions would have no operation in that context.
III
The Court’s approach disregards AEDPA’s “ ‘principles
of comity, finality, and federalism.’ ” Panetti, 551 U. S., at
945 (quoting Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 337). Under the
Court’s newly created exception to the “second or succes
sive” application bar, a defendant who succeeds on even
the most minor and discrete issue relating to his sentenc
ing would be able to raise 25 or 50 new sentencing claims
in his second habeas petition, all based on arguments he
failed to raise in his first petition. “[I]f reexamination of
[a] convictio[n] in the first round of habeas offends federal
ism and comity, the offense increases when a State must
defend its conviction in a second or subsequent habeas
proceeding on grounds not even raised in the first peti
tion.” McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 492.
The Court’s novel exception would also allow the once
successful petitioner to reraise every argument against a
sentence that was rejected by the federal courts during the
first round of federal habeas review. As respondents
explain, under the Court’s theory, “a post-resentencing
petitioner could simply staple a new cover page with the
words, ‘§2254 Petition Attacking New Judgment,’ to his
previously adjudicated petition.” Brief for Respondents
47. Because traditional res judicata principles do not
apply to federal habeas proceedings, see Salinger v. Loisel,
