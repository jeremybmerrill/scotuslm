MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

unaddressed claim is not abusive by any definition. If the
Court believes there are “[m]any examples” where abuse
of-the-writ principles unfairly close the door to state pris
oners seeking federal habeas review, ibid., one would
think the Court would be able to come up with an exam
ple. It does not do so.
Third, a “mixed petition”—raising both abusive and
nonabusive claims—would be “second or successive.” In
that circumstance the petitioner would have to obtain
authorization from the court of appeals to proceed with the
nonabusive claims. See §2244(b)(3); see also 28 J. Moore
et al., Federal Practice §671.10[2][b] (3d ed. 2010). After
the court of appeals makes its determination, a district
court may consider nonabusive claims that the petitioner
had no fair opportunity to present in his first petition and
dismiss the abusive claims. See §2244(b)(4).
The operation of the above rule is exemplified by the
Court’s decision in Panetti. Panetti’s claim that he was
mentally incompetent to be executed under Ford v. Wain
wright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), did not become ripe until
after the denial of his first habeas petition. When the
Ford claim became ripe, Panetti filed a second habeas
petition, raising his Ford claim for the first time. In con
cluding that this second habeas petition was not a “second
or successive” application, this Court explained that “sec
ond or successive” did not “refe[r] to all §2254 applications
filed second or successively in time,” but was rather a
term-of-art that “takes its full meaning from our case law,
including decisions predating the enactment of [AEDPA].”
551 U. S., at 943–944. The Court relied on AEDPA’s
purpose of “ ‘further[ing] the principles of comity, finality,
and federalism,’ ” id., at 945 (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell,
537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003)), an aversion to the “empty
formality requiring prisoners to file unripe” claims, 551
U. S., at 946, and this Court’s pre-AEDPA cases regarding
the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, id., at 947. Panetti thus
