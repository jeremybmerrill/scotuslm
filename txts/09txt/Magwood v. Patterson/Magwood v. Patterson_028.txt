MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

I
Absent two exceptions that are inapplicable here, the
relevant statutory provision in AEDPA provides:
“A claim presented in a second or successive habeas
corpus application under section 2254 that was not
presented in a prior application shall be dismissed
. . . .” 28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(2).
The question before the Court is whether petitioner Billy
Joe Magwood filed “a second or successive” application by
raising a claim in his second habeas petition that he had
available and yet failed to raise in his first petition.
The term “second or successive” is a habeas “term of
art.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486 (2000). It
incorporates the pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ doctrine.
Panetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Before today, that legal princi
ple was established by the decisions of this Court. See,
e.g., ibid.; Slack, 529 U. S., at 486. Under that rule, to
determine whether an application is “second or succes
sive,” a court must look to the substance of the claim the
application raises and decide whether the petitioner had a
full and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior
application. Panetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Applying this
analytical framework puts applications into one of three
categories.
First, if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to
raise the claim in the prior application, a second-in-time
application that seeks to raise the same claim is barred as
“second or successive.” This is consistent with pre-AEDPA
cases applying the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine and the bar
on “second or successive” applications. See, e.g., Wong Doo
v. United States, 265 U. S. 239, 241 (1924) (second applica
tion barred where petitioner had a “full opportunity to
offer proof” of the same claim in his first habeas applica
tion); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U. S. 377, 379 (1984)
(Powell, J., concurring, writing for a majority of the Court)
