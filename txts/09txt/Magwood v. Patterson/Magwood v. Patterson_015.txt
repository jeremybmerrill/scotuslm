MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
Opinion of the Court

requirement’ ” of §2254, whereas being held pursuant to a
state-court “judgment” is merely a “ ‘status requirement.’ ”
Brief for Respondents 53 (quoting Liebman & Hertz,
Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §8.1,
p. 391).
We find this argument unpersuasive. Section 2254
articulates the kind of confinement that may be chal
lenged on the ground that the petitioner is being held “in
violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the
United States.” §2254(a). The requirement of custody
pursuant to a state-court judgment distinguishes §2254
from other statutory provisions authorizing relief from
constitutional violations—such as §2255, which allows
challenges to the judgments of federal courts, or 42
U. S. C. §1983, which allows federal-court suits against
state and local officials. Custody is crucial for §2254
purposes, but it is inextricable from the judgment that
authorizes it.
The State’s “custody”-based rule is difficult to justify for
another reason. Under the State’s approach, applying the
phrase “second or successive” to any subsequent applica
tion filed before a prisoner’s release would mean that a
prisoner who remains in continuous custody for a com
pletely unrelated conviction would have to satisfy the
strict rules for review under §2244(b) to challenge his
unrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the
statutory text or context supports, much less requires,
such an anomalous result. See, e.g., Beyer, 306 F. 3d, at
507 (“[A] prisoner is entitled to one free-standing collateral
attack per judgment, rather than one attack per stretch of
imprisonment”); cf. Dotson, supra, at 85 (SCALIA, J., con
curring) (“[W]hen a habeas petitioner challenges only one
of several consecutive sentences, the court may invalidate
the challenged sentence even though the prisoner remains
