Opinion of the Court

“that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder
would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying
offense,” §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), under the State’s rule, all that
matters is that the facts “could not have been discovered
previously through the exercise of due diligence,”
§2244(b)(2)(B)(i). We decline to adopt a reading that
would thus truncate §2244(b)(2)’s requirements.
IV 

A

We are not persuaded by the State or the dissent that
the approach we take here contradicts our precedents.
The State invokes several pre-AEDPA cases denying
review of claims in second or successive applications
where the petitioners did not avail themselves of prior
opportunities to present the claims. See Wong Doo v.
United States, 265 U. S. 239 (1924); Antone v. Dugger, 465
U. S. 200 (1984) (per curiam); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464
U. S. 377 (1984) (per curiam); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320
(1990) (per curiam); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467
(1991). These cases, the State contends, show that Mag
wood’s fair-warning claim should be dismissed as second
or successive because he could have raised—but did not
raise—the claim in his first application.
But none of these pre-AEDPA decisions applies the
phrase “second or successive” to an application challenging
a new judgment. Therefore, the decisions cast no light on
the question before the Court today: whether abuse-of-the
writ rules, as modified by AEDPA under §2244(b)(2), apply
at all to an application challenging a new judgment. The
State’s misplaced reliance on those cases stems from its
failure to distinguish between §2244(b)’s threshold inquiry
into whether an application is “second or successive,” and
its subsequent inquiry into whether claims in a successive
application must be dismissed.
