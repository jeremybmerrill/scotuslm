Opinion of the Court

honor the federal court’s mandate.” Brief for Respondents
42. We see no need to engage in such novel and complex
rationalizations.
AEDPA’s text commands a more
straightforward rule: where, unlike in Burton, there is a
“new judgment intervening between the two habeas peti
tions,” 549 U. S., at 156, an application challenging the
resulting new judgment is not “second or successive” at all.
V
The State objects that our reading of §2244(b) would
allow a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his
sentence to file a subsequent application challenging not
only his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,
undisturbed conviction. The State believes this result
follows because a sentence and conviction form a single
“judgment” for purposes of habeas review. This case gives
us no occasion to address that question, because Magwood
has not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction.16
We base our conclusion on the text, and that text is not
altered by consequences the State speculates will follow in
another case.17

For these reasons, we conclude that Magwood’s first
application challenging his new sentence under the 1986
judgment is not “second or successive” under §2244(b).

16 Several

Courts of Appeals have held that a petitioner who succeeds
on a first habeas application and is resentenced may challenge only the
“portion of a judgment that arose as a result of a previous successful
action.” Lang v. United States, 474 F. 3d 348, 351 (CA6 2007) (citing
decisions); see also Walker, 133 F. 3d, at 455; United States v. Esposito,
135 F. 3d 111, 113–114 (CA2 1997).
17 In any case, we cannot agree with the dissent that our reading of
§2244(b) gives a windfall to “a defendant who succeeds on even the
most minor and discrete issue.” Post, at 12. AEDPA permits relief
“only on the ground that [the petitioner] is in custody in violation of the
Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” §2254(a).
