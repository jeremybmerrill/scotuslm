MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
Opinion of the Court

warning claim challenged the trial court’s reliance on the
same (allegedly improper) aggravating factor that the trial
court had relied upon for Magwood’s original sentence, his
claim was governed by §2244(b)’s restrictions on “second
or successive” habeas applications. Id., at 975–976. The
Court of Appeals then dismissed the claim because Mag
wood did not argue that it was reviewable under one of the
exceptions to §2244(b)’s general rule requiring dismissal of
claims first presented in a successive application.7 See id.,
at 976.
We granted certiorari to determine whether Magwood’s
application challenging his 1986 death sentence, imposed
as part of resentencing in response to a conditional writ
from the District Court, is subject to the constraints that
§2244(b) imposes on the review of “second or successive”
habeas applications. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).

Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) pro
vides in relevant part:

beas corpus application under section 2254 that was
not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed
unless—

court treated Magwood’s ineffective-assistance claim as new
and free of the restrictions of §2244(b)(2), but reversed on the merits:
“While there was a possible objection, Alabama’s highest court had said
in Kyzer that a §13–11–2 aggravating factor could be used as an aggra
vating circumstance. We are not prepared to require counsel to raise
an argument that has already been decided adversely to his client’s
position by a state’s highest court in order to avoid being found ineffec
tive.” 555 F. 3d, at 977–978.
