BILLY JOE MAGWOOD, PETITIONER v. TONY

PATTERSON, WARDEN, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
The Court today decides that a state prisoner who suc
ceeds in his first federal habeas petition on a discrete
sentencing claim may later file a second petition raising
numerous previously unraised claims, even if that petition
is an abuse of the writ of habeas corpus. The Court, in my
respectful submission, reaches this conclusion by misread
ing precedents on the meaning of the phrase “second or
successive” in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The Court then rewrites
AEDPA’s text but refuses to grapple with the logical con
sequences of its own editorial judgment. A straightfor
ward application of the principles articulated in Panetti v.
Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930 (2007), consistent with the
conclusions of all of the Courts of Appeals that have con
sidered this issue, dictates the opposite result. The design
and purpose of AEDPA is to avoid abuses of the writ of
habeas corpus, in recognition of the potential for the writ’s
intrusive effect on state criminal justice systems. But
today’s opinion, with considerable irony, is not only a step
back from AEDPA protection for States but also a step
back even from abuse-of-the-writ principles that were in
place before AEDPA. So this respectful dissent becomes
necessary.
