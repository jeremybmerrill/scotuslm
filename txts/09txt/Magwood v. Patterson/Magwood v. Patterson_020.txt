Nor do our post-AEDPA cases contradict our approach.
Only one, Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147 (2007) (per
curiam), comes close to addressing the threshold question
whether an application is “second or successive” if it chal
lenges a new judgment. And that case confirms that the
existence of a new judgment is dispositive. In Burton, the
petitioner had been convicted and sentenced in state court
in 1994. See id., at 149. He successfully moved for resen
tencing based on vacatur of an unrelated prior conviction.
Id., at 150. The state appellate court affirmed the convic

state review of his new sentence still pending, the peti

viction. The District Court denied it on the merits, the
Court of Appeals affirmed, and we denied certiorari. Ibid.
In 2002, after exhausting his state sentencing appeal,
the petitioner filed a §2254 petition challenging only his
1998 sentence. The District Court denied relief on the

petitions challenging the denial of good-time credits or parole). We
address only an application challenging a new state-court judgment for
the first time. We do not purport to constrain the scope of §2254 as we
have previously defined it.
