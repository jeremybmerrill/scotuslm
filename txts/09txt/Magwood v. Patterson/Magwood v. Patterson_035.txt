KENNEDY, J., dissenting

§2254(a).
But this provision does not purport to create any prerequi
sites to §2244(b)’s bar against “second or successive” appli
cations. The accepted reading of the quoted language is
that this is a mere “status requirement.” See 1 R. Hertz &
J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Proce
dure §8.1, p. 391 (5th ed. 2005). The provision stands for
the simple proposition that a petitioner must be held
“pursuant to the judgment of a State court” to be able to
file any §2254(b) petition in the first place. That reading
also explains why federal habeas petitions can attack not
only the judgment pursuant to which the petitioner is
being held but also “the duration of sentence . . . and . . .
the conditions under which that sentence is being served,”
including rules such as “the basis of parole” and “good
time” credits. Id., §9.1, at 475–481.
The Court’s reading of the phrase “pursuant to the
judgment of a State court” as a limitation on §2244(b)(2)’s
“second or successive” application bar is artificial. The
Court would amend §2244(b)(2) to read: “A claim pre
sented in a second or successive habeas corpus application
under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior
application [against the same judgment] shall be dis
missed.” This is not what §2244(b)(2) says.
The Court wholly glosses over another significant prob
lem with its atextual analysis. The Court relies upon the
notion that “[a]n error made a second time is still a new
error.” Ante, at 18. But in making this statement, the
Court can mean one of two very different things:
First, it could mean that any error logically encom
passed in a reentered judgment is a “new” error. A crimi
nal “judgment” generally includes both the conviction and
the sentence. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(k)(1) (a
criminal judgment “must set forth the plea, the jury ver
dict or the court’s findings, the adjudication, and the
