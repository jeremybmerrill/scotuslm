MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
Opinion of the Court

U. S. 4, 9 (2000)). According to the State, the phrase
should be read to reflect a principle that “a prisoner is
entitled to one, but only one, full and fair opportunity to
wage a collateral attack.” See Brief for Respondents
25–26 (citing Beyer v. Litscher, 306 F. 3d 504, 508 (CA7
2002); internal quotation marks omitted). The State
asserts that under this “one opportunity” rule, Magwood’s
fair-warning claim was successive because he had an
opportunity to raise it in his first application, but did not
do so. See Brief for Respondents 25–26.
Magwood, in contrast, reads §2244(b) to apply only to a
“second or successive” application challenging the same
state-court judgment. According to Magwood, his 1986
resentencing led to a new judgment, and his first applica
tion challenging that new judgment cannot be “second or
successive” such that §2244(b) would apply. We agree.
We begin with the text. Although Congress did not
define the phrase “second or successive,” as used to modify
“habeas corpus application under section 2254,”
§§2244(b)(1)–(2), it is well settled that the phrase does not
simply “refe[r] to all §2254 applications filed second or
successively in time,” Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.
930, 944 (2007); see id., at 947 (creating an “exceptio[n]” to
§2244(b) for a second application raising a claim that
would have been unripe had the petitioner presented it in
his first application); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523
U. S. 637, 643 (1998) (treating a second application as part
of a first application where it was premised on a newly
ripened claim that had been dismissed from the first
application “as premature”); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S.
473, 478, 487 (2000) (declining to apply §2244(b) to a
second application where the District Court dismissed the
first application for lack of exhaustion).8

suggest the definition of second or successive would be different under
