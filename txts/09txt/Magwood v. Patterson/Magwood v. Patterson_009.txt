MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
Opinion of the Court

State, 501 So. 2d 542 (Ala. Crim. App. 1986)).6 The Ala
bama Supreme Court denied certiorari, see 689 So. 2d, at
959, as did this Court, see Magwood v. Alabama, 522 U. S.
836 (1997).
In April 1997, Magwood sought leave to file a second or
successive application for a writ of habeas corpus challeng
ing his 1981 judgment of conviction. See §2244(b)(3)(A)
(requiring authorization from the Court of Appeals to file a
second or successive application). The Court of Appeals
denied his request. See In re Magwood, 113 F. 3d 1544
(CA11 1997). He simultaneously filed a petition for a writ
of habeas corpus challenging his new death sentence,
which the District Court conditionally granted. See Mag
wood v. Culliver, 481 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1295 (MD Ala.
2007). In that petition, Magwood again argued that his
sentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair
warning at the time of his offense that his conduct would
be sufficient to warrant a death sentence under Alabama
law, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance
during the resentencing proceeding.
Before addressing the merits of Magwood’s fair-warning
claim, the District Court sua sponte considered whether
the application was barred as a “successive petition” under
§2244, and concluded that it was not. Id., at 1283–1284
(“[H]abeas petitions challenging the constitutionality of a
resentencing proceeding are not successive to petitions
that challenge the underlying conviction and original
sentence” (citing 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas
Corpus Practice & Procedure §28.3b(i), p. 1412 (5th ed.
2005) (“When a petitioner files a second or subsequent

Jackson v. State, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals held
that Kyzer supported a death sentence for a defendant who was con
victed for an offense committed before Kyzer was decided but was
resentenced after that decision. 501 So. 2d 542, 544 (1986).
