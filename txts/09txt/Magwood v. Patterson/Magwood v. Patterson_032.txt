MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

See, e.g., Pratt v. United States, 129 F. 3d 54, 62–63 (CA1
1997); Galtieri v. United States, 128 F. 3d 33, 37–38 (CA2
1997); United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, 211 F. 3d 862, 871
(CA5 2000); Lang v. United States, 474 F. 3d 348, 351−353
(CA6 2007). While most of these cases arose in the context
of federal prisoners’ challenges to their convictions or
sentences under 28 U. S. C. §2255, the “second or succes
sive” bar under §2244(b) applies to §2255 motions. See
§2255(h) (2006 ed., Supp. II).
In the present case the Court should conclude that
Magwood has filed a “second or successive habeas corpus
application.” In 1983, he filed a first federal habeas peti
tion raising nine claims, including that the trial court
improperly failed to consider two mitigating factors when
it imposed Magwood’s death sentence. The District Court
granted Magwood’s petition and ordered relief only on the
mitigating factor claim. The state trial court then held a
new sentencing proceeding, in which it considered all of
the mitigating factors and reimposed the death penalty.
In 1997, Magwood brought a second habeas petition, this
time raising an argument that could have been, but was
not, raised in his first petition. The argument was that he
was not eligible for the death penalty because he did not
have fair notice that his crime rendered him death eligi
ble. There is no reason that Magwood could not have
raised the identical argument in his first habeas petition.
Because Magwood had a full and fair opportunity to adju
dicate his death-eligibility claim in his first petition in
1983, his 1997 petition raising this claim is barred as
“second or successive.”

The Court reaches the opposite result by creating an ill
defined exception to the “second or successive” application
bar. The Court, in my respectful view, makes two critical
errors. First, it errs in rejecting Panetti’s claim-based
