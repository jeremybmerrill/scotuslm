MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
Opinion of the Court

The Court of Appeals erred by reading §2244(b) to bar
review of the fair-warning claim Magwood presented in
that application. We do not address whether the fair
warning claim is procedurally defaulted. Nor do we ad
dress Magwood’s contention that the Court of Appeals
erred in rejecting his ineffective-assistance claim by not
addressing whether his attorney should have objected
under federal law.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
