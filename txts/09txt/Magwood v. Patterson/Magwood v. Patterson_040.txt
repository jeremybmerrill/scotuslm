MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

cannot use the accident of a remand to raise in a second
appeal an issue that he could just as well have raised in
the first appeal because the remand did not affect it”).
The Court’s approach also turns AEDPA’s bar against
“second or successive” applications into a one-way ratchet
that favors habeas petitioners. Unless today’s decision is
read to unduly limit Panetti, see supra, at 7–8, AEDPA
still incorporates recognized exceptions to the abuse-of
the-writ doctrine to allow petitioners to bring their previ
ously unavailable and unripe claims, see ante, at 1
(BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg
ment). But after today’s holding, AEDPA now “modi
fie[s],” ante, at 15, abuse-of-the-writ principles and allows
petitioners to bring abusive claims so long as they have
won any victory pursuant to a prior federal habeas peti
tion. The Court thus reads AEDPA as creating a new
loophole that habeas petitioners can exploit to challenge
their sentences based on grounds they previously ne
glected to raise. This is inconsistent with the understand
ing that AEDPA adds “new restrictions on successive
petitions” and “further restricts the availability of relief to
habeas petitioners.” Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664
(1996).

Had Magwood been unsuccessful in his first petition, all
agree that claims then available, but not raised, would be
barred. But because he prevailed in his attack on one part
of his sentencing proceeding the first time around, the
Court rules that he is free, postsentencing, to pursue
claims on federal habeas review that might have been
raised earlier. The Court is mistaken in concluding that
Congress, in enacting a statute aimed at placing new
restrictions on successive petitions, would have intended
this irrational result.
Magwood had every chance to raise his death-eligibility
