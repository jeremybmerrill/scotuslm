Opinion of the Court

penalty of death, stating on the record that the new
“judgment and sentence [were] the result of a complete
and new assessment of all of the evidence, arguments of
counsel, and law.” Sentencing Tr., R. Tab 1, p. R–25. The
Alabama courts affirmed, see Magwood v. State, 548
So. 2d 512, 516 (Ala. Crim. App. 1988); Ex parte Magwood,
548 So. 2d 516, 516 (Ala. 1988), and this Court denied
certiorari, see Magwood v. Alabama, 493 U. S. 923 (1989).
Magwood filed a petition for relief under Alabama’s
former Temporary Rule of Criminal Procedure 20 (1987)
(now Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32) (Rule 20 petition) claiming,
inter alia, that his death sentence exceeded the maximum
sentence authorized by statute; that his death sentence
violated the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments
because it rested upon an unforeseeable interpretation of
the capital sentencing statute; and that his attorney ren
dered ineffective assistance of counsel during resentenc
ing. The trial court denied relief. It held that the statu
tory basis for Magwood’s death sentence had been
affirmed on direct appeal and could not be relitigated. The
trial court also held that Magwood’s attorney played no
substantive role in the resentencing and had no obligation
to dispute the aggravation, given that the District Court
had required only that the trial court consider additional
mitigating factors.
Magwood appealed the denial of his Rule 20 petition,
arguing, inter alia, that his sentence was unconstitutional
because he did not have fair warning that his offense could
be punished by death, and that he received constitution
ally ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing. See
Record in Appeal No. 92–843 (Ala. Crim. App.), Tab 25,
pp. 23–24, 53–61.
The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, citing
its decision on direct appeal as to the propriety of the
death sentence. See Magwood v. State, 689 So. 2d 959,
965 (1996) (citing Kyzer, 399 So. 2d 330, and Jackson v.
