MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON
Opinion of the Court

error. Under the State’s “one opportunity” rule, the
phrase “second or successive” would apply to any claim
that the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise
in a prior application. And the phrase “second or succes
sive” would not apply to a claim that the petitioner did not
have a full and fair opportunity to raise previously.
This reading of §2244(b) would considerably under
mine—if not render superfluous—the exceptions to dis
missal set forth in §2244(b)(2). That section describes
circumstances when a claim not presented earlier may be
considered: intervening and retroactive case law, or newly
discovered facts suggesting “that . . . no reasonable fact
finder would have found the applicant guilty of the under
lying offense.” §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). In either circumstance,
a petitioner cannot be said to have had a prior opportunity
to raise the claim, so under the State’s rule the claim
would not be successive and §2244(b)(2) would not apply to
it at all. This would be true even if the claim were raised
in a second application challenging the same judgment.11
In addition to duplicating the exceptions under §2244(b)
in some circumstances, the State’s rule would dilute them
in others. Whereas the exception to dismissal of fact
based claims not presented in a prior application applies
only if the facts provide clear and convincing evidence

11 This case does not require us to determine whether §2244(b) ap
plies to every application filed by a prisoner in custody pursuant to a
state-court judgment if the prisoner challenged the same state-court
judgment once before. Three times we have held otherwise. See Slack
v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 475, 487 (2000); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal,
523 U. S. 637, 643 (1998); Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 945
(2007).
The dissent’s claim that our reading of §2244(b) calls one of those
decisions, Panetti, into doubt, see post, at 7–8, is unfounded. The
question in this case is whether a first application challenging a new
sentence in an intervening judgment is second or successive. It is not
whether an application challenging the same state-court judgment
must always be second or successive.
