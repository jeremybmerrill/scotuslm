Opinion of the Court

In accordance with Alabama law, the trial court reviewed
the basis for the jury’s decision. See §§13–11–3, 13–11–4.
Although the court did not find the existence of any statu
tory “aggravating circumstance” under §13–11–6, the
court relied on Ex parte Kyzer, 399 So. 2d 330 (Ala. 1981),
to find that murder of a sheriff while “on duty or because
of some official or job-related acts,” §13–11–2(a)(5), is a
capital felony that, by definition, involves aggravation
sufficient for a death sentence.3 The trial court found that
Magwood’s young age (27 at the time of the offense) and
lack of significant criminal history qualified as mitigating
factors, but found no mitigation related to Magwood’s
mental state. Weighing the aggravation against the two
mitigating factors, the court approved the sentence of
death. The Alabama courts affirmed. See Magwood v.
State, 426 So. 2d 918, 929 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982); Ex parte
Magwood, 426 So. 2d 929, 932 (Ala. 1983). We denied
certiorari. Magwood v. Alabama, 462 U. S. 1124 (1983).

3 As relevant here, Kyzer did away with the prior Alabama rule that
an aggravating component of a capital felony could not double as an
aggravating factor supporting a capital sentence. In Kyzer, the defen
dant had been sentenced to death for the intentional murder of “two or
more human beings” under §13–11–2(a)(10). See 399 So. 2d, at 332.
The crime of murder, so defined, was aggravated by its serial nature,
just as Magwood’s crime of murder, as defined under §13–11–2(a)(5),
was aggravated by the fact that he killed an on-duty sheriff because of
the sheriff’s job-related acts. In Kyzer, the Alabama Supreme Court
ultimately remanded for a new trial, but in order to guide the lower
court on remand, addressed whether the aggravation in the charged
crime, see §13–11–2(a)(10), was sufficient to impose a sentence of death
even without a finding of any “aggravating circumstance” enumerated
in §13–11–6. See id., at 337. The court ruled that if the defendant was
convicted under §13–11–2(a)(10), “the jury and the trial judge at the
sentencing hearing [may] find the aggravation averred in the indict
ment as the aggravating circumstance, even though the aggravation is
not listed in §13–11–6 as an aggravating circumstance.” Id., at 339
