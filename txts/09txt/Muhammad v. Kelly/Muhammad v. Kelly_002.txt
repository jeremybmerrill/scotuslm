MUHAMMAD v. KELLY
Statement of STEVENS, J.

dant’s first application for a federal writ of habeas corpus.
See, e.g., Emmett v. Kelly, 552 U. S. 942 (2007) (STEVENS,
J., joined by GINSBURG, J., respecting denial of certiorari);
Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 379 (1998) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting). Such a practice would give meaningful effect
to the distinction Congress has drawn between first and
successive habeas petitions. See 28 U. S. C. §2244(b). It
would also serve the interests of avoiding irreversible
error, facilitating the efficient management of our docket,
and preserving basic fairness by ensuring death row in
mates receive the same procedural safeguards that ordi
nary inmates receive.
Having reviewed petitioner’s claims, I do not dissent
from the Court’s decision to deny certiorari. “I do, how
ever, remain firmly convinced that no State should be
allowed to foreshorten this Court’s orderly review of . . .
first-time habeas petition[s] by executing prisoners before
that review can be completed.” Emmett, 552 U. S., at 943.
