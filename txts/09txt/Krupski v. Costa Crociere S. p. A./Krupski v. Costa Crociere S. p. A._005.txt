WANDA KRUPSKI, PETITIONER v. COSTA 

CROCIERE S. P. A. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 7, 2010]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gov
erns when an amended pleading “relates back” to the date
of a timely filed original pleading and is thus itself timely
even though it was filed outside an applicable statute of
limitations. Where an amended pleading changes a party
or a party’s name, the Rule requires, among other things,
that “the party to be brought in by amendment . . . knew
or should have known that the action would have been
brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper
party’s identity.” Rule 15(c)(1)(C). In this case, the Court
of Appeals held that Rule 15(c) was not satisfied because
the plaintiff knew or should have known of the proper
defendant before filing her original complaint. The court
also held that relation back was not appropriate because
the plaintiff had unduly delayed in seeking to amend. We
hold that relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on
what the party to be added knew or should have known,
not on the amending party’s knowledge or its timeliness in
seeking to amend the pleading. Accordingly, we reverse
the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
