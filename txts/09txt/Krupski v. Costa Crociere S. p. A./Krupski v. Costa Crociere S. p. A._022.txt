KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.
Opinion of the Court

to be named in the action”).
In light of these facts, Costa Crociere should have
known that Krupski’s failure to name it as a defendant in
her original complaint was due to a mistake concerning
the proper party’s identity. We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
and remand the case for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
