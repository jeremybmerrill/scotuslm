WANDA KRUPSKI, PETITIONER v. COSTA 

CROCIERE S. P. A. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 7, 2010]


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I join the Court’s opinion except for its reliance, ante, at
10–11, 15, n. 5, on the Notes of the Advisory Committee as
establishing the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Proce
dure 15(c)(1)(C). The Advisory Committee’s insights into
the proper interpretation of a Rule’s text are useful to the
same extent as any scholarly commentary. But the Com
mittee’s intentions have no effect on the Rule’s meaning.
Even assuming that we and the Congress that allowed the
Rule to take effect read and agreed with those intentions,
it is the text of the Rule that controls. Tome v. United
States, 513 U. S. 150, 167–168 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concur
ring in part and concurring in judgment).
