Opinion of the Court

dence countered any implication that Adams had origi
nally failed to name Nelson because of any “mistake con
cerning the proper party’s identity,” and instead suggested
that Adams decided to name Nelson only after the fact in
an attempt to ensure that the fee award would be paid.
The footnote merely observes that Adams had originally
been under no misimpression about the function Nelson
played in the underlying dispute. We said, after all, that
Adams knew of Nelson’s “role” as well as his existence.
Id., at 467, n. 1. Read in context, the footnote in Nelson is
entirely consistent with our understanding of the Rule:
When the original complaint and the plaintiff’s conduct
compel the conclusion that the failure to name the pro
spective defendant in the original complaint was the result
of a fully informed decision as opposed to a mistake con
cerning the proper defendant’s identity, the requirements
of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are not met. This conclusion is in
keeping with our rejection today of the Court of Appeals’
reliance on the plaintiff’s knowledge to deny relation back.
B
The Court of Appeals offered a second reason why Krup
ski’s amended complaint did not relate back: Krupski had
unduly delayed in seeking to file, and in eventually filing,
an amended complaint. 330 Fed. Appx., at 895. The
Court of Appeals offered no support for its view that a
plaintiff’s dilatory conduct can justify the denial of relation
back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C), and we find none. The Rule
plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for
relation back, and the amending party’s diligence is not
among them. Moreover, the Rule mandates relation back
once the Rule’s requirements are satisfied; it does not
leave the decision whether to grant relation back to the
district court’s equitable discretion. See Rule 15(c)(1) (“An
amendment . . . relates back . . . when” the three listed
requirements are met (emphasis added)).
