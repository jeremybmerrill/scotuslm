KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.
Opinion of the Court

serting that it was not the proper defendant, as it was
merely the North American sales and marketing agent for
Costa Crociere, which was the actual carrier and vessel
operator. Id., at 31. Second, on March 20, 2008, Costa
Cruise listed Costa Crociere as an interested party in its
corporate disclosure statement. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.
Finally, on May 6, 2008, Costa Cruise moved for summary
judgment, again stating that Costa Crociere was the
proper defendant. App. 5, 33–38.
On June 13, 2008, Krupski responded to Costa Cruise’s
motion for summary judgment, arguing for limited discov
ery to determine whether Costa Cruise should be dis
missed. According to Krupski, the following sources of
information led her to believe Costa Cruise was the re
sponsible party: The travel documents prominently identi
fied Costa Cruise and gave its Florida address; Costa
Cruise’s Web site listed Costa Cruise in Florida as the
United States office for the Italian company Costa Croci
ere; and the Web site of the Florida Department of State
listed Costa Cruise as the only “Costa” company registered
to do business in that State. Id., at 43–45, 56–59. Krup
ski also observed that Costa Cruise’s claims administrator
had responded to her claims notification without indicat
ing that Costa Cruise was not a responsible party. Id., at
45. With her response, Krupski simultaneously moved to
amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defen
dant. Id., at 41–42, 52–54.
On July 2, 2008, after oral argument, the District Court
denied Costa Cruise’s motion for summary judgment
without prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend,
ordering that Krupski effect proper service on Costa Cro
ciere by September 16, 2008. Id., at 71–72. Complying
with the court’s deadline, Krupski filed an amended com
plaint on July 11, 2008, and served Costa Crociere on
August 21, 2008. Id., at 73, 88–89. On that same date,
the District Court issued an order dismissing Costa Cruise
