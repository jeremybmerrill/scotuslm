Opinion of the Court

observed that Krupski waited 133 days from the time she
filed her original complaint to seek leave to amend and did
not file an amended complaint for another month after
that. In light of this delay, the Court of Appeals concluded
that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in
denying relation back.
We granted certiorari to resolve tension among the
Circuits over the breadth of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii),2 558 U. S.
___ (2010), and we now reverse.
II
Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, an amend
ment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original
pleading when:
“(A) the law that provides the applicable statute of
limitations allows relation back;
“(B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that
arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set
out—or attempted to be set out—in the original plead

2 See, e.g., Krupski v. Costa Cruise Lines, N. V., LLC, 330 Fed. Appx.
892, 895 (CA11 2009) (per curiam) (case below); Rendall-Speranza v.
Nassim, 107 F. 3d 913, 918 (CADC 1997) (provision does not authorize
relation back where plaintiff “was fully aware of the potential defen
dant’s identity but not of its responsibility for the harm alleged”);
Cornwell v. Robinson, 23 F. 3d 694, 705 (CA2 1994) (no relation back
where plaintiff knew the identities of the responsible defendants and
failed to name them); Goodman v. Praxair, Inc., 494 F. 3d 458, 469–470
(CA4 2007) (en banc) (rejecting argument that plaintiff’s knowledge of
proper corporate defendant’s existence and name meant that no mis
take had been made); Arthur v. Maersk, Inc., 434 F. 3d 196, 208 (CA3
2006) (“A ‘mistake’ is no less a ‘mistake’ when it flows from lack of
knowledge as opposed to inaccurate description”); Leonard v. Parry, 219
F. 3d 25, 28–29 (CA1 2000) (plaintiff’s knowledge of proper defendant’s
identity was not relevant to whether she made a “ ‘mistake concerning
the identity of the proper party’ ”). We express no view on whether
these decisions may be reconciled with each other in light of their
specific facts and the interpretation of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) we adopt
today.
