KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A. 

Opinion of the Court 


I

On February 21, 2007, petitioner, Wanda Krupski,
tripped over a cable and fractured her femur while she
was on board the cruise ship Costa Magica. Upon her
return home, she acquired counsel and began the process

District of Florida in Broward County, Florida, as the
