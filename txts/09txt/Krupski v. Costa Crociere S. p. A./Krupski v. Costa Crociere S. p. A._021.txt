Opinion of the Court

Crociere are related corporate entities with very similar
names; “crociera” even means “cruise” in Italian. Cassell’s
Italian Dictionary 137, 670 (1967). This interrelationship
and similarity heighten the expectation that Costa Croci
ere should suspect a mistake has been made when Costa
Cruise is named in a complaint that actually describes
Costa Crociere’s activities. Cf. Morel v. DaimlerChrysler
AG, 565 F. 3d 20, 27 (CA1 2009) (where complaint con
veyed plaintiffs’ attempt to sue automobile manufacturer
and erroneously named the manufacturer as DaimlerChrysler Corporation instead of the actual manufacturer,
a legally distinct but related entity named DaimlerChrys
ler AG, the latter should have realized it had not been
named because of plaintiffs’ mistake); Goodman v. Prax
air, Inc., 494 F. 3d 458, 473–475 (CA4 2007) (en banc)
(where complaint named parent company Praxair, Inc.,
but described status of subsidiary company Praxair Ser
vices, Inc., subsidiary company knew or should have
known it had not been named because of plaintiff’s mis
take). In addition, Costa Crociere’s own actions contrib
uted to passenger confusion over “the proper party” for a
lawsuit. The front of the ticket advertises that “Costa
Cruises” has achieved a certification of quality, App. to
Pet. for Cert. 25a, without clarifying whether “Costa
Cruises” is Costa Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, or some
other related “Costa” company. Indeed, Costa Crociere is
evidently aware that the difference between Costa Cruise
and Costa Crociere can be confusing for cruise ship pas
sengers. See, e.g., Suppa v. Costa Crociere, S. p. A., No.
07–60526–CIV, 2007 WL 4287508, *1, (SD Fla., Dec. 4,
2007) (denying Costa Crociere’s motion to dismiss the
amended complaint where the original complaint had
named Costa Cruise as a defendant after “find[ing] it
simply inconceivable that Defendant Costa Crociere was
not on notice . . . that . . . but for the mistake in the origi
nal Complaint, Costa Crociere was the appropriate party
