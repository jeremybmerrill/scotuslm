KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.
Opinion of the Court

tained an award of attorney’s fees against the corporation
of which Donald Nelson was the president and sole share
holder. After Adams became concerned that the corpora
tion did not have sufficient funds to pay the award, Adams
sought to amend its pleading to add Nelson as a party and
simultaneously moved to amend the judgment to hold
Nelson responsible. The District Court granted both
motions, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reversed,
holding that the requirements of due process, as codified
in Rules 12 and 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
demand that an added party have the opportunity to
respond before judgment is entered against him. Id., at
465–467. In a footnote explaining that relation back does
not deny the added party an opportunity to respond to the
amended pleading, we noted that the case did not arise
under the “mistake clause” of Rule 15(c):4 “Respondent
Adams made no such mistake. It knew of Nelson’s role
and existence and, until it moved to amend its pleading,
chose to assert its claim for costs and fees only against
[Nelson’s company].” Id., at 467, n. 1.
Contrary to respondent’s claim, Nelson does not suggest
that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) cannot be satisfied if a plaintiff
knew of the prospective defendant’s existence at the time
she filed her original complaint. In that case, there was
nothing in the initial pleading suggesting that Nelson was
an intended party, while there was evidence in the record
(of which Nelson was aware) that Adams sought to add
him only after learning that the company would not be
able to satisfy the judgment. Id., at 463–464. This evi

4 The “mistake clause” at the time we decided Nelson was set forth in
Rule 15(c)(3). 529 U. S., at 467, n. 1; 528 F. R. D. 525, 529 (1991). Rule
15(c) was renumbered in 2007 without substantive change “as part of
the general restyling of the Civil Rules,” at which time it received its
current placement in Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). Advisory Committee’s 2007
