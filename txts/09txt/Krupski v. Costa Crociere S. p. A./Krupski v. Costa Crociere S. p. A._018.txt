KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.
Opinion of the Court

The mandatory nature of the inquiry for relation back
under Rule 15(c) is particularly striking in contrast to the
inquiry under Rule 15(a), which sets forth the circum
stances in which a party may amend its pleading before
trial. By its terms, Rule 15(a) gives discretion to the
district court in deciding whether to grant a motion to
amend a pleading to add a party or a claim. Following an
initial period after filing a pleading during which a party
may amend once “as a matter of course,” “a party may
amend its pleading only with the opposing party’s written
consent or the court’s leave,” which the court “should
freely give . . . when justice so requires.” Rules 15(a)(1)–
(2). We have previously explained that a court may con
sider a movant’s “undue delay” or “dilatory motive” in
deciding whether to grant leave to amend under Rule
15(a). Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182 (1962). As the
contrast between Rule 15(a) and Rule 15(c) makes clear,
however, the speed with which a plaintiff moves to amend
her complaint or files an amended complaint after obtain
ing leave to do so has no bearing on whether the amended
complaint relates back. Cf. 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.
Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §1498, pp. 142–143,
and nn. 49–50 (2d ed. 1990 and Supp. 2010).
Rule 15(c)(1)(C) does permit a court to examine a plain
tiff’s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but not in the
way or for the purpose respondent or the Court of Appeals
suggests. As we have explained, the question under Rule
15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is what the prospective defendant reasona
bly should have understood about the plaintiff’s intent in
filing the original complaint against the first defendant.
To the extent the plaintiff’s postfiling conduct informs the
prospective defendant’s understanding of whether the
plaintiff initially made a “mistake concerning the proper
party’s identity,” a court may consider the conduct. Cf.
Leonard v. Parry, 219 F. 3d 25, 29 (CA1 2000) (“[P]ost
