JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.
Opinion of the Court

identified the wrong trust-law standard. Instead of the
standard that applies when a trustee and a settlor negoti
ate the trustee’s fee at the time of the creation of a trust,
petitioners invoke the standard that applies when a trus
tee seeks compensation after the trust is created. Brief for
Petitioners 20–23, 35–37. A compensation agreement
reached at that time, they point out, “ ‘will not bind the
beneficiary’ if either ‘the trustee failed to make a full
disclosure of all circumstances affecting the agreement’ ”
which he knew or should have known or if the agreement
is unfair to the beneficiary. Id., at 23 (quoting Restate
ment (Second) of Trusts §242, Comment i). Respondent,
on the other hand, contends that the term “fiduciary” is
not exclusive to the law of trusts, that the phrase means
different things in different contexts, and that there is no
reason to believe that §36(b) incorporates the specific
meaning of the term in the law of trusts. Brief for Re
spondent 34–36.
We find it unnecessary to take sides in this dispute. In
Pepper v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295 (1939), we discussed the
meaning of the concept of fiduciary duty in a context that
is analogous to that presented here, and we also looked to
trust law. At issue in Pepper was whether a bankruptcy
court could disallow a dominant or controlling share
holder’s claim for compensation against a bankrupt corpo
ration. Dominant or controlling shareholders, we held, are
“fiduciar[ies]” whose “powers are powers [held] in trust.”
Id., at 306. We then explained:
“Their dealings with the corporation are subjected to
rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or
engagements with the corporation is challenged the
burden is on the director or stockholder not only to
prove the good faith of the transaction but also to
show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the
corporation and those interested therein. . . . The es
