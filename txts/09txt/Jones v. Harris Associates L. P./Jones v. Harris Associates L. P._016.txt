Opinion of the Court

the [investment adviser’s] service and fee, and the extent
of care and conscientiousness with which they perform
their duties are important factors to be considered in
deciding whether they and the [investment adviser] are
guilty of a breach of fiduciary duty in violation of §36(b).”

III
While both parties in this case endorse the basic Gar
tenberg approach, they disagree on several important
questions that warrant discussion.
The first concerns comparisons between the fees that an
adviser charges a captive mutual fund and the fees that it
charges its independent clients. As noted, the Gartenberg
court rejected a comparison between the fees that the
adviser in that case charged a money market fund and the
fees that it charged a pension fund. 694 F. 2d, at 930, n. 3
(noting the “[t]he nature and extent of the services re
quired by each type of fund differ sharply”). Petitioners
contend that such a comparison is appropriate, Brief for
Petitioners 30–31, but respondent disagrees. Brief for
Respondent 38–44. Since the Act requires consideration of
all relevant factors, 15 U. S. C. §80a–35(b)(2); see also
§80a–15(c), we do not think that there can be any cate
gorical rule regarding the comparisons of the fees charged
different types of clients. See Daily Income Fund, supra,
at 537 (discussing concern with investment advisers’
practice of charging higher fees to mutual funds than to
their other clients). Instead, courts may give such com
parisons the weight that they merit in light of the simi
larities and differences between the services that the
clients in question require, but courts must be wary of
inapt comparisons. As the panel below noted, there may
be significant differences between the services provided by
an investment adviser to a mutual fund and those it pro
vides to a pension fund which are attributable to the
