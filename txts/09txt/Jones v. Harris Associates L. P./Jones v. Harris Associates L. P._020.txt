Opinion of the Court

Court is institutionally unsuited to gather the facts upon
which economic predictions can be made, and profession
ally untrained to make them”); Verizon Communications
Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 539 (2002); see also Concord v.
Boston Edison Co., 915 F. 2d 17, 25 (CA1 1990) (opinion
for the court by Breyer, C. J.) (“[H]ow is a judge or jury to
determine a ‘fair price’?”). Gartenberg’s “so disproportion
ately large” standard, 694 F. 2d, at 928, reflects this con
gressional choice to “rely largely upon [independent direc
tor] ‘watchdogs’ to protect shareholders interests.” Burks,
supra, at 485.
By focusing almost entirely on the element of disclosure,
the Seventh Circuit panel erred. See 527 F. 3d, at 632 (An
investment adviser “must make full disclosure and play no
tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation”). The
Gartenberg standard, which the panel rejected, may lack
sharp analytical clarity, but we believe that it accurately
reflects the compromise that is embodied in §36(b), and it
has provided a workable standard for nearly three dec
ades. The debate between the Seventh Circuit panel and
the dissent from the denial of rehearing regarding today’s
mutual fund market is a matter for Congress, not the
courts.
IV
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is vacated, and the case remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
