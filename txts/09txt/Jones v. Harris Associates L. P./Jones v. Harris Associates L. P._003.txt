Syllabus
928, reflects Congress’ choice to “rely largely upon [independent]
‘watchdogs’ to protect shareholders interests,” Lasker, supra, at 482.
Pp. 12–16.
(e) The Seventh Circuit erred in focusing on disclosure by invest
ment advisers rather than the Gartenberg standard, which the panel
rejected. That standard may lack sharp analytical clarity, but it ac
curately reflects the compromise embodied in §36(b) as to the appro
priate method of testing investment adviser compensation, and it has
provided a workable standard for nearly three decades. Pp. 16–17.
527 F. 3d 627, vacated and remanded.
ALITO, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. THOMAS, J.,
filed a concurring opinion.
