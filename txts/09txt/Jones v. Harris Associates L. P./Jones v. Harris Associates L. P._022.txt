JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.
THOMAS, J., concurring

Act, and now the Court’s opinion, requires. See, e.g., ante,
at 11 (underscoring that the Act “modifies” the governing
fiduciary duty standard “in a significant way: It shifts the
burden of proof from the fiduciary to the party claiming
breach, 15 U. S. C. §80a–35(b)(1), to show that the fee is
outside the range that arm’s-length bargaining would
produce”); ante, at 16 (citing the “degree of deference that
is due a board’s decision to approve an adviser’s fees” and
admonishing that “the standard for fiduciary breach under
§36(b) does not call for judicial second-guessing of in
formed board decisions”).
I concur in the Court’s decision to affirm this approach
based upon the Investment Company Act’s text and our
longstanding fiduciary duty precedents. But I would not
say that in doing so we endorse the “Gartenberg standard.”
Whatever else might be said about today’s decision, it does
not countenance the free-ranging judicial “fairness” review
of fees that Gartenberg could be read to authorize, see 694
F. 2d, at 929–930, and that virtually all courts deciding
§36(b) cases since Gartenberg (including the Court of
Appeals in this case) have wisely eschewed in the post
Gartenberg precedents we approve.
