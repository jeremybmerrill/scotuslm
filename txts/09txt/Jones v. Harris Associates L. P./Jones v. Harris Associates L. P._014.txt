Opinion of the Court

sence of the test is whether or not under all the circum
stances the transaction carries the earmarks of an
arm’s length bargain. If it does not, equity will set it
aside.” Id., at 306–307 (emphasis added; footnote
omitted); see also Geddes v. Anaconda Copper Mining
Co., 254 U. S. 590, 599 (1921) (standard of fiduciary
duty for interested directors).
We believe that this formulation expresses the meaning of
the phrase “fiduciary duty” in §36(b), 84 Stat. 1429. The
Investment Company Act modifies this duty in a signifi

Gartenberg’s approach also reflects §36(b)’s place in the
statutory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the
other protections that the Act affords investors.
Under the Act, scrutiny of investment adviser compen
sation by a fully informed mutual fund board is the “cor
nerstone of the . . . effort to control conflicts of interest
within mutual funds.” Burks, 441 U. S., at 482. The Act
interposes disinterested directors as “independent watch
dogs” of the relationship between a mutual fund and its
