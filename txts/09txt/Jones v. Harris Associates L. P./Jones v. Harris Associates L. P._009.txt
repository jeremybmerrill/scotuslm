JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.
Opinion of the Court

mutual fund market. Noting that “[t]oday thousands of
mutual funds compete,” the panel concluded that “sophis
ticated investors” shop for the funds that produce the best
overall results, “mov[e] their money elsewhere” when fees
are “excessive in relation to the results,” and thus “create
a competitive pressure” that generally keeps fees low. Id.,
at 633–634. The panel faulted Gartenberg on the ground
that it “relies too little on markets.” 527 F. 3d, at 632.
And the panel firmly rejected a comparison between the
fees that Harris Associates charged to the funds and the
fees that Harris Associates charged other types of clients,
observing that “[d]ifferent clients call for different com
mitments of time” and that costs, such as research, that
may benefit several categories of clients “make it hard to
draw inferences from fee levels.” Id., at 634.
The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc by an
equally divided vote. 537 F. 3d 728 (2008). The dissent
from the denial of rehearing argued that the panel’s rejec
tion of Gartenberg was based “mainly on an economic
analysis that is ripe for reexamination.” 537 F. 3d, at 730
(opinion of Posner, J.). Among other things, the dissent
expressed concern that Harris Associates charged “its
captive funds more than twice what it charges independ
ent funds,” and the dissent questioned whether high ad
viser fees actually drive investors away. Id., at 731.
We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the
Courts of Appeals over the proper standard under §36(b).2
556 U. S. ___ (2009).
