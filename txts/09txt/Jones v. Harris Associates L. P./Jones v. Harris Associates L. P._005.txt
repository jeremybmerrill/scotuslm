JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.
Opinion of the Court

the fund’s directors, manages the fund’s investments, and
provides other services. See id., at 481. Because of the
relationship between a mutual fund and its investment
adviser, the fund often “ ‘cannot, as a practical matter
sever its relationship with the adviser. Therefore, the
forces of arm’s-length bargaining do not work in the mu
