Opinion of the Court

tiate and scrutinize adviser compensation. Burks, supra,
at 482. The amendments required that no more than 60
percent of a fund’s directors be “persons who are inter
ested persons,” e.g., that they have no interest in or affilia
tion with the investment adviser.1 15 U. S. C. §80a–
10(a); §80a–2(a)(19); see also Daily Income Fund, supra, at
538. These board members are given “a host of special
responsibilities.” Burks, 441 U. S., at 482–483. In par
ticular, they must “review and approve the contracts of the
investment adviser” annually, id., at 483, and a majority
of these directors must approve an adviser’s compensation,
15 U. S. C. §80a–15(c). Second, §36(b), 84 Stat. 1429, of
the Act imposed upon investment advisers a “fiduciary
duty” with respect to compensation received from a mu
tual fund, 15 U. S. C. §80a–35(b), and granted individual
investors a private right of action for breach of that duty,
ibid.
The “fiduciary duty” standard contained in §36(b) repre

“affiliated person” includes (1) a person who owns, controls, or
holds the power to vote 5 percent or more of the securities of the in
vestment adviser; (2) an entity which the investment adviser owns,
controls, or in which it holds the power to vote more than 5 percent of
the securities; (3) any person directly or indirectly controlling, con
trolled by, or under common control with the investment adviser; (4) an
officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of the investment
adviser; (5) an investment adviser or a member of the investment
adviser’s board of directors; or (6) the depositor of an unincorporated
investment adviser. See §80a–2(a)(3). The Act defines “interested
person” to include not only all affiliated persons but also a wider swath
of people such as the immediate family of affiliated persons, interested
persons of an underwriter or investment adviser, legal counsel for the
company, and interested broker-dealers. §80a–2(a)(19).
