JERRY N. JONES, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. HARRIS

tenberg, most courts have correctly declined its invitation
to stray beyond statutory bounds. Instead, they have
followed an approach (principally in deciding which cases
may proceed past summary judgment) that defers to the
informed conclusions of disinterested boards and holds
plaintiffs to their heavy burden of proof in the manner the
