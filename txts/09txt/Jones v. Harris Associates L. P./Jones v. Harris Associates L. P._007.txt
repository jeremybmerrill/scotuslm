JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.
Opinion of the Court

court deemed it ‘unconscionable’ or ‘shocking,’ ” and “secu

damages, an injunction, and rescission of advisory agree
ments between Harris Associates and the mutual funds.
The complaint alleged that Harris Associates had violated
§36(b) by charging fees that were “disproportionate to the
services rendered” and “not within the range of what
