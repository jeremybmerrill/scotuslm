AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL 

FOOTBALL LEAGUE
Opinion of the Court 





power characteristic of independent action. Each of the
teams is a substantial, independently owned, and inde­
pendently managed business. “[T]heir general corporate
actions are guided or determined” by “separate corporate
consciousnesses,” and “[t]heir objectives are” not “com­
mon.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 771; see also North
American Soccer League v. NFL, 670 F. 2d 1249, 1252
(CA2 1982) (discussing ways that “the financial perform­
ance of each team, while related to that of the others, does
not . . . necessarily rise and fall with that of the others”).
The teams compete with one another, not only on the
playing field, but to attract fans, for gate receipts and for
contracts with managerial and playing personnel. See
Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., 518 U. S. 231, 249 (1996);
Sullivan v. NFL, 34 F. 3d 1091, 1098 (CA1 1994); MidSouth Grizzlies v. NFL, 720 F. 2d 772, 787 (CA3 1983); cf.
NCAA, 468 U. S., at 99.
Directly relevant to this case, the teams compete in the
market for intellectual property. To a firm making hats,
the Saints and the Colts are two potentially competing
suppliers of valuable trademarks. When each NFL team
licenses its intellectual property, it is not pursuing the
“common interests of the whole” league but is instead
pursuing interests of each “corporation itself,” Copperweld,
467 U. S., at 770; teams are acting as “separate economic
actors pursuing separate economic interests,” and each
team therefore is a potential “independent cente[r] of
decisionmaking,” id., at 769. Decisions by NFL teams to
license their separately owned trademarks collectively and
to only one vendor are decisions that “depriv[e] the mar­
ketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,” ibid.,
and therefore of actual or potential competition. See
NCAA, 468 U. S., at 109, n. 39 (observing a possible §1
violation if two separately owned companies sold their
separate products through a “single selling agent”); cf.
