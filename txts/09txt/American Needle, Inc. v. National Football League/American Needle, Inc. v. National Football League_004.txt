otherwise, or, conspiracy, in restraint of trade” is made
illegal by §1 of the Sherman Act, ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as

different from and antecedent to the question whether it
unreasonably restrains trade. This case raises that ante­

National Football League (NFL) and a corporate entity
that they formed to manage their intellectual property.
