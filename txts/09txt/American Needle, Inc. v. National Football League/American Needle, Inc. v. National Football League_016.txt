Opinion of the Court

most significant competitive threats arise when joint
venture participants are actual or potential competitors”).
In defense, respondents argue that by forming NFLP,
they have formed a single entity, akin to a merger, and
market their NFL brands through a single outlet. But it is
not dispositive that the teams have organized and own a
legally separate entity that centralizes the management of
their intellectual property. An ongoing §1 violation cannot
evade §1 scrutiny simply by giving the ongoing violation a
name and label. “Perhaps every agreement and combina­
tion in restraint of trade could be so labeled.” Timken

The NFL respondents may be similar in some sense to a
single enterprise that owns several pieces of intellectual
property and licenses them jointly, but they are not simi­
lar in the relevant functional sense. Although NFL teams
have common interests such as promoting the NFL brand,
they are still separate, profit-maximizing entities, and
their interests in licensing team trademarks are not nec­

NFL brand “partially unit[e] the economic interests of the
parent firms,” Broadley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust
Policy, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1521, 1526 (1982) (emphasis
added), but the teams still have distinct, potentially com­
peting interests.
It may be, as respondents argue, that NFLP “has served
as the ‘single driver’’ of the teams’ “promotional vehicle,”
“ ‘pursu[ing] the common interests of the whole.’ ” Brief for
NFL Respondents 28 (quoting Copperweld, 467 U. S., at

are in the common interests of the parties to the restraint,
