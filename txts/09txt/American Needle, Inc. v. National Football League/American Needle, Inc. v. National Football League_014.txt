Opinion of the Court

dressed by Sherman Act §1” is the “elimin[ation of] compe­
tition that would otherwise exist”).
Thus, while the president and a vice president of a firm
could (and regularly do) act in combination, their joint
action generally is not the sort of “combination” that §1 is
intended to cover. Such agreements might be described as
“really unilateral behavior flowing from decisions of a
single enterprise.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 767. Nor, for
this reason, does §1 cover “internally coordinated conduct
of a corporation and one of its unincorporated divisions,”
id., at 770, because “[a] division within a corporate struc­
ture pursues the common interests of the whole,” ibid.,
and therefore “coordination between a corporation and its
division does not represent a sudden joining of two inde­
pendent sources of economic power previously pursuing
separate interests,” id., at 770–771. Nor, for the same
reasons, is “the coordinated activity of a parent and its
wholly owned subsidiary” covered. See id., at 771. They
“have a complete unity of interest” and thus “[w]ith or
without a formal ‘agreement,’ the subsidiary acts for the
benefit of the parent, its sole shareholder.” Ibid.
Because the inquiry is one of competitive reality, it is
not determinative that two parties to an alleged §1 viola­
tion are legally distinct entities. Nor, however, is it de­
terminative that two legally distinct entities have organ­
ized themselves under a single umbrella or into a
structured joint venture. The question is whether the
agreement joins together “independent centers of deci­
sionmaking.” Id., at 769. If it does, the entities are capa­
ble of conspiring under §1, and the court must decide
whether the restraint of trade is an unreasonable and
therefore illegal one.
