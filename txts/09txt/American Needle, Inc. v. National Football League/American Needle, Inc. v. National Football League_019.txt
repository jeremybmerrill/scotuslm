AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL 

FOOTBALL LEAGUE
Opinion of the Court 





decisions relating to purchases of apparel and headwear,
to the sale of such items, and to the granting of licenses to
use its trademarks.
We generally treat agreements within a single firm as
independent action on the presumption that the compo­
nents of the firm will act to maximize the firm’s profits.
But in rare cases, that presumption does not hold. Agree­
ments made within a firm can constitute concerted action
covered by §1 when the parties to the agreement act on
interests separate from those of the firm itself,8 and the
intrafirm agreements may simply be a formalistic shell for
ongoing concerted action. See, e.g., Topco Associates, Inc.,
405 U. S., at 609; Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354.
For that reason, decisions by the NFLP regarding the
teams’ separately owned intellectual property constitute
concerted action. Thirty-two teams operating independ­
ently through the vehicle of the NFLP are not like the
components of a single firm that act to maximize the firm’s
profits. The teams remain separately controlled, potential
competitors with economic interests that are distinct from
NFLP’s financial well-being. See generally Hovenkamp,
1995 Colum. Bus. L. Rev., at 52–61. Unlike typical deci­
sions by corporate shareholders, NFLP licensing decisions
effectively require the assent of more than a mere majority
of shareholders. And each team’s decision reflects not only
an interest in NFLP’s profits but also an interest in the
team’s individual profits. See generally Shusido, 39 Hast­
ings L. J., at 69–71. The 32 teams capture individual
