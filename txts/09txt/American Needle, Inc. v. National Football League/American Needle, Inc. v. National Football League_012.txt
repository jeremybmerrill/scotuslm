Opinion of the Court

through ownership of the maximum amount of stock in
each local branch that was allowed by law, “ownership of
much of the remaining stock by parties friendly to C&S,
use by the suburban banks of the C&S logogram and all of
C&S’s banking services, and close C&S oversight of the
operation and governance of the suburban banks.” Id., at
89 (footnote omitted). The Government challenged the
cooperation between the banks. In our analysis, we ob­
served that “ ‘corporate interrelationships . . . are not
determinative,’ ” id., at 116, “looked to economic sub­
stance,” and observed that “because the sponsored banks
were not set up to be competitors, §1 did not compel them
to compete.” Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶1463, at 200–201;
see also Citizens & Southern, 422 U. S., at 119–120;

We finally reexamined the intraenterprise conspiracy
doctrine in Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.,
467 U. S. 752 (1984), and concluded that it was inconsis­
tent with the “ ‘basic distinction between concerted and
independent action.’ ” Id., at 767. Considering it “per­
fectly plain that an internal agreement to implement a
single, unitary firm’s policies does not raise the antitrust
dangers that §1 was designed to police,” id., at 769, we
held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned sub­
sidiary “are incapable of conspiring with each other for
purposes of §1 of the Sherman Act,” id., at 777. We ex­
plained that although a parent corporation and its wholly
owned subsidiary are “separate” for the purposes of incor­
poration or formal title, they are controlled by a single
center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggre­
gation of economic power. Joint conduct by two such
entities does not “depriv[e] the marketplace of independ­
ent centers of decisionmaking,” id., at 769, and as a re­
sult, an agreement between them does not constitute a
“contract, combination . . . or conspiracy” for the purposes
