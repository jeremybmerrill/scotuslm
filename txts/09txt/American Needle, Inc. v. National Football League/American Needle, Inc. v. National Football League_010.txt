Opinion of the Court

dictated that each operate within a specific geographic
area. Id., at 352–353. The Government alleged that the
licensees and Sealy were conspiring in violation of §1, and
we agreed. Id., at 352–354. We explained that “[w]e seek
the central substance of the situation” and therefore “we
are moved by the identity of the persons who act, rather
than the label of their hats.” Id., at 353. We thus held
that Sealy was not a “separate entity, but . . . an instru­

In similar circumstances, we have found other formally

Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468
U. S. 85 (1984) (NCAA); United States v. Topco Associates,

curring); United States v. Terminal Railroad Assn. of St.
Louis, 224 U. S. 383 (1912); see also Rock, Corporate Law
Through an Antitrust Lens, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 497, 506–
510 (1992) (discussing cases). We have similarly looked
past the form of a legally “single entity” when competitors
were part of professional organizations3 or trade groups.4
Conversely, there is not necessarily concerted action
simply because more than one legally distinct entity is
involved. Although, under a now-defunct doctrine known
as the “intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine,” we once
treated cooperation between legally separate entities as
