AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL 

FOOTBALL LEAGUE
Opinion of the Court 


necessarily covered by §1, we now embark on a more
functional analysis.
The roots of this functional analysis can be found in the
very decision that established the intraenterprise conspir­
acy doctrine. In United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S.
218 (1947), we observed that “corporate interrelationships
. . . are not determinitive of the applicability of the
Sherman Act” because the Act “is aimed at substance
rather than form.” Id., at 227. We nonetheless held that
cooperation between legally separate entities was neces­
sarily covered by §1 because an unreasonable restraint of
trade “may result as readily from a conspiracy among
those who are affiliated or integrated under common
ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are
otherwise independent.” Ibid.; see also Kiefer-Stewart Co.
v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211, 215
(1951).
The decline of the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine
began in Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler & Smith Citrus
Products Co., 370 U. S. 19 (1962). In that case, several
agricultural cooperatives that were owned by the same
farmers were sued for violations of §1 of the Sherman Act.
Id., at 24–25. Applying a specific immunity provision for
agricultural cooperatives, we held that the three coopera­
tives were “in practical effect” one “organization,” even
though the controlling farmers “have formally organized
themselves into three separate legal entities.” Id., at 29.
“To hold otherwise,” we explained, “would be to impose
grave legal consequences upon organizational distinctions
that are of de minimis meaning and effect” insofar as “use
of separate corporations had [no] economic significance.”

Next, in United States v. Citizens & Southern Nat.
Bank, 422 U. S. 86 (1975), a large bank, Citizens and
Southern (C&S), formed a holding company that operated
de facto suburban branch banks in the Atlanta area
