Opinion of the Court

U. S., at 101; see id., at 117 (“Our decision not to apply a
per se rule to this case rests in large part on our recogni­
tion that a certain degree of cooperation is necessary if the
type of competition that petitioner and its member institu­
tions seek to market is to be preserved”); see also Dagher,
547 U. S., at 6. In such instances, the agreement is likely
to survive the Rule of Reason. See Broadcast Music, Inc.
v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 23
(1979) (“Joint ventures and other cooperative arrange­
ments are also not usually unlawful. . . where the agree­
ment . . . is necessary to market the product at all”). And
depending upon the concerted activity in question, the
Rule of Reason may not require a detailed analysis; it “can
sometimes be applied in the twinkling of an eye.” NCAA,
468 U. S., at 109, n. 39.
Other features of the NFL may also save agreements
amongst the teams. We have recognized, for example,
“that the interest in maintaining a competitive balance”
among “athletic teams is legitimate and important,”
NCAA, 468 U. S., at 117. While that same interest applies
to the teams in the NFL, it does not justify treating them
as a single entity for §1 purposes when it comes to the
marketing of the teams’ individually owned intellectual
property. It is, however, unquestionably an interest that
may well justify a variety of collective decisions made by
the teams. What role it properly plays in applying the
Rule of Reason to the allegations in this case is a matter to
be considered on remand.

intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse;
but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts
and to predict consequences.” See also Leegin Creative Leather Prod
