combination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade.” 15
U. S. C. §1.
The meaning of the term “contract, combination . . . or
conspiracy” is informed by the “ ‘basic distinction’ ” in the
Sherman Act “ ‘between concerted and independent ac­
tion’ ” that distinguishes §1 of the Sherman Act from §2.
Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 767 (quoting Monsanto Co. v.
Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S. 752, 761 (1984)).
Section 1 applies only to concerted action that restrains
trade. Section 2, by contrast, covers both concerted and
independent action, but only if that action “monopolize[s],”
15 U. S. C. §2, or “threatens actual monopolization,” Cop
perweld, 467 U. S., at 767, a category that is narrower
than restraint of trade. Monopoly power may be equally
harmful whether it is the product of joint action or indi­
vidual action.
Congress used this distinction between concerted and
independent action to deter anticompetitive conduct and
compensate its victims, without chilling vigorous competi­
tion through ordinary business operations. The distinc­
tion also avoids judicial scrutiny of routine, internal busi­
ness decisions.
Thus, in §1 Congress “treated concerted behavior more
strictly than unilateral behavior.” Id., at 768. This is so
because unlike independent action, “[c]oncerted activity
inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk” insofar as
it “deprives the marketplace of independent centers of
decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.”
Id., at 768–769. And because concerted action is discrete
and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a
vast amount of business conduct. As a result, there is less
risk of deterring a firm’s necessary conduct; courts need
only examine discrete agreements; and such conduct may
be remedied simply through prohibition.2 See Areeda &
