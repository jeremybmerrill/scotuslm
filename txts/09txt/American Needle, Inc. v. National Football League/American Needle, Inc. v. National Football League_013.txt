AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL 

FOOTBALL LEAGUE
Opinion of the Court 


of §1.5
IV
As Copperweld exemplifies, “substance, not form, should
determine whether a[n] . . . entity is capable of conspiring
under §1.” 467 U. S., at 773, n. 21. This inquiry is some­
times described as asking whether the alleged conspira­
tors are a single entity. That is perhaps a misdescription,
however, because the question is not whether the defen­
dant is a legally single entity or has a single name; nor is
the question whether the parties involved “seem” like one
firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense. The key
is whether the alleged “contract, combination . . . , or
conspiracy” is concerted action—that is, whether it joins
together separate decisionmakers. The relevant inquiry,
therefore, is whether there is a “contract, combination . . .
or conspiracy” amongst “separate economic actors pursu­
ing separate economic interests,” id., at 769, such that the
agreement “deprives the marketplace of independent
centers of decisionmaking,” ibid., and therefore of “diver­
sity of entrepreneurial interests,” Fraser v. Major League
Soccer, L. L. C., 284 F. 3d 47, 57 (CA1 2002) (Boudin,
C. J.), and thus of actual or potential competition, see
Freeman v. San Diego Assn. of Realtors, 322 F. 3d 1133,
1148–1149 (CA9 2003) (Kozinski, J.); Rothery Storage &
Van Co. v. Atlas Van Line, Inc., 792 F. 2d 210, 214–215

5 This focus on “substance, not, form,” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 773,
n. 21, can also be seen in our cases about whether a company and its
agent are capable of conspiring under §1. See, e.g., Simpson v. Union
Oil Co. of Cal., 377 U. S. 13, 20–21 (1964); see also E. Elhauge & D.
Geradin, Global Antitrust Law and Economics 787–788, and n. 7 (2007)
(hereinafter Elhauge & Geradin) (explaining the functional difference
between Simpson and United States v. General Elec. Co., 272 U. S. 476
(1926), in which we treated a similar agreement as beyond the reach of
§1).
