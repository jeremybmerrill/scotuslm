AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL 

FOOTBALL LEAGUE
Opinion of the Court 





trols the promotion of NFL football,” and “it makes little
sense to assert that each individual team has the author­
ity, if not the responsibility, to promote the jointly pro­
duced NFL football.” Ibid. Recognizing that NFL teams
have “license[d] their intellectual property collectively”
since 1963, the court held that §1 did not apply. Id., at

We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. __ (2009).

As the case comes to us, we have only a narrow issue to
decide: whether the NFL respondents are capable of en­
gaging in a “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” as
defined by §1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. §1, or, as we

also Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U. S. 1, 5 (2006) (“This
Court has not taken a literal approach to this language”);
cf. Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S.
231, 238 (1918) (reasoning that the term “restraint of
trade” in §1 cannot possibly refer to any restraint on com­
petition because “[e]very agreement concerning trade,
every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain,
