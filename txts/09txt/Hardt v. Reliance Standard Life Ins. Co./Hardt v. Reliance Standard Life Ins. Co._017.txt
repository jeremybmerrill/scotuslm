BRIDGET HARDT, PETITIONER v. RELIANCE 

STANDARD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[May 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
While I join the Court’s judgment and Parts I and II of
its opinion, I do not believe that our mistaken interpreta
tion of §307(f) of the Clean Air Act in Ruckelshaus v. Si
erra Club, 463 U. S. 680 (1983), should be given any spe
cial weight in the interpretation of this—or any other—
different statutory provision. The outcome in that closely
divided case turned, to a significant extent, on a judgment
about how to read the legislative history of the provision
in question. Compare id., at 686–693, with id., at 703–706
(STEVENS, J., dissenting). I agree with the Court in this
case that 29 U. S. C. §1132(g)(1) does not impose a “pre
vailing party” requirement; I agree, further, that the
District Court acted well within its discretion in awarding
attorney’s fees to this petitioner. But I would examine the
text, structure, and history of any other federal statute
authorizing an award of fees before concluding that Con
gress intended the same approach under that statute as
under this one.
