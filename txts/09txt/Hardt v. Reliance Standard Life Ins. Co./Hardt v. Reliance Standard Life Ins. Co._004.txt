BRIDGET HARDT, PETITIONER v. RELIANCE 

STANDARD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[May 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
In most lawsuits seeking relief under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat.
829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §1001 et seq., “a reasonable
attorney’s fee and costs” are available “to either party” at
the court’s “discretion.” §1132(g)(1). The Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit has interpreted §1132(g)(1) to re
quire that a fee claimant be a “prevailing party” before he
may seek a fees award. We reject this interpretation as
contrary to §1132(g)(1)’s plain text. We hold instead that
a court “in its discretion” may award fees and costs “to
either party,” ibid., as long as the fee claimant has
achieved “some degree of success on the merits,” Ruckels
haus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694 (1983).
