Opinion of the Court

Court nevertheless found “compelling evidence that Ms.
Hardt is totally disabled due to her neuropathy,” and
stated that it was “inclined to rule in Ms. Hardt’s favor” on
her benefits claim, but declined to do so before “first giving
Reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its”
statutorily mandated “full and fair review” of that claim.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; 29 U. S. C. §1133(2). Hardt
thus obtained a judicial order instructing Reliance “to act
on Ms. Hardt’s application by adequately considering all
the evidence” within 30 days; “[o]therwise, judgment will
be issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.” App. to Pet. for Cert.
49a. After Reliance conducted that court-ordered review,
and consistent with the District Court’s appraisal, Reli
ance reversed its decision and awarded Hardt the benefits
she sought. App. 120a–123a.
These facts establish that Hardt has achieved far more
than “trivial success on the merits” or a “purely procedural
victory.” Accordingly, she has achieved “some success on
the merits,” and the District Court properly exercised its
discretion to award Hardt attorney’s fees in this case.
Because these conclusions resolve this case, we need not
decide today whether a remand order, without more,
constitutes “some success on the merits” sufficient to make
a party eligible for attorney’s fees under §1132(g)(1).9

We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit and remand this case for proceedings con
sistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

9 Reliance has not preserved any separate objection to the reason
ableness of the amount of fees awarded. See Perdue v. Kenny A., 559
U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7–8, 14).
