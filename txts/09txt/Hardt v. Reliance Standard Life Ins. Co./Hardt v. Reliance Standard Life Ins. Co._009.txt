HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.
Opinion of the Court

v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc., 115 F. 3d
1201, 1210 (CA4 1997), and citing Buckhannon Board &
Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and
Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001)). If the fee
claimant qualifies as a prevailing party, the court proceeds
to step two and “determin[es] whether an award of attor
neys’ fees is appropriate” by examining “five factors.”1
App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. Finally, if those five factors
suggest that a fees award is appropriate, the court “must
review the attorneys’ fees and costs requested and limit
them to a reasonable amount.” Id., at 17a (citing Hensley
v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 433 (1983)).
Applying that framework, the District Court granted
Hardt’s motion. It first concluded that Hardt was a pre
vailing party because the court’s remand order “sanctioned
a material change in the legal relationship of the parties
by ordering [Reliance] to conduct the type of review to
which [Hardt] was entitled.” Id., at 22a. The court recog
nized that the order did not “sanctio[n] a certain result on
remand,” but found that it “quite clearly expressed the
consequences to [Reliance] were it to fail to complete its
reconsideration in an expeditious manner.” Id., at 19a.
Accordingly, the remand order “signif[ied] that the court
was displeased with the cursory review that [Reliance]
had initially given to [Hardt’s] claim, but was inclined to
reserve judgment and permit [Reliance] to conduct a
proper review of all of the medical evidence.” Ibid. The

1 These factors are: “ ‘(1) the degree of opposing parties’ culpability or
bad faith; (2) ability of opposing parties to satisfy an award of attor
neys’ fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys’ fees against the opposing
parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances;
(4) whether the parties requesting attorneys’ fees sought to benefit all
participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a signifi
cant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits
of the parties’ positions.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a (quoting Quesin
berry v. Life Ins. Co. of North Am., 987 F. 2d 1017, 1029 (CA4 1993)).
