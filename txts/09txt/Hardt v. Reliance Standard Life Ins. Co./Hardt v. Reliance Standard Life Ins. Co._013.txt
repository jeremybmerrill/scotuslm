HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.
Opinion of the Court

see also Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip
op., at 5). Statutory changes to this rule take various
forms. Most fee-shifting provisions permit a court to
award attorney’s fees only to a “prevailing party.” 3 Others
permit a “substantially prevailing” party 4 or a “successful”
litigant 5 to obtain fees. Still others authorize district
courts to award attorney’s fees where “appropriate,” 6 or
simply vest district courts with “discretion” to award fees.7
Of those statutory deviations from the American Rule,
we have most often considered statutes containing an
express “prevailing party” requirement. See, e.g., Texas
State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,
489 U. S. 782, 792–793 (1989); Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S.
103, 109–114 (1992); Buckhannon, supra, at 602–606; Sole
v. Wyner, 551 U. S. 74, 82–86 (2007). Our “prevailing
party” precedents, however, do not govern the availability
of fees awards under §1132(g)(1), because this provision
does not limit the availability of attorney’s fees to the
“prevailing party.” Supra, at 8–9; see also Gross, supra, at
___, (slip op., at 6) (cautioning courts “conducting statu
tory interpretation . . . ‘not to apply rules applicable under
one statute to a different statute without careful and
critical examination’ ” (quoting Federal Express Corp. v.
Holowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 393 (2008))).
Instead, we interpret §1132(g)(1) in light of our prece
dents addressing statutory deviations from the American
Rule that do not limit attorney’s fees awards to the “pre
