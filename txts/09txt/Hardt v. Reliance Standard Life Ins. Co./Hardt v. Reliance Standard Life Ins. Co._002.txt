HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.
Syllabus
and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 604, that a fee claimant is a
“prevailing party” only if he has obtained an “enforceable judgmen[t]
on the merits ” or a “court-ordered consent decre[e]. ” The court rea
soned that because the remand order did not require Reliance to
award Hardt benefits, it did not constitute an enforceable judgment
on the merits.

Held:
1. A fee claimant need not be a “prevailing party” to be eligible for
an attorney’s fees award under §1132(g)(1). Interpreting the section
to require a party to attain that status is contrary to §1132(g)(1)’s
plain text. The words “prevailing party” do not appear in the provi
sion. Nor does anything else in §1132(g)(1)’s text purport to limit the
availability of attorney’s fees to a “prevailing party.” Instead,
§1132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts “discretion” to award at
torney’s fees “to either party.” (Emphasis added.) That language
contrasts sharply with §1132(g)(2), which governs the availability of
attorney’s fees in ERISA actions to recover delinquent employer con
tributions to a multiemployer plan. In such cases, only plaintiffs who
obtain “a judgment in favor of the plan” may seek attorney’s fees.
§1132(g)(2)(D). The contrast between these two paragraphs makes
clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the avail
ability of attorney’s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed to
include in §1132(g)(1) an express “prevailing party” requirement, the
Fourth Circuit’s decision adding that term of art to the statute more
closely resembles “invent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]
one.” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359. Pp. 8–9.
2. A court may award fees and costs under §1132(g)(1), as long as
the fee claimant has achieved “some degree of success on the merits.”
Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694. The bedrock princi
ple known as the American Rule provides the relevant point of refer
ence: Each litigant pays his own attorney’s fees, win or lose, unless a
statute or contract provides otherwise. E.g., id., at 683–686. This
Court’s “prevailing party” precedents do not govern here because that
term of art does not appear in §1132(g)(1). Instead, the Court inter
prets §1132(g)(1) in light of its precedents addressing statutes that
deviate from the American Rule by authorizing attorney’s fees based
on other criteria. Ruckelshaus, which considered a statute authoriz
ing a fees award if the court “determines that such an award is ap
propriate,” 42 U. S. C. §7607(f), is the principal case in that category.
Applying that decision’s interpretive approach to 29 U. S. C.
§1132(g)(1), the Court first looks to “the language of the section,” 463
U. S., at 682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attor
ney’s fees “in its discretion . . . to either party.” Ruckelshaus also lays
down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising that discre
