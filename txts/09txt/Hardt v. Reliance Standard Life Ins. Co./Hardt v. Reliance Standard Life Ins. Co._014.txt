Opinion of the Court

vailing party.” In that line of precedents, Ruckelshaus is
the principal case. There, the Court interpreted §307(f) of
the Clean Air Act, which authorizes a court to award fees
“whenever it determines that such an award is appropri
ate.” 42 U. S. C. §7607(f). We began by noting that be
cause nothing in §307(f)’s text “clear[ly] show[ed]” that
Congress meant to abandon the American Rule, 463 U. S.,
at 685, fee claimants must have achieved some litigating
success to be eligible for a fees award under that section,
id., at 686. We then concluded that by using the less
stringent “whenever . . . appropriate” standard instead of
the traditional “prevailing party” standard, Congress had
“expand[ed] the class of parties eligible for fees awards
from prevailing parties to partially prevailing parties—
parties achieving some success, even if not major success.”
Id., at 688. We thus held “that, absent some degree of
success on the merits by the claimant, it is not ‘appropri
ate’ for a federal court to award attorney’s fees under
§307(f).” Id., at 694.
Applying the interpretive approach we employed in
Ruckelshaus to §1132(g)(1), we first look to “the language
of the section,” id., at 682, which unambiguously allows a
court to award attorney’s fees “in its discretion . . . to
either party,” §1132(g)(1). Statutes vesting judges with
such broad discretion are well known in the law, particu
larly in the attorney’s fees context. See, e.g., n. 7, supra;
see also Perdue, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).
Equally well known, however, is the fact that a “judge’s
discretion is not unlimited.” Ibid. Consistent with Cir
cuit precedent, the District Court applied five factors to
guide its discretion in deciding whether to award attor
ney’s fees under §1132(g)(1). See supra, at 6, and n. 1.
Because these five factors bear no obvious relation to
§1132(g)(1)’s text or to our fee-shifting jurisprudence, they
are not required for channeling a court’s discretion when
awarding fees under this section.
