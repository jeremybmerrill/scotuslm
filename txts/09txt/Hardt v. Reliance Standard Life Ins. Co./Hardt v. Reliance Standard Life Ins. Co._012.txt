party.” (Emphasis added.)
That language contrasts sharply with §1132(g)(2), which
governs the availability of attorney’s fees in ERISA actions
under §1145 (actions to recover delinquent employer
contributions to a multiemployer plan). In such cases,
only plaintiffs who obtain “a judgment in favor of the plan”
may seek attorney’s fees. §1132(g)(2)(D). The contrast
between these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress
knows how to impose express limits on the availability of
attorney’s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed
to include in §1132(g)(1) an express “prevailing party”
limit on the availability of attorney’s fees, the Court of
Appeals’ decision adding that term of art to a fee-shifting
statute from which it is conspicuously absent more closely
resembles “invent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]
one.” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359
(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).
We see no reason to dwell any longer on this question,
particularly given Reliance’s concessions. See Brief for
Respondent 9–10 (“On its face,” §1132(g)(1) “does not
expressly demand, like so many statutes, that a claimant
be a ‘prevailing party’ before receiving attorney’s fees”).
We therefore hold that a fee claimant need not be a “pre
vailing party” to be eligible for an attorney’s fees award
under §1132(g)(1).
III
We next consider the circumstances under which a court
may award attorney’s fees pursuant to §1132(g)(1). “Our
basic point of reference” when considering the award of
attorney’s fees is the bedrock principle known as the
“ ‘American Rule’ ”: Each litigant pays his own attorney’s
fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides
otherwise. Ruckelshaus, 463 U. S., at 683; see id., at 683–
686; Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,
421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975); Buckhannon, supra, at 602–603;
