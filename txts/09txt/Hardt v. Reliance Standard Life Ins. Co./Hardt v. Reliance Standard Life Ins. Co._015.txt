HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.
Opinion of the Court

Instead, Ruckelshaus lays down the proper markers to
guide a court in exercising the discretion that §1132(g)(1)
grants. As in the statute at issue in Ruckelshaus, Con
gress failed to indicate clearly in §1132(g)(1) that it
“meant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and
intuitive notions of fairness.” 463 U. S., at 686. Accord
ingly, a fees claimant must show “some degree of success
on the merits” before a court may award attorney’s fees
under §1132(g)(1), id., at 694. A claimant does not satisfy
that requirement by achieving “trivial success on the
merits” or a “purely procedural victor[y],” but does satisfy
it if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation
some success on the merits without conducting a “lengthy
inquir[y] into the question whether a particular party’s
success was ‘substantial’ or occurred on a ‘central issue.’ ”
Id., at 688, n. 9.8
Reliance essentially agrees that this standard should
govern fee requests under §1132(g)(1), see Brief for Re
spondent 13–31, but argues that Hardt has not satisfied it.
Specifically, Reliance contends that a court order remand
ing an ERISA claim for further consideration can never
constitute “some success on the merits,” even if such a
remand results in an award of benefits. See id., at 34–50.
Reliance’s argument misses the point, given the facts of
this case. Hardt persuaded the District Court to find that
“the plan administrator has failed to comply with the
ERISA guidelines” and “that Ms. Hardt did not get the
kind of review to which she was entitled under applicable
law.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; see 29 U. S. C. §1133(2),
29 CFR §2560.503–1(h) (2009). Although Hardt failed to
win summary judgment on her benefits claim, the District
——————
8 We do not foreclose the possibility that once a claimant has satisfied
this requirement, and thus becomes eligible for a fees award under
§1132(g)(1), a court may consider the five factors adopted by the Court
of Appeals, see n. 1, supra, in deciding whether to award attorney’s
fees.
