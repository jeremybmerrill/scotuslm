Opinion of the Court

court next concluded that a fees award was appropriate
under the five-factor test, see id., at 22a–25a, and
awarded $39,149 in fees and costs, id., at 25a–30a.
Reliance appealed the fees award, and the Court of
Appeals vacated the District Court’s order. According to
the Court of Appeals, Hardt failed to satisfy the step-one
inquiry—i.e., she failed to establish that she was a “pre
vailing party.” In reaching that conclusion, the Court of
Appeals relied on this Court’s decision in Buckhannon,
under which a fee claimant qualifies as a “prevailing
party” only if he has obtained an “ ‘enforceable judgmen[t]

Fed. Appx. 332, 335 (CA4 2009) (per curiam) (quoting 532
U. S., at 604). The Court of Appeals reasoned that be

a “prevailing party”?2 Second, did the Court of Appeals

2 The Courts of Appeals are divided on this issue. Some (a few only
tentatively) agree with the Court of Appeals’ conclusion here that only
prevailing parties are entitled to fees under §1132(g)(1). See, e.g.,
Cottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F. 3d 220, 225 (CA1
1996) (“Congress declared that, in any ERISA claim advanced by a
‘participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may
allow a reasonable attorney’s fee’ to the prevailing party” (emphasis
added)); Tate v. Long Term Disability Plan for Salaried Employees of
Champion Int’l Corp. #506, 545 F. 3d 555, 564 (CA7 2008) (“In analyz
ing whether attorney’s fees should be awarded to a ‘prevailing party’ in
an ERISA case, a court should consider whether the losing party’s
