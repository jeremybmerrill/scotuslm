HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.
Opinion of the Court

correctly identify the circumstances under which a fee
claimant is entitled to attorney’s fees under §1132(g)(1)?
We granted certiorari. 558 U. S. ___ (2010).
II
Whether §1132(g)(1) limits the availability of attorney’s
fees to a “prevailing party” is a question of statutory con
struction. As in all such cases, we begin by analyzing the
statutory language, “assum[ing] that the ordinary mean
ing of that language accurately expresses the legislative
purpose.” Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U. S.
___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks
omitted). We must enforce plain and unambiguous statu
tory language according to its terms. Carcieri v. Salazar,
555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7); Jimenez v. Quar
terman, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5).
Section 1132(g)(1) provides:
“In any action under this subchapter (other than an
action described in paragraph (2)) by a participant,
beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion
may allow a reasonable attorney’s fee and costs of ac
tion to either party.”
The words “prevailing party” do not appear in this provi
sion. Nor does anything else in §1132(g)(1)’s text purport
to limit the availability of attorney’s fees to a “prevailing
party.” Instead, §1132(g)(1) expressly grants district
courts “discretion” to award attorney’s fees “to either
——————
is not a prevailing party in the truest sense of the term” (some internal
quotation marks and citation omitted)); Graham v. Hartford Life and
Accident Ins. Co., 501 F. 3d 1153, 1162 (CA10 2007) (“We also afford
certain weight to prevailing party status, even though we acknowledge
that the ERISA attorney’s fees provision is not expressly directed at
prevailing parties”). Other Courts of Appeals have rejected or dis
avowed that position. See, e.g., Miller v. United Welfare Fund, 72 F. 3d
1066, 1074 (CA2 1995); Gibbs v. Gibbs, 210 F. 3d 491, 503 (CA5 2000);
Freeman v. Continental Ins. Co., 996 F. 2d 1116, 1119 (CA11 1993).
