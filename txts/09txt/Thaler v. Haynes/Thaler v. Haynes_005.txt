principle to the facts of the prisoner’s case.” Id., at 413.

In holding that respondent is entitled to a new trial, the
Court of Appeals cited two decisions of this Court, Batson
and Snyder, but neither of these cases held that a de
meanor-based explanation for a peremptory challenge
must be rejected unless the judge personally observed
and recalls the relevant aspect of the prospective juror’s
demeanor.
The Court of Appeals appears to have concluded that
Batson supports its decision because Batson requires a
judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory challenge to
“ ‘undertake “a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial
and direct evidence of intent as may be available.” ’ ” 561
F. 3d, at 540 (quoting Batson, 476 U. S., at 93, in turn
quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Devel
opment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977)). This general
requirement, however, did not clearly establish the rule on
which the Court of Appeals’ decision rests. Batson noted
the need for a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory
challenge to “tak[e] into account all possible explanatory
factors in the particular case,” 476 U. S., at 95 (internal
quotation marks omitted). See also Miller-El v. Dretke,
545 U. S. 231, 239 (2005); Johnson v. California, 545 U. S.
162, 170 (2005). Thus, where the explanation for a per
emptory challenge is based on a prospective juror’s de
meanor, the judge should take into account, among other
things, any observations of the juror that the judge was
able to make during the voir dire. But Batson plainly did
not go further and hold that a demeanor-based explana
tion must be rejected if the judge did not observe or cannot
recall the juror’s demeanor.
Nor did we establish such a rule in Snyder.2 In that
