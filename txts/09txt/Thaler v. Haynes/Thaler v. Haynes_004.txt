THALER v. HAYNES
Per Curiam

adopted the rule that it had previously termed “ar
guabl[e].” See 526 F. 3d, at 199; Haynes v. Quarterman,
561 F. 3d 535, 541 (CA5 2009). The court concluded that
the decisions of the state courts were not owed “AEDPA
deference” in this case “because the state courts engaged
in pure appellate fact-finding for an issue that turns en
tirely on demeanor.” Ibid. The court then held that
“no court, including ours, can now engage in a proper
adjudication of the defendant’s demeanor-based Bat
son challenge as to prospective juror Owens because
we will be relying solely on a paper record and would
thereby contravene Batson and its clearly-established
‘factual inquiry’ requirement. See, e.g., Snyder, [552
U. S., at 477]; Batson, [476 U. S., at 95].” Ibid. (foot
note omitted).

Respondent cannot obtain federal habeas relief under 28
U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) unless he can show that the decision
of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals “was contrary to,
or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab

A legal principle is “clearly established” within the mean
ing of this provision only when it is embodied in a holding
of this Court. See Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 74
(2006); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000).
Under §2254(d)(1), a habeas petitioner may obtain relief
(1) “if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to
that reached by this Court on a question of law or if the
state court decides a case differently than this Court has
on a set of materially indistinguishable facts”; or (2) “if the
state court identifies the correct governing legal principle
from this Court’s decisions but unreasonably applies that
