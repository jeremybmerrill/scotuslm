SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
RICK THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT 

OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTI-

HAYNES 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 09–273.

Decided February 22, 2010

Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), must reject a demeanor
based explanation for the challenge unless the judge per
sonally observed and recalls the aspect of the prospective
juror’s demeanor on which the explanation is based. The
Court of Appeals appears to have concluded that either
Batson itself or Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472 (2008),
clearly established such a rule, but the Court of Appeals
read far too much into those decisions, and its holding, if
allowed to stand, would have important implications. We
therefore grant the petition for certiorari, grant respon
dent’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse
the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
