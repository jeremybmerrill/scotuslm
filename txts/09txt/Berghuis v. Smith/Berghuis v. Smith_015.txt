BERGHUIS v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

§2254(d)(1); see 543 F. 3d, at 345. We disagree. As ex
plained below, our Duren decision hardly establishes—no
less “clearly” so—that Smith was denied his Sixth
Amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair
cross section of the community.
II
To establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross
section requirement, this Court’s pathmarking decision in
Duren instructs, a defendant must prove that: (1) a group
qualifying as “distinctive” (2) is not fairly and reasonably
represented in jury venires, and (3) “systematic exclusion”
in the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepre
sentation. 439 U. S., at 364; see supra, at 1–2.
The defendant in Duren successfully challenged Jackson
County’s administration of a Missouri exemption permit
ting any woman to opt out of jury service. 439 U. S., at
360. The Court explained why it was plain that defendant
Duren had established a prima facie case. First, women in
Jackson County were both “numerous and distinct from
men.” Id., at 364 (quoting Taylor, 419 U. S., at 531).
Second, Duren’s “statistical presentation” showed gross
underrepresentation: Women were over half the jury
eligible population; in stark contrast, they accounted for
less than 15% of jury venires. 439 U. S., at 364–366.
Duren also demonstrated systematic exclusion with
particularity. He proved that women’s underrepresenta
tion was persistent—occurring in every weekly venire for
almost a year—and he identified the two stages of the
jury-selection process “when . . . the systematic exclusion
took place.” Id., at 366. First, questionnaires for prospec
tive jurors stated conspicuously that women could opt out
of jury service. Less than 30% of those summoned were
female, suggesting that women in large numbers claimed
the exemption at the questionnaire stage. Ibid. “More
over, at the summons stage women were . . . given another
