Opinion of the Court

at 335.
The Sixth Circuit erred in so ruling. No decision of this
Court “clearly establishe[s]” Smith’s entitlement to fed
eral-court relief. According to the Sixth Circuit, Smith
had demonstrated that a Kent County prospective-juror
assignment procedure, which Smith calls “siphoning,”
“systematic[ally] exclu[ded]” African-Americans. Under
this procedure, Kent County assigned prospective jurors
first to local district courts, and, only after filling local
needs, made remaining persons available to the county
wide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith’s.
The Michigan Supreme Court, however, had rejected
Smith’s “siphoning” plea for lack of proof that the assign
ment procedure caused underrepresentation. Smith, 463
Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. As that determination
was not at all unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit had no
warrant to disturb it. See §2254(d)(2).
In addition to renewal of his “siphoning” argument,
Smith here urges that a host of factors combined to reduce
systematically the number of African-Americans appear
ing on Kent County jury lists, for example, the Kent
County court’s practice of excusing people without ade
quate proof of alleged hardship, and the refusal of Kent
County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to
appear. Brief for Respondent 53–54. Our decisions do not
address factors of the kind Smith urges. We have cau
tioned, however, that “[t]he fair-cross-section principle
must have much leeway in application.” Taylor, 419 U. S.,
at 537–538; see id., at 537 (Court’s holding that Sixth
Amendment is violated by systematic exclusion of women
from jury service “does not augur or authorize the fashion
ing of detailed jury-selection codes by federal courts.”).
