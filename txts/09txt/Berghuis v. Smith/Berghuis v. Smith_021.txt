BERGHUIS v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

resembling those Smith assails might well “survive a fair
cross-section challenge,” 439 U. S., at 370.6 In sum, the
Michigan Supreme Court’s decision rejecting Smith’s fair
cross-section claim is consistent with Duren and “involved
[no] unreasonable application o[f] clearly established
Federal law,” §2254(d)(1).
*
*
*
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.

6 We have also never “clearly” decided, and have no need to consider
here, whether the impact of social and economic factors can support a
fair-cross-section claim. Compare Smith, 463 Mich., at 206, 615 N. W.
2d, at 3 (“[T]he influence of social and economic factors on juror partici
pation does not demonstrate a systematic exclusion of [a distinctive
group].”), with 543 F. 3d 326, 341 (CA6 2008) (case below) (“[T]he Sixth
Amendment is concerned with social or economic factors when the
particular system of selecting jurors makes such factors relevant to who
is placed on the qualifying list and who is ultimately called to or ex
cused from service on a venire panel.”).
