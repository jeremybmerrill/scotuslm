BERGHUIS v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

for jury service.” Smith, 463 Mich., at 203–204, 615 N. W.
2d, at 2–3. And to our knowledge, “[n]o court . . . has
accepted [a standard deviation analysis] alone as determi
native in Sixth Amendment challenges to jury selection
systems.” United States v. Rioux, 97 F. 3d 648, 655 (CA2
1996).
On direct review, as earlier stated, the Michigan Su
preme Court chose no single method “to measur[e]
whether representation was fair and reasonable.” Smith,
463 Mich., at 204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3; see supra, at 7.
Instead, it “adopt[ed] a case-by-case approach.” Smith,
463 Mich., at 204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. “Provided that the
parties proffer sufficient evidence,” that court said, “the
results of all of the tests [should be considered].” Ibid. In
contrast, the Sixth Circuit declared that “[w]here the
distinctive group alleged to have been underrepresented is
small, as is the case here, the comparative disparity test is
the more appropriate measure of underrepresentation.”
543 F. 3d, at 338.
Even in the absence of AEDPA’s constraint, see supra,
at 8, we would have no cause to take sides today on the
method or methods by which underrepresentation is ap
propriately measured.4 Although the Michigan Supreme
Court concluded that “[Smith’s] statistical evidence failed
to establish a legally significant disparity under either the
absolute or comparative disparity tests,” Smith, 463 Mich.,
at 204–205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3,5 that court nevertheless
——————
4 The State asks us to “adopt the absolute-disparity standard for
measuring fair and reasonable representation” and to “requir[e] proof
that the absolute disparity exceeds 10%” to make out a prima facie fair
cross-section violation. Brief for Petitioner 45–46. Under the rule the
State proposes, “the Sixth Amendment offers no remedy for complete
exclusion of distinct groups in communities where the population of the
distinct group falls below the 10 percent threshold.” Brief for Respon
dent 35. We need not reach that issue.
5 For similar conclusions, see, for example, United States v. Orange,
447 F. 3d 792, 798–799, and n. 7 (CA10 2006) (absolute disparity of
