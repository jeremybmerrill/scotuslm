BERGHUIS v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

statistics expert estimated that the comparative disparity
was 34.8%. App. 181a. In the 11 months after Kent
County discontinued the district-court-first assignment
policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped
from 18% to 15.1%. Id., at 102a–103a, 113a.
Smith also introduced the testimony of an expert in
demographics and economics, who tied the underrepresen
tation to social and economic factors. In Kent County, the
expert explained, these forces made African-Americans
less likely than whites to receive or return juror-eligibility
questionnaires, and more likely to assert a hardship ex
cuse. Id., at 79a–80a.
The hearing convinced the trial court that AfricanAmericans were underrepresented in Circuit Court veni
res. App. to Pet. for Cert. 210a. But Smith’s evidence was
insufficient, that court held, to prove that the juror
assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection
process, had systematically excluded African-Americans.
Id., at 210a–212a. The court therefore rejected Smith’s
fair-cross-section claim.

The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the juror
allocation system in place at the relevant time did result
in the underrepresentation of African-Americans. Id., at
182a–183a. Reversing the trial court’s judgment, the
intermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, with
jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment
order installed shortly after the voir dire in Smith’s case.
Ibid.; see supra, at 5.
The Michigan Supreme Court, in turn, reversed the
Court of Appeals’ judgment, concluding that Smith “ha[d]
not established a prima facie violation of the Sixth
Amendment fair-cross-section requirement.” Smith, 463
Mich., at 207, 615 N. W. 2d, at 4. The Michigan High
Court observed, first, that this Court has specified “[no]
