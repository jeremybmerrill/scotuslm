Syllabus
fendant’s prima facie case. The Michigan Supreme Court was there
fore far from “unreasonable,” §2254(d)(1), in concluding that Duren
first and foremost required Smith himself to show that the underrep
resentation complained of was due to systematic exclusion. This
Court, furthermore, has never “clearly established” that jury
selection-process features of the kind on Smith’s list can give rise to a
fair-cross-section claim. Rather, the Taylor Court “recognized broad
discretion in the States” to “prescribe relevant qualifications for their
jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions.” 419 U. S., at 537–538.
And in Duren, the Court understood that hardship exemptions re
sembling those Smith assails might well “survive a fair-cross-section
challenge.” 439 U. S., at 370. Pp. 14–16.
543 F. 3d 326, reversed and remanded.
GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. THOMAS,
J., filed a concurring opinion.
