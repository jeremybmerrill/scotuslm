Opinion of the Court

gave Smith “the benefit of the doubt on underrepresenta
tion,” id., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. It did so in order to
reach the issue ultimately dispositive in Duren: To the
extent underrepresentation existed, was it due to “system
atic exclusion”? Ibid.; see Duren, 439 U. S., at 364.

Addressing the ground on which the Sixth Circuit rested
its decision, Smith submits that the district-court-first
assignment order systematically excluded AfricanAmericans from Kent County Circuit Court venires. Brief
for Respondent 46–48. But as the Michigan Supreme
Court not at all unreasonably concluded, Smith, 463
Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3, Smith’s evidence scarcely
shows that the assignment order he targets caused under
representation. Although the record established that
some officials and others in Kent County believed that the
assignment order created racial disparities, and the
County reversed the order in response, supra, at 5, the
belief was not substantiated by Smith’s evidence.
Evidence that African-Americans were underrepre
sented on the Circuit Court’s venires in significantly
higher percentages than on the Grand Rapids District
Court’s could have indicated that the assignment order
made a critical difference. But, as the Michigan Supreme
Court noted, Smith adduced no evidence to that effect.
See Smith, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Nor did
Smith address whether Grand Rapids, which had the
County’s largest African-American population, “ha[d] more

3.57%; comparative disparities “rang[ing] from 38.17% to 51.22%”); 

United States v. Royal, 174 F. 3d 1, 10 (CA1 1999) (2.97% absolute

disparity; 61.1% comparative disparity); United States v. Rioux, 97

F. 3d 648, 657–658 (CA2 1996) (2.08% absolute disparity; 29% com
parative disparity); State v. Gibbs, 254 Conn. 578, 591–593, 758 A. 2d
327, 337–338 (2000) (2.49% absolute disparity; 37% comparative
disparity).
