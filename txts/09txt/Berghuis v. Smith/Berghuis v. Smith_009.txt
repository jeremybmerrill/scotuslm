BERGHUIS v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

and killed during a bar brawl in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
The bar was crowded at the time of the brawl, with 200-to
300 people on the premises. All patrons of the bar were
African-American. The State charged Smith with the
murder in Kent County Circuit Court.
Voir dire for Smith’s trial took place in September 1993.

tried in a sole Circuit Court. Misdemeanors were prose
cuted in 12 district courts, each covering a discrete geo
graphical area. To fill the courts’ venires, Kent County

Court Administrator testified that about 5% of the forms
were returned as undeliverable, and another 15 to 20%
were not answered. App. 13a. From the pool of prospec
