BERGHUIS v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

need for jurors per capita than [any other district in Kent
County].” Tr. of Oral Arg. 26; id., at 18, 37. Furthermore,
Smith did not endeavor to compare the African-American
representation levels in Circuit Court venires with those
in the Federal District Court venires for the same region.
See id., at 46–47; Duren, 439 U. S., at 367, n. 25.
Smith’s best evidence of systematic exclusion was of
fered by his statistics expert, who reported a decline in
comparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after
Kent County reversed the assignment order. See supra, at
5. This evidence—particularly in view of AEDPA’s in
struction, §2254(d)(2)—is insufficient to support Smith’s
claim that the assignment order caused the underrepre
sentation. As Smith’s counsel recognized at oral argu
ment, this decrease could not fairly be described as “a big
change.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 51; see ibid. (the drop was “a
step in the right direction”). In short, Smith’s evidence
gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude
that the district-court-first assignment order had a signifi
cantly adverse impact on the representation of AfricanAmericans on Circuit Court venires.

To establish systematic exclusion, Smith contends, the
defendant must show only that the underrepresentation is
persistent and “produced by the method or ‘system’ used to
select [jurors],” rather than by chance. Brief for Respon
dent 38, 40. In this regard, Smith catalogs a laundry list
of factors in addition to the alleged “siphoning” that, he
urges, rank as “systematic” causes of underrepresentation
of African-Americans in Kent County’s jury pool. Id., at
53–54. Smith’s list includes the County’s practice of ex
cusing people who merely alleged hardship or simply
failed to show up for jury service, its reliance on mail
notices, its failure to follow up on nonresponses, its use of
residential addresses at least 15 months old, and the
