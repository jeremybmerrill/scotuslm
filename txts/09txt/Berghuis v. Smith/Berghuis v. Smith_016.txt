ignored the summons, she was deemed to have opted out;
no further inquiry was made. Id., at 367. At this “final,
venire, stage,” women’s representation plummeted to
14.5%. Ibid. In the Federal District Court serving the
same territory, the Court noted, despite a women-only
childcare exemption, women accounted for nearly 40% of
those actually serving on juries. See ibid., n. 25.
The “disproportionate and consistent exclusion of
women from the [Jackson County] jury wheel and at the
venire stage,” the Court concluded, “was quite obviously

367. “[A]ppropriately tailored” hardship exemptions, the
Court added, would likely survive a fair-cross-section
challenge if justified by an important state interest. Id.,
at 370. But no such interest, the Court held, could justify
Missouri’s exemption for each and every woman—the
altogether evident explanation for the underrepresenta

As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly observed, see
supra, at 6, neither Duren nor any other decision of this
Court specifies the method or test courts must use to
measure the representation of distinctive groups in jury
pools. The courts below and the parties noted three meth
ods employed or identified in lower federal court decisions:
absolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard
deviation. See Smith, 463 Mich., at 204–205, 615 N. W.
2d, at 2–3; Brief for Petitioner 3; Brief for Respondent 26;
supra, at 6–7.
Each test is imperfect. Absolute disparity and compara
tive disparity measurements, courts have recognized, can
be misleading when, as here, “members of the distinctive
group comp[ose] [only] a small percentage of those eligible
