BERGHUIS v. SMITH
Opinion of the Court

juror participation does not demonstrate a systematic
exclusion.” Id., at 206, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3.
D
In February 2003, Smith filed a habeas corpus petition
in the United States District Court for the Western Dis
trict of Michigan, reasserting his fair-cross-section claim.
Because Smith is “in custody pursuant to the judgment of
a State court,” the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), §2254, governed the District
Court’s review of his application for federal habeas corpus
relief. Under the controlling provision of AEDPA, codified
in §2254(d), a state prisoner’s application may not be
granted as to “any claim . . . adjudicated . . . in State
court” unless the state court’s adjudication
“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab

Court of the United States; or
“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un
reasonable determination of the facts in light of the
evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”
Applying these standards, the District Court dismissed
Smith’s habeas petition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a–42a.
The Court of Appeals reversed. Where, as here, the
allegedly excluded group is small, the Sixth Circuit ruled,
courts should use the comparative disparity test to meas
ure underrepresentation. 543 F. 3d, at 338. In that
court’s view, Smith’s comparative disparity statistics
sufficed “to demonstrate that the representation of African
American veniremen in Kent County . . . was unfair and
unreasonable.” Ibid. As to systematic exclusion, the Sixth
Circuit, in accord with the Michigan intermediate appel
late court, believed that the juror-assignment order in
effect when Smith’s jury was empaneled significantly
