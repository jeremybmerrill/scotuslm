MARY BERGHUIS, WARDEN, PETITIONER v.

DIAPOLIS SMITH 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[March 30, 2010] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.
The text of the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right
to a trial by “an impartial jury.” Historically, juries did
not include a sampling of persons from all levels of society
or even from both sexes. See, e.g., Alschuler & Deiss, A
Brief History of the Criminal Jury in the United States, 61
U. Chi. L. Rev. 867, 877 (1994) (In 1791, “[e]very state
limited jury service to men; every state except Vermont
restricted jury service to property owners or taxpayers;
three states permitted only whites to serve; and one state,
Maryland, disqualified atheists”); Taylor v. Louisiana, 419
U. S. 522, 533, n. 13 (1975) (“In this country women were
disqualified by state law to sit as jurors until the end of
the 19th century”). The Court has nonetheless concluded
that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the
right to a jury that represents “a fair cross section” of the
community. Ante, at 1 (citing Taylor, supra).
In my view, that conclusion rests less on the Sixth
Amendment than on an “amalgamation of the Due Process
Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment,” Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357, 372 (1979)
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting), and seems difficult to square
with the Sixth Amendment’s text and history. Accord
ingly, in an appropriate case I would be willing to recon
sider our precedents articulating the “fair cross section”
