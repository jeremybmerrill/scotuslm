Opinion of the Court

preferred method for measuring whether representation of
a distinctive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable.”
Id., at 203, 615 N. W. 2d, at 2. The court then noted that
lower federal courts had applied three different methods
to measure fair and reasonable representation: the abso
lute and comparative disparity tests, described supra, at 5,
and “the standard deviation test.”1
Recognizing that no single test was entirely satisfactory,
the Michigan Supreme Court adopted a case-by-case
approach allowing consideration of all three means of
measuring underrepresentation. Smith, 463 Mich., at
204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Smith’s statistical evidence, the
court found, “failed to establish a legally significant dis
parity under either the absolute or comparative disparity
tests.” Id., at 204–205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. (The parties
had presented no expert testimony regarding application
of the standard deviation test. Id., at 204, n. 1, 615 N. W.
2d, at 3, n. 1; supra, at 5–6.)
Nevertheless “grant[ing] [Smith] the benefit of the doubt
on unfair and unreasonable underrepresentation,” the
Michigan Supreme Court ultimately determined that “he
ha[d] not shown systematic exclusion.” Smith, 463 Mich.,
at 203, 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 2, 3. Smith’s evidence, the
court said, did not show “how the alleged siphoning of
African American jurors to district courts affected the
circuit court jury pool.” Id., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. In
particular, the court observed, “[t]he record does not dis
close whether the district court jury pools contained more,
fewer, or approximately the same percentage of minority
jurors as the circuit court jury pool.” Ibid. The court also
ruled that “the influence of social and economic factors on

1 Standard deviation analysis seeks to determine the probability that
the disparity between a group’s jury-eligible population and the group’s
percentage in the qualified jury pool is attributable to random chance.
