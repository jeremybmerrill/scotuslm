STEVENS, J., dissenting

Today, without having heard Officer Goolsby’s testi
mony, this Court decides that the trial judge got it wrong.
I am not persuaded that he did, but even if we make that
assumption, it is hard to see how the Court is justified in
micromanaging the day-to-day business of state tribunals
making fact-intensive decisions of this kind. We ought not
usurp the role of the factfinder when faced with a close
question of the reasonableness of an officer’s actions,
particularly in a case tried in a state court. I therefore
respectfully dissent.
