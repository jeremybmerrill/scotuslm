MICHIGAN v. FISHER
STEVENS, J., dissenting

at the officers and told them to get a warrant, and that
Fisher was screaming and throwing things. Goolsby also
testified that he saw “mere drops” of blood outside Fisher’s
home, No. 276439, 2008 WL 786515, *2 (Mich. App., Mar.
25, 2008) (per curiam) (summarizing Goolsby’s testimony),
and that he did not ask whether anyone else was inside.
Goolsby did not testify that he had any reason to believe
that anyone else was in the house. Thus, the factual
question was whether Goolsby had “an objectively reason
able basis for believing that [Fisher was] seriously injured
or imminently threatened with such injury.” Brigham
City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 400 (2006).
After hearing the testimony, the trial judge was “even
more convinced” that the entry was unlawful. Tr. 29 (Dec.
19, 2006). He noted the issue was “whether or not there
was a reasonable basis to [enter the house] or whether
[Goolsby] was just acting on some possibilities,” id., at 22,
and evidently found the record supported the latter rather
than the former. He found the police decision to leave the
scene and not return for several hours—without resolving
any potentially dangerous situation and without calling
for medical assistance—inconsistent with a reasonable
belief that Fisher was in need of immediate aid. In sum,
the one judge who heard Officer Goolsby’s testimony was
not persuaded that Goolsby had an objectively reasonable
basis for believing that entering Fisher’s home was neces
sary to avoid serious injury.
The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding
that the State had not met its burden. Perhaps because
one judge dissented, the Michigan Supreme Court initially
granted an application for leave to appeal. After consider
ing briefs and oral argument, however, the majority of
that Court vacated its earlier order because it was “no
longer persuaded that the questions presented should be
reviewed by this Court.” 483 Mich. 1007, 765 N. W. 2d 19
(2009).
