STEVENS, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
MICHIGAN v. JEREMY FISHER
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF 

APPEALS OF MICHIGAN

No. 09–91. Decided December 7, 2009 


JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR
joins, dissenting.
On October 31, 2003, Jeremy Fisher pointed a rifle at
Officer Christopher Goolsby when Goolsby attempted to
force his way into Fisher’s home without a warrant.
Fisher was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon
and possession of a dangerous weapon during the commis
sion of a felony. The charges were dismissed after the
trial judge granted a motion to suppress evidence of the
assault because it was the product of Goolsby’s unlawful
entry. In 2005 the Michigan Court of Appeals held that
the trial court had erred because it had decided the sup

2d 910, 921 (1993). We have stated the rule in the same
way under federal law, Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385,
392 (1978), and have explained that a warrantless entry is
justified by the “ ‘need to protect or preserve life or avoid
serious injury,’ ” ibid. The State bears the burden of proof
on that factual issue and relied entirely on the testimony
of Officer Goolsby in its attempt to carry that burden.
Since three years had passed, Goolsby was not sure about
certain facts—such as whether Fisher had a cut on his
hand—but he did remember that Fisher repeatedly swore
