MICHIGAN v. FISHER
Per Curiam

Officer Goolsby then pushed the front door partway open
and ventured into the house. Through the window of the
open door he saw Fisher pointing a long gun at him.
Officer Goolsby withdrew.
Fisher was charged under Michigan law with assault
with a dangerous weapon and possession of a firearm
during the commission of a felony. The trial court con
cluded that Officer Goolsby violated the Fourth Amend
ment when he entered Fisher’s house, and granted
Fisher’s motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a
result—that is, Officer Goolsby’s statement that Fisher
pointed a rifle at him. The Michigan Court of Appeals
initially remanded for an evidentiary hearing, see Docket
No. 256027, 2005 WL 3481454 (Dec. 20, 2005) (per cu
riam), after which the trial court reinstated its order. The
Court of Appeals then affirmed over a dissent by Judge
Talbot. See 2008 WL 786515, at *2; id., at *2–*5. The
Michigan Supreme Court granted leave to appeal, but,
after hearing oral argument, it vacated its prior order and
denied leave instead; three justices, however, would have
taken the case and reversed on the ground that the Court
of Appeals misapplied the Fourth Amendment. See 483
Mich. 1007, 765 N. W. 2d 19 (2009). Because the decision
of the Michigan Court of Appeals is indeed contrary to our
Fourth Amendment case law, particularly Brigham City v.
Stuart, 547 U. S. 398 (2006), we grant the State’s petition
for certiorari and reverse.
“[T]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment,”
we have often said, “is ‘reasonableness.’ ” Id., at 403.
Therefore, although “searches and seizures inside a home
without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable,” Groh
v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004) (internal quotation
marks omitted), that presumption can be overcome. For
example, “the exigencies of the situation [may] make the
needs of law enforcement so compelling that the war
rantless search is objectively reasonable.” Mincey v. Ari
