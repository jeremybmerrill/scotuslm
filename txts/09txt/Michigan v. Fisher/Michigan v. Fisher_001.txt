Per Curiam

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
MICHIGAN v. JEREMY FISHER
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF 

APPEALS OF MICHIGAN

No. 09–91. Decided December 7, 2009 


PER CURIAM.
Police officers responded to a complaint of a disturbance
near Allen Road in Brownstown, Michigan.* Officer Chris
topher Goolsby later testified that, as he and his partner
approached the area, a couple directed them to a residence
where a man was “going crazy.” Docket No. 276439, 2008
WL 786515, *1 (Mich. App., Mar. 25, 2008) (per curiam)
(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Upon
their arrival, the officers found a household in consider
able chaos: a pickup truck in the driveway with its front
smashed, damaged fenceposts along the side of the prop
erty, and three broken house windows, the glass still on
the ground outside. The officers also noticed blood on the
hood of the pickup and on clothes inside of it, as well as on
one of the doors to the house. (It is disputed whether they
noticed this immediately upon reaching the house, but
undisputed that they noticed it before the allegedly uncon
stitutional entry.) Through a window, the officers could
see respondent, Jeremy Fisher, inside the house, scream
ing and throwing things. The back door was locked, and a
couch had been placed to block the front door.
The officers knocked, but Fisher refused to answer.
They saw that Fisher had a cut on his hand, and they
asked him whether he needed medical attention. Fisher
ignored these questions and demanded, with accompany
ing profanity, that the officers go to get a search warrant.
