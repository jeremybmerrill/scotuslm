Per Curiam

lieve, when he entered the house, that Fisher or someone
else was seriously injured (which is doubtful), the test, as
we have said, is not what Goolsby believed, but whether
there was “an objectively reasonable basis for believing”
that medical assistance was needed, or persons were in
danger, Brigham City, supra, at 406; Mincey, supra, at
392.
It was error for the Michigan Court of Appeals to re
place that objective inquiry into appearances with its
hindsight determination that there was in fact no emer
gency. It does not meet the needs of law enforcement or
the demands of public safety to require officers to walk
away from a situation like the one they encountered here.
Only when an apparent threat has become an actual harm
can officers rule out innocuous explanations for ominous
circumstances. But “[t]he role of a peace officer includes
preventing violence and restoring order, not simply ren
dering first aid to casualties.” Brigham City, supra, at
406. It sufficed to invoke the emergency aid exception
that it was reasonable to believe that Fisher had hurt
himself (albeit nonfatally) and needed treatment that in
his rage he was unable to provide, or that Fisher was
about to hurt, or had already hurt, someone else. The
Michigan Court of Appeals required more than what the
Fourth Amendment demands.

The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of
the Michigan Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
