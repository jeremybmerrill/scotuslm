BREYER, J., dissenting

irreparable harm. Certainly there is no evidence that
such harm could arise in this nonjury civil case from the
simple fact of transmission itself. By my count, 42 States
and two Federal District Courts currently give judges the
discretion to broadcast civil nonjury trials. See Media
Privacy and Related Law 2009–10 (2009) (collecting state
statutes and rules); Civ. Rule 1.8 (SDNY 2009); Civ. Rule
1.8 (EDNY 2009). Neither the applicants nor anyone else
“has been able to present empirical data sufficient to
establish that the mere presence of the broadcast media
inherently has an adverse effect on [the judicial] process,”
Chandler v. Florida, 449 U. S. 560, 578–579 (1981). Cf. M.
Cohn & D. Dow, Cameras in the Courtroom: Television
and the Pursuit of Justice 62–64 (1998) (canvassing stud
ies, none of which found harm, and one of which found
that witnesses “who faced an obvious camera, provided
answers that were more correct, lengthier and more de
tailed”). And, in any event, any harm to the parties, in
cluding the applicants, is reparable through appeal. Cf.
Chandler, supra, at 581.
The applicants also claim that the transmission will
irreparably harm the witnesses themselves, presumably
by increasing the public’s awareness of who those wit
nesses are. And they claim that some members of the
public might harass those witnesses. But the witnesses,
although capable of doing so, have not asked this Court to
set aside the District Court’s order. Cf. Miller v. Albright,
523 U. S. 420, 445 (1998) (O’Connor, J., joined by
KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); Powers v. Ohio,
499 U. S. 400, 411 (1991). And that is not surprising. All
of the witnesses supporting the applicants are already
publicly identified with their cause. They are all experts
or advocates who have either already appeared on televi
sion or Internet broadcasts, already toured the State
advocating a “yes” vote on Proposition 8, or already en
gaged in extensive public commentary far more likely to
