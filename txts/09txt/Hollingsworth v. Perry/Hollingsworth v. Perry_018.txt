DENNIS HOLLINGSWORTH ET AL. v. KRISTIN M.

Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 U. S., 1306, 1308 (1980) (Bren

States Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004)
(noting that mandamus is a “drastic and extraordinary
remedy reserved for really extraordinary causes” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). This case, in my view, does not
satisfy a single one of these standards, let alone all of
them. Consequently, I must dissent.
First, consider the merits of the legal issue: The United
States Code, in a chapter entitled “Rules of Courts,” states
