Per Curiam

Denver. That meant the families of deceased and surviv
ing victims in and around Oklahoma City would not have
the opportunity to observe the trial. Congress passed a
statute that allowed victims’ families to watch the trial on
closed-circuit television. 42 U. S. C. §10608. The statute
was drawn with care to provide precise and detailed guid
ance with respect to the wide range of issues implicated by
the broadcast. See §10608(a) (the statute only applies “in
cases where the venue of the trial is changed” to a city
that is “out of the State” and “more than 350 miles from
the location in which those proceedings originally would
have taken place”); §§10608(a)–(b) (standards for who can
view such trials); §10608(c) (restrictions on transmission).
And the statute gave the Judicial Conference of the United
States rulemaking authority “to effectuate the policy
addressed by this section.” §10608(g). In the present case,
by contrast, over a span of three weeks the District Court
and Ninth Circuit Judicial Council issued, retracted, and
reissued a series of Web site postings and news releases.
These purport to amend rules and policies at the heart of
an ongoing consideration of broadcasting federal trials.
And they have done so to make sure that one particular
trial may be broadcast. Congress’ requirement of a notice
and comment procedure prevents just such arbitrary
changes of court rules. Instead, courts must use the pro
cedures prescribed by statute to amend their rules, 28
U. S. C. §2071.
If Local Rule 77–3 had been validly revised, questions
would still remain about the District Court’s decision to
allow broadcasting of this particular trial, in which several
of the witnesses have stated concerns for their own secu
rity. Even districts that allow trials to be broadcast, see
Civ. Rule 1.8 (SDNY 2009); Civ. Rule 1.8 (EDNY 2009),
recognize that a district judge’s discretion to broadcast a
trial is limited, see, e.g., Hamilton v. Accu-Tek, 942
F. Supp. 136, 138 (EDNY 1996) (broadcast forbidden
