The need for a meaningful comment period was particu

proceeded with appropriate caution in addressing this
question. In 1996, the Judicial Conference of the United
States adopted a policy opposing the public broadcast of
court proceedings. This policy was adopted after a multi

These postings gave no explanation for invoking the ex
