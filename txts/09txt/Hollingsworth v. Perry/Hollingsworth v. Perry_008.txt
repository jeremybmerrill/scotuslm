HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY
Per Curiam

mandamus may issue, a party must establish that (1) “no
other adequate means [exist] to attain the relief he de
sires,” (2) the party’s “right to issuance of the writ is ‘clear
and indisputable,’ ” and (3) “the writ is appropriate under
the circumstances.” Cheney v. United States Dist. Court
for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380–381 (2004) (some internal
quotation marks omitted). This Court will issue the writ
of mandamus directly to a federal district court “only
where a question of public importance is involved, or
where the question is of such a nature that it is peculiarly
appropriate that such action by this court should be
taken.” Ex parte United States, 287 U. S. 241, 248–249
(1932). These familiar standards are followed here, where
applicants claim that the District Court’s order was based
on a local rule adopted in violation of federal law.

Given the importance of the issues at stake, and our
conclusion that the District Court likely violated a federal
statute in revising its local rules, applicants have shown a
fair prospect that a majority of this Court will either grant

below or will grant a petition for a writ of mandamus.
A district court has discretion to adopt local rules.
Frazier v. Heebe, 482 U. S. 641, 645 (1987) (citing 28
U. S. C. §2071; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83). Those rules have
“the force of law.” Weil v. Neary, 278 U. S. 160, 169
(1929). Federal law, however, requires a district court to
follow certain procedures to adopt or amend a local rule.
Local rules typically may not be amended unless the
district court “giv[es] appropriate public notice and an
opportunity for comment.” 28 U. S. C. §2071(b); see also
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83(a). A limited exception permits
dispensing with this notice-and-comment requirement
only where “there is an immediate need for a rule.”
§2071(e). Even where a rule is amended based on imme
