HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY
Per Curiam

unless “there is no interference with the due process, the
dignity of litigants, jurors and witnesses, or with other
appropriate aspects of the administration of justice”).
Consequently, courts in those districts have allowed the
broadcast of their proceedings on the basis that those
cases were not high profile, E*Trade Financial Corp. v.
Deutsche Bank AG, 582 F. Supp. 2d 528, 535 (SDNY
2008), or did not involve witnesses, Marisol A. v. Giuliani,
929 F. Supp. 660, 661 (SDNY 1996); Katzman v. Victoria’s
Secret Catalogue, 923 F. Supp. 580, 586–587 (SDNY 1996).
Indeed, one District Court did not allow the broadcasting

tive issues.” Schoeps v. Museum of Modern Art, 599
F. Supp. 2d 532, 534 (SDNY 2009). This case, too, in
volves issues subject to intense debate in our society. The
District Court intends not only to broadcast the attorneys’
arguments but also witness testimony. See Sony BMG,
564 F. 3d, at 11 (Lipez, J., concurring) (distinguishing
broadcast of attorneys’ arguments from other parts of the
trial). This case is therefore not a good one for a pilot
program. Even the studies that have been conducted thus
far have not analyzed the effect of broadcasting in high
profile, divisive cases. See Application for Stay 17 (warn
ing by Judge Edward R. Becker that in “ ‘truly high-profile
cases,’ ” one can “ ‘[j]ust imagine what the findings would
be’ ” (quoting Exh. 21, at 2, App. to Pet.)).
III
The District Court attempted to change its rules at the
eleventh hour to treat this case differently than other
trials in the district. Not only did it ignore the federal
statute that establishes the procedures by which its rules
may be amended, its express purpose was to broadcast a
high-profile trial that would include witness testimony
about a contentious issue. If courts are to require that
others follow regular procedures, courts must do so as
