HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY
Per Curiam

order was issued pursuant to a purported amendment to a
local Rule of the District Court. That Rule had previously
forbidden the broadcasting of trials outside the courthouse
in which a trial takes place. The District Court effected its
amendment via several postings on the District Court’s
Web site in the days immediately before the trial in this
case was to begin.
Applicants here are defendant-intervenors in the law
suit. They object to the District Court’s order, arguing
that the District Court violated a federal statute by prom
ulgating the amendment to its local Rule without suffi
cient opportunity for notice and comment and that the
public broadcast would violate their due process rights to a
fair and impartial trial. Applicants seek a stay of the
order pending the filing of petitions for writs of certiorari
and mandamus. We granted a temporary stay to consider
the issue further. Post, p. ___. Concluding that the appli
cants have made a sufficient showing of entitlement to
relief, we now grant a stay.

pellant 28–29 in Citizens United v. Federal Election
Comm’n, No. 08–205, now pending before this Court. For
example, donors to groups supporting Proposition 8 “have
received death threats and envelopes containing a pow
dery white substance.” Stone, Prop 8 Donor Web Site
