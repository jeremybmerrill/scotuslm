located, with the exception of any space specifically
designated as a Press Room. Nothing in this rule is
intended to restrict the use of electronic means to re
ceive or present evidence during Court proceedings.”
Notably, the Rule excepted from its general ban the trans
mittal of certain proceedings—but it limited that exception
to transmissions “within the confines of the courthouse.”
The negative inference of this exception, of course, is that
the Rule would have prohibited the streaming of trans
missions, or other broadcasting or televising, beyond “the
confines of the courthouse.”

its Web site, the District Court purported to revise or
