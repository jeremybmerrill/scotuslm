CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

Court of Appeals’ decision. If the court deferred to the
District Court’s interpretation of Plan terms, then the
Court of Appeals most likely should have reviewed the
decision de novo. See Firestone, supra, at 112; cf. Davila,
supra, at 210 (“Any dispute over the precise terms of the
plan is resolved by a court under a de novo review stan­
dard”). If instead the Court of Appeals deferred to the
District Court’s creation of a remedy, in significant part on
the basis of “equitable principles,” then it properly re­
viewed the District Court decision for “abuse of discre­
tion.” See, e.g., Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320
F. 3d 11, 24 (CA1 2003); Zervos v. Verizon N. Y., Inc., 277
F. 3d 635, 648 (CA2 2002); Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere
Life Ins. Co., 237 F. 3d 1154, 1163 (CA9 2001); Halpin v.
W. W. Grainger, Inc., 962 F. 2d 685, 697 (CA7 1992).
The District Court opinion contains language that sup­
ports either characterization. On the one hand, the court
wrote that its task was to “interpret the Plan as written.”
472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. On the other hand, the court said
that “virtually nothing is set forth in either the Plan or the
[Summary Plan Description]” about how to treat prior
distributions; and, in describing its task, it said that the
Court of Appeals had directed it to use “equitable princi­
ples” in fashioning a remedy. Ibid. Ultimately, the Dis­
trict Court appears to have used both the Plan language
and equitable principles to arrive at its conclusion. See
id., at 457–459.
The Court of Appeals, too, used language that supports
both characterizations. Compare 535 F. 3d, at 117 (noting
that the District Court “applied [Plan] terms” in crafting
its remedy), with id., at 117–119 (describing the District
Court’s decision as the “craft[ing]” of a “remedy” and
acknowledging that it had directed the District Court to
use “equitable principles” in doing so). But the Court of
Appeals ultimately treated the District Court’s opinion as
if it primarily created a fair remedy. Ibid. Given the prior
