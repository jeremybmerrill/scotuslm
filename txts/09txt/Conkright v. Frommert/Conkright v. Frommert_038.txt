CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
B to the opinion of BREYER, J.
AppendixREYER, J., dissenting

account” ($264,000). The total present value of the bene­
fits John would receive upon his second retirement would
thus be $13,800.
This means that John would receive approximately $690
annually ($13,800 × 5 percent) upon retirement under the
Plan Administrator’s “phantom account” approach. In
comparison, if John had simply been treated as a new
employee when he was rehired, his pension would have
entitled him to at least $3,500 annually ($50,000 × 1.4
percent × 5 years) upon his retirement. And the impact of
the “phantom account” may have been even more dramatic
with respect to some of the respondents in this case. See
Brief for Respondents 24 (describing how respondent Paul
Frommert erroneously received a report claiming that his
retirement benefits were $2,482.00 per month, before later
discovering that, because of the “phantom account,” his
actual monthly pension was $5.31 per month); see also
App. 63a.
