Opinion of the Court

settlor would want the trustee divested entirely of that
discretion simply because of one good-faith mistake.1
Here the lower courts made no finding that the Plan
Administrator had acted in bad faith or would not fairly
exercise his discretion to interpret the terms of the Plan.
Thus, if the District Court had followed the trust law
principles set out in Scott and Ascher, it should not have
“act[ed] as a substitute trustee,” Eaton v. Eaton, 82 N. H.
216, 218, 132 A. 10, 11 (1926), and stripped the Plan

1 The

dissent is wrong to suggest a lack of case support for this inter
pretation of trust law. Post, at 10–12 (opinion of BREYER, J.). See, e.g.,
Hanford v. Clancy, 87 N. H. 458, 461, 183 A. 271, 272–273 (1936)
(“Affirmative orders of disposition, such as the court made in this case,
may only be sustained if, under the circumstances, there is but one
reasonable disposition possible. If more than one reasonable disposi
tion could be made, then the trustee must make the choice” (emphasis
added)); In re Sullivan’s Will, 144 Neb. 36, 40–41, 12 N. W. 2d 148,
150–151 (1943) (although trustees erred in not providing any support to
plaintiff, “the court was without authority to determine the amount of
support to which plaintiff was entitled from the trust fund” because
“the court has no authority to substitute its judgment for that of the
trustees” (emphasis added)); Eaton v. Eaton, 82 N. H. 216, 218–219,
132 A. 10, 11 (1926) (“[The trustee’s] failure to administer the fund
properly did not entitle the court to act as a substitute trustee. . . .
[W]ithin the limits of reasonableness the trustee alone may exercise
discretion, since that is what the will requires” (emphasis added) (cited
in 3 A. Scott & W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts §187.1, pp. 30–31 (4th ed.
1988))); In re Marre’s Estate, 18 Cal. 2d 184, 190, 114 P. 2d 586, 590–
591 (1941) (lower court erred in setting amount of payments to benefi
ciary after ruling that trustees had mistakenly failed to make payment;
“[i]t is well settled that the courts will not attempt to exercise discretion
which has been confided to a trustee unless it is clear that the trustee
has abused his discretion in some manner. . . . The amounts to be paid
should therefore be determined in the discretion of the trustees” (cited
in 3 Scott and Ascher 1349, n. 4 (5th ed. 2007))); Finch v. Wachovia
Bank & Trust Co., 156 N. C. App. 343, 348, 577 S. E. 2d 306, 310 (2003)
(agreeing with lower court that trustee abused its discretion, but
vacating the court’s remedial order because it would “strip discretion
from the trustee and replace it with the judgment of the court”). See
