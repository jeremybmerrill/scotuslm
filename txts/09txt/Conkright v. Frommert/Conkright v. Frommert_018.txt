Opinion of the Court

trict Court on the merits.2

Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.

——————
2 The Government raises an additional argument—that the District
Court should not have deferred to the Plan Administrator’s second
interpretation of the Plan because that interpretation would have
violated ERISA’s notice requirements. See Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 25–26. That is an argument about the merits, not the
proper standard of review, and we leave it to be decided, if necessary,
on remand.
