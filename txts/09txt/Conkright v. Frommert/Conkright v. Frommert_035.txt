BREYER, J., dissenting

Court of Appeals opinion’s language, supra, at 6 (quoting
433 F. 3d, at 268), I believe that view is a fair, indeed a
correct, view. And I consequently believe the Court of
Appeals properly reviewed the result for an “abuse of
discretion.”
Petitioners argue that, because respondents were seek­
ing relief under 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), the Court of
Appeals was, in effect, prohibited from treating the rem­
edy as anything other than an application of a plan’s
terms. Brief for Petitioners 55–56; Reply Brief for Peti­
tioners 3, and n. 8, 16–17. While this provision allows
plaintiffs only to “enforce” or “clarify” rights or to “recover
benefits” “under the terms of the plan,” §1132(a)(1)(B)
(emphasis added), it does not so limit a court’s remedial
authority, Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,
534 U. S. 204, 221 (2002) (In §1132(a)(1)(B), “Congress
authorized ‘a participant or beneficiary’ to bring a civil
action . . . without referenc[ing] whether the relief sought
is legal or equitable”). The provision thus does not pro­
hibit a court from shaping relief through the application of
equitable principles, as trust law plainly permits. See,
e.g., 2 Third Restatement §50, and Comment b, at 261
(discussing remedial options); Bogert & Bogert §870, at
123–126 (2d rev. ed. 1995). Indeed, a court that finds, for
example, that an administrator provided employees with
inadequate notice of a plan’s terms (as was true here) may
have no alternative but to rely significantly upon those
principles. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1104(a)(1)(D) (plan fiduciary
must “discharge his dut[y] . . . in accordance with the
documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as
such documents and instruments are consistent” with
ERISA).
For these reasons I would affirm the decision of the
Court of Appeals. And I therefore respectfully dissent
from the majority’s contrary determination.
