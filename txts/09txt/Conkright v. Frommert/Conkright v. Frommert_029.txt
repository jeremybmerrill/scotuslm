BREYER, J., dissenting

has abused his discretion in some manner” (emphasis
added)); In re Ferrall’s Estate, 92 Cal. App. 2d 712, 716–
717, 207 P. 2d 1077, 1079–1080 (1949) (following In re
Marre’s Estate). Three other cases are inapposite because
their circumstances do not involve any allegation of abuse
of discretion by the trustee. See In re Ziegler’s Trusts, 157
So. 2d 549, 550 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1963) (per curiam)
(“There is no contention here that the court . . . would not
retain its rights, upon appropriate petition or other plead­
ings by an interested party, to review an alleged abuse, if
any, of the discretion exercised by the trustees”); In re
Grubel’s Will, 37 Misc. 2d 910, 911, 235 N. Y. S. 2d 21, 23
(Surr. Ct. 1962) (stating that “in the first instance” it is
the “proper function of the trustees” to set an amount to be
paid (emphasis added)); Orr v. Moses, 94 N. H. 309, 312,
52 A. 2d 128, 130 (1947) (declining to construe will be­
cause none “of the parties now assert claims adverse to
any position taken by the trustee”). In the final case, the
court decided that, on the facts before it, it did not need to
control the trustees’ discretion. See Estate of Stillman,
107 Misc. 2d 102, 111, 433 N. Y. S. 2d 701 (Surr. Ct. 1980)
(“The fine record of the trustees in enhancing the equity of
these trusts while earning substantial income, also per­
suades the court of the wisdom of retaining their services
as fiduciaries”). Which of these cases says that, after the
trustee has abused its discretion, a district court must still
defer to the trustee? None of them do. I repeat: Not a
single case cited by the Scott treatise writers supports the
majority’s reading of the treatise.
The majority seeks to justify its reading of the Scott
treatise by referring to four cases that Scott does not cite.
See ante, at 7, n. 1. I am not surprised that the treatise
does not refer to these cases. In the first three, a court
thought it best, when a trustee had not yet exercised
judgment about a particular matter, to direct the trustee
to do so. See In re Sullivan’s Will, 144 Neb. 36, 40–41, 12
