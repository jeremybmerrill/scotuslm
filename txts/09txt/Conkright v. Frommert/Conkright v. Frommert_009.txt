CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
Opinion of the Court

different result.
Nor is the Court of Appeals’ decision supported by the
considerations on which our holdings in Firestone and
Glenn were based—namely, the terms of the plan, princi
ples of trust law, and the purposes of ERISA. See supra,
at 4–5. First, the Plan here grants the Plan Administrator
general authority to “[c]onstrue the Plan.” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 141a–142a. Nothing in that provision suggests that
the grant of authority is limited to first efforts to construe
the Plan.
Second, the Court of Appeals’ exception to Firestone
deference is not required by principles of trust law. Trust
law is unclear on the narrow question before us. A leading
treatise states that a court will strip a trustee of his dis
cretion when there is reason to believe that he will not
exercise that discretion fairly—for example, upon a show
ing that the trustee has already acted in bad faith:
“If the trustee’s failure to pay a reasonable amount [to
the beneficiary of the trust] is due to a failure to exer
cise [the trustee’s] discretion honestly and fairly, the
court may well fix the amount [to be paid] itself. On
the other hand, if the trustee’s failure to provide rea
sonably for the beneficiary is due to a mistake as to
the trustee’s duties or powers, and there is no reason
to believe the trustee will not fairly exercise the dis
cretion once the court has determined the extent of
the trustee’s duties and powers, the court ordinarily
will not fix the amount but will instead direct the
trustee to make reasonable provision for the benefici
ary’s support.” 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher,

This is not surprising—if the settlor who creates a trust
grants discretion to the trustee, it seems doubtful that the
