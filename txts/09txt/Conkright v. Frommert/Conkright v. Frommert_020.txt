CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

percent of your salary to a cash account. Id., at 40a.
This account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate 1
percent above the 1-year Treasury bill rate. Id., at
41a. To determine your benefits under this approach,
take the balance of your cash account and convert the
final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a. Thus, if you
have accrued, say, $200,000 in your account and the
relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is
7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approxi­
mately $14,000 per year upon your retirement (ap­
proximately $200,000 ×7 percent).
(3) “The Investment Account”: Before 1990, Xerox
contributed to an employee profit sharing plan. Id., at
33a–34a. Thus, all employees who were hired by the
end of 1989 have an investment account that consists
of all of the contributions Xerox made to this profit
sharing plan (prior to its discontinuation) and the in­
vestment returns on those contributions. Id., at 33a–
36a. To determine your benefits under this approach,
take the balance of your investment account and con­
vert the final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a.
Thus, just like the cash account, if you have accrued
$400,000 in your account and the relevant annuity
rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you
would be entitled to receive approximately $28,000
per year upon your retirement (approximately
$400,000 × 7 percent).
Given these three examples, the retiring employee’s pen­
sion would come from the investment account, and the
employee would receive $28,000 per year.
This case concerns one aspect of Xerox’s retirement
plan, namely, the way in which the Plan treats employees
who leave Xerox and later return, working for additional
years before their ultimate retirement. The Plan has long
treated such leaving-and-returning employees as follows
