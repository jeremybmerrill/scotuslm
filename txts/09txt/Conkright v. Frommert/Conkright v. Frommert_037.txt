Now, as far as I understand it, John’s retirement bene­
fits are calculated as follows, see 433 F. 3d, at 260:
First, the Plan Administrator would choose which of
John’s three accounts would yield him the greatest bene­
fits. In making this comparison, the Plan Administrator
would assume that John had never left Xerox when calcu­
lating John’s pension. The Plan Administrator would also
assume, when calculating the value of John’s cash and
investment accounts, that the lump-sum distribution John
had received from Xerox had remained invested in his
accounts. (In other words, the Plan Administrator would
include the “phantom account” in his calculations. The
total value of this phantom account in 1989, when John
rejoined Xerox, is equal to John’s lump-sum distribution of
$140,000 × 1.059, or approximately $217,200.)
The Plan Administrator would thus compare John’s
pension, column D, and column H to determine John’s
benefit. As you can see above, column H provides the
greatest benefit, so John’s cash account would be used to
calculate the benefits he would receive upon retirement.
Second, the Plan Administrator would “offset” John’s
prior distribution against his current benefits to deter­
mine the amount of benefits John would actually receive.
Thus, the Plan Administrator would take the “total” value
of John’s cash account, including the “phantom account”
($277,800), and subtract out the value of the “phantom
