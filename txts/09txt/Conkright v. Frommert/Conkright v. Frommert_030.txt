CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

N. W. 2d 148, 150–151 (1943) (finding that the trustees’
“failure to act” was erroneous, and directing the trustees
to exercise their discretion in setting a payment amount);
Eaton v. Eaton, 82 N. H. 216, 218, 132 A. 10, 11 (1926)
(same); Finch v. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., 156 N. C.
App. 343, 347–348, 577 S. E. 2d 306, 309–310 (2003) (hold­
ing trustee erred by “[f]ail[ing] to exercise judgment,” and
directing it to do so). The fourth case concerns circum­
stances so distant from those before us that it is difficult to
know what to say. (The question was whether the benefi­
ciary of a small trust had title in certain trust assets or
whether the trustee had discretionary power to allocate
them in her best interest; the court held the latter, adding
that, if the trustee acted unreasonably, the lower court in
that particular case should seek to have the trustee re­
moved rather than trying to administer the trust funds
itself.) See Hanford v. Clancy, 87 N. H. 458, 460–461, 183
A. 271, 272–273 (1936).
I cannot read these four cases, or any other case to
which the majority refers, as holding that a court, as a
general matter, is required to defer to a trust administra­
tor’s second attempt at exercising discretion. And I am
aware of no such case. In contrast, the Restatement and
Bogert and Scott treatises identify numerous cases in
which courts have remedied a trustee’s abuse of discretion
by ordering the trustee to pay a specific amount. See 2
Third Restatement §50, Reporter’s Note, at 283 (citing
cases such as Coker v. Coker, 208 Ala. 354, 94 So. 566
(1922)); Bogert & Bogert §560, at 223, n. 19 (citing cases
such as Rubion); 3 Scott §18.2.1, at 1348–1349, nn. 3–4
(citing cases such as Emmert v. Old Nat. Bank of Martins
burg, 162 W. Va. 48, 246 S. E. 2d 236 (1978)); see also
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18 (listing cases).
I thus do not find trust law “unclear” on this matter. Ante,
at 6. When a trustee abuses its discretion, trust law
grants courts the authority either to defer anew to the
