Opinion of the Court

“where the plan is administered, where the breach took
place, or where a defendant resides or may be found”). In
fact, that may already be the case. In similar litigation
over the Plan, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the use of
the phantom account method, but held that the Plan
Administrator should utilize actuarial principles in ac
counting for rehired employees’ past distributions—which
would presumably include taking some cognizance of the
time value of money. See Miller v. Xerox Corp. Retirement
Income Guarantee Plan, 464 F. 3d 871, 875–876 (2006);
Brief for ERISA Industry Committee and American Bene
fits Council as Amici Curiae 8–9. Thus, failing to defer to
the Plan Administrator here could well cause the Plan to
be subject to different interpretations in California and
New York. “Uniformity is impossible, however, if plans
are subject to different legal obligations in different
States.” Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 148 (2001).
Firestone deference serves to avoid that result and to
preserve the “careful balancing” of interests that ERISA
represents. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 481 U. S., at 54.

In spite of all this, respondents and the Government
argue that requiring the District Court to apply Firestone
deference in this case would actually disserve the purposes
of ERISA. They argue that continued deference would
encourage plan administrators to adopt unreasonable
interpretations of plans in the first instance, as adminis
trators would anticipate a second chance to interpret their
plans if their first interpretations were rejected. And they
argue that plan administrators would be able to proceed
seriatim through several interpretations of their plans,
each time receiving deference, thereby undermining the
prompt resolution of disputes over benefits, driving up
litigation costs, and discouraging employees from chal
lenging the decisions of plan administrators at all.
