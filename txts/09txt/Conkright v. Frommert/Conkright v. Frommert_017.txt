CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
Opinion of the Court

All this is overblown. There is no reason to think that
deference would be required in the extreme circumstances
that respondents foresee. Under trust law, a trustee may
be stripped of deference when he does not exercise his
discretion “honestly and fairly.” 3 Scott and Ascher 1348.
Multiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provi
sion, even if issued in good faith, might well support a
finding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to
exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of
costly litigation that respondents fear.
Applying a deferential standard of review does not mean
that the plan administrator will prevail on the merits. It
means only that the plan administrator’s interpretation of
the plan “will not be disturbed if reasonable.” Firestone,
489 U. S., at 111; see also ibid. (“ ‘Where discretion is
conferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a
power, its exercise is not subject to control by the court
except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discre
tion’ ” (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts §187)).
Thus, far from “impos[ing] [a] rigid and inflexible re
quirement” that courts must defer to plan administrators,
post, at 8, we simply hold that the lower courts should
have applied the standard established in Firestone and
Glenn.

Court could refuse to defer to the Plan Administrator’s
interpretation of the Plan on remand, simply because the
Court of Appeals had found a previous related interpreta
tion by the Administrator to be invalid. Because we re
verse on that ground, we do not reach the question
whether the Court of Appeals also erred in applying a
deferential standard of review to the decision of the Dis
