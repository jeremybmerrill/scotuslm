Opinion of the Court

remains appropriate even in the face of a conflict. See id.,
at ___ (slip op., at 9).
It is undisputed that, under Firestone and the terms of
the Plan, the Plan Administrator here would normally be
entitled to deference when interpreting the Plan. See 328
F. Supp. 2d, at 430–431 (observing that the Plan grants
the Plan Administrator “broad discretion in making deci

the Administrator.

Court’s chosen method as one of “several reasonable
alternatives”).

the standard was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions like the
one adopted by the Court of Appeals. See 489 U. S., at
111, 115. Indeed, we refused to create such an exception
to Firestone deference in Glenn, recognizing that ERISA
law was already complicated enough without adding
“special procedural or evidentiary rules” to the mix. 554
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). If, as we held in Glenn, a
systemic conflict of interest does not strip a plan adminis
trator of deference, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 9), it is diffi
cult to see why a single honest mistake would require a
