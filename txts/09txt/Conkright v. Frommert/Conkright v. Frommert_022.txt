CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

It is this hypothetical sum—termed the “phantom ac­
count,” ante, at 2—that is at issue in this case. Xerox’s
pre-1989 Plan assumed that a rehired employee had this
hypothetical sum on hand at the time of her final retire­
ment from the company, and in effect subtracted the
amount from the employee’s benefits upon her departure.
Brief for Petitioners 10–11; cf. ante, at 2. Depending on
how the Plan’s investments did over time, the Administra­
tor’s use of this “phantom account” could have a substan­
tial impact on a rehired employee’s benefits. (See Appen­
dix, infra, for an example of how this “phantom account”
works.)
When the Plan Administrator amended Xerox’s Em­
ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)
Plan in 1989, however, it made what it tells us was an
“inadverten[t]” omission. Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 3. In
a section of the 1989 Plan applicable to the roughly 100
leaving-and-returning employees who are plaintiffs here,
the Plan said that it would “offset” the retiring employees’
“accrued benefit” (as ordinarily calculated) “by the accrued
benefit attributable” to the prior lump-sum “distribution”
those employees received when they initially left Xerox.
App. 32a. But the Plan said nothing about how it would
calculate this “offset.” In other words, the Plan said noth­
ing about the Administrator’s use of the “phantom ac­
count.”
This led to the first mistake in this case. Despite the
Plan’s failure to include language explaining how the
Administrator would take into account an employee’s prior
distribution, the Plan Administrator continued to employ
the “phantom account” methodology. In essence, the
Administrator read the 1989 Plan to include the language
that had been omitted—an interpretation that, as de­
scribed below, see Part I–B, infra, the Court of Appeals
found to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of
ERISA.
