CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
Opinion of the Court

Administrator of the deference he would otherwise enjoy
under Firestone and the terms of the Plan.
Other trust law sources, however, point the other way.
For example, the Restatement (Second) of Trusts states
that “the court will control the trustee in the exercise of a
power where he acts beyond the bounds of a reasonable
judgment.” Restatement (Second) of Trusts §187, Com
ment i, p. 406 (1957). Another treatise states that, after a
trustee has abused his discretion, “[s]ometimes the court
decides for the trustee how he should act, either by stating
the exact result it desires to achieve, or by fixing some
limits on the trustee’s action and giving him leeway within
those limits.” G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and
Trustees §560, p. 223 (2d rev. ed. 1980).
The unclear state of trust law on the question was per
haps best captured by the Texas Supreme Court:
“There is authority for ordering a dismissal of the case
to afford the trustee an opportunity to exercise a rea
sonable discretion in arriving at the amount of pay
ments to be made in the light of our discussion of the
problem and after a proper consideration of the many
factors involved. On the other hand, there is author
ity for remanding the case to the trial court to hear
evidence and in the exercise of its supervisory juris
diction to fix the amount of such payments. There is
still other authority for remanding the case to the
trial court to hear evidence and fix the boundaries of a
reasonable discretion to be exercised by the trustee
within maximum and minimum limits.” State v.
Rubion, 158 Tex. 43, 54–55, 308 S. W. 2d 4, 11 (1957)
(citations omitted).
While we are “guided by principles of trust law” in
ERISA cases, Firestone, 489 U. S., at 111, we have recog
nized before that “trust law does not tell the entire story,”
Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996); see ibid.
