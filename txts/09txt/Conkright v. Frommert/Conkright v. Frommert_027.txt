BREYER, J., dissenting

discretion under trust law when a “trustee had discretion
but abused it”). In short, the controlling trust law princi­
ple appears to be that, “[w]here the court finds that there
has been an abuse of a discretionary power, the decree to
be rendered is in its discretion.” Bogert & Bogert §560, at
222.
Of course, the fact that trust law grants courts discre­
tion does not mean that they will exercise that discretion
in all instances. The majority refers to the 2007 edition of
Scott on Trusts, ante, at 6, which says that, if there is “no
reason” to doubt that a trustee “will . . . fairly exercise” his
“discretion,” then courts “ordinarily will not fix the
amount” of a payment “but will instead direct the trustee
to make reasonable provision for the beneficiary’s sup­
port,” 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and
Ascher on Trusts §18.2.1, pp. 1348–1349 (5th ed. 2007)
(emphasis added). As this passage demonstrates, there
are situations in which a court will typically defer to a
trustee’s remedial suggestion.
The word “ordinarily”
confirms, however, that the Scott treatise writers recog­
nize that there are instances in which courts will not
defer. And other treatises indicate that black letter trust
law gives the district courts authority to decide which
instances are which. See Bogert & Bogert §560, at 222–
223 (when there is an abuse of discretion, a court “may set
aside the transaction,” “award damages to the benefici­
ary,” or “order a new decision to be made in the light of
rules expounded by the court”); 2 Third Restatement §50,
and Comment b, at 261 (discussing similar remedial op­
tions); 1 Second Restatement §187, and Comment b, at
402 (same); see also 3 Third Restatement §87, and Com­
ment c, at 244–245 (noting that “judicial intervention on
the ground of abuse” is allowed when a “good-faith,” yet
“unreasonable,” decision is made by a trustee); Rubion,
supra, at 54–55, 308 S. W. 2d, at 11 (discussing a court’s
remedial options).
