BREYER, J., dissenting

B
The District Court committed the second mistake in this
case. In 1999, the respondents, nearly 100 employees who
left and were later rehired by Xerox, brought this lawsuit.
Ante, at 2; Brief for Petitioners ii–iii, 12. They pointed out
that the 1989 Plan said that it would decrease their re­
tirement benefits to reflect the fact that they had already
received a lump-sum benefits distribution when they
initially left Xerox. But, they added, neither the 1989
Plan, nor the 1989 Plan’s Summary Plan Description, said
anything about whether (or how) the Administrator would
adjust their previous benefits distribution to take into
account that they had received the distribution well before
their retirement. They thus claimed that the Plan Admin­
istrator could not use the “phantom account” methodology
to adjust their previous distributions. See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 4–5.
The District Court, however, rejected respondents’
claims. 328 F. Supp. 2d 420 (WDNY 2004). The court
accepted the Administrator’s argument that the 1989 Plan
implicitly incorporated the “phantom account” approach
that had previously been part of Xerox’s retirement plan.
Id., at 433–434. And the court thus held in favor of peti­
tioners—thereby committing the second mistake in this
case. Id., at 439.
On appeal, the Second Circuit disagreed with the Dis­
trict Court and vacated the District Court’s decision in
relevant part. 433 F. 3d 254 (2006). The Court of Appeals
concluded that, because the 1989 Plan said nothing about
how the Administrator would adjust the previous benefits
distributions, it was “arbitrary and capricious” for the
Administrator to interpret the 1989 Plan as if it still in­
corporated the “phantom account.” Id., at 265–266, and
n. 11. And the Court of Appeals thus held that the lan­
guage of the Plan and the Summary Plan Description, at
the least, violated ERISA by failing to provide respondents
