CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

with fair notice that the Administrator was going to use
the “phantom account” approach. See id., at 265 (discuss­
ing 29 U. S. C. §1022); see also 433 F. 3d, at 263, 267–268
(holding that the Administrator’s attempt to apply the
“phantom account” to respondents violated two other
ERISA provisions: 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)’s notice require­
ment and §1054(g)’s prohibition on retroactive benefit
cutbacks). Rather, the court noted, respondents “likely
believed”—based on the language of the Plan—“that their
past distributions would only be factored into their [cur­
rent] benefits calculations by taking into account the
amounts they had actually received.” 433 F. 3d, at 267.
In light of these conclusions, the Court of Appeals rec­
ognized the need to devise a remedy for the Administra­
tor’s abuse of discretion and ERISA violations—a remedy
that took into account the previous benefits distributions
respondents had received in a manner consistent with the
1989 Plan. The court therefore remanded the case to the
District Court, with the following instructions:
“On remand, the remedy crafted by the district court
for those employees [in the respondents’ situation]
should utilize an appropriate [pre-1989 Plan] calcula­
tion to determine their benefits. We recognize the dif­
ficulty that this task poses . . . . As guidance for the
district court, we suggest that it may wish to employ
equitable principles when determining the appropri­
ate calculation and fashioning the appropriate rem­
edy.” Id., at 268.
On remand, the District Court invited the parties to
submit remedial recommendations. Brief for Petitioners
14. The Plan Administrator proposed an approach that
would adjust respondents’ previous benefits distributions
by adding interest, and, as a fallback, the Administrator
suggested that the Plan should treat respondents as new
hires. Ante, at 3; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
