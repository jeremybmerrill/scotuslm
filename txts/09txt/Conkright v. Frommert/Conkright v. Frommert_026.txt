CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
BREYER, J., dissenting

conclusion is erroneous, as trust law imposes no such rigid
and inflexible requirement.
The Second Circuit found the Administrator’s interpre­
tation of the Plan to be arbitrary and capricious and in
violation of ERISA, and it made clear that the District
Court’s task on remand was to “craf[t]” a “remedy.” See
433 F. 3d, at 268. Trust law treatise writers say that in
these circumstances a court may (but need not) exercise its
own discretion rather than defer to a trustee’s interpreta­
tion of trust language. See G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of
Trusts and Trustees §560, pp. 222–223 (2d rev. ed. 1980)
(hereinafter Bogert & Bogert) (after finding an abuse of
discretion, a court may “decid[e] for the trustee how he
should act,” possibly by “stating the exact result” the court
“desires to achieve”); see also 2 Restatement (Third) of
Trusts §50, p. 258 (2001) (hereinafter Third Restatement)
(“A discretionary power conferred upon the trustee . . . is
subject to judicial control only to prevent misinterpreta­
tion or abuse of the discretion by the trustee”); 1 Restate­
ment (Second) of Trusts §187, p. 402 (1957) (hereinafter
Second Restatement) (“Where discretion is conferred upon
the trustee . . . , its exercise is not subject to control by the
court, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his
discretion”); see also Firestone, supra, at 111. Judges
deciding trust law cases have said the same. See, e.g.,
Colton v. Colton, 127 U. S. 300, 322 (1888) (stating that it
was the “duty of the court” to determine the trust pay­
ments due after rejecting the trustee’s interpretation);
State v. Rubion, 158 Tex. 43, 55, 308 S. W. 2d 4, 11 (1957)
(“Considering that we have held that there has already
been an abuse of discretion by the trustee . . . , we have
concluded that a remand of the case to the trial court for
the definite establishment of amounts to be paid will
better promote a speedy administration of justice and a
final termination of this litigation”); Glenn, supra, at ____
