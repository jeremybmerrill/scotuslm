BREYER, J., dissenting

6–7. The District Court rejected these suggestions and
concluded that the “appropriate” remedy was the one
suggested by the Second Circuit: no adjustment to the
prior distributions received by respondents.
472
F. Supp. 2d 452, 458 (WDNY 2007). The court stated that
this remedy was “straightforward; it adequately pre­
vent[ed] employees from receiving a windfall[;] and . . . it
most clearly reflect[ed] what a reasonable employee would
have anticipated based on the not-very-clear language in
the Plan.” Ibid. And the Court of Appeals, finding that
the District Court did not abuse its discretion in crafting a
remedy, affirmed. 535 F. 3d 111 (CA2 2008).

The third mistake, I believe, is the Court’s. As the
majority recognizes, ante, at 4, “principles of trust law”
guide this Court in “determining the appropriate stan­

administrator. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489
U. S. 101, 111–113 (1989); see also Metropolitan Life Ins.
Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 4);

(2004); Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pen
sion Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559, 570
(1985). And, as the majority also recognizes, ante, at 4,
where an ERISA plan grants an administrator the discre­
tionary authority to interpret plan terms, trust law re
quires a court to defer to the plan administrator’s inter­
pretation of plan terms. See, e.g., Glenn, supra, at ____
(slip op., at 4). But the majority further concludes that
trust law “does not resolve the specific issue before” the
Court in this case—i.e., whether a court is required to
defer to an administrator’s second attempt at interpreting
plan documents, even after the court has already deter­
mined that the administrator’s first attempt amounted to
an abuse of discretion. Ante, at 9. In my view, this final
