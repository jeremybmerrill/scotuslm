CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
Opinion of the Court

cover them only in broad strokes. This case concerns
Xerox Corporation’s pension plan, which is covered by
ERISA, 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §1001 et seq.
Petitioners are the plan itself (hereinafter Plan), and the
Plan’s current and former administrators (hereinafter
Plan Administrator). See §1002(16)(A)(i); App. 32a. Re
spondents are Xerox employees who left the company in
the 1980’s, received lump-sum distributions of retirement
benefits they had earned up to that point, and were later
rehired. See 328 F. Supp. 2d 420, 424 (WDNY 2004); Brief
for Respondents 9–10. The dispute giving rise to this case
concerns how to account for respondents’ past distribu
tions when calculating their current benefits—that is, how
to avoid paying respondents the same benefits twice.
The Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to
call for an approach that has come to be known as the
“phantom account” method. 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 424.
Essentially, that method calculated the hypothetical
growth that respondents’ past distributions would have
experienced if the money had remained in Xerox’s invest
ment funds, and reduced respondents’ present benefits
accordingly. See id., at 426–428; App. to Pet. for Cert.
146a. After the Plan Administrator denied respondents’
administrative challenges to that method, respondents
filed suit in federal court under ERISA, 29 U. S. C.
§1132(a)(1)(B). See 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 428–429. The
District Court granted summary judgment for the Plan,
applying a deferential standard of review to the Plan
Administrator’s interpretation. See id., at 430–431, 439.
The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding that
the Plan Administrator’s interpretation was unreasonable
and that respondents had not been adequately notified
that the phantom account method would be used to calcu
late their benefits. See 433 F. 3d 254, 257, 265–269
(2006).
The phantom account method having been exorcised
