CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
Opinion of the Court

111, 119 (2008).
Petitioners asked us to grant certiorari on two ques
tions: (1) whether the District Court owed deference to the
Plan Administrator’s interpretation of the Plan on re
mand, and (2) whether the Court of Appeals properly
granted deference to the District Court on the merits. Pet.
for Cert. i. We granted certiorari on both, 557 U. S. ___
(2009), but find it necessary to decide only the first.

A
This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the
decisions of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone, 489
U. S. 101. Because ERISA’s text does not directly resolve
the matter, we looked to “principles of trust law” for guid
ance. Id., at 109, 111. We recognized that, under trust
law, the proper standard of review of a trustee’s decision
depends on the language of the instrument creating the
trust. See id., at 111–112. If the trust documents give the
trustee “power to construe disputed or doubtful terms, . . .
the trustee’s interpretation will not be disturbed if reason
able.” Id., at 111. Based on these considerations, we held
that “a denial of benefits challenged under §1132(a)(1)(B)
is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the
benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discre
tionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to
construe the terms of the plan.” Id., at 115.
We expanded Firestone’s approach in Metropolitan Life
Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). In determining the
proper standard of review when a plan administrator
operates under a conflict of interest, we again looked to
trust law, the terms of the plan at issue, and the principles
of ERISA—plus, of course, our precedent in Firestone. See
554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4, 6–7, 9–10). We held that,
when the terms of a plan grant discretionary authority to
the plan administrator, a deferential standard of review
