BREYER, J., dissenting

(again, I simplify and use my own words):
First, when an employee initially leaves, she is paid a
lump-sum distribution equivalent to the benefits she has
accrued up to that point (i.e., the highest of her pension,
her cash account, or, if she was hired before the end of
1989, her investment account). See ante, at 2.
Second, when the employee returns, she again begins to
accrue amounts in her cash account, App. 40a–41a, start­
ing from scratch. (She accrues nothing in her investment
account, because Xerox no longer makes profit sharing
contributions. Id., at 34a.) Thus, by the time of her re­
tirement the employee may not have accrued much money
in this account.
Third, a rehired employee’s pension is calculated in the
way I have set forth above, with her entire tenure at Xerox
(both before her departure and after her return) taken into
account. See Brief for Petitioners 9–10.
Fourth, the employee’s benefits calculation is adjusted
to take account of the fact that the employee has already
received a lump-sum distribution from the Plan. See App.
32a; Brief for Petitioners 10–11.
This case is about the adjustment that takes place dur­
ing step four. It concerns the way in which the Plan Ad­
ministrator calculates that adjustment so as to reflect the
fact that a retiring leaving-and-returning employee has
already received a distribution when she initially left
Xerox. Before 1989, the Plan Administrator calculated the
adjusted amount by taking the benefits distribution previ­
ously received (say, $100,000) and adjusting it to equal the
amount that would have existed in the investment account
had no distribution been made. Ibid. Thus, if an employee
had not left Xerox, and if the $100,000 had been left in her
investment account for, say, 20 years, that amount would
likely have increased dramatically—perhaps doubling,
tripling, or quadrupling in amount, depending upon how
well the Plan’s investments performed.
