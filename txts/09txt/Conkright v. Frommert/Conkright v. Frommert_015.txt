CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT
Opinion of the Court

which would only further complicate ERISA proceedings.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 40–45.
This case also demonstrates the harm to the interest in
predictability that would result from stripping a plan
administrator of Firestone deference. After declining to
apply a deferential standard here, the District Court
adopted an interpretation of the Plan that does not ac
count for the time value of money. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at
458; 535 F. 3d, at 119. In the actuarial world, this is
heresy, and highly unforeseeable. Indeed, the actuaries
tell us that they have never encountered an ERISA plan
resembling this one that did not include some adjustment
for the time value of money. Brief for Chief Actuaries as
Amici Curiae 12.
Respondents’ own actuarial expert testified before the
District Court that fairness would require recognizing the
time value of money in some fashion. See App. 127a,
130a. And respondents and the Government do not dis
pute that the District Court’s approach, which does not
account for the fact that respondents were able to use
their past distributions as they saw fit for over 20 years,
would place respondents in a better position than employ
ees who never left the company. Cf. Brief for Respondents
42–43; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32–33.
Deference to plan administrators, who have a duty to all
beneficiaries to preserve limited plan assets, see Varity
Corp., 516 U. S., at 514, helps prevent such windfalls for
particular employees.
Finally, this case demonstrates the uniformity problems
that arise from creating ad hoc exceptions to Firestone
deference. If other courts were to adopt an interpretation
of the Plan that does account for the time value of money,
Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation. Similar
Xerox employees could be entitled to different benefits
depending on where they live, or perhaps where they bring
a legal action. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1132(e)(2) (permitting suit
