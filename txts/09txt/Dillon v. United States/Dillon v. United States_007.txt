DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

unaffected.” §1B1.10(b)(1).1 Under §3582(c)(2), a court
may then grant a reduction within the amended Guide
lines range if it determines that one is warranted “after
considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the
extent that they are applicable.”2 Except in limited cir
cumstances, however, §1B1.10(b)(2)(A) forecloses a court
acting under §3582(c)(2) from reducing a sentence “to a
term that is less than the minimum of the amended guide
line range.”
II
A jury convicted petitioner Percy Dillon in 1993 of con
spiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to
distribute more than 500 grams of powder cocaine and
more than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21
U. S. C. §846, possession with the intent to distribute
more than 500 grams of powder cocaine in violation of
§841(a)(1), and use of a firearm during and in relation to a
drug-trafficking offense in violation of 18 U. S. C.
§924(c)(1). Dillon’s convictions exposed him to a statutory
sentencing range of 10 years to life for the conspiracy, 5
to-40 years for cocaine possession, and a mandatory mini
mum sentence of 5 years for the firearm offense, to be
served consecutively to the sentence for the drug offenses.

1 The Sentencing Commission substantially revised §1B1.10 in March
2008, see USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 712 (Nov. 2009) (effective Mar. 3,
2008), roughly three months before the District Court’s decision in this
case. Because the current version of the relevant Guidelines provisions
is not meaningfully different from the version in effect at the time of
the District Court’s decision, references in this opinion are to the
current, 2009 edition of the Guidelines.
2 Section 3553(a) provides that a “court shall impose a sentence suffi
cient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set
forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,” and it enumerates several
factors a court “shall consider” in determining an appropriate sentence,
including “the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history
and characteristics of the defendant,” §3553(a)(1).
