DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Commission. The relevant policy statement instructs that
a court proceeding under §3582(c)(2) “shall substitute” the
amended Guidelines range for the initial range “and shall
leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.”
§1B1.10(b)(1). Because the aspects of his sentence that
Dillon seeks to correct were not affected by the Commis
sion’s amendment to §2D1.1, they are outside the scope of
the proceeding authorized by §3582(c)(2), and the District
Court properly declined to address them.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is
Affirmed.
JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the decision of this case.
