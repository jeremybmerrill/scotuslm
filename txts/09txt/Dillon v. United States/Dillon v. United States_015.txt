DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Hicks, 472 F. 3d 1167, 1170 (2007).6 Relying on our rejec
tion in Booker of a remedy that would have made the
Guidelines advisory only in certain cases—namely, when
treating them as binding would run afoul of the Sixth
Amendment, see 543 U. S., at 265–267—the Ninth Circuit
held that Booker precludes treating the Guidelines as
mandatory for purposes of §3582(c)(2) and advisory in
other contexts, see Hicks, 472 F. 3d, at 1171–1172.
This argument is unpersuasive. The incomplete remedy
we rejected in Booker would have required courts to treat
the Guidelines differently in similar proceedings, leading
potentially to unfair results and considerable administra
tive challenges. See 543 U. S., at 266. As already ex
plained, the sentence-modification proceedings authorized
by §3582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other
sentencing proceedings. Given the substantially different
purpose of §3582(c)(2) and the circumscribed nature of
proceedings under that section, requiring courts to honor
§1B1.10(b)(2)’s instruction not to depart from the amended
Guidelines range at such proceedings will create none of
the confusion or unfairness that led us in Booker to reject
the Government’s argument for a partial fix.
The dissent’s contrary conclusion rests on two erroneous
premises. First, the dissent ignores the fundamental
differences between sentencing and sentence-modification
proceedings and asserts without explanation that
“[n]othing turns on” the distinction between them. Post,
at 11. For the reasons stated above, the statutory differ
ences between the proceedings are highly significant.
Second, the dissent gives short shrift to the fact that,
after Booker, the Commission retains at least some au

Ninth Circuit subsequently agreed to consider en banc Booker’s
applicability to §3582(c)(2) proceedings. See United States v. Fox, 583
F. 3d 596 (2009). The matter was stayed pending our decision in this
case. No. 08–30445 (CA9, Dec. 8, 2009).
