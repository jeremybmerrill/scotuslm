DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

under §3582(c)(2) to impose a term “comparably” below the
amended range. §1B1.10(b)(2)(B).
At step two of the inquiry, §3582(c)(2) instructs a court
to consider any applicable §3553(a) factors and determine
whether, in its discretion, the reduction authorized by
reference to the policies relevant at step one is warranted
in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of
the case. Because reference to §3553(a) is appropriate
only at the second step of this circumscribed inquiry, it
cannot serve to transform the proceedings under
§3582(c)(2) into plenary resentencing proceedings.
This understanding of §3582(c)(2) as a narrow exception
to the rule of finality finds further support outside the
statute. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 requires
that a defendant be present at “sentencing,” see Rule
43(a)(3), but it excludes from that requirement proceed
ings that “involv[e] the correction or reduction of sentence
under Rule 35 or 18 U. S. C. §3582(c),” Rule 43(b)(4). Like
§3582(c)(2), Rule 35 delineates a limited set of circum
stances in which a sentence may be corrected or reduced.
Specifically, it authorizes a court to “correct a sentence
that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear
error” within 14 days after sentencing, Rule 35(a), and it
authorizes a reduction for substantial assistance on the
Government’s motion, Rule 35(b). Rule 43 therefore sets
the proceedings authorized by §3582(c)(2) and Rule 35
apart from other sentencing proceedings.
B
Given the limited scope and purpose of §3582(c)(2), we
conclude that proceedings under that section do not impli
cate the interests identified in Booker. Notably, the sen
tence-modification proceedings authorized by §3582(c)(2)
are not constitutionally compelled. We are aware of no
constitutional requirement of retroactivity that entitles
defendants sentenced to a term of imprisonment to the
