PERCY DILLON, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[June 17, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
When sentencing petitioner Percy Dillon for crack co­
caine-related offenses in 1993, the District Court stated
that the punishment Dillon received was “entirely too high
for the crime [he] committed.” App. 13. Bound by a sen­
tencing regime that was mandatory at the time, the judge
had no choice but to sentence Dillon to 322 months of
imprisonment—nearly 27 years behind bars. The judge
later explained that, were it within his discretion, he
would have sentenced Dillon to 5 years of imprisonment.
Id., at 62. Had Dillon been sentenced after our decision in
United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), the judge
would have had that discretion. Instead, the District
Court was compelled to mete out a punishment that it
believed to be grossly disproportionate to the offense and,
therefore, “greater than necessary” to meet the goals of
our criminal justice system, 18 U. S. C. §3553(a).
The punishment Dillon received was so high, in part,
because at the time of his conviction our drug laws pun­
ished crack cocaine offenses 100 times more severely than
powder cocaine offenses. In 2007, as the Court explains,

(Commission) proposed a partial fix to this disparity,
lowering its Guidelines Manual1 ranges for crack cocaine
