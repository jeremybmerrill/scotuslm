DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus
stead, §3582(c)(2) authorizes only a limited adjustment to an other
wise final sentence. This conclusion is further supported by the sub
stantial role Congress gave the Commission with respect to sentence
modification proceedings, charging it with determining whether and
to what extent a Guidelines amendment will be retroactive, 28
U. S. C. §994(u), and authorizing a court to grant a reduction under
§3582(c)(2) only “if [it] is consistent with applicable policy statements
issued by the Sentencing Commission.” Section 3582(c)(2) estab
lishes a two-step inquiry: A court must (1) determine the scope of the
reduction, if any, authorized by §1B1.10, and then (2) consider
whether the authorized reduction is warranted according to the ap
plicable §3553(a) factors. At step one, the court must follow the
Commission’s instructions in §1B1.10 to impose a term of imprison
ment within the amended Guidelines range unless the sentencing
court originally imposed a below-Guidelines sentence. §1B1.10(b)(2).
Because reference to §3553(a) is appropriate only at step two, that
provision does not transform §3582(c)(2) proceedings into plenary re
sentencing proceedings. Pp. 6–10.
(b) Given §3582(c)(2)’s limited scope and purpose, proceedings un
der that section do not implicate Booker. The section represents a
congressional act of lenity intended to give prisoners the benefit of
later enacted adjustments to the judgments reflected in the Guide
lines. Taking the original sentence as given, any facts found by a
judge at a §3582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the pre
scribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only the judge’s ex
ercise of discretion within that range. That exercise does not contra
vene the Sixth Amendment, even if it is informed by judge-found
facts. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481. Thus, Dillon’s
Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District Court’s
adherence to §1B1.10’s instruction to consider a reduction only within
the amended Guidelines range. Dillon’s argument that Booker’s re
medial opinion nonetheless requires the Guidelines to be treated as
advisory in such proceedings is unpersuasive given that proceedings
under §3582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other sentencing
proceedings. Pp. 10–13.
(c) Also rejected is Dillon’s argument that the District Court should
have corrected other mistakes in his original sentence, namely, a
Booker error resulting from the initial sentencing court’s treatment of
the Guidelines as mandatory and an alleged error in the calculation
of his criminal-history category. Because those aspects of Dillon’s
sentence were not affected by the crack-cocaine Guidelines amend
ment, they are outside the scope of the §3582(c)(2) proceeding, and
the District Court properly declined to address them. Pp. 13–14.

572 F. 3d 146, affirmed.
