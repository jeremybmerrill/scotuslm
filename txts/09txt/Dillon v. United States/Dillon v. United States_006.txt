Opinion of the Court

departures. 543 U. S., at 259. “With these two sections
excised (and statutory cross-references to the two sections
consequently invalidated),” we held that “the remainder of
the Act satisfies the Court’s constitutional requirements.”
Ibid. Booker thus left intact other provisions of the SRA,
including those giving the Commission authority to revise
the Guidelines, 28 U. S. C. §994(o) (2006 ed.), and to de
termine when and to what extent a revision will be retro
active, §994(u).
With respect to drug-trafficking offenses, the Sentencing
Guidelines establish a defendant’s base offense level ac
cording to the type and weight of the drug. See USSG
§§2D1.1(a), (c). When the Commission first promulgated
the Guidelines in 1987, it adopted the 100-to-1 ratio se
lected by Congress in setting mandatory minimum sen
tences in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207.
Under that framework, the Commission “treated every
gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of
powder cocaine.” Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.
85, 96 (2007). The Commission later sought to alleviate
the disparity produced by this ratio. After several failed
attempts at reform, see id., at 99, the Commission in 2007
amended the Guidelines to reduce by two levels the base
offense level associated with each quantity of crack co
caine. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (effective Nov.
1, 2007). In 2008, the Commission made that amendment
retroactive. See id., Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).
When the Commission makes a Guidelines amendment
retroactive, 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2) authorizes a district
court to reduce an otherwise final sentence that is based
on the amended provision. Any reduction must be consis
tent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sen
tencing Commission.
The relevant policy statement,
USSG §1B1.10, instructs courts proceeding under
§3582(c)(2) to substitute the amended Guidelines range
while “leav[ing] all other guideline application decisions
