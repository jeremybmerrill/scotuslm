DILLON v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 09–6338. Argued March 30, 2010—Decided June 17, 2010
In 1993, petitioner Dillon was convicted of, inter alia, crack and powder
cocaine offenses, which produced a base offense level of 38 and a
Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months’ imprisonment. The court
sentenced him at the bottom of the range for those counts. After the
Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the base
offense level associated with each quantity of crack cocaine, USSG
Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706, and made that amendment retroactive,
USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 713, Dillon moved for a sentence reduc
tion under 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2). That provision authorizes a
district court to reduce an otherwise final sentence pursuant to a
Guidelines amendment if a reduction is consistent with the Commis
sion’s policy statements. The relevant policy statement, USSG
§1B1.10, precludes a court from reducing a sentence “to a term that is
less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range” except in
limited circumstances. In addition to the two-level reduction author
ized by the amendment, Dillon sought a variance below the amended
Guidelines range, contending that United States v. Booker, 543 U. S.
220, authorized the exercise of such discretion. The District Court
imposed a sentence at the bottom of the revised range but declined to
grant a further reduction. Finding Booker inapplicable to §3582(c)(2)
proceedings, the court concluded that the Commission’s directives in
§1B1.10 constrained it to impose a sentence within the amended
Guidelines range. The Third Circuit affirmed.
Held: Booker’s holdings do not apply to §3582(c)(2) proceedings and
therefore do not require treating §1B1.10(b) as advisory. Pp. 6–14.
(a) The statute’s text and narrow scope belie Dillon’s characteriza
tion of proceedings under §3582(c)(2) as “resentencing” proceedings
governed by the same principles as other sentencing proceedings. In
