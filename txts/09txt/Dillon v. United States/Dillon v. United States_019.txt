DILLON v. UNITED STATES
STEVENS, J., dissenting

offenses to a 20:1 ratio. See United States Sentencing
Commission, Guidelines Manual Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706
(Nov. 2009) (USSG) (effective Nov. 1, 2007). Pursuant to
its congressional mandate, see 28 U. S. C. §994(u), the
Commission made this change retroactive for those indi­
viduals, like Dillon, who were still serving sentences for
crack cocaine offenses. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt.

Although Dillon does not have a constitutional right to
obtain the benefit of the Commission’s change, it is undis­

3553(a),” and only “if such a reduction is consistent with
applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing
Commission.” Dillon sought such relief. His 322-month
sentence was reduced to a 270-month sentence—still 17½
years more than the sentencing judge thought necessary
as an initial matter.
In his §3582(c)(2) proceeding, Dillon alleged that his
circumstances warranted an additional reduction in light
of the fact that his sentence was “greater than necessary”
to effectuate the goals of our sentencing system, §3553(a).
He also emphasized that he has been a model inmate
during his 17 years in federal prison. Once again, how­
ever, the District Court felt that its hands were tied, this

guidelines, see 28 U. S. C. §994(a)(1), and policy statements, see
§944(a)(2). I use “Guidelines” in this opinion to refer to both the guide­
lines as described in §994(a)(1), as well as more generally to all of the
provisions in the Guidelines Manual. The section numbers of both
types of provisions are enumerated identically within the Commission’s
Guidelines Manual, but their effects, as discussed in more detail herein,
are different.
