DILLON v. UNITED STATES
STEVENS, J., dissenting

dant’s term of imprisonment under 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2)
and this policy statement to a term that is less than the
minimum of the amended guideline range determined”
under the new range. §1B1.10(b)(2)(A). In other words,
the Commission told federal courts that its Guidelines, at
least in §3582(c)(2) proceedings, remain mandatory and
binding.
Had the Commission taken it upon itself, by issuance of
a general policy statement, to make its Guidelines manda­

either strike down such an act on separation-of-powers
grounds or apply the same remedy we did in Booker to
render the statement advisory. It makes little difference,
in my view, that the Commission has only rejected the
Booker remedy in this single procedure. The encroach­
ment is the same, if only more subtle. Any legislative
response to Booker was a decision for Congress to make—
not the Commission.

Separate from the arguments noted above, the Court’s
decision today may reflect a concern that a contrary hold­

active amendments to the Guidelines, owing to a fear of
burdening the district courts. In what might be described
as a subtle threat, the Commission has highlighted this
point in its amicus brief supporting the Government. The
brief explains that holding for Dillon would introduce
uncertainty into the Commission’s “assessments about the
effects of retroactivity decisions,” making these decisions
“very difficult” and “weigh[ing] against making Guideline
amendments retroactive in the future.” Brief for United
