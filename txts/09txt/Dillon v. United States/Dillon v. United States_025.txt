DILLON v. UNITED STATES
STEVENS, J., dissenting

of the statute, and conclude that Congress would have
preferred the latter. We then compare our own rem­
edy to the total invalidation of the statute, and con­
clude that Congress would have preferred our rem­
edy.” 543 U. S., at 249.
Thus, rather than “maintaining the Act as written with
jury factfinding added,” ibid., the Court opted to alter the
Commission’s power in a more fundamental way: It did
away with a fixed, determinate sentencing regime based
on mandatory Guidelines. Henceforth the Commission
would guide and advise federal courts in the exercise of
their sentencing authority. But the Commission would
not bind.
The Court held as follows:
“We answer the question of remedy by finding the
provision of the federal sentencing statute that makes
the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1)
(Supp. IV), incompatible with today’s constitutional
holding. We conclude that this provision must be sev­
ered and excised, as must one other statutory section,
§3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which depends upon
the Guidelines’ mandatory nature. So modified, the
federal sentencing statute, see Sentencing Reform Act
of 1984 (Sentencing Act), as amended, 18 U. S. C.
§3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. §991 et seq., makes the
Guidelines effectively advisory. It requires a sentenc­
ing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 18 U.S.C.
§3553(a)(4) (Supp. IV), but it permits the court to tai­
lor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as
well, see §3553(a).” Id., at 245–246.
The only fair way to read the Booker majority’s remedy
is that it eliminated the mandatory features of the Guide­
lines—all of them.4 It is true that the Court explicitly
