STEVENS, J., dissenting

time because USSG §1B1.10(b)(2) purports to place a
mandatory limit on the extent of any sentence reduction
that a court may order pursuant to §3582(c)(2). And so,
giving the Commission’s statement the effect of law, the
District Court denied Dillon further relief.
Today, the Court holds that in this one limited nook of
sentencing law, the Commission retains the power to bind
judges that we struck down in Booker. In my view, the
Court’s decision to treat the Commission’s policy state­

recommendation is unfaithful to Booker. It is also on
dubious constitutional footing, as it permits the Commis­

authority. And it is manifestly unjust. I would therefore
hold that in the context of a §3582(c)(2) sentence modifica­

not bound by, any applicable policy statements promul­
gated by the Commission. In other words, I would apply
Booker’s remedial holding to §3582(c)(2) proceedings.

Court did not excise any portion of §3582 when crafting its
remedy. At the time, there was nothing in §3582(c)(2)—
separate and apart from the Guidelines’ general manda­

discretion in a §3582(c)(2) proceeding. There was, conse­
quently, nothing that needed excising. Relief under
§3582(c)(2) is available if it is “consistent with” the Com­
mission’s related policy statement. And when we decided
Booker, the particular policy statement at issue,
