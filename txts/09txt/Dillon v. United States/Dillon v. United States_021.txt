DILLON v. UNITED STATES
STEVENS, J., dissenting

§1B1.10(b), had no explicit binding effect.2
Prior to our decision in Booker, the Guidelines were
mandatory only by virtue of congressional mandate, and
not by virtue of Commission decree. See 18 U. S. C.
§3553(b)(1). Following Booker, the Commission’s policy
statement in §1B1.10 took effect in March 2008. That
statement, I will explain more fully in Part II, infra, is
now the only source of binding authority in §3582(c)(2)
proceedings, as it purports to have the effect of reinstating
a mandatory Guidelines regime within the context of a
sentence modification proceeding. It is now the Commis­
sion’s policy statement, and not an explicit congressional
mandate, that makes the Guidelines ranges binding under
§3582(c)(2).
As a matter of textual analysis, divorced from judicial
precedent, it is certainly reasonable for the Court to find
that the Commission can set mandatory limits on sentence
reductions under §3582(c)(2). But it is a mistake, in my
view, to take such a narrow approach to the question
presented by this case. The Court has turned a blind eye
to the fundamental sea-change that was our decision in
Booker.

2 From 1989 to 1994, the policy statement in §1B1.10 also contained
what could be described fairly as a limitation on the “amount” of an
available sentence reduction. See USSG §1B1.10(c)(2) (Nov. 1990) (“[A]
reduction in a defendant’s term of imprisonment . . . may, in no event,
exceed the number of months by which the maximum of the guideline
range applicable to the defendant . . . has been lowered”). In 1994, as
part of Amendment 504 to the Guidelines Manual, the Commission
deleted this provision, explaining that this “rather complex subsection”
was an “unnecessary restriction on the court’s consideration of a
revised sentence.” USSG, App. C, Amdt. 504 (effective Nov. 1, 1994).
Later, in an “Application Note,” the Commission indicated that “the
amended guideline range” “limit[s] the extent to which an eligible
defendant’s sentence may be reduced.” Id., Amdt. 548 (effective Nov. 1,
1997). The bottom line is that it was the Guidelines’ mandatory nature,
and not the effect of a policy statement, that made the Guidelines
ranges binding in an 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2) proceeding.
