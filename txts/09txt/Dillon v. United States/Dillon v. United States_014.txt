Opinion of the Court

benefit of subsequent Guidelines amendments. Rather,
§3582(c)(2) represents a congressional act of lenity in
tended to give prisoners the benefit of later enacted ad
justments to the judgments reflected in the Guidelines.
Viewed that way, proceedings under §3582(c)(2) do not
implicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential
facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Taking
the original sentence as given, any facts found by a judge
at a §3582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the
prescribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only
the judge’s exercise of discretion within that range.
“[J]udges in this country have long exercised discretion of
this nature in imposing sentence within [established]
limits in the individual case,” and the exercise of such
discretion does not contravene the Sixth Amendment even
if it is informed by judge-found facts. Apprendi v. New
Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481 (2000) (emphasis in original).
Because §3582(c)(2) proceedings give judges no more than
this circumscribed discretion, “[t]here is no encroachment
here by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury,
nor any threat to the jury’s domain as a bulwark at trial
between the State and the accused.” Oregon v. Ice, 555
U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8). Accordingly, Dillon’s
Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District
Court’s adherence to the instruction in §1B1.10 to consider
a reduction only within the amended Guidelines range.
Dillon contends that, even if §3582(c)(2) does not impli
cate the constitutional rights vindicated in Booker—
something the dissent appears to concede—the remedial
aspect of the Court’s decision applies to proceedings under
that section and requires that the Guidelines be treated as
advisory in such proceedings just as they are in other
sentencing proceedings. In support of his position, Dillon
invokes the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning in United States v.
