DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Dillon contended that a variance from the amended Guide
lines range was warranted in his case. He further urged
that, after Booker, the court was authorized to grant such
a variance because the amended Guidelines range was
advisory notwithstanding any contrary statement in
§1B1.10.
The District Court reduced Dillon’s sentence to 270
months—the term at the bottom of the revised Guidelines
range.4 But the court declined to go further. Concluding
that the sentencing proceedings at issue in Booker are
readily distinguishable from those under §3582(c)(2), the
court found Booker’s holdings inapplicable to the instant
proceeding and accordingly held that it lacked authority to
impose a sentence inconsistent with §1B1.10.
The Third Circuit affirmed. 572 F. 3d 146, 150 (2009).
The court noted that §3582(c)(2) is codified in a different
section than the provisions invalidated in Booker and
contains no cross-reference to those provisions. Finding
no other indication that Booker “obviate[d] the congres
sional directive in §3582(c)(2) that a sentence reduction
pursuant to that section be consistent with Sentencing
Commission policy statements,” 572 F. 3d, at 149, the
Third Circuit held that §1B1.10 is binding. It therefore
agreed that the District Court lacked authority to reduce
Dillon’s sentence below the amended Guidelines range.
We granted certiorari to consider Booker’s applicability
to §3582(c)(2) proceedings. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).
