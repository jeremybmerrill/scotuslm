DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

“reduce” an otherwise final sentence in circumstances
specified by the Commission.
Compare 28 U. S. C.
§994(a)(2)(C) (referring to §3582(c)(2) as a “sentence modi
fication provisio[n]”), with 18 U. S. C. §3742(f) (authoriz
ing courts of appeals to remand “for further sentencing”
upon a finding of error), and §3742(g) (establishing the
terms of “sentencing upon remand” and describing the
proceeding as a “resentenc[ing]” (capitalization omitted)).
It is also notable that the provision applies only to a lim
ited class of prisoners—namely, those whose sentence was
based on a sentencing range subsequently lowered by the
Commission. Section 3582(c)(2)’s text, together with its
narrow scope, shows that Congress intended to authorize
only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence
and not a plenary resentencing proceeding.
The substantial role Congress gave the Commission
with respect to sentence-modification proceedings further
supports this conclusion. The SRA charges the Commis
sion both with deciding whether to amend the Guidelines,
§994(o), and with determining whether and to what extent
an amendment will be retroactive, §994(u).5 A court’s
power under §3582(c)(2) thus depends in the first instance
on the Commission’s decision not just to amend the Guide
lines but to make the amendment retroactive. The court is
also constrained by the Commission’s statements dictating
“by what amount” the sentence of a prisoner serving a
term of imprisonment affected by the amendment “may be
reduced.” §994(u); see also Braxton v. United States, 500
U. S. 344, 348 (1991) (noting that the Commission imple
mented that power through §1B1.10).
Read in this context, §3582(c)(2)’s reference to §3553(a)

5 We

do not respond to the dissent’s separation-of-powers discussion,
see post, at 11–16 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), as that issue is not fairly
encompassed within the questions presented and was not briefed by the
parties.
