STEVENS, J., dissenting

relief for the defendants in Booker, or to apply the Guide­
lines in a mandatory fashion in future cases—so long as
juries were allowed to decide the factual issues raised by
requests for enhanced sentences. See id., at 272–303
(STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). Notwithstanding the
fact that the Court could have retained the Guidelines’
mandatory prescriptive effect in a manner consonant with
the jury-trial right, the Court nevertheless adopted a
broad remedy that recast the Guidelines in their entirety.
That change did not respond to a determination that the
mandatory Guidelines regime itself violated the Sixth
Amendment. Neither my opinion for the Court with re­
spect to our constitutional holding, nor JUSTICE BREYER’s
remedial opinion, contained any such determination.
Instead, the Court’s decision to make the Guidelines dis­
cretionary rested entirely on the majority’s judgment that
Congress would have preferred that result to either an
increase in the jury’s role in making factual findings or a
decision invalidating the entire regime. Id., at 249. When
Congress was wrestling with the Sentencing Reform Act of
1984, it did not foresee Apprendi, Ring, and Blakely. The
Court made a policy-based prediction that, were Congress
to have had such foresight, it would not have elected—in
any respect—a mandatory sentencing regime.
The Court openly acknowledged this methodology:
“In essence, in what follows, we explain both (1) why
Congress would likely have preferred the total invali­
dation of the Act to an Act with the Court’s Sixth
Amendment requirement engrafted onto it, and (2)
why Congress would likely have preferred the excision
of some of the Act, namely the Act’s mandatory lan­
guage, to the invalidation of the entire Act. That is to
say, in light of today’s holding, we compare maintain­
ing the Act as written with jury factfinding added (the
dissenters’ proposed remedy) to the total invalidation
