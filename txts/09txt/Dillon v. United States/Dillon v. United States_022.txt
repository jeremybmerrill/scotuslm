STEVENS, J., dissenting

It is useful to put Booker in context. During the delib­
erations that led to the enactment of the Sentencing Re­
form Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. §3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C.
§991, et seq., Congress considered—and rejected—a pro­
posal that would have made the Guidelines only advisory.
See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 387 (1989).
Ultimately, the decision to authorize the Commission to
issue rules that “have the force and effect of laws” gener­
ated a serious debate over the constitutionality of the
Commission itself. See id., at 413 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
While we resolved that constitutional debate in the
Commission’s favor in Mistretta, it became apparent dur­
ing the next two decades that the mandatory character of
the Guidelines, coupled with the practice of judicial fact­
finding, not only produced a host of excessively severe
sentences but also created an unacceptable risk of depriv­
ing defendants of long-settled constitutional protections.
See, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490
(2000) (holding that “[o]ther than the fact of a prior convic­
tion, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond
the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a
jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt”); Ring v.
Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 602 (2002) (holding that “[i]f a
State makes an increase in a defendant’s authorized pun­
ishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact—no
matter how the State labels it—must be found by a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt”); Blakely v. Washington, 542
U. S. 296, 304 (2004) (holding that “[w]hen a judge inflicts
punishment that the jury’s verdict alone does not allow,
the jury has not found all the facts ‘which the law makes
essential to the punishment,’ and the judge exceeds his
proper authority” (citation omitted)).
Over a series of cases, we arrived at our present under­
standing of determinate sentencing schemes: They are
constitutionally infirm if they mandate enhanced punish­
ments based on facts found only by a judge by a prepon­
