DILLON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

not demand that result.
I
The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA or Act), 98
Stat. 1987, established the Sentencing Commission and
authorized it to promulgate Sentencing Guidelines and to
issue policy statements regarding the Guidelines’ applica
tion. See 28 U. S. C. §§991, 994(a). The Act also charged
the Commission with periodically reviewing and revising
the Guidelines. See §994(o). When a revision reduces the
Guidelines range for a given offense, the Commission must
determine “in what circumstances and by what amount
the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment
for the offense may be reduced.” §994(u).
As enacted, the SRA made the Sentencing Guidelines
binding. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 233–234. Except in
limited circumstances, district courts lacked discretion to
depart from the Guidelines range. See Burns v. United
States, 501 U. S. 129, 133 (1991). Under that regime, facts
found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence often
increased the mandatory Guidelines range and permitted
the judge to impose a sentence greater than that sup
ported by the facts established by the jury verdict or guilty
plea. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 235. We held in Booker
that treating the Guidelines as mandatory in these cir
cumstances violated the Sixth Amendment right of crimi
nal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every
element of an offense proved by the Government beyond a
reasonable doubt. Id., at 243–244.
To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the
Guidelines advisory by invalidating two provisions of the
SRA: 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which
generally required a sentencing court to impose a sentence
within the applicable Guidelines range, and §3742(e)
(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the standard of
review on appeal, including de novo review of Guidelines
