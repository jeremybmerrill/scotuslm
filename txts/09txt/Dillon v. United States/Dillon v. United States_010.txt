Opinion of the Court

stances. §3582(b). Section 3582(c)(2) establishes an ex
ception to the general rule of finality “in the case of a
defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprison
ment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently
been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to
28 U. S. C. §994(o)” and made retroactive pursuant to
§994(u). In such cases, Congress has authorized courts to
“reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the
factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they
are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with appli
cable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commis
sion.” §3582(c)(2).
Characterizing proceedings under §3582(c)(2) as “resen
tencing” proceedings, Dillon contends that “[t]here is no
practical or functional difference between a resentencing
pursuant to §3582(c)(2) and any other resentencing.” Brief
for Petitioner 18. Accordingly, Dillon urges, the same
principles that govern other sentencing proceedings like
wise govern §3582(c)(2) proceedings, and courts have
authority under §3582(c)(2) to vary from the revised
Guidelines range consistent with §3553(a), see
Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 101. Dillon cites as support for
this view §3582(c)(2)’s instruction to consider the factors
in §3553(a) in determining whether a sentence reduction
is warranted. Under Dillon’s approach, Booker would
preclude the Commission from issuing a policy statement
that generally forecloses below-Guidelines sentences at
§3582(c)(2) proceedings, as USSG §1B1.10 purports to do.
Dillon thus asks us to excise the mandatory language of
§1B1.10(b)(2)(A) and treat that provision as advisory, just
as we did the offending statutory provisions in Booker.
The language of §3582(c)(2) belies Dillon’s characteriza
tion of proceedings under that section. By its terms,
§3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentenc
ing proceeding. Instead, it provides for the “modif[ication
of] a term of imprisonment” by giving courts the power to
