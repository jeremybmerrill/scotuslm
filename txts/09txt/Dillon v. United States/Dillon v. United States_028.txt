STEVENS, J., dissenting

on whether the proceeding is best understood as a resen­
tencing or as a sentence modification procedure. Nor is it
relevant that Dillon has no right to be present at a pro­
ceeding under §3582(c)(2), ante, at 9–10, or that a sentence
reduction proceeding may not be “constitutionally com­
pelled,” ante, at 10–11. The Court’s general reliance on
Booker in this case, see ante, at 11–12, is odd because the
Booker Court explained its belief “that Congress would not
have authorized a mandatory system in some cases and a
nonmandatory system in others,” 543 U. S., at 266. Yet,
this is precisely the system the Court approves today.
Approaching this case as the Booker Court did, one must
ask whether it is likely that a fully informed Congress
would have created this kind of Commission: one endowed
with vast responsibilities for drafting advisory Guidelines
and policy statements, but also with the tiniest sliver of
lawmaking power to tie the hands of a district court’s
exercise of grace under §3582(c)(2). I think the answer is
obvious.

My understanding of the scope of the Booker remedy is
reinforced by an additional consideration: The Commis­
sion’s policy statement, to which the Court today allows
binding effect, may exceed the scope of the Commission’s
powers. No one disputes that Congress could have re­
jected the Court’s remedial holding in Booker if it so
wished. Instead, it is the Commission that has rejected
Booker’s application to §3582(c)(2), by purporting to give
mandatory force to its own policy statement. That action
presses the bounds of the authority Congress validly gave
the Commission in 1984, for it is not clear that Congress
has authorized the Commission to create this type of
policy statement or to circumvent a decision such as
Booker on its own accord.
We have been quite permissive of congressional delega­
