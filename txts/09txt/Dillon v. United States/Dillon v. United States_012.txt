Opinion of the Court

does not undermine our narrow view of proceedings under
the former provision. Section 3582(c)(2) instructs a dis
trict court to “conside[r] the factors set forth in section
3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,” but it
authorizes a reduction on that basis only “if such a reduc
tion is consistent with applicable policy statements issued
by the Sentencing Commission”—namely, §1B1.10. The
statute thus establishes a two-step inquiry. A court must
first determine that a reduction is consistent with §1B1.10
before it may consider whether the authorized reduction is
warranted, either in whole or in part, according to the
factors set forth in §3553(a).
Following this two-step approach, a district court pro
ceeding under §3582(c)(2) does not impose a new sentence
in the usual sense. At step one, §3582(c)(2) requires the
court to follow the Commission’s instructions in §1B1.10 to
determine the prisoner’s eligibility for a sentence modifi
cation and the extent of the reduction authorized. Specifi
cally, §1B1.10(b)(1) requires the court to begin by “deter
min[ing] the amended guideline range that would have
been applicable to the defendant” had the relevant
amendment been in effect at the time of the initial sen
tencing. “In making such determination, the court shall
substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for
the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied
when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all
other guideline application decisions unaffected.” Ibid.
Consistent with the limited nature of §3582(c)(2) pro
ceedings, §1B1.10(b)(2) also confines the extent of the
reduction authorized. Courts generally may “not reduce
the defendant’s term of imprisonment under 18 U. S. C.
§3582(c)(2) . . . to a term that is less than the minimum of
the amended guideline range” produced by the substitu
tion. §1B1.10(b)(2)(A). Only if the sentencing court origi
nally imposed a term of imprisonment below the Guide
lines range does §1B1.10 authorize a court proceeding
