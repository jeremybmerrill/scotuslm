Opinion of the Court

review of administrative action” is “well-settled,” Catholic
Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 63–64 (quoting McNary,
498 U. S., at 496), the Court assumes that “Congress
legislates with knowledge of” the presumption, id., at 496.
It therefore takes “clear and convincing evidence” to dis
lodge the presumption. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509
U. S., at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is
no such evidence here.
Finally, we stress a paramount factor in the decision we
render today. By defining the various jurisdictional bars
by reference to other provisions in the INA itself, Congress
ensured that it, and only it, would limit the federal courts’
jurisdiction. To read §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to matters
where discretion is conferred on the Board by regulation,
rather than on the Attorney General by statute, would
ignore that congressional design. If the Seventh Circuit’s
construction of §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) were to prevail, the Ex
ecutive would have a free hand to shelter its own decisions
from abuse-of-discretion appellate court review simply by
issuing a regulation declaring those decisions “discretion
ary.” Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can
not be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.

A statute affecting federal jurisdiction “must be con
strued both with precision and with fidelity to the terms
by which Congress has expressed its wishes.” Cheng Fan
Kwok v. INS, 392 U. S. 206, 212 (1968). As we have noted,
see supra, at 14, and as amicus emphasizes, “many provi
sions of IIRIRA [we]re aimed at protecting [from court
review exercises of] the Executive’s discretion.” AmericanArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S., at 486 (em
phasis deleted). But “no law pursues its purpose at all
costs, and . . . the textual limitations upon a law’s scope
are no less a part of its ‘purpose’ than its substantive
authorizations.” Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715,
