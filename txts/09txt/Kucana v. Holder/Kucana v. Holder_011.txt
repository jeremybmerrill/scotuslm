Opinion of the Court

to reopen removal proceedings dates back to at least 1916.
See Dada, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9–10) (citing
cases). This Court has ultimately reviewed reopening
decisions on numerous occasions. See, e.g., INS v. Do
herty, 502 U. S. 314, 322–324 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485
U. S. 94, 104–111 (1988); INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U. S.
444, 449–452 (1985); INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U. S. 139,
141–146 (1981) (per curiam). Mindful of the Board’s
“broad discretion” in such matters, however, courts have
employed a deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of
review. See Doherty, 502 U. S., at 323 (internal quotation
marks omitted).
The Seventh Circuit held that Congress removed the
authority long exercised by federal courts to review deni
als of an alien’s reopening request. Congress did so, the
Court of Appeals said, in §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which removes
jurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General
“the authority for which is specified under this subchapter
to be in the discretion of the Attorney General.” All agree
that the Attorney General’s regulation, 8 CFR §1003.2(a),
places “[t]he decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen
. . . within the discretion of the Board.” But the statute
does not codify that prescription,9 and does not otherwise
“specif[y]” that reopening decisions are “in the discretion
of the Attorney General.”10

9 As earlier noted, see supra, at 5, n. 6, the Seventh Circuit stated
that the regulation specifying the Board’s discretion over motions to
reopen, 8 CFR §1003.2(a), “draw[s] [its] force from provisions in the
Act.” 533 F. 3d, at 536 (citing 8 U. S. C. §1229a(c)(7)). It is hard to see
how the regulation could draw force from §1229a(c)(7), for the regula
tion was already in force when that statutory provision was enacted.
The regulation, 8 CFR §1003.2(a), was published April 29, 1996, 61
Fed. Reg. 18900, 18904; 8 U. S. C. §1229a(c)(7) was enacted September
30, 1996, §304, 110 Stat. 3009–593.
10 The only statutory reference to discretion respecting motions to
reopen appears in §1229a(c)(7)(C)(iv)(III), which gives the Attorney
General “discretion” to waive one of the statute’s time limitations in
