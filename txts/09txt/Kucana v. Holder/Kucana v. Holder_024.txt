KUCANA v. HOLDER
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

Chapter 12 of Title 8, 8 U. S. C. §§1101–1107. See 8
U. S. C. §1103(a) (1994 ed.) (giving the Attorney General
the authority to “establish such regulations . . . as he
deems necessary for carrying out his authority under
[Chapter 12 of Title 8 of the U. S. Code]”).
The amicus curiae whom we appointed to defend the
decision of the Court of Appeals has attempted to link 8
CFR §1003.2 to Subchapter II. She notes that the Attor
ney General, in promulgating that regulation, cited not
only 8 U. S. C. §1103(a), but also a provision of Subchapter
II, 8 U. S. C. §1252b (1994 ed.). See 61 Fed. Reg. 18900,
18904 (1996).1 This latter statutory provision2 conferred
the authority to reopen a narrow set of deportation orders,
i.e., those issued after the alien failed to appear at the
deportation hearing. Although this statutory provision
——————
1 Two

other provisions in Subchapter II refer to motions to reopen,
but both were enacted after the implementation of 8 CFR §1003.2
(2009), and therefore that regulation cannot be said to implement these
provisions. See ante 7, n. 9. Title 8 U. S. C. §1229a(c)(7), which ad
dresses the procedural requirements for filing such a motion, and
§1252(b)(6), which requires consolidation of a motion to reopen with the
underlying removal order, were enacted as part of the Illegal Immigra
tion Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) in
September 1996 and made effective in April 1997. See 110 Stat. 3009–
593, 3009–609. Prior to that time, the consolidation provision was
found in Subchapter I. See 8 U. S. C. §1105(a)(6) (1994 ed.).
2 This provision conferred the authority to rescind a deportation order
“upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the
order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear
was because of exceptional circumstances . . . or upon a motion to
reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not
receive notice . . . or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in
Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the
alien.” 8 U. S. C. §1252b(c)(3) (1994 ed.).
A similar provision, enacted as part of IIRIRA, is now contained in 8
U. S. C. §1229a(b)(5)(C) (2006 ed.). As the Government notes, this
provision does not apply in this case because petitioner challenges the
denial of his second motion to reopen, which the parties agree is gov
erned by §1229a(c)(7). Brief for Respondent 21, n. 13; id., at 6, n. 4.
