KUCANA v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11) (internal quota
tion marks omitted).
B
The history of the relevant statutory provisions corrobo
rates our determination that §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not
proscribe judicial review of denials of motions to reopen.
Attorney General regulations have long addressed reopen
ing requests. See 6 Fed. Reg. 71–72 (1941). The current
regulations, adopted in 1996, 61 Fed. Reg. 18904–18906,
derive from rules published in 1958, see 23 Fed. Reg.
9118–9119; Dada, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).
Enacting IIRIRA in 1996, Congress “transform[ed] the
motion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statu
tory form of relief available to the alien.” Id., at ___ (slip
op., at 12). IIRIRA largely codified the Attorney General’s
directions on filing reopening motions. See §1229a(c)(7)
(guaranteeing right to file one motion, prescribing con
tents, and setting deadlines).
In the same legislation, Congress amended the INA
aggressively to expedite removal of aliens lacking a legal
basis to remain in the United States. See Reno v. Ameri
can-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 475
(1999). Among IIRIRA’s several proscriptions of judicial
review is the one here at issue, §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), barring
review of administrative decisions Congress placed within
the Attorney General’s discretion.
Congress thus simultaneously codified the process for
filing motions to reopen and acted to bar judicial review of
a number of executive decisions regarding removal. But
Congress did not codify the regulation delegating to the
BIA discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen. See 8
CFR §1003.2(a) (reopening may be entertained not only on
application; Board “may at any time reopen . . . on its own
motion any case in which it has rendered a decision”).
Had Congress elected to insulate denials of motions to
