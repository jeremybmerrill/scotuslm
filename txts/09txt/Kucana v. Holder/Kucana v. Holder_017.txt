Opinion of the Court

moval, §1229b; permission for voluntary departure,
§1229c; and adjustment of status, §1255.
Other decisions specified by statute “to be in the discre
tion of the Attorney General,” and therefore shielded from
court oversight by §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.
See, e.g., §1157(c)(1) (discretion to admit refugees “deter
mined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United
States”); §1181(b) (discretion to waive requirement of
documentation for readmission); §1182(a)(3)(D)(iv) (discre
tion to waive, in certain cases, inadmissibility of aliens
who have affiliated with a totalitarian party). Decisions
on reopening motions made discretionary by regulation, in
contrast, are adjunct rulings: The motion to reopen is a
procedural device serving to ensure “that aliens [a]re
getting a fair chance to have their claims heard.” Tr. of
Oral Arg. 17. A court decision reversing the denial of a
motion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford
the alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches and
concerns only the question whether the alien’s claims have
been accorded a reasonable hearing.
If Congress wanted the jurisdictional bar to encompass
decisions specified as discretionary by regulation along
with those made discretionary by statute, moreover, Con
gress could easily have said so. In other provisions en
acted simultaneously with §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), Congress
expressed precisely that meaning. See IIRIRA, §213, 110
Stat. 3009–572 (“immigration benefits pursuant to this
Act; or the regulations promulgated thereunder”), codified
at 8 U. S. C. §1324c(e)(2); IIRIRA, §372, 110 Stat. 3009–
646 (“any of the powers, privileges, or duties conferred or
imposed by this Act or regulations issued thereunder”),
codified at 8 U. S. C. §1103(a)(10). “[W]here Congress
includes particular language in one section of a statute but
omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally
presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely
in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Nken v. Holder,
