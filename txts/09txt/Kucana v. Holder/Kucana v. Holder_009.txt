Opinion of the Court

his motion, Kucana filed a petition for review in the Sev
enth Circuit.
In a fractured decision, the Seventh Circuit dismissed
the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Kucana v. Mukasey,
533 F. 3d 534, 539 (2008). The court held that 8 U. S. C.
§1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars judicial review not only of adminis
trative decisions made discretionary by statute, but also
“when the agency’s discretion is specified by a regulation
rather than a statute.” 533 F. 3d, at 536.6 In so ruling,
the Seventh Circuit created a split between itself and
other Courts of Appeals, all of them holding that denials of
reopening motions are reviewable in court.7
Judge Ripple concurred dubitante. He acknowledged
that the court was following an earlier decision, Ali v.
Gonzales, 502 F. 3d 659 (CA7 2007),8 but “suggest[ed]
that, had Congress intended to deprive th[e] court of juris
diction . . . , it would have done so explicitly, as it did in 8
U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)(i).” 533 F. 3d, at 540. The court,

6 While recognizing that a regulation, rather than the INA itself,
confers on the Board discretion to grant or deny a motion to reopen, the
Court of Appeals said that the regulation, §1003.2(a), “draw[s] . . . force
from provisions in the Act allowing immigration officials to govern their
own proceedings.” 533 F. 3d, at 536. The “force,” according to the
Seventh Circuit, comes from 8 U. S. C. §1229a(c)(7), which it described
as providing “authority for reopening by [the] Board.” 533 F. 3d, at
536. Section 1229a(c)(7), however, is not directed to the agency’s
discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen. In the main, “it simply
lays out the requirements an alien must fulfill when filing a motion to
reopen.” Id., at 541 (Cudahy, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). See
also infra, at 7, n. 9.
7 See Singh v. Mukasey, 536 F. 3d 149, 153–154 (CA2 2008); Jahjaga
v. Attorney Gen. of United States, 512 F. 3d 80, 82 (CA3 2008); Zhao v.
Gonzales, 404 F. 3d 295, 303 (CA5 2005); Miah v. Mukasey, 519 F. 3d
784, 789, n. 1 (CA8 2008); Medina-Morales v. Ashcroft, 371 F. 3d 520,
528–529 (CA9 2004); Infanzon v. Ashcroft, 386 F. 3d 1359, 1361–1362
(CA10 2004).
8 Ali involved a decision, made discretionary by regulation, denying
an alien’s request for a continuance.
