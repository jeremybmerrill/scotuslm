Opinion of the Court

“Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statu
tory or nonstatutory), . . . except as provided in sub
paragraph (D),[1] and regardless of whether the judg
ment, decision, or action is made in removal
proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction to re
view—
“(i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief
under section 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255
of this title,[2] or
“(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney
General . . . the authority for which is specified under
this subchapter[3] to be in the discretion of the Attor
ney General . . . , other than the granting of relief un
der section 1158(a) of this title.”4

1 Subparagraph (D) of §1252(a)(2), enacted in 2005, REAL ID Act of
2005 (REAL ID Act), §106(a), 119 Stat. 310, adds:
“Nothing in subparagraph (B) . . . or in any other provision of this Act
(other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review,
shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or
questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appro

The addition of 8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(D) in 2005 did not change the
operative language of §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as enacted in 1996.
The REAL ID Act amendments also inserted into this introductory
clause, inter alia, the words “(statutory or nonstatutory).”
§106(a)(1)(A)(ii), 119 Stat. 310. The introductory clause, however, does
not define the scope of 8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s jurisdictional bar.
It simply informs that once the scope of the bar is determined, jurisdic
tion is precluded regardless of what any other provision or source of law
might say.
2 Sections 1182(h) and 1182(i) address waivers of inadmissibility
based on certain criminal offenses, and fraud or misrepresentation,
respectively; §1229b addresses cancellation of removal; §1229c, volun
tary departure; and §1255, adjustment of status.

the United States Code, codified at 8 U. S. C. §§1151–1381 and titled
“Immigration.”
