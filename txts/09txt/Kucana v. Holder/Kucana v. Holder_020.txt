Opinion of the Court

v. Ashcroft, 386 F. 3d 1359, 1361–1362 (CA10 2004); Me
dina-Morales v. Ashcroft, 371 F. 3d 520, 528–529 (CA9

though adding or reformulating provisions on asylum,
§101(a), (b), 119 Stat. 302–303, protection from removal,
§101(c), (d), id., at 303–305, even judicial review, §106, id.,
at 310–311, the REAL ID Act did not disturb the unbroken
line of decisions upholding court review of administrative
denials of motions to reopen. See supra, at 6–7; supra, at

Any lingering doubt about the proper interpretation of 8
U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would be dispelled by a familiar

(1995). We have consistently applied that interpretive

Board’s decision not to reopen removal proceedings sua sponte. Courts
of Appeals have held that such decisions are unreviewable because
sua sponte reopening is committed to agency discretion by law, see 5
U. S. C. §701(a)(2). See, e.g., Tamenut v. Mukasey, 521 F. 3d 1000,
1003–1004 (CA8 2008) (en banc) (per curiam) (agreeing with ten other
Courts of Appeals).
