Opinion of the Court

reopen from judicial review, it could have so specified
together with its codification of directions on filing reopen
ing motions.
From the Legislature’s silence on the discretion of the
Attorney General (or his delegate, the Board) over reopen
ing motions, see supra, at 7–8, n. 10, we take it that Con
gress left the matter where it was pre-IIRIRA: The BIA
has broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney General,
“to grant or deny a motion to reopen,” 8 CFR §1003.2(a),
but courts retain jurisdiction to review, with due respect,
the Board’s decision.16 It is unsurprising that Congress
would leave in place judicial oversight of this “important
[procedural] safeguard” designed “to ensure a proper and
lawful disposition” of immigration proceedings, Dada, 554
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15–16), where, as here, the alien’s
underlying claim (for asylum) would itself be reviewable.17
In the REAL ID Act, Congress further amended the
INA. By 2005, two Courts of Appeals had already ruled
that 8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not preclude them

16 A statement in the House Conference Report on IIRIRA, amicus
suggests, supports her argument that Congress intended broadly to
foreclose judicial review of reopening denials.
Brief for CourtAppointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 32–34. The
report states that §1252(a)(2)(B) “bars judicial review . . . of any deci
sion or action of the Attorney General which is specified to be in the
discretion of the Attorney General.” H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104–828,
p. 219 (1996). That statement, as we read it, simply summarizes the
statutory text at a general level. It does not home in on the question
whether decisions made discretionary only by regulation are judicially
reviewable.
17 We do not reach the question whether review of a reopening denial
would be precluded if the court would lack jurisdiction over the alien’s
underlying claim for relief. Some courts confronting that question have
refused to consider petitions for review of a reopening denial that seeks
to revisit the denial of the underlying claim; they have reasoned that
hearing the petition would end-run the bar to review of the petitioner’s
core claim. See, e.g., Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F. 3d 471, 473–475 (CA5
2004) (per curiam).
