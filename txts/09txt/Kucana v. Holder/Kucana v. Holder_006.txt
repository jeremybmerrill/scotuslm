Opinion of the Court

by the Attorney General himself through regulation. We
hold that the key words “specified under this subchapter”
refer to statutory, but not to regulatory, specifications. We
so rule based on the longstanding exercise of judicial

Section 1252(a)(2), captioned “Matters not subject to
