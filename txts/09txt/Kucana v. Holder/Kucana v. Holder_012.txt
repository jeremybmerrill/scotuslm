KUCANA v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

III
A
1
The Board’s discretionary authority to act on a motion to
reopen, we have thus far explained, is “specified” not in a
statute, but only in the Attorney General’s regulation,
which instructs: “The decision to grant or deny a motion to
reopen . . . is within the discretion of the Board, subject to
the restrictions of this section. The Board has discretion
to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has
made out a prima facie case for relief.” 8 CFR §1003.2(a).
Nevertheless, in defense of the Seventh Circuit’s judg
ment, amicus urges that regulations suffice to trigger 8
U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s proscription of judicial review.
The jurisdiction-stripping provision, amicus reminds,
refers to “authority . . . specified under this subchapter.”
As she reads that formulation, the word “under” is key.
She comprehends “under” to mean “pursuant to,” “subor
dinate to,” “below or lower than,” “inferior . . . in rank or
importance,” “by reason of the authority of.” Brief for

extraordinary circumstances.
Amicus urges that “the statutory language governing motions to
reopen anticipates an exercise of Attorney General discretion when it
states, ‘[t]he motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be
proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.’ ” Brief for
Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 19, n. 8
(quoting §1229a(c)(7)(B)). One can demur to the argument that Con
gress anticipated that decisions on reopening motions would be discre
tionary.
Even so, the statutory proscription Congress enacted,
§1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), speaks of authority “specified”—not merely assumed
or contemplated—to be in the Attorney General’s discretion. “Speci
fied” is not synonymous with “implied” or “anticipated.” See Webster’s
New Collegiate Dictionary 1116 (1974) (“specify” means “to name or
state explicitly or in detail”). See also Soltane v. U. S. Dept. of Justice,
381 F. 3d 143, 147 (CA3 2004) (Alito, J.) (“[W]e do not think . . . that the
use of marginally ambiguous statutory language, without more, is
adequate to ‘specif[y]’ that a particular action is within the Attorney
General’s discretion for the purposes of §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).”).
