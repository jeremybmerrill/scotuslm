Opinion of the Court

for the admissibility bar in §1252(a)(2)(A).
Given
§1252(a)(2)(B)’s statutory placement, sandwiched between
subsections (a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(C), one would expect that
it, too, would cover statutory provisions alone.

Focusing on §1252(a)(2)(B), we note the lead line serving
to introduce both of the subparagraph’s two clauses: “[N]o
court shall have jurisdiction to review . . . .” Clause (i)
then places within the no-judicial-review category “any
judgment regarding the granting of relief under section
1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.” Each of the
statutory provisions referenced in clause (i) addresses a
different form of discretionary relief from removal, see
supra, at 3, n. 2, and each contains language indicating
that the decision is entrusted to the Attorney General’s
discretion. See, e.g., §1182(h) (“The Attorney General
may, in his discretion, waive [inadmissibility based on
certain criminal offenses].”). Clause (i) does not refer to
any regulatory provision.
To the clause (i) enumeration of administrative judg
ments that are insulated from judicial review, Congress
added in clause (ii) a catchall provision covering “any
other decision . . . the authority for which is specified
under this subchapter.” The proximity of clauses (i) and
(ii), and the words linking them—“any other decision”—
suggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same
genre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation.13 The
clause (i) enumeration, we find, is instructive in determin
——————
13 Congress excepted from §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) “the granting of relief
under [§]1158(a).” Section 1158 concerns applications for asylum.
Absent the exception, asylum applicants might fall within
§1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s jurisdictional bar because a statutory provision,
§1158(b)(1)(A), specifies that “the Attorney General may grant asylum.”
(Emphasis added.) See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 697 (2001)
(“ ‘may’ suggests discretion”).
