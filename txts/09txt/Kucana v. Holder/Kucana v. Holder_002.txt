KUCANA v. HOLDER
Syllabus
dates back to at least 1916, with the courts employing a deferential
abuse-of-discretion standard of review. While the Attorney General’s
regulation in point, 8 CFR §1003.2(a), places the reopening decision
within the BIA’s discretion, the statute does not codify that prescrip
tion or otherwise “specif[y]” that such decisions are in the Attorney
General’s discretion. Pp. 6–7.
(b) Section 1252(a)(2)(B) does not proscribe judicial review of deni
als of motions to reopen. Pp. 8–16.
(1) The amicus defending the Seventh Circuit’s judgment urges
that regulations suffice to trigger §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s proscription.
She comprehends “under” in “authority . . . specified under this sub
chapter” to mean, e.g., “pursuant to,” “subordinate to.” Administra
tive regulations count for §1252(a)(2)(B) purposes, she submits, be
cause they are issued “pursuant to,” and are measures “subordinate
to,” the legislation they serve to implement. On that reading,
§1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would bar judicial review of any decision that an
executive regulation places within the BIA’s discretion, including the
decision to deny a motion to reopen. The parties, on the other hand,
read the statutory language to mean “specified in,” or “specified by,”
the subchapter. On their reading, §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judi
cial review only when the statute itself specifies the discretionary
character of the Attorney General’s authority. Pp. 8–9.
(2) The word “under” “has many dictionary definitions and must
draw its meaning from its context.” Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129,
135. Examining the provision at issue in statutory context, the par
ties’ position stands on firmer ground. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is far
from IIRIRA’s only jurisdictional limitation. It is sandwiched be
tween two subsections, §1252(a)(2)(A) and §1252(a)(2)(C), both de
pendent on statutory provisions, not on any regulation, to define
their scope. Given §1252(a)(2)(B)’s statutory placement, one would
expect that it, too, would cover statutory provisions alone. Pp. 9–11.
(3) Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) places within the no-judicial-review
category “any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section
1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.” Each of the referenced
statutory provisions addresses a different form of discretionary relief
from removal and contains language indicating that the decision is
entrusted to the Attorney General’s discretion. Clause (i) does not re
fer to any regulatory provision. The proximity of clause (i) and the
clause (ii) catchall, and the words linking them—“any other deci
sion”—suggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same
genre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation. Read harmoni
ously, both clauses convey that Congress barred court review of dis
cretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney
General’s discretionary authority in the statute. Pp. 11–12.
