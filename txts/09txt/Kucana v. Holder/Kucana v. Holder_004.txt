KUCANA v. HOLDER
Syllabus
ticularly to questions concerning the preservation of federal-court ju
risdiction. See, e.g., Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S.
43, 63–64. Because this presumption is “ ‘well-settled,’ ” ibid., the
Court assumes that “Congress legislates with knowledge of” it,
McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 496. It there
fore takes “ ‘ “clear and convincing evidence” ’ ” to dislodge the pre
sumption. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 64. There is no
such evidence here. Finally, reading §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to
matters where discretion is conferred on the BIA by regulation would
ignore Congress’ design to retain for itself control over federal-court
jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit’s construction would free the Ex
ecutive to shelter its own decisions from abuse-of-discretion appellate
court review simply by issuing a regulation declaring those decisions
“discretionary.” Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can
not be extracted from the statute Congress enacted. Pp. 16–17.

533 F. 3d 534, reversed and remanded.
GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,
C. J., and STEVENS, SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined. ALITO, J., filed an opinion concurring in the
judgment.
