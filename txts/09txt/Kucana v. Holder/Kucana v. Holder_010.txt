KUCANA v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

he concluded, should revisit both Ali and Kucana and
“chart a course . . . more closely adher[ing] to the statutory
language chosen and enacted by Congress.” 533 F. 3d, at
540.
Judge Cudahy dissented. Given the absence of “specific
[statutory] language entrusting the decision on a motion
to reopen to the discretion of the Attorney General,” ibid.
(internal quotation marks omitted), he saw no impediment
to the exercise of jurisdiction over Kucana’s petition. In
support of his position, Judge Cudahy invoked the “strong
presumption that Congress intends judicial review of
administrative action.” Id., at 541 (quoting Traynor v.
Turnage, 485 U. S. 535, 542 (1988)). With four judges
dissenting, the Seventh Circuit denied Kucana’s petition
for rehearing en banc. See 533 F. 3d, at 541–542 (dissent
ing statement of Ripple, J., joined by Rovner, Wood, and
Williams, JJ.).
We granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve the Circuit conflict. As it did before the Seventh
Circuit, the Government agrees with Kucana that
§1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not remove federal-court jurisdic
tion to review the denial of a reopening motion. We ap
pointed Amanda C. Leiter to brief and argue the case, as
amicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuit’s judg
ment. 557 U. S. ___ (2009). Ms. Leiter has ably dis
charged her assigned responsibilities.
