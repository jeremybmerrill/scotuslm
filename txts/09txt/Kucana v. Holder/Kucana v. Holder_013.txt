Opinion of the Court

Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment
Below 15, 17 (citing, inter alia, Florida Dept. of Revenue v.
Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip
op., at 5); Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991)).
Administrative regulations count for §1252(a)(2)(B) pur
poses, she urges, because they are issued “pursuant to,”
and are measures “subordinate to,” the legislation they
serve to implement. The parties, on the other hand, read
“specified under this subchapter” to mean “specified in,” or
“specified by,” the subchapter.11
On the reading amicus advances, §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)
would bar judicial review of any decision that an executive
regulation places within the BIA’s discretion, including
the decision to deny a motion to reopen. On the parties’
reading, however, §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judicial
review only when the statute itself specifies the discre
tionary character of the Attorney General’s authority.

As the parties and amicus recognize, their diverse ren

many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning
from its context.” Ardestani, 502 U. S., at 135.12 Examin

11 Defining

“under,” as used in §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), to mean “pursuant
to,” or “subordinate to,” and not “in” or “by,” the Attorney General
observes, would give rise to “a fatal anomaly”: “Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)
would apply only to regulations promulgated ‘under the authority of’
the relevant subchapter, and not to specifications of discretion in the
subchapter itself.” Reply Brief for Respondent 6.
12 In an appendix to her brief, amicus lists hundreds of statutory
provisions in which regulations are described as being issued “under” a
statute. See App. A to Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in
Support of Judgment Below. In every one of those examples, Congress
expressly used the word “regulations.”
At oral argument, amicus called our attention to three instances in
which Congress used the words “specified under” in Title 8, without any
reference to “regulations,” to encompass agency matters. Tr. of Oral
