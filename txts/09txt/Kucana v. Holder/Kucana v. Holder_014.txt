KUCANA v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

ing, in statutory context, the provision in which the word
“under” is embedded, we conclude that the parties’ posi
tion stands on firmer ground.
Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), the provision at issue here, is
far from the only jurisdictional limitation in IIRIRA. See
Dada, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (“In reading a
statute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but
consider in connection with it the whole statute.” (internal
quotation marks omitted)); Davis v. Michigan Dept. of
Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989) (“[T]he words of a
statute must be read in their context and with a view to
their place in the overall statutory scheme.”). Section
1252(a)(2), titled “Matters not subject to judicial review,”
lists a variety of agency determinations the federal courts
lack jurisdiction to review. Those determinations divide
into three categories. The first, §1252(a)(2)(A), concerns
immigration officers’ determinations whether aliens apply
ing for admission are admissible. Next in statutory order
is the provision before us, §1252(a)(2)(B), which involves
denials of discretionary relief.
The last category,
§1252(a)(2)(C), concerns final orders of removal entered
against criminal aliens.
Both §1252(a)(2)(A) and §1252(a)(2)(C) depend on statu
tory provisions, not on any regulation, to define their
scope. The latter provision, the criminal alien bar, pre
cludes judicial review of “any final order of removal
against an alien who is removable by reason of having
committed a criminal offense covered in” §1182(a)(2),
§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D), or certain offenses
covered in §1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). All the defining references
are statutory; none invokes a regulation. The same holds
—————— 

Arg. 47–48, 54–55 (citing §§1227(a)(1)(H), 1375a(a)(6), and 1537(b)(1)).

These three provisions point to other parts of the Act, which in turn

rely on administrative determinations. Amicus’ research underscores 

the point that context defines “under.”
