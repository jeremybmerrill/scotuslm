KUCANA v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

A regulation, amended in 1996, just months before Con
gress enacted IIRIRA, 61 Fed. Reg. 18904, Pt. 3, §3.2(a),
states that “[t]he decision to grant or deny a motion to
reopen . . . is within the discretion of the Board.” 8 CFR
§1003.2(a) (2009). As adjudicator in immigration cases,
the Board exercises authority delegated by the Attorney
General. See 8 U. S. C. §1103(g)(2); 8 CFR §1003.1. See
also 8 CFR §1003.23(b)(3) (governing motions to reopen
filed with an IJ).
B
Kucana, a citizen of Albania, entered the United States
on a business visa in 1995 and remained after the visa
expired. Alleging that he would be persecuted based on
his political beliefs if returned to Albania, Kucana applied
for asylum and withholding of removal in 1996. An IJ
determined that Kucana was removable and scheduled a
hearing to evaluate his eligibility for asylum. When Ku
cana failed to appear for the hearing, the IJ immediately
ordered his removal in absentia. Kucana filed a motion to
reopen, explaining that he had missed his hearing because
he had overslept. The IJ denied the motion, and the BIA
affirmed in 2002. Kucana did not seek judicial review, nor
did he leave the United States.
Kucana filed a second motion to reopen his removal
proceedings in 2006, contending that conditions in Albania
had worsened.5 The BIA denied relief; it concluded that
conditions in Albania had actually improved since 1997.
Arguing that the BIA had abused its discretion in denying
——————
limited to the denial of his motion to reopen; he does not challenge in
this proceeding the decision denying his application for asylum.
5 The statute “guarantees to each alien the right to file ‘one motion to
reopen proceedings.’ ” Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, __ (2008) (slip op.,
at 12) (quoting §1229a(c)(7)(A)). Attorney General regulations permit
further motions to reopen to seek asylum or withholding of removal
based on changed conditions in the country of nationality or removal.
See 8 CFR §1003.2(c)(3)(ii) (2009).
