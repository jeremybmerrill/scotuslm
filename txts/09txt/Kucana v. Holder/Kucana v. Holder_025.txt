ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

does not apply to petitioner’s motion to reopen, amicus
argues that “the section’s brief allusion to motions to
reopen clearly presupposed that the Attorney General had
in place a more general procedure for reviewing all mo
tions to reopen removal proceedings.” Brief for CourtAppointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below
41–42.
Amicus’ argument is ingenious but ultimately unper
suasive. At most, 8 U. S. C. §1252b (1994 ed.) may be read
as implicitly authorizing the promulgation of a regulation
giving the Attorney General the discretion to reopen cer
tain deportation orders that were issued in absentia.
Petitioner’s second motion to reopen, however, seeks re
opening on grounds outside of §1252b, and therefore 8
CFR §1003.2, insofar as it applies to petitioner’s case, was
not issued pursuant to Subchapter II and does not imple
ment any provision of that Subchapter.
For these reasons, this case can and should be decided
on the narrow ground that, even if some regulations can
render a decision of the Attorney General unreviewable,
the regulation at issue in this case does not have that
effect.
