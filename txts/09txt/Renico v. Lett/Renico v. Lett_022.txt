RENICO v. LETT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

“extraordinary and striking circumstances,” Downum v.
United States, 372 U. S. 734, 736 (1963) (internal quota
tion marks omitted); that the trial judge may not take this
“weighty” step, Somerville, 410 U. S., at 471, unless and
until he has “scrupulous[ly]” assessed the situation and
“take[n] care to assure himself that [it] warrants action on
his part foreclosing the defendant from a potentially fa
vorable judgment by the tribunal,” United States v. Jorn,
400 U. S. 470, 485, 486 (1971) (plurality opinion);11 that, to
exercise sound discretion, the judge may not act “irration
ally,” “irresponsibly,” or “precipitately” but must instead
act “deliberately” and “careful[ly],” Washington, 434 U. S.,
at 514–515, 516;12 and that, in view of “the elusive nature
of the problem,” mechanical rules are no substitute in the
double jeopardy mistrial context for the sensitive applica
tion of general standards, Jorn, 400 U. S., at 485 (plurality
opinion).13 The governing legal principles in this area are
just that—principles—and their application to any par
ticular set of facts entails an element of judgment.
As the Court emphasizes, we have also repeatedly reaf

also Jorn, 400 U. S., at 486 (“[I]n the final analysis, the judge
must always temper the decision whether or not to abort the trial by
considering the importance to the defendant of being able, once and for
all, to conclude his confrontation with society through the verdict of a
tribunal he might believe to be favorably disposed to his fate”). Jorn
was technically a plurality opinion, but in all relevant respects it was a
majority product. Justices Black and Brennan believed the Court
lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, and for that reason they withheld
their full assent. Id., at 488 (statement concurring in judgment).
“However, in view of a decision by a majority of the Court to reach the
merits, they join[ed] the judgment of the Court.” Ibid. As petitioner
acknowledges, Jorn broke no new ground: Its “holding is consistent
[with] and no broader than Perez.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 18, n. 50.

tional floor”).
