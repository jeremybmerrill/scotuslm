RENICO v. LETT
Opinion of the Court

(per curiam).1
The “clearly established Federal law” in this area is
largely undisputed. In Perez, we held that when a judge
discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot
reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a
new trial for the defendant before a new jury. 9 Wheat., at
579–580. We explained that trial judges may declare a
mistrial “whenever, in their opinion, taking all the cir
cumstances into consideration, there is a manifest neces
sity” for doing so. Id., at 580. The decision to declare a
mistrial is left to the “sound discretion” of the judge, but
“the power ought to be used with the greatest caution,
under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvi
ous causes.” Ibid.
Since Perez, we have clarified that the “manifest neces
sity” standard “cannot be interpreted literally,” and that a
mistrial is appropriate when there is a “ ‘high degree’ ” of
necessity. Washington, supra, at 506. The decision
whether to grant a mistrial is reserved to the “broad dis
cretion” of the trial judge, a point that “has been consis
tently reiterated in decisions of this Court.” Illinois v.
Somerville, 410 U. S. 458, 462 (1973). See also Gori v.
United States, 367 U. S. 364, 368 (1961).
In particular, “[t]he trial judge’s decision to declare a
mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is . . .
accorded great deference by a reviewing court.” Washing

1 The

dissent correctly points out that AEDPA itself “never uses the
term ‘deference.’ ” Post, at 19 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But our cases
have done so over and over again to describe the effect of the threshold
restrictions in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) on granting federal habeas relief to
state prisoners. See, e.g., Wellons v. Hall, 558 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2010)
(per curiam) (slip op., at 5, n. 3); Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 2); McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per
curiam) (slip op., at 13); Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___, (2009) (slip op.,
at 13, 23); Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___ n. 2 (2009) (slip
op., at 9, n. 2); Waddington v. Sarausad, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip
op., at 14).
