RENICO v. LETT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

I
No one disputes that a “genuinely deadlocked jury” is
“the classic basis” for declaring a mistrial or that such
declaration, under our doctrine, does not preclude reprose

which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure,
the power ought to be used with the greatest caution,
under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and
obvious causes; and, in capital cases especially, Courts
should be extremely careful how they interfere with
any of the chances of life, in favour of the prisoner.
But, after all, they have the right to order the dis
