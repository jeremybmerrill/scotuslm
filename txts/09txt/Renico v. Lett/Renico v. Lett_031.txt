STEVENS, J., dissenting

“had deliberated for at least four hours following a rela
tively short, and far from complex, trial”; it “had sent out
several notes over the course of its deliberations, including
one that appears to indicate that its discussions may have
been particularly heated”; the parties did not object to the
mistrial order; and, “[m]ost important,” “the jury foreper
son expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a
verdict.” Ibid.; see ante, at 10 (reprising this list).16
These reasons do not suffice to justify the mistrial order.
Four hours is not a long time for jury deliberations, par
ticularly in a first-degree murder case. Indeed, it would
have been “remarkable” if the jurors “could review the
testimony of all [the] witnesses in the time they were
given, let alone conclude that they were deadlocked.” 507
F. Supp. 2d, at 786. The jury’s note pertaining to its vol
ume level does not necessarily indicate anything about the
“heated[ness],” Lett, 466 Mich., at 223, 644 N. W. 2d, at
753, of its discussion. “[T]here is no other suggestion in
the record that such was the case, and the trial judge did
not draw that conclusion.” 507 F. Supp. 2d, at 786. Al

the trial court before it, the Michigan Supreme Court did not
make any factual findings to bolster its unreasonable legal conclusion.
As the State Court of Appeals noted, the trial judge declared a mistrial
as soon as she extracted a suggestive answer from the foreperson. She
“never even found on the record that the jury was genuinely dead
locked.” People v. Lett, No. 209513, 2000 WL 33423221, *4 (Apr. 21,
2000) (per curiam); see also People v. Lett, 466 Mich. 206, 225, 644
N. W. 2d 743, 754 (2002) (trial court did not “articulate a rationale on
the record”). The Michigan Supreme Court expressly declined to
commit to the position that the jury really was deadlocked or that
manifest necessity really did exist. See, e.g., id., at 220, 644 N. W. 2d,
at 751 (“The issue is not whether this Court would have found manifest
necessity”). Accordingly, even if 28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(1) were to apply to
this appeal, there were no “determination[s] of a factual issue made by
a State court” that we would have to “presum[e] to be correct.” In any
event, none of the relevant facts in the case are disputed, and no
argument concerning §2254(e)(1) was properly raised in this Court or
passed upon below.
