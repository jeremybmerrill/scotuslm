Opinion of the Court

to ask you if the jury is deadlocked; in other words, is
there a disagreement as to the verdict?
“THE FOREPERSON: Yes, there is.
“THE COURT: All right. Do you believe that it is
hopelessly deadlocked?
“THE FOREPERSON: The majority of us don’t be
lieve that—
“THE COURT: (Interposing) Don’t say what you’re
going to say, okay?
“THE FOREPERSON: Oh, I’m sorry.
“THE COURT: I don’t want to know what your ver
dict might be, or how the split is, or any of that.
Thank you. Okay? Are you going to reach a unani
mous verdict, or not?
“THE FOREPERSON: (No response)
“THE COURT: Yes or no?
“THE FOREPERSON: No, Judge.” Tr. in No. 96–
08252 (Recorder’s Court, Detroit, Mich.), pp. 319–320.
The judge then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury,
and scheduled a new trial for later that year. Neither the
prosecutor nor Lett’s attorney made any objection.
Lett’s second trial was held before a different judge and
jury in November 1997. This time, the jury was able to
reach a unanimous verdict—that Lett was guilty of sec
ond-degree murder—after deliberating for only 3 hours
and 15 minutes. Lett, supra, at 210, and n. 4, 644 N. W.
2d, at 746, and n. 4.
Lett appealed his conviction to the Michigan Court of
Appeals. He argued that the judge in his first trial had
announced a mistrial without any manifest necessity for
doing so. Because the mistrial was an error, Lett main
tained, the State was barred by the Double Jeopardy
Clause of the U. S. Constitution from trying him a second
time. The Michigan Court of Appeals agreed with Lett
and reversed his conviction.
