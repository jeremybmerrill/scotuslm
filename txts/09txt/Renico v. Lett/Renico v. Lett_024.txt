RENICO v. LETT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

stream” and discharging the jury without giving the par
ties an opportunity to object. Jorn, 400 U. S., at 487 (plu
rality opinion); see also Somerville, 410 U. S., at 469
(characterizing Jorn judge’s actions as “erratic”). And we
have opined that, while trial judges have considerable
leeway in deciding whether to discharge the jury, “[w]e
resolve any doubt in favor of the liberty of the citizen,
rather than exercise what would be an unlimited, uncer

U. S., at 738 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The Court accurately describes the events leading up to
this trial judge’s declaration of mistrial, ante, at 2–3, but it
glides too quickly over a number of details that, taken
together, show her decisionmaking was neither careful nor
well considered. If the “manifest necessity” and “sound
discretion” standards are to have any force, we must

sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. Seventeen
witnesses provided testimony over the course of 10 calen
dar days. See 507 F. Supp. 2d 777, 779, 785–786 (ED
Mich. 2007); see also id., at 785 (discussing “piecemeal
fashion” in which evidence was presented to the jury).
The jury’s first period of deliberation on Thursday after
noon lasted less than 40 minutes. “The jury likely spent”
that brief session “doing little more than electing a fore
person.” People v. Lett, 466 Mich. 206, 227, 644 N. W. 2d
743, 755 (2002) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). The jury de

discharge. During that time, it sent the trial court seven
