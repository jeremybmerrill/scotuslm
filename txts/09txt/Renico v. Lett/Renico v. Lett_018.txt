RENICO v. LETT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

some American judges continued to coax unresolved juries
toward consensus by threatening to deprive them of heat,5
sleep,6 or sustenance7 or to lock them in a room for a pro
longed period of time.8
Mercifully, our legal system has evolved, and such harsh
measures are no longer tolerated. Yet what this history
demonstrates—and what has not changed—is the respect
owed “a defendant’s valued right to have his trial com
pleted by a particular tribunal.” Wade v. Hunter, 336
U. S. 684, 689 (1949). Our longstanding doctrine applying
the Double Jeopardy Clause attests to the durability and
fundamentality of this interest.
“The reasons why this ‘valued right’ merits constitu
tional protection are worthy of repetition.” Arizona v.
Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503 (1978).
“Even if the first trial is not completed, a second
prosecution may be grossly unfair. It increases the fi
nancial and emotional burden on the accused, pro
longs the period in which he is stigmatized by an un
resolved accusation of wrongdoing, and may even
enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be
convicted. The danger of such unfairness to the de
fendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is
completed. Consequently, as a general rule, the
prosecutor is entitled to one, and only one, opportu
nity to require an accused to stand trial.” Id., at 503–
505 (footnotes omitted).
