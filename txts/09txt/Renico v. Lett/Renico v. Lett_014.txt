RENICO v. LETT
Opinion of the Court

Fed. Appx., at 427. It further determined that the judge’s
brief colloquy with the foreperson may have wrongly
implied a false equivalence between “mere disagreement”
and “genuine deadlock,” and may have given rise to “inap
propriate pressure” on her to say that the jury would be
unable to reach a verdict. Id., at 426–427. The trial
judge’s mistakes were so egregious, in the Court of Ap
peals’ view, that the Michigan Supreme Court’s opinion
finding no abuse of discretion was not only wrong but
objectively unreasonable. Id., at 427.
The Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the trial record
is not implausible. Nor, for that matter, is the more in
ventive (surely not “crude”) speculation of the dissent.
Post, at 10. After all, the jury only deliberated for four
hours, its notes were arguably ambiguous, the trial judge’s
initial question to the foreperson was imprecise, and the
judge neither asked for elaboration of the foreperson’s
answers nor took any other measures to confirm the fore
person’s prediction that a unanimous verdict would not be
reached.2
But other reasonable interpretations of the record are
also possible. Lett’s trial was not complex, and there is no
reason that the jury would necessarily have needed more
than a few hours to deliberate over his guilt. The notes
the jury sent to the judge certainly could be read as re
flecting substantial disagreement, even if they did not say
so outright. Most important, the foreperson expressly told
the judge—in response to her unambiguous question “Are
you going to reach a unanimous verdict, or not?”—that the
jury would be unable to agree. Lett, supra, at 210, 644
N. W. 2d, at 745.
Given the foregoing facts, the Michigan Supreme
——————
2 We do not think it reasonable, however, to contend that “the fore
person had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood of deadlock.”
Post, at 12. She had, after all, participated in the jury’s deliberations.
