RENICO v. LETT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

the aforementioned measures, but she did have an obliga
tion to exercise sound discretion and thus to “assure
h[er]self that the situation warrant[ed] action on h[er]
part foreclosing the defendant from a potentially favorable
judgment by the tribunal.” Jorn, 400 U. S., at 486 (plural
ity opinion).
Add all these factors up, and I fail to see how the trial
judge exercised anything resembling “sound discretion” in
declaring a mistrial, as we have defined that term. In
deed, I fail to see how a record could disclose much less
evidence of sound decisionmaking. Within the realm of
realistic, nonpretextual possibilities, this mistrial declara
tion was about as precipitate as one is liable to find.
Despite the multitude of cases involving hung-jury mistri
als that have arisen over the years, neither petitioner nor
the Court has been able to identify any in which such
abrupt judicial action has been upheld. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 12–15. Even the prosecutor felt compelled to ac
knowledge that the trial court’s decision to discharge the
jury “ ‘clearly was error.’ ” 316 Fed. Appx., at 427 (quoting
postconviction hearing transcript).
The Michigan Supreme Court’s contrary conclusion was
unreasonable. The court suggested that an abuse of dis
cretion should only be found “ ‘when the result is “so pal
pably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evi
dences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not
the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof.” ’ ” Lett, 466
Mich., at 221, n. 12, 644 N. W. 2d, at 751, n. 12 (quoting
Alken-Ziegler, Inc. v. Waterbury Headers Corp., 461 Mich.
219, 227, 600 N. W. 2d 638, 642 (1999)). Finding that the
record in this case “provides sufficient justification for the
mistrial declaration,” Lett, 466 Mich., at 218, 644 N. W.
2d, at 750, the court concluded that the declaration consti
tuted a permissible exercise of judicial discretion, id., at
223, 644 N. W. 2d, at 753. The court listed, without ex
plaining, several reasons for this conclusion. The jury
