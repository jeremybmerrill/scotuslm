RENICO v. LETT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

appear to dispute this point, but it nevertheless denies
Lett relief by applying a level of deference to the state
courtâ€™s ruling that effectively effaces the role of the federal
courts. Nothing one will find in the United States Code or
the United States Reports requires us to turn a blind eye
to this manifestly unlawful conviction.
I respectfully dissent.
