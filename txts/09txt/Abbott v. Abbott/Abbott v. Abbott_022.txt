ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
Opinion of the Court

“Some child psychologists believe that the trauma children
suffer from these abductions is one of the worst forms of
child abuse.” H. R. Rep. No. 103–390, p. 2 (1993). A child
abducted by one parent is separated from the second
parent and the child’s support system. Studies have
shown that separation by abduction can cause psychologi­
cal problems ranging from depression and acute stress
disorder to posttraumatic stress disorder and identity­
formation issues. See N. Faulkner, Parental Child Abduc­

an early age can experience loss of community and stabil­

See Huntington, Parental Kidnapping: A New Form of
Child Abuse (1982), in American Prosecutors Research
Institute’s National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse,
Parental Abduction Project, Investigation and Prosecution
of Parental Abduction (1995) (App. A). Abductions may
prevent the child from forming a relationship with the left­
behind parent, impairing the child’s ability to mature. See
Faulkner, supra, at 5.

custody and may seek a return remedy, a return order is
not automatic. Return is not required if the abducting
parent can establish that a Convention exception applies.
One exception states return of the child is not required
when “there is a grave risk that his or her return would
expose the child to physical or psychological harm or
otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.” Art.
13(b), Treaty Doc., at 10. If, for example, Ms. Abbott could
demonstrate that returning to Chile would put her own
safety at grave risk, the court could consider whether this
is sufficient to show that the child too would suffer “psy­
