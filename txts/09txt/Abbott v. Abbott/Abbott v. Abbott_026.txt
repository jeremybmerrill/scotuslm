STEVENS, J., dissenting

Analysis 1054 (“[F]undamental purpose” of the Convention
is “to protect children from wrongful international remov­
als or retention by persons bent on obtaining their physi­
cal and/or legal custody”). The drafters’ primary concern
was to remedy abuses by noncustodial parents who at­
tempt to circumvent adverse custody decrees (e.g., those
granting sole custodial rights to the other parent) by
seeking a more favorable judgment in a second nation’s
family court system. Pérez-Vera Report ¶14, at 429.
The drafters determined that when a noncustodial
parent abducts a child across international borders, the
best remedy is return of that child to his or her country of
habitual residence—or, in other words, the best remedy is
return of the child to his or her custodial parent. Id., ¶18,
at 430. The drafters concluded that the same remedy
should not follow, however, when a custodial parent takes
a child from his or her country of habitual residence in
breach of the other parent’s visitation rights, or “rights of
access” in the Convention’s parlance. Id., ¶65, at 444–445.
The distinction between rights of custody and rights of
access, therefore, is critically important to the Conven­
tion’s scheme and purpose. It defines the scope of the
available Convention remedies.
Article 5 defines these rights as follows:
“For the purposes of this Convention—
“a ‘rights of custody’ shall include rights relating to
the care of the person of the child and, in particular,
the right to determine the child’s place of residence;
“b ‘rights of access’ shall include the right to take a
child for a limited period of time to a place other than
the child’s habitual residence.” S. Treaty Doc. No. 99–
11, at 7 (hereinafter Treaty Doc.).
