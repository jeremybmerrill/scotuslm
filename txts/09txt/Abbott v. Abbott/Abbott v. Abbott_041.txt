ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

of travel restriction at issue in this case as part of “rights
of custody”—will undermine the Convention’s careful
balance between the “rights of custody and the “rights of
access”:
“Although the problems which can arise from a breach
of access rights, especially where the child is taken
abroad by its custodian, were raised during the Four­
teenth Session, the majority view was that such situa­
tions could not be put in the same category as the
wrongful removals which it is sought to prevent.
“This example, and others like it where breach of ac­
cess rights profoundly upsets the equilibrium estab­
lished by a judicial or administrative decision, cer­
tainly demonstrate that decisions concerning the
custody of children should always be open to review.
This problem however defied all efforts the Hague
Conference to coordinate views thereon. A question­
able result would have been attained had the applica­
tion of the Convention, by granting the same degree of
protection to custody and access rights, led ultimately
to the substitution of the holders of one type of right by
those who held the other.” Id., ¶65, at 445 (emphasis
added; footnote omitted).
It seems the very same authority on which the Court
relies to support its broad, flexible reading of the Conven­
tion’s terms also tell us that the drafters expressly rejected
the very outcome the Court reaches today. Far from “ren­
der[ing] the Convention meaningless,” ante, at 9, a faithful
reading of the Convention’s text avoids the very “question­
able result” its drafters foresaw and attempted to preclude
were they to extend “the same degree of protection” “to
custody and access rights.” Pérez-Vera Report ¶65, at 445.

Hence, in my view, the Convention’s language is plain
