ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
Opinion of the Court

a treaty “is entitled to great weight.” Id., at 185. There is
no reason to doubt that this well-established canon of
deference is appropriate here. The Executive is well in­
formed concerning the diplomatic consequences resulting
from this Court’s interpretation of “rights of custody,”
including the likely reaction of other contracting states
and the impact on the State Department’s ability to re­
claim children abducted from this country.

This Court’s conclusion that ne exeat rights are rights of
custody is further informed by the views of other contract­
ing states. In interpreting any treaty, “[t]he ‘opinions of
our sister signatories’ . . . are ‘entitled to considerable
weight.’ ” El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng,
525 U. S. 155, 176 (1999) (quoting Air France v. Saks, 470
U. S. 392, 404 (1985)). The principle applies with special
force here, for Congress has directed that “uniform inter­
national interpretation of the Convention” is part of the
Convention’s framework. See §11601(b)(3)(B).
A review of the international case law confirms broad
acceptance of the rule that ne exeat rights are rights of
custody. In an early decision, the English High Court of
Justice explained that a father’s “right to ensure that the
child remain[ed] in Australia or live[d] anywhere outside
Australia only with his approval” is a right of custody
requiring return of the child to Australia. C. v. C., [1989]
1 W. L. R. 654, 658 (C. A.). Lords of the House of Lords
have agreed, noting that C. v. C.’s conclusion is “settled, so
far as the United Kingdom is concerned” and “appears to
be the majority [view] of the common law world.” See In
re D (A Child), [2007] 1 A. C. 619, 628, 633, 635 (2006).
The Supreme Court of Israel follows the same rule,
concluding that “the term ‘custody’ should be interpreted
in an expansive way, so that it will apply [i]n every case in
which there is a need for the consent of one of the parents
