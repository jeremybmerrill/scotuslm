ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

come a joint custodian of a child merely because he can
attempt to veto one of the countless decisions the child’s
other parent has sole legal authority to make on the
child’s behalf.
The right to determine the child’s place of residence. The
Court also concludes that Mr. Abbott’s veto power satisfies
the Convention’s definition of custodial rights because it
is, in the Court’s view, a “right to determine the child’s
place of residence.” Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. I disagree

child, although still a minor at law, has the right itself
to determine its own place of residence, the substance
of the custody rights will have to be determined in the
context of other rights concerning the person of the

child’s place of residence” to be an “example” of what the
Convention means by “care of the person of the child.” It
is indicative of the “substance” of what it means to be a
custodial parent. The definition is not, as the Court would
have it, one stick in the bundle that may be parsed as a
singular “ ‘righ[t] of custody,’ ” ante, at 1; rather, it is a
