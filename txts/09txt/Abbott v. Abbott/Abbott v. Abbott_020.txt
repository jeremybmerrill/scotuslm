ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
Opinion of the Court

rights of custody. The Report explains that rather than
defining custody in precise terms or referring to the laws
of different nations pertaining to parental rights, the
Convention uses the unadorned term “rights of custody” to
recognize “all the ways in which custody of children can be
exercised” through “a flexible interpretation of the terms
used, which allows the greatest possible number of cases
to be brought into consideration.” Id., ¶¶67, 71, at 446,
447–448. Thus the Report rejects the notion that because
ne exeat rights do not encompass the right to make medi­

they cannot be rights of custody. Indeed, the Report is
fully consistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights
are just one of the many “ways in which custody of chil­

its objects and purposes. The Convention is based on the
principle that the best interests of the child are well

in the country of habitual residence. See Convention
Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Ordering a return remedy

make this determination in a responsible manner.
Custody decisions are often difficult. Judges must strive
always to avoid a common tendency to prefer their own
society and culture, a tendency that ought not interfere
with objective consideration of all the factors that should
be weighed in determining the best interests of the child.
This judicial neutrality is presumed from the mandate of
the Convention, which affirms that the contracting states
