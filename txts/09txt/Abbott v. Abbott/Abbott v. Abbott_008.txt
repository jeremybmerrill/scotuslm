ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
Opinion of the Court

conflict. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).
II
The Convention was adopted in 1980 in response to the
problem of international child abductions during domestic
disputes. The Convention seeks “to secure the prompt
return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in
any Contracting State,” and “to ensure that rights of
custody and of access under the law of one Contracting

moval or retention; and
“b at the time of removal or retention those rights
were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or
would have been so exercised but for the removal or
retention.
