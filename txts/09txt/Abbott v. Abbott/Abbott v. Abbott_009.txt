Opinion of the Court

moved or retained in terms of Article 3 . . . the author­
ity concerned shall order the return of the child
forthwith.” Id., at 7, 9.
The Convention’s central operating feature is the return
remedy. When a child under the age of 16 has been
wrongfully removed or retained, the country to which the
child has been brought must “order the return of the child
forthwith,” unless certain exceptions apply. See, e.g., Arts.
4, 12, ibid. A removal is “wrongful” where the child was
removed in violation of “rights of custody.” The Conven­
tion defines “rights of custody” to “include rights relating
to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the
right to determine the child’s place of residence.” Art.
5(a), id., at 7. A return remedy does not alter the pre-ab­
duction allocation of custody rights but leaves custodial
decisions to the courts of the country of habitual residence.
Art. 19, id., at 11. The Convention also recognizes “rights
of access,” but offers no return remedy for a breach of
those rights. Arts. 5(b), 21, id., at 7, 11.
The United States has implemented the Convention
through the ICARA. The statute authorizes a person who
seeks a child’s return to file a petition in state or federal
court and instructs that the court “shall decide the case in
accordance with the Convention.” 42 U. S. C. §§11603(a),
(b), (d). If the child in question has been “wrongfully
removed or retained within the meaning of the Conven­
tion,” the child shall be “promptly returned,” unless an
exception is applicable. §11601(a)(4).
III
As the parties agree, the Convention applies to this
dispute. A. J. A. is under 16 years old; he was a habitual
resident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States
are contracting states. The question is whether A. J. A.
was “wrongfully removed” from Chile, in other words,
whether he was removed in violation of a right of custody.
