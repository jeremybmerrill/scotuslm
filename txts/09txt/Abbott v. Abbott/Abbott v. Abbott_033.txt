ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

dence,” even standing alone, refers to a particular loca­
tion—and not, more generally, to a nation or country. In
the law, “residence” can mean: “[t]he act or fact of living in
a given place for some time”; “[t]he place where one actu­
ally lives”; or, “[a] house or other fixed abode; a dwelling.”
Black’s Law Dictionary 1423 (9th ed. 2009).5 Lay defini­
tions of “residence” similarly describe a specific location:
“the act or fact of abiding or dwelling in a place for some
time”; “the place where one actually lives or has his
home”; or, “a temporary or permanent dwelling place,
abode, or habitation.” Webster’s 1931. It follows that a
“place of residence” describes a “physical” location in
which a child “actually lives.”
The Court’s reading of this text depends on its substitu­
tion of the word “country” for the word “place.” Such a
substitution is not illogical, of course, in light of the Con­
vention’s international focus. See Croll v. Croll, 229 F. 3d
133, 147, 148 (CA2 2000) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (read­
ing “place of residence” to mean “authority over the child’s
more specific living arrangements” “ignores the basic
international character of the Hague Convention”). But it
is inconsistent with the Convention’s text and purpose.
When the drafters wanted to refer to country, they did.
For example, in Article 3, the drafters explained that
rights of custody should be defined by looking to “the law
of the State in which the child was habitually resident.”
Art. 3(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. Had the drafters intended the
definition of the child’s “place of residence” in Article 5 to
refer to his or her “State” or country of “residence,” they
——————
5 “Residence” can also refer to “[t]he place where a corporation or
other enterprise does business or is registered to do business.” Black’s
Law Dictionary 1423. Earlier this Term, we recognized the self-evident
principle that a corporation’s principal “place” of business for diversity
jurisdiction purposes is a single location “within a State” and “not the
State itself.” Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,
at 14).
