TIMOTHY MARK CAMERON ABBOTT, PETITIONER v.
JACQUELYN VAYE ABBOTT
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[May 17, 2010] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents, as it has from its inception in the
United States District Court, a question of interpretation
under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of In­
ternational Child Abduction (Convention), Oct. 24, 1980,
T. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99–11. The
United States is a contracting state to the Convention; and
Congress has implemented its provisions through the
International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 102
Stat. 437, 42 U. S. C. §11601 et seq. The Convention
provides that a child abducted in violation of “rights of
custody” must be returned to the child’s country of habit­
ual residence, unless certain exceptions apply. Art. 1, S.
Treaty Doc. No. 99–11, at 7 (Treaty Doc.). The question is
whether a parent has a “righ[t] of custody” by reason of
that parent’s ne exeat right: the authority to consent before
the other parent may take the child to another country.
