ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
Opinion of the Court

This Court’s inquiry is shaped by the text of the Conven­
tion; the views of the United States Department of State;
decisions addressing the meaning of “rights of custody” in
courts of other contracting states; and the purposes of the
Convention. After considering these sources, the Court
determines that Mr. Abbott’s ne exeat right is a right of
custody under the Convention.
A
“The interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of
a statute, begins with its text.” Medellín v. Texas, 552
U. S. 491, 506 (2008). This Court consults Chilean law to
determine the content of Mr. Abbott’s right, while follow­
ing the Convention’s text and structure to decide whether
the right at issue is a “righ[t] of custody.”
Chilean law granted Mr. Abbott a joint right to decide
his child’s country of residence, otherwise known as a
ne exeat right. Minors Law 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to
Pet. for Cert. 61a, 62a, provides that “[o]nce the court has
decreed” that one of the parents has visitation rights, that
parent’s “authorization . . . shall also be required” before
the child may be taken out of the country, subject to court
override only where authorization “cannot be granted or is
denied without good reason.” Mr. Abbott has “direct and
regular” visitation rights and it follows from Chilean law,
that he has a shared right to determine his son’s country
of residence under this provision. App. 9. To support the
conclusion that Mr. Abbott’s right under Chilean law gives
him a joint right to decide his son’s country of residence, it
is notable that a Chilean agency has explained that Mi­
nors Law 16,618 is a “right to authorize the minors’ exit”
from Chile and that this provision means that neither
parent can “unilaterally” “establish the [child’s] place of
residence.” Letter from Paula Strap Camus, Director
