ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

custody’ ” within the meaning of the Hague Convention on
the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Con­
vention), Oct. 25, 1980, T. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty
Doc. No. 99–11. Ante, at 1.
Because the Court concludes that this travel restriction
constitutes a right of custody, and because Ms. Abbott
indisputably violated the restriction when she took A. J. A.
from Chile without either Mr. Abbott’s or the court’s per­
mission, Mr. Abbott is now entitled to the return of
A. J. A. to Chile under the terms of the Convention. Thus,
absent a finding of an exception to the Convention’s pow­
erful return remedy, see ante, at 18–19, and even if the
return is contrary to the child’s best interests, an Ameri­
can court must now order the return of A. J. A. to Mr.
Abbott, who has no legal authority over A. J. A., based
solely on his possessing a limited veto power over Ms.
Abbott’s ability to take A. J. A. from Chile. As I shall
explain, use of the Convention’s return remedy under
these circumstances is contrary to the Convention’s text
and purpose.

When the drafters of the Convention gathered in 1980,
they sought an international solution to an emerging
problem: transborder child abductions perpetrated by
noncustodial parents “to establish artificial jurisdictional
links . . . with a view to obtaining custody of a child.” 1980

and “a source of background on the meaning of the provisions of the
