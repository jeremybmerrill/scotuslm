Opinion of the Court

February 2006, provided Mr. Abbott remained in Texas.
App. 42.
In May 2006, Mr. Abbott filed the instant action in the
United States District Court for the Western District of
Texas. He sought an order requiring his son’s return to
Chile pursuant to the Convention and enforcement provi­
sions of the ICARA. In July 2007, after holding a bench
trial during which only Mr. Abbott testified, the District
Court denied relief. The court held that the father’s ne
exeat right did not constitute a right of custody under the
Convention and, as a result, that the return remedy was
not authorized. 495 F. Supp. 2d 635, 640.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
affirmed on the same rationale. The court held the father
possessed no rights of custody under the Convention be­
cause his ne exeat right was only “a veto right over his
son’s departure from Chile.” 542 F. 3d 1081, 1087 (2008).
The court expressed substantial agreement with the Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Croll v. Croll, 229
F. 3d 133 (2000). Relying on American dictionary defini­
tions of “custody” and noting that ne exeat rights cannot be
“ ‘actually exercised’ ” within the meaning of the Conven­
tion, Croll held that ne exeat rights are not rights of cus­
tody. Id., at 138–141 (quoting Art. 3(b), Treaty Doc., at 7).
A dissenting opinion in Croll was filed by then-Judge
Sotomayor. The dissent maintained that a ne exeat right
is a right of custody because it “provides a parent with
decisionmaking authority regarding a child’s international
relocation.” 229 F. 3d, at 146.
The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits
adopted the conclusion of the Croll majority. See Fawcett
v. McRoberts, 326 F. 3d 491, 500 (CA4 2003); Gonzalez v.
Gutierrez, 311 F. 3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002). The Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has followed the reason­
ing of the Croll dissent. Furnes v. Reeves, 362 F. 3d 702,
720, n. 15 (2004). Certiorari was granted to resolve the
