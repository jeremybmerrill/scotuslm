ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Similar factual distinctions—involving, typically, joint
guardianship rights or shared decisionmaking rights—are
present in other of the foreign cases relied upon by the
Court and Mr. Abbott.15
Those foreign courts that have reached a position con­
sistent with my own, the Court is right to point out, have
also done so in slightly different factual scenarios. Ante,
