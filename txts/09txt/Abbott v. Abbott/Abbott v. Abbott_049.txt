ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Today, the Court has upended the considered judgment
of the Conventionâ€™s drafters in favor of protecting the
rights of noncustodial parents. In my view, the bright-line
rule the Court adopts today is particularly unwise in the
context of a treaty intended to govern disputes affecting
the welfare of children.
I, therefore, respectfully dissent.
