Opinion of the Court

father relies on his rights under Minors Law 16,618. Mr.
Abbott’s rights derive not from the order but from Minors
Law 16,618. That law requires the father’s consent before
the mother can remove the boy from Chile, subject only to
the equitable power family courts retain to override any
joint custodial arrangements in times of disagreement.
Minors Law 16,618; see 1 J. Atkinson, Modern Child
Custody Practice §6–11 (2d ed. 2009) (“[T]he court remains
the final arbiter and may resolve the [dispute between
joint custodians] itself or designate one parent as having

Lombardo v. Lombardo, 202 Mich. App. 151, 159, 507
N. W. 2d 788, 792 (1993) (“[W]here the parents as joint
custodians cannot agree on important matters such as
education, it is the court’s duty to determine the issue in
the best interests of the child”). The consent provision in
Minors Law 16,618 confers upon the father the joint right
to determine his child’s country of residence. This is a
right of custody under the Convention.

rights are rights of custody. In its brief before this Court
the United States advises that “the Department of State,
whose Office of Children’s Issues serves as the Central
Authority for the United States under the Convention, has
long understood the Convention as including ne exeat
rights among the protected ‘rights of custody.’ ” Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 21; see Sumitomo Shoji
America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 184–185, n. 10
(1982) (deferring to the Executive’s interpretation of a
treaty as memorialized in a brief before this Court). It is
well settled that the Executive Branch’s interpretation of
