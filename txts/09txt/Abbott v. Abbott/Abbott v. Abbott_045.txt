ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
STEVENS, J., dissenting

own reading of the treaty’s text. Its view is informed by no
unique vantage it has, whether as the entity responsible
for enforcing the Convention in this country or as a par­
ticipating drafter. The Court’s perfunctory, one-paragraph
treatment of the Department’s judgment of this matter
only underscores this point. Ante, at 11–12. I see no
reason, therefore, to replace our understanding of the
Convention’s text with that of the Executive Branch.
Views of foreign jurisdictions. The Court believes that
the views of our sister signatories to the Convention de­
serve special attention when, in a case like this, “Congress
has directed that ‘uniform international interpretation’ of
the Convention is part of the Convention’s framework.”
Ante, at 12 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §11601(b)(3)(B)). This
may well be correct, but we should not substitute the
judgment of other courts for our own. See Olympic Air­
ways v. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 655, n. 9 (2004). And the
handful of foreign decisions the Court cites, see ante, at
12–13, provide insufficient reason to depart from my
understanding of the meaning of the Convention, an un­
derstanding shared by many U. S. Courts of Appeals. See,
e.g., 542 F. 3d 1081 (CA5 2008) (case below); Gonzalez v.
Gutierrez, 311 F. 3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002) (parent’s right to
“refuse permission for his children to leave Mexico”
“hardly amounts to a right of custody, in the plainest
sense of the term”); Croll, 229 F. 3d, at 140 (“If we were to
enforce rights held pursuant to a ne exeat clause by the
remedy of mandatory return, the Convention would be­
come unworkable. . . . It does not contemplate return of a
child to a parent whose sole right—to visit or veto—impose
no duty to give care”); Fawcett v. McRoberts, 326 F. 3d 491
(CA4 2003). Indeed, the interest in having our courts
correctly interpret the Convention may outweigh the
interest in having the ne exeat clause issue resolved in the
same way that it is resolved in other countries. Cf. Breard
v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 375 (1998) (per curiam) (“[W]hile
