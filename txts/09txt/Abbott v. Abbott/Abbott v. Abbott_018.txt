ABBOTT v. ABBOTT
Opinion of the Court

plicit ne exeat right and, in any event, the court ordered a
return remedy on a different basis. See [1996] 2 S. C. R.,
at 140–141, 142, 134 D. L. R. (4th), at 503–504, 505.
French courts are divided. A French Court of Appeals
held that “the right to accept or refuse the removal of the
children’s residence” outside of a region was “a joint exer­
cise of rights of custody.” Public Ministry v. M. B., [CA]
Aix-en-Provence, 6e ch., Mar. 23, 1989, Rev. crit. dr. inter­
nat. Privé 79(3), July–Sept. 1990, 529, 533–535. A trial
court in a different region of France rejected this view,
relying on the mother’s “fundamental liberty” to establish
her domicil. See Attorney for the Republic at Périgueux v.
Mrs. S., [T. G. I.] Périgueux, Mar. 17, 1992, Rev. cr. dr.

Bertrand Ancel, D. 1992, note G. C.
Scholars agree that there is an emerging international
consensus that ne exeat rights are rights of custody, even if
that view was not generally formulated when the Conven­
tion was drafted in 1980. At that time, joint custodial
arrangements were unknown in many of the contracting
states, and the status of ne exeat rights was not yet well
understood. See 1980 Conférence de La Haye de droit
international privé, Enlèvement d’enfants, morning meet­
ing of Wed., Oct. 8, 1980 (discussion by Messrs. Leal & van
Boeschoten), in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzième
session, pp. 263–266 (1982) (Canadian and Dutch dele­
gates disagreeing whether the Convention protected
ne exeat rights, while agreeing that it should protect such
rights). Since 1980, however, joint custodial arrange­
ments have become more common. See supra, at 8–9.
And, within this framework, most contracting states and
scholars now recognize that ne exeat rights are rights of
custody. See, e.g., Hague Conference on Private Interna­
tional Law: Transfrontier Contact Concerning Children:
General Principles and Guide to Good Practice §9.3, p. 43
