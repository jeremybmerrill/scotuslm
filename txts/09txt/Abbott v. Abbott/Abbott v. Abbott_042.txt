STEVENS, J., dissenting

and that language precludes the result the Court reaches.
See Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S.
176, 180 (1982). In these circumstances, the “clear import
of treaty language controls” the decision. Ibid. To support
its reading of the text, however, the Court turns to author­
ity we utilize to aid us in interpreting ambiguous treaty
text: the position of the Executive Branch and authorities
from foreign jurisdictions that have confronted the ques­
tion before the Court.11 Ante, at 11–14. Were I to agree
with the Court that it is necessary turn to these sources to
resolve the question before us, I would not afford them the
weight the Court does in this case.
Views of the Department of State. Without discussing
precisely why, we have afforded “great weight” to “the
meaning given [treaties] by the departments of govern­
ment particularly charged with their negotiation and
enforcement.” Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 187, 194
(1961); see also Sumitomo, 457 U. S., at 184–185; Factor v.
Laubenheimer, 290 U. S. 276, 294 (1933). We have
awarded “great weight” to the views of a particular gov­
ernment department even when the views expressed by
the department are newly memorialized, see Sumitomo,
457 U. S., at 184, n. 10, and even when the views appear
contrary to those expressed by the department at the time
of the treaty’s signing and negotiation, ibid. In this case,
it appears that both are true: The Department of State’s
position, which supports the Court’s conclusion, is newly
memorialized, see Brief for United States as Amicus Cu­
riae 21, n. 13, and is possibly inconsistent with the De­
partment’s earlier position, see Convention Analysis

the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is
manifestly absurd or unreasonable”).
