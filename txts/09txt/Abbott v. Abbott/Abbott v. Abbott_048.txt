STEVENS, J., dissenting

the Convention as custody”).16 The Canadian Supreme
Court later affirmed this important distinction in D. S. v.
V. W., [1996] 2 S. C. R. 108, 139, 134 D. L. R. (4th) 481,
503 (rejecting argument that “any removal of a child
without the consent of the parent having access rights”
should authorize return remedy because such a reading of
the Convention would “indirectly afford the same protec­
tion to access rights as is afforded to custody rights”).
In sum, the decisions relied upon by the Court and Mr.
Abbott from our sister signatories do not convince me that
we should refrain from a straightforward textual analysis
in this case in order to make way for a “uniform interna­
tional interpretation” of the Convention. 42 U. S. C.
§11601(b)(3)(B). There is no present uniformity suffi­
ciently substantial to justify departing from our independ­
ent judgment on the Convention’s text and purpose and
the drafters’ intent.

At bottom, the Convention aims to protect the best
interests of the child. Pérez-Vera Report ¶25, at 432.
Recognizing that not all removals in violation of the laws
of the country of habitual residence are contrary to a
child’s best interests, the Convention provides a powerful
but limited return remedy. The judgment of the Conven­
tion’s drafters was that breaches of access rights, while
significant (and thus expressly protected by Article 21),
are secondary to protecting the child’s interest in main­
taining an existing custodial relationship.

16 The Canadian high court also observed that construing a perma­
nent travel restriction on one parent as creating a right of custody in
the other has “serious implications of the mobility rights of the custo­
dian.” Thomson, 3 S. C. R., at 590, 119 D. L. R., at 281. A French
Court of Appeals made a similar observation in Attorney for the Repub­
lic at Périgueux v. Mrs. S, T. G. I. Périgueux, Mar. 17, 1992, Rev. cr. dr.
internat. Privé 82(4) Oct.–Déc. 1993, 650, 651–653.
