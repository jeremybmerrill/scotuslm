Opinion of the Court

to remove the children from one country to another.” CA
5271/92 Foxman v. Foxman, [1992], §§3(D), 4 (K. Chagall
transl.). The High Courts of Austria, South Africa, and
Germany are in accord.
See Oberster Gerichtshof
[O. G. H.] [Supreme Court] Feb. 5, 1992, 2 Ob 596/91
(Austria) (“Since the English Custody Court had ordered
that the children must not be removed from England and
Wales without the father’s written consent, both parents
had, in effect, been granted joint custody concerning the
children’s place of residence”); Sonderup v. Tondelli,
2001(1) SA 1171, 1183 (Constitutional Ct. of South Africa
2000) (“[The mother’s] failure to return to British Colum­
bia with the child . . . was a breach of the conditions upon
which she was entitled to exercise her rights of custody
and . . . therefore constituted a wrongful retention . . . as
contemplated by [Article 3] of the Convention”); Bundes­
verfassungsgericht [BVerfG] [Federal Constitutional
Court of Germany] July 18, 1997, 2 BvR 1126/97, ¶15 (the
Convention requires a return remedy for a violation of the
“right to have a say in the child’s place of residence”).
Appellate courts in Australia and Scotland agree. See In
the Marriage of Resina [1991] FamCA 33 (Austl., May 22,
1991), ¶¶18–27; A. J. v. F. J., [2005] CSIH 36, 2005 1 S. C.
428, 435–436.
It is true that some courts have stated a contrary view,
or at least a more restrictive one. The Canadian Supreme
Court has said ne exeat orders are “usually intended” to
protect access rights. Thomson v. Thomson, [1994] 3
S. C. R. 551, 589–590, 119 D. L. R. (4th) 253, 281; see D. S.
v. V. W., [1996] 2 S. C. R. 108, 134 D. L. R. (4th) 481. But
the Canadian cases are not precisely on point here.
Thomson ordered a return remedy based on an interim
ne exeat order, and only noted in dicta that it may not
order such a remedy pursuant to a permanent ne exeat
order. See [1994] 3 S. C. R., at 589–590, 119 D. L. R. (4th),
at 281. D. S. involved a parent’s claim based on an im­
