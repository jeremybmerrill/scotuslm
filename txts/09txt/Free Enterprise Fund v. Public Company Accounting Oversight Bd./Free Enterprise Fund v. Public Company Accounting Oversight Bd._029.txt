Opinion of the Court

cerning private organizations like the New York Stock
Exchange. Cf. §§78s(h)(4), 7217(d)(3). While we need not
decide the question here, a removal standard appropriate
for limiting Government control over private bodies may
be inappropriate for officers wielding the executive power
of the United States.
Alternatively, respondents portray the Act’s limitations
on removal as irrelevant, because—as the Court of Ap­
peals held—the Commission wields “at-will removal power
over Board functions if not Board members.” 537 F. 3d, at
683 (emphasis added); accord, Brief for United States 27–
28; PCAOB Brief 48. The Commission’s general “oversight
and enforcement authority over the Board,” §7217(a), is
said to “blun[t] the constitutional impact of for-cause
removal,” 537 F. 3d, at 683, and to leave the President no
worse off than “if Congress had lodged the Board’s func­
tions in the SEC’s own staff,” PCAOB Brief 15.
Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to
the power to remove Board members. The Commission
may, for example, approve the Board’s budget, §7219(b),
issue binding regulations, §§7202(a), 7217(b)(5), relieve
the Board of authority, §7217(d)(1), amend Board sanc­
tions, §7217(c), or enforce Board rules on its own,
§§7202(b)(1), (c). But altering the budget or powers of an
agency as a whole is a problematic way to control an infe­
rior officer. The Commission cannot wield a free hand to
supervise individual members if it must destroy the Board
in order to fix it.
Even if Commission power over Board activities could
substitute for authority over its members, we would still
reject respondents’ premise that the Commission’s power
in this regard is plenary. As described above, the Board is
empowered to take significant enforcement actions, and
does so largely independently of the Commission. See
supra, at 3–4. Its powers are, of course, subject to some
latent Commission control. See supra, at 4–5. But the Act
