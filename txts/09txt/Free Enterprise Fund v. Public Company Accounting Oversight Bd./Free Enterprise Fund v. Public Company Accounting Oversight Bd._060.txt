Where a “for cause” provision is so unlikely to restrict
presidential power and so likely to further a legitimate
institutional need, precedent strongly supports its consti
tutionality. First, in considering a related issue in Nixon
v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425 (1977),
the Court made clear that when “determining whether the
Act disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate
branches, the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to
which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplish
ing its constitutionally assigned functions.” Id., at 443.
The Court said the same in Morrison, where it upheld a
restriction on the President’s removal power. 487 U. S., at
691 (“[T]he real question is whether the removal restric
tions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s
ability to perform his constitutional duty, and the func
tions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that
light”). Here, the removal restriction may somewhat
diminish the Commission’s ability to control the Board,
but it will have little, if any, negative effect in respect to
the President’s ability to control the Board, let alone to
coordinate the Executive Branch. See Part II–A, supra.
Indeed, given Morrison, where the Court upheld a restric
tion that significantly interfered with the President’s
important historic power to control criminal prosecutions,
a “ ‘purely executive’ ” function, 487 U. S., at 687–689, the
constitutionality of the present restriction would seem to
follow a fortiori.
Second, as previously pointed out, this Court has re
peatedly upheld “for cause” provisions where they restrict
the President’s power to remove an officer with adjudica
tory responsibilities. Compare Humphrey’s Executor, 295
U. S., at 623–628; Wiener, 357 U. S., at 355; Schor, 478
