Opinion of the Court

Petitioners’ general challenge to the Board is “collateral”
to any Commission orders or rules from which review
might be sought. Cf. McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center,
Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 491–492 (1991). Requiring petitioners
to select and challenge a Board rule at random is an odd
procedure for Congress to choose, especially because only
new rules, and not existing ones, are subject to challenge.
See 15 U. S. C. §§78s(b)(2), 78y(a)(1), 7217(b)(4).
Alternatively, the Government advises petitioners to
raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction. Brief for
United States 16–17. But the investigation of Beckstead
and Watts produced no sanction, see id., at 7, n. 5; Reply
Brief for Petitioners 29, n. 11 (hereinafter Reply Brief),
and an uncomplimentary inspection report is not subject
to judicial review, see §7214(h)(2). So the Government
proposes that Beckstead and Watts incur a sanction (such
as a sizable fine) by ignoring Board requests for docu­
ments and testimony. Brief for United States 17. If the
Commission then affirms, the firm will win access to a
court of appeals—and severe punishment should its chal­
lenge fail. We normally do not require plaintiffs to “bet
the farm . . . by taking the violative action” before “testing
the validity of the law,” MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech,
Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 129 (2007); accord, Ex parte Young,
209 U. S. 123 (1908), and we do not consider this a “mean­
ingful” avenue of relief. Thunder Basin, 510 U. S., at 212.
Petitioners’ constitutional claims are also outside the
Commission’s competence and expertise. In Thunder
Basin, the petitioner’s primary claims were statutory; “at
root . . . [they] ar[o]se under the Mine Act and f[e]ll
squarely within the [agency’s] expertise,” given that the
agency had “extensive experience” on the issue and had
“recently addressed the precise . . . claims presented.” Id.,
at 214–215. Likewise, in United States v. Ruzicka, 329
U. S. 287 (1946), on which the Government relies, we
reserved for the agency fact-bound inquiries that, even if
