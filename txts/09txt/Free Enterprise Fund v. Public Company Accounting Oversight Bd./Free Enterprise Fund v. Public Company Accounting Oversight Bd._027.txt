Opinion of the Court

tion, never before addressed by the Court, of two layers of
for-cause tenure. And though it may be criticized as “ele­
mentary arithmetical logic,” post, at 23, two layers are not
the same as one.
The President has been given the power to oversee
executive officers; he is not limited, as in Harry Truman’s
lament, to “persuad[ing]” his unelected subordinates “to do
what they ought to do without persuasion.” Post, at 11
(internal quotation marks omitted). In its pursuit of a
“workable government,” Congress cannot reduce the Chief
Magistrate to a cajoler-in-chief.

The United States concedes that some constraints on
the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the
Constitution. See Brief for United States 47. It contends,
however, that the removal restrictions at issue here do
not.
To begin with, the Government argues that the Com­
mission’s removal power over the Board is “broad,” and
could be construed as broader still, if necessary to avoid
invalidation. See, e.g., id., at 51, and n. 19; cf. PCAOB
Brief 22–23. But the Government does not contend that
simple disagreement with the Board’s policies or priorities
could constitute “good cause” for its removal. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 41–43, 45–46. Nor do our precedents suggest as
much. Humphrey’s Executor, for example, rejected a
removal premised on a lack of agreement “ ‘on either the
policies or the administering of the Federal Trade Com­
mission,’ ” because the FTC was designed to be “ ‘inde­
pendent in character,’ ” “free from ‘political domination or
control,’ ” and not “ ‘subject to anybody in the government’ ”
or “ ‘to the orders of the President.’ ” 295 U. S., at 619, 625.
