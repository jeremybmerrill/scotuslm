Syllabus
3. The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the
remainder of the statute. Because “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part
of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its re
maining provisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm’n
of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234, the “normal rule” is “that partial . . . in
validation is the required course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,
472 U. S. 491, 504. The Board’s existence does not violate the sepa
ration of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by
§§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Concluding that the removal restric
tions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission
at will. With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains “ ‘fully
operative as a law,’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186,
and nothing in the Act’s text or historical context makes it “evident”
that Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose
members are removable at will, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480
U. S. 678, 684. The consequence is that the Board may continue to
function as before, but its members may be removed at will by the
Commission. Pp. 27–29.
4. The Board’s appointment is consistent with the Appointments
Clause. Pp. 29–33.
(a) The Board members are inferior officers whose appointment
Congress may permissibly vest in a “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].” Infe
rior officers “are officers whose work is directed and supervised at
some level” by superiors appointed by the President with the Senate’s
consent. Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662–663. Because
the good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and
void, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members
at will, in addition to its other oversight authority. Board members
are therefore directed and supervised by the Commission. Pp. 29–30.
(b) The Commission is a “Departmen[t]” under the Appointments
Clause. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887, n. 4, specifi
cally reserved the question whether a “principal agenc[y], such as”
the SEC, is a “Departmen[t].” The Court now adopts the reasoning of
the concurring Justices in Freytag, who would have concluded that
the SEC is such a “Departmen[t]” because it is a freestanding compo
nent of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within
any other such component. This reading is consistent with the com
mon, near-contemporary definition of a “department”; with the early
practice of Congress, see §3, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Court’s cases,
which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of
such an establishment. Pp. 30–31.
(c) The several Commissioners, and not the Chairman, are the
Commission’s “Hea[d].” The Commission’s powers are generally
vested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone. The
