FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY
ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.
BREYER, J., dissenting

“double for-cause” rule applies to appointees who are
“inferior officer[s].” Ante, at 2. And who are they? Courts
and scholars have struggled for more than a century to
define the constitutional term “inferior officers,” without
much success. See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con
stitution §1536, pp. 397–398 (3d ed. 1858) (“[T]here does
not seem to have been any exact line drawn, who are and
who are not to be deemed inferior officers, in the sense of
the constitution”); Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651,
661 (1997) (“Our cases have not set forth an exclusive
criterion for [defining] inferior officers”); Memorandum
from Steven G. Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney

of the Executive Branch: Officers of the United States
Within the Meaning of the Appointments Clause, p. 3
(Apr. 16, 2007) (hereinafter OLC Memo), online at

(“[T]he Supreme Court has not articulated the precise
scope and application of the [Inferior Officer] Clause’s
requirements”); Konecke, The Appointments Clause and
Military Judges: Inferior Appointment to a Principal
Office, 5 Seton Hall Const. L. J. 489, 492 (1995) (same);
Burkoff, Appointment and Removal Under the Federal
Constitution: The Impact of Buckley v. Valeo, 22 Wayne
L. Rev. 1335, 1347, 1364 (1976) (describing our early
precedent as “circular” and our later law as “not particu
larly useful”). The Court does not clarify the concept. But
without defining who is an inferior officer, to whom the
majority’s new rule applies, we cannot know the scope or
the coherence of the legal rule that the Court creates. I
understand the virtues of a common-law case-by-case
approach. But here that kind of approach (when applied
without more specificity than I can find in the Court’s
opinion) threatens serious harm.
The problem is not simply that the term “inferior officer”
is indefinite but also that efforts to define it inevitably
