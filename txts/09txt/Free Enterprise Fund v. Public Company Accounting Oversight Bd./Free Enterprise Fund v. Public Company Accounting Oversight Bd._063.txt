BREYER, J., dissenting

Myers, supra, at 161; emphasis added). Congress here has
“drawn” no power to itself to remove the Board members.
It has instead sought to limit its own power, by, for exam
ple, providing the Accounting Board with a revenue
stream independent of the congressional appropriations
process. See supra, at 19; see also Brief for Former SEC
Chairmen 16. And this case thereby falls outside the
ambit of the Court’s most serious constitutional concern.
In sum, the Court’s prior cases impose functional
criteria that are readily met here. Once one goes beyond
the Court’s elementary arithmetical logic (i.e., “one plus
one is greater than one”) our precedent virtually dictates
a holding that the challenged “for cause” provision is
constitutional.
D
We should ask one further question. Even if the “for
cause” provision before us does not itself significantly
interfere with the President’s authority or aggrandize
Congress’ power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a
bright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a
series of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable,
Congress might undercut the President’s central constitu
tional role? Cf. Strauss 625–626. The answer to this
question is that no such need has been shown. Moreover,
insofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails.
And in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious
than any imaginable harm this “for cause” provision might
bring about.
The Court fails to create a bright-line rule because of
considerable uncertainty about the scope of its holding—
an uncertainty that the Court’s opinion both reflects and
generates. The Court suggests, for example, that its rule
may not apply where an inferior officer “perform[s] adjudi
cative . . . functions.” Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. But the Ac
counting Board performs adjudicative functions.
