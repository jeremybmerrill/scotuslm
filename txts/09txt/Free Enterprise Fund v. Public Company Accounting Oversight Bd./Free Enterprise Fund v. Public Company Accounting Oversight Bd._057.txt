BREYER, J., dissenting

tional, 62 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 85 (2009), online at

prehensive nature of the Commission’s powers).
What is left? The Commission’s inability to remove a
Board member whose perfectly reasonable actions cause
the Commission to overrule him with great frequency?
What is the practical likelihood of that occurring, or, if it
does, of the President’s serious concern about such a mat

the Commission is constitutionally sufficient. See Hum

the Board is virtually absolute, then, as a practical matter,
the President’s control over the Board should prove suffi

At the same time, Congress and the President had good

First and foremost, the Board adjudicates cases. See 15

personal independence of those who even only sometimes
engage in adjudicatory functions. Humphrey’s Executor,
supra, at 623–628; see also Wiener, supra, at 355–356;
Morrison, 487 U. S., at 690–691, and n. 30; McAllister v.
United States, 141 U. S. 174, 191–201 (1891) (Field, J.,
dissenting). Indeed, as early as 1789 James Madison
stated that “there may be strong reasons why an” execu
tive “officer” such as the Comptroller of the United States
“should not hold his office at the pleasure of the Executive
branch” if one of his “principal dut[ies]” “partakes strongly
of the judicial character.” 1 Annals of Congress 611–612;
