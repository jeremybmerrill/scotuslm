Opinion of the Court

at 679. It ruled that the dual restraints on Board mem­
bers’ removal are permissible because they do not “render
the President unable to perform his constitutional duties.”
Id., at 683. The majority reasoned that although the
President “does not directly select or supervise the Board’s
members,” id., at 681, the Board is subject to the compre­
hensive control of the Commission, and thus the Presi­
dent’s influence over the Commission implies a constitu­
tionally sufficient influence over the Board as well. Id., at
682–683. The majority also held that Board members are
inferior officers subject to the Commission’s direction and
supervision, id., at 672–676, and that their appointment is
otherwise consistent with the Appointments Clause, id., at
676–678.
Judge Kavanaugh dissented. He agreed that the case
was one of first impression, id., at 698, but argued that
“the double for-cause removal provisions in the [Act] . . .
combine to eliminate any meaningful Presidential control
over the [Board],” id., at 697. Judge Kavanaugh also
argued that Board members are not effectively supervised
by the Commission and thus cannot be inferior officers
under the Appointments Clause. Id., at 709–712.
We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).

claims.

review any Board rule or sanction. See 15 U. S. C.
§§7217(b)(2)–(4), (c)(2). Once the Commission has acted,
aggrieved parties may challenge “a final order of the
Commission” or “a rule of the Commission” in a court of
appeals under §78y, and “[n]o objection . . . may be consid­
