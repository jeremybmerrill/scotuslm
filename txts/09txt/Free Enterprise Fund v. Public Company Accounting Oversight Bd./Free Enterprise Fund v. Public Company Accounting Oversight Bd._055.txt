BREYER, J., dissenting

for Former SEC Chairmen). And those organizations—
which rely on private financing and on officers drawn from
the private sector—exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory
authority that is pervasively controlled by, and is indeed
“entirely derivative” of, the SEC. See National Assn. of
Securities Dealers, Inc. v. SEC, 431 F. 3d 803, 806 (CADC

§§7211(c)(3),
7214(h), 7215(b)(1)–(4);
