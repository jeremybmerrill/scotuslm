BREYER, J., dissenting

413 U. S., at 557; see also Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367,
380–388 (1983) (describing the history of “Congressional
attention to the problem of politically-motivated removals”).
And so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the
many questions the majority’s opinion raises will not only
apply the Court’s new rule to its logical conclusion, but will
also determine that the only available remedy to certain
double for-cause problems is to invalidate entire agencies.
Thus, notwithstanding the majority’s assertions to the
contrary, the potential consequences of today’s holding are
worrying. The upshot, I believe, is a legal dilemma. To
interpret the Court’s decision as applicable only in a few
circumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbitrary. To interpret the rule more broadly will make the
rule more rational, but destructive.

One last question: How can the Court simply assume
without deciding that the SEC Commissioners themselves
are removable only “for cause”? See ante, at 5 (“[W]e
decide the case with th[e] understanding” “that the Commissioners cannot themselves be removed by the President except” for cause (emphasis added)). Unless the
Commissioners themselves are in fact protected by a “for
cause” requirement, the Accounting Board statute, on the
Court’s own reasoning, is not constitutionally defective. I
am not aware of any other instance in which the Court has
similarly (on its own or through stipulation) created a
constitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that
defect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional. Cf.
Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)

do not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal statute . . .
