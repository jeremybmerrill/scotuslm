Opinion of the Court

at all places where such shall be found necessary,” §3, 1
Stat. 234—thus treating him as the “Hea[d] of [a] De­
partmen[t]” without the title of Secretary or any role in
the President’s Cabinet. And it is consistent with our
prior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment
made by the head of such an establishment. See Freytag,
supra, at 917; cf. Burnap v. United States, 252 U. S. 512,
515 (1920); United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 511
(1879). Because the Commission is a freestanding compo­
nent of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or con­
tained within any other such component, it constitutes a
“Departmen[t]” for the purposes of the Appointments
Clause.11
But petitioners are not done yet. They argue that the
full Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board
members, because only the Chairman of the Commission
is the Commission’s “Hea[d].”12 The Commission’s powers,
however, are generally vested in the Commissioners
jointly, not the Chairman alone. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C.
§§77s, 77t, 78u, 78w. The Commissioners do not report to
the Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive
functions subject to the full Commission’s policies. See
——————
11 We express no view on whether the Commission is thus an “execu­
tive Departmen[t]” under the Opinions Clause, Art. II, §2, cl. 1, or
under Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. See Freytag v.
Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 886–887 (1991).
12 The Board argued below that petitioners lack standing to raise this
claim, because no member of the Board has been appointed over the
Chairman’s objection, and so petitioners’ injuries are not fairly trace­
able to an invalid appointment. See Defendants’ Memorandum of
Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Complaint
in Civil Action No. 1:06–cv–00217–JR (DC), Doc. 17, pp. 42–43; Brief
for Appellees PCAOB et al. in No. 07–5127 (CADC), pp. 32–33. We
cannot assume, however, that the Chairman would have made the
same appointments acting alone; and petitioners’ standing does not
require precise proof of what the Board’s policies might have been in
that counterfactual world. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,
533 (1962) (plurality opinion).
