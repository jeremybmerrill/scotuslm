BREYER, J., dissenting

U. S. 833, 859–860 (1986). Indeed, this Court has held
that the separation-of-powers principle guarantees the
President the authority to dismiss certain Executive
Branch officials at will. Myers v. United States, 272 U. S.
52 (1926).
But neither of these two principles is absolute in its
application to removal cases. The Necessary and Proper
Clause does not grant Congress power to free all Execu
tive Branch officials from dismissal at the will of the
President. Ibid. Nor does the separation-of-powers prin
ciple grant the President an absolute authority to remove
any and all Executive Branch officials at will. Rather,
depending on, say, the nature of the office, its function, or
its subject matter, Congress sometimes may, consistent
with the Constitution, limit the President’s authority to
remove an officer from his post. See Humphrey’s Executor
v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), overruling in part
Myers, supra; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988).
And we must here decide whether the circumstances
surrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.
In answering the question presented, we cannot look to
more specific constitutional text, such as the text of the
Appointments Clause or the Presentment Clause, upon
which the Court has relied in other separation-of-powers
cases. See, e.g., Chadha, supra, at 946; Buckley, supra, at
124–125. That is because, with the exception of the gen
eral “vesting” and “take care” language, the Constitution
is completely “silent with respect to the power of removal
from office.” Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 258 (1839); see
also Morrison, supra, at 723 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)
(“There is, of course, no provision in the Constitution
stating who may remove executive officers . . . ”).
Nor does history offer significant help. The President’s
power to remove Executive Branch officers “was not dis
cussed in the Constitutional Convention.” Myers, supra,
at 109–110. The First Congress enacted federal statutes
