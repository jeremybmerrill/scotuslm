FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

Syllabus 

Commissioners do not report to the Chairman, who exercises admin
istrative functions subject to the full Commission’s policies. There is
no reason why a multimember body may not be the “Hea[d]” of a
“Departmen[t]” that it governs. The Appointments Clause necessar
ily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts of Law,”
Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress appoints its officers col
lectively, see, e.g., Art. I, §2, cl. 5. Practice has also sanctioned the
appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies. Pp. 31–33.

537 F. 3d 667, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
ROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which SCALIA,
KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., joined. BREYER, J., filed a dissenting
opinion, in which STEVENS, GINSBURG, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.
