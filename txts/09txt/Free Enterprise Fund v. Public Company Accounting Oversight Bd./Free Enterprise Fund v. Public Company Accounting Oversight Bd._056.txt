FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


Accounting Board member who has unreasonably
“failed to enforce compliance with” the relevant
“rule[s], or any professional standard,” §7217(d)(3)(C)
(emphasis added);
•	 The Commission may at any time “relieve the Board
of any responsibility to enforce compliance with any
provision” of the Act, the rules, or professional stan
dards if, in the Commission’s view, doing so is in
“the public interest,” §7217(d)(1) (emphasis added).
As these statutory provisions make clear, the Court is
simply wrong when it says that “the Act nowhere gives the
Commission effective power to start, stop, or alter” Board
investigations. Ante, at 23–24. On the contrary, the
Commission’s control over the Board’s investigatory and
legal functions is virtually absolute. Moreover, the Com
mission has general supervisory powers over the Account
ing Board itself: It controls the Board’s budget, §§7219(b),
(d)(1); it can assign to the Board any “duties or functions”
that it “determines are necessary or appropriate,”
§7211(c)(5); it has full “oversight and enforcement author
ity over the Board,” §7217(a), including the authority to
inspect the Board’s activities whenever it believes it “ap
propriate” to do so, §7217(d)(2) (emphasis added). And it
can censure the Board or its members, as well as remove
the members from office, if the members, for example, fail
to enforce the Act, violate any provisions of the Act, or
abuse the authority granted to them under the Act,
§7217(d)(3). Cf. Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U. S. 311,
314–319 (1903) (holding that removal authority is not
always “restricted to a removal for th[e] causes” set forth
by statute); Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 729 (rejecting the “ar
guable premis[e]” “that the enumeration of certain speci
fied causes of removal excludes the possibility of removal
for other causes”). Contra, ante, at 22, n. 7. See generally
