FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

Opinion of the Court 


those circumstances, the Court sustained the statute.
Morrison did not, however, address the consequences of
more than one level of good-cause tenure—leaving the

Board’s conduct, to the same extent that he may hold the
