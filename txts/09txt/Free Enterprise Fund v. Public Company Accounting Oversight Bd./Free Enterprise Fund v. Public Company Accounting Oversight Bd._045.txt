BREYER, J., dissenting

supra, the Court invalidated—for the first and only time—
a congressional statute on the ground that it unduly lim
ited the President’s authority to remove an Executive
Branch official. But soon thereafter the Court expressly
disapproved most of Myers’ broad reasoning. See Hum
phrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 626–627, overruling in part
Myers, supra; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349, 352
(1958) (stating that Humphrey’s Executor “explicitly ‘dis
approved’ ” of much of the reasoning in Myers). Moreover,
the Court has since said that “the essence of the decision
in Myers was the judgment that the Constitution prevents
Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the power to remove
or the right to participate in the exercise of that power.’ ”
Morrison, supra, at 686 (emphasis added). And that fea
ture of the statute—a feature that would aggrandize the
power of Congress—is not present here. Congress has not
granted itself any role in removing the members of the
Accounting Board. Cf. Freytag, 501 U. S., at 878 (“separa
tion-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the
danger of one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the
expense of another branch” (emphasis added)); Buckley,
424 U. S., at 129 (same); Schor, 478 U. S., at 856 (same);
Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 727 (1986) (same). Com
pare Myers, supra, (striking down statute where Congress
granted itself removal authority over Executive Branch
official), with Humphrey’s Executor, supra, (upholding
statute where such aggrandizing was absent); Wiener,
supra (same); Morrison, supra (same).
In short, the question presented lies at the intersection
of two sets of conflicting, broadly framed constitutional
principles. And no text, no history, perhaps no precedent
provides any clear answer. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527
U. S. 41, 106 (1999) (THOMAS, J., joined by Rehnquist,
C. J., and SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that
“this Court” is “most vulnerable” when “it deals with
judge-made constitutional law” that lacks “roots in the
