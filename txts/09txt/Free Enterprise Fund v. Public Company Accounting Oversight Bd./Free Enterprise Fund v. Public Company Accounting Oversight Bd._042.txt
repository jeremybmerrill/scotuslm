FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


constitutional authority. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. As Chief Jus
tice Marshall wrote for the Court nearly 200 years ago, the
Necessary and Proper Clause reflects the Framers’ efforts
to create a Constitution that would “endure for ages to
come.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).
It embodies their recognition that it would be “unwise” to
prescribe “the means by which government should, in all
future time, execute its powers.” Ibid. Such “immutable
rules” would deprive the Government of the needed flexi
bility to respond to future “exigencies which, if foreseen at
all, must have been seen dimly.” Ibid. Thus the Neces
sary and Proper Clause affords Congress broad authority
to “create” governmental “ ‘offices’ ” and to structure those
offices “as it chooses.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138
(1976) (per curiam); cf. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355
(1903). And Congress has drawn on that power over the
past century to create numerous federal agencies in re
sponse to “various crises of human affairs” as they have
arisen. McCulloch, supra, at 415 (emphasis deleted). Cf.
Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 36–37 (1950).
On the other hand, the opening sections of Articles I, II,
and III of the Constitution separately and respectively
vest “all legislative Powers” in Congress, the “executive
Power” in the President, and the “judicial Power” in the
Supreme Court (and such “inferior Courts as Congress
may from time to time ordain and establish”). In doing so,
these provisions imply a structural separation-of-powers
principle. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 341–
342 (2000). And that principle, along with the instruction
in Article II, §3 that the President “shall take Care that
the Laws be faithfully executed,” limits Congress’ power to
structure the Federal Government. See, e.g., INS v.
Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983); Freytag v. Commis
sioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878 (1991); Northern Pipeline
Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 64
(1982); Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478
