BREYER, J., dissenting

U. S., at 854; Morrison, supra, at 691, n. 30, with ante, at
17–18 (ignoring these precedents). And we have also
upheld such restrictions when they relate to officials with
technical responsibilities that warrant a degree of special
independence. E.g., Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 624.
The Accounting Board’s functions involve both kinds of
responsibility. And, accordingly, the Accounting Board’s
adjudicatory responsibilities, the technical nature of its
job, the need to attract experts to that job, and the impor
tance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job
to the public strongly justify a statute that assures that
Board members need not fear for their jobs when compe

Commission as the ultimate authority over Board policies
and actions. See Part II–B, supra.
Third, consider how several cases fit together in a way
that logically compels a holding of constitutionality here.
In Perkins, 116 U. S., at 483, 484—which was reaffirmed
in Myers, 272 U. S., at 127 and in Morrison, supra, at 689,
n. 27—the Court upheld a removal restriction limiting the
authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove a “cadet
engineer,” whom the Court explicitly defined as an “infe
rior officer.” The Court said,
“We have no doubt that when Congress, by law,
vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads
of Departments it may limit and restrict the power of
removal as it deems best for the public interest. The
constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the
appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and
regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may
enact in relation to the officers so appointed.” Per
kins, supra, at 485 (emphasis added; internal quota
tion marks omitted).
See also Morrison, supra, at 723–724 (SCALIA, J., dissent
ing) (agreeing that the power to remove an “inferior offi
