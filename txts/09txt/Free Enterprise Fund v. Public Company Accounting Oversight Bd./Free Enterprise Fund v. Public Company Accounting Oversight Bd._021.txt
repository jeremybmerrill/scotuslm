Opinion of the Court

Commission accountable for everything else that it does.
The Commissioners are not responsible for the Board’s
actions. They are only responsible for their own determi­
nation of whether the Act’s rigorous good-cause standard
is met. And even if the President disagrees with their
determination, he is powerless to intervene—unless that
determination is so unreasonable as to constitute “ineffi­
ciency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Hum
phrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 620 (internal quotation
marks omitted).
This novel structure does not merely add to the Board’s
independence, but transforms it. Neither the President,
nor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer
whose conduct he may review only for good cause, has full
control over the Board. The President is stripped of the
power our precedents have preserved, and his ability to
execute the laws—by holding his subordinates accountable
for their conduct—is impaired.
That arrangement is contrary to Article II’s vesting of
the executive power in the President. Without the ability
to oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board’s failings to
those whom he can oversee, the President is no longer the
judge of the Board’s conduct. He is not the one who de­
cides whether Board members are abusing their offices or
neglecting their duties. He can neither ensure that the
laws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a
Board member’s breach of faith. This violates the basic
principle that the President “cannot delegate ultimate
responsibility or the active obligation to supervise that
goes with it,” because Article II “makes a single President
responsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.”
