FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

Opinion of the Court 


States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), we held that Congress can,
under certain circumstances, create independent agencies
run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom
the President may not remove at will but only for good
cause. Likewise, in United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483
(1886), and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988), the
Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of prin­
cipal executive officers—themselves responsible to the
President—to remove their own inferiors. The parties do
not ask us to reexamine any of these precedents, and we
do not do so.
We are asked, however, to consider a new situation not
yet encountered by the Court. The question is whether
these separate layers of protection may be combined. May
the President be restricted in his ability to remove a prin­
cipal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to
remove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer
determines the policy and enforces the laws of the United
States?
We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is
contrary to Article II’s vesting of the executive power in
the President. The President cannot “take Care that the
Laws be faithfully executed” if he cannot oversee the
faithfulness of the officers who execute them. Here the
President cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than
one level of good-cause protection, even if the President
determines that the officer is neglecting his duties or
discharging them improperly. That judgment is instead
committed to another officer, who may or may not agree
with the President’s determination, and whom the Presi­
dent cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees
with him. This contravenes the President’s “constitutional
obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.”
Id., at 693.
