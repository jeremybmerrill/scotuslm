FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY
ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.
BREYER J., dissenting
Appendix B to ,opinion of BREYER, J.

B
The table that follows lists the 573 career appointees in
the Senior Executive Service (SES) who constitute the
upper level management of the independent agencies
listed in Appendix A, supra. Each of these officials is,
under any definition—including the Court’s—an inferior
officer, and is, by statute, subject to two layers of for-cause
removal. See supra, at 25–30.
The data are organized into three columns: The first
column lists the “office” to which the corresponding official
is assigned within the respective agency and, where avail
able, the provision of law establishing that office. Cf.
supra, at 27 (citing Mouat, 124 U. S., at 307–308; Ger
maine, 99 U. S., at 510). The second and third columns
respectively list the career appointees in each agency who
occupy “general” and “reserved” SES positions. A “gen
eral” position is one that could be filled by either a career
appointee or by a noncareer appointee were the current
(career) occupant to be replaced.
See 5
U. S. C.
§3132(b)(1). Because 90% of all SES positions must be
filled by career appointees, §3134(b), “most General posi
tions are filled by career appointees,” Plum Book 200. A
“reserved” position, by contrast, must always be filled by a
career appointee. §3132(b)(1). The data for the “general
position” column come from the 2008 Plum Book, a quad
rennial manual prepared by the congressional committees
responsible for government oversight. See supra, at 29.
Positions listed as vacant in that source are not included.
The data for the “reserved position” column come from a
list periodically published by the Office of Personnel Man
agement and last published in 2006. See 72 Fed. Reg.
16154–16251 (2007); §3132(b)(4). Given the Federal Gov
ernment’s size and the temporal lag between the underly
ing sources, the list that follows is intended to be illustra
tive, not exact.
