Opinion of the Court

stantially insulated from the Commission’s control. The
Commission cannot remove Board members at will, but
only “for good cause shown,” “in accordance with” certain
procedures. §7211(e)(6).
Those procedures require a Commission finding, “on the
record” and “after notice and opportunity for a hearing,”
that the Board member
“(A) has willfully violated any provision of th[e] Act,
the rules of the Board, or the securities laws;
“(B) has willfully abused the authority of that mem­
ber; or
“(C) without reasonable justification or excuse, has
failed to enforce compliance with any such provision
or rule, or any professional standard by any registered
public accounting firm or any associated person
thereof.” §7217(d)(3).
Removal of a Board member requires a formal Commis­
sion order and is subject to judicial review. See 5 U. S. C.
§§554(a), 556(a), 557(a), (c)(B); 15 U. S. C. §78y(a)(1).
Similar procedures govern the Commission’s removal of
officers and directors of the private self-regulatory organi­
zations. See §78s(h)(4). The parties agree that the Com­
missioners cannot themselves be removed by the Presi­
dent except under the Humphrey’s Executor standard of
“inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” 295
U. S., at 620 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Brief
for Petitioners 31; Brief for United States 43; Brief for
Respondent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
31 (hereinafter PCAOB Brief); Tr. of Oral Arg. 47, and we
decide the case with that understanding.
