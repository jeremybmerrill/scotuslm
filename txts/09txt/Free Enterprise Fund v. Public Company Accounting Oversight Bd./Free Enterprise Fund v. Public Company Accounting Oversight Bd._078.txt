FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY
ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.
BREYER J., dissenting
Appendix A to ,opinion of BREYER, J.

APPENDIXES 

A

There are 24 stand-alone federal agencies (i.e., “depart
ments”) whose heads are, by statute, removable by the
President only “for cause.” Moreover, there are at least 24
additional offices, boards, or bureaus situated within
departments that are similarly subject, by statute, to for
cause removal provisions. The chart below first lists the
24 departments and then lists the 24 additional offices,
boards, and bureaus. I have highlighted those instances
in which a “for-cause” office is situated within a “for
cause” department—i.e., instances of “double for-cause”
removal that are essentially indistinguishable from this
case (with the notable exception that the Accounting
Board may not be statutorily subject to two layers of for
cause removal, cf. Part III, supra). This list does not
include instances of “double for-cause” removal that arise
in Article I courts, although such instances might also be
affected by the majority’s holding, cf. ante, at 26, n. 10.
Compare 48 U. S. C. §§1424(a), 1614(a), with 28 U. S. C.
§§631(a), (i), and 18 U. S. C. §§23, 3602(a).
