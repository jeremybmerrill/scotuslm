the challenged statute is valid”); Bowsher, 478 U. S., at
736 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Compared to
Congress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an
inferior understanding of the realities of administration,
and the manner in which power, including and most espe
cially political power, operates in context.
There is no indication that the two comparatively more
expert branches were divided in their support for the “for
cause” provision at issue here. In this case, the Act em

the House of Representatives and a by vote of 99 to 0 in the
Senate. 148 Cong. Rec. 14458, 14505 (2002). The creation

Act but did not express any separation-of-powers concerns.

asserted “over 500” “constitutional objections” through
signing statements “in his first term,” including 82 “related
