FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

Opinion of the Court 


Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §1(b)(1), 64 Stat. 1265. The
Chairman is also appointed from among the Commission­
ers by the President alone, id., §3, at 1266, which means
that he cannot be regarded as “the head of an agency” for
purposes of the Reorganization Act. See 5 U. S. C. §904.
(The Commission as a whole, on the other hand, does meet
the requirements of the Act, including its provision that
“the head of an agency [may] be an individual or a com­
mission or board with more than one member.”)13
As a constitutional matter, we see no reason why a
multimember body may not be the “Hea[d]” of a “Depart­
men[t]” that it governs. The Appointments Clause neces­
sarily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts
of Law,” Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress, too,
appoints its officers collectively, see Art. I, §2, cl. 5; id., §3,
cl. 5. Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomi­
nation of principal officers in the President to avoid the
perceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal
no similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose
appointments may be vested elsewhere, including in mul­
timember bodies. Practice has also sanctioned the ap­
pointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.
See Freytag, supra, at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment); see also Classification Act of
1923, ch. 265, §2, 42 Stat. 1488 (defining “the head of the
department” to mean “the officer or group of officers . . .

13 Petitioners

contend that finding the Commission to be the head will
invalidate numerous appointments made directly by the Chairman,
such as those of the “heads of major [SEC] administrative units.”
Reorg. Plan No. 10, §1(b)(2), at 1266. Assuming, however, that these
individuals are officers of the United States, their appointment is still
made “subject to the approval of the Commission.” Ibid. We have
previously found that the department head’s approval satisfies the
Appointments Clause, in precedents that petitioners do not ask us to
revisit. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 124 U. S. 525, 532 (1888);
Germaine, 99 U. S., at 511; United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 393–
394 (1868).
