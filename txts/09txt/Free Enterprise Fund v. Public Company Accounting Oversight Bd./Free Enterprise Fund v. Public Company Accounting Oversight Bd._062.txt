FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


cer” who is appointed by a department head can be re
stricted). Cf. ante, at 30–33 (holding that SEC Commis
sioners are “Heads of Departments”).
In Humphrey’s Executor, the Court held that Congress
may constitutionally limit the President’s authority to
remove certain principal officers, including heads of de
partments. 295 U. S., at 627–629. And the Court has
consistently recognized the validity of that holding. See
Wiener, supra; United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706
(1974); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 133–136; Chadha, 462 U. S.,
at 953, n. 16; Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 725–726; Morrison,
supra, at 686–693; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.
361, 410–411 (1989).
And in Freytag, 501 U. S., at 921, JUSTICE SCALIA stated
in a concurring opinion written for four Justices, including
JUSTICE KENNEDY, that “adjusting the remainder of the
Constitution to compensate for Humphrey’s Executor is a
fruitless endeavor.” In these Justices’ view, the Court
should not create a separate constitutional jurisprudence
for the “independent agencies.” That being so, the law
should treat their heads as it treats other Executive
Branch heads of departments. Consequently, as the Court
held in Perkins, Congress may constitutionally “limit and
restrict” the Commission’s power to remove those whom
they appoint (e.g, the Accounting Board members).
Fourth, the Court has said that “[o]ur separation-of
powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of
one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the expense of
another branch.” Freytag, supra, at 878 (emphasis added);
accord, Buckley, supra, at 129; Schor, supra, at 856; Mor
rison, supra, at 686; cf. Bowsher, supra. Indeed, it has
added that “the essence of the decision in Myers,” which is
the only one of our cases to have struck down a “for cause”
removal restriction, “was the judgment that the Constitu
tion prevents Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the
power to remove.’ ” Morrison, supra, at 686 (quoting
