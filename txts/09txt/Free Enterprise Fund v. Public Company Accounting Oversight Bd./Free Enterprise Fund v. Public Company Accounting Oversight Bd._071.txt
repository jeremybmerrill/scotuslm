rg1004.pdf. Numerous statutory provisions provide that
such officers may not be removed from office except for
cause (at least in peacetime). See, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§629–
632, 804, 1161, 1181–1185. And such officers can gener

§§612, 825, 1187, who themselves enjoy the same career
protections.
The majority might simply say that the military is
different. But it will have to explain how it is different. It
is difficult to see why the Constitution would provide a
President who is the military’s “commander-in-chief,”
Art. II, §2, cl. 1, with less authority to remove “inferior”
military “officers” than to remove comparable civil offi

any of “these positions,” “or any others,” might be deemed
unconstitutional under its new rule, preferring instead to
leave these matters for a future case. Ante, at 27. But
what is to happen in the meantime? Is the work of all
these various officials to be put on hold while the courts of
appeals determine whether today’s ruling applies to them?
Will Congress have to act to remove the “for cause” provi
sions? Cf. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 142–143. Can the Presi
dent then restore them via executive order? And, still,
what about the military? A clearer line would help avoid
these practical difficulties.
The majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the
Government’s ability to function while these many ques
