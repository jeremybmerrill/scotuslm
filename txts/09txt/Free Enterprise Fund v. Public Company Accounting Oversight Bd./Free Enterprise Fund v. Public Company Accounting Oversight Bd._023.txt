Opinion of the Court

487 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). Without a clear

see, e.g., post, at 6 (opinion of BREYER, J.). According to
the dissent, Congress may impose multiple levels of for­
cause tenure between the President and his subordinates
when it “rests agency independence upon the need for
technical expertise.” Post, at 18. The Board’s mission is
said to demand both “technical competence” and “apolitical
expertise,” and its powers may only be exercised by “tech­
