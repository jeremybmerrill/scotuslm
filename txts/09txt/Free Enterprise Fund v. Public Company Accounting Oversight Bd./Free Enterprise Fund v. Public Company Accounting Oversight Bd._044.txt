FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


that limited the President’s ability to oversee Executive
Branch officials, including the Comptroller of the United
States, federal district attorneys (precursors to today’s
United States Attorneys), and, to a lesser extent, the
Secretary of the Treasury. See, e.g., Lessig, Readings By
Our Unitary Executive, 15 Cardozo L. Rev. 175, 183–184
(1993); Teifer, The Constitutionality of Independent Offi
cers as Checks on Abuses of Executive Power, 63 B. U. L.
Rev. 59, 74–75 (1983); Casper, An Essay in Separation of
Powers: Some Early Versions and Practices, 30 Wm. &
Mary L. Rev. 211, 240–241 (1989) (hereinafter Casper); H.
Bruff, Balance of Forces: Separation of Powers in the
Administrative State 414–417 (2006). But those statutes
did not directly limit the President’s authority to remove
any of those officials—“a subject” that was “much dis
puted” during “the early history of this government,” “and
upon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained.”

dissenting); Casper 233–237 (recounting the Debate of
1789). Scholars, like Members of this Court, have contin
ued to disagree, not only about the inferences that should
be drawn from the inconclusive historical record, but also
about the nature of the original disagreement. Compare
ante, at 11; Myers, supra, at 114 (majority opinion of Taft,
C. J.); and Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91
Cornell L. Rev. 1021 (2006), with, e.g., Myers, supra, at
194 (McReynolds, J., dissenting); Corwin, Tenure of Office
and the Removal Power Under the Constitution, 27 Colum.

and the Administration, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 25–26 (1994)

and Congress: Power and Policy 86–89 (1972).
Nor does this Court’s precedent fully answer the ques
tion presented. At least it does not clearly invalidate the
provision in dispute. See Part II–C, infra. In Myers,
