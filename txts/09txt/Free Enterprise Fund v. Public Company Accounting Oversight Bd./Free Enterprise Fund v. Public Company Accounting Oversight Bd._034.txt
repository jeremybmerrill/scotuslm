FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

Opinion of the Court 


Constitution. App. 46. We reject such a broad holding.
Instead, we agree with the Government that the unconsti­
tutional tenure provisions are severable from the remain­
der of the statute.
“Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional
flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the prob­
lem,” severing any “problematic portions while leaving the
remainder intact.”
Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of
Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328–329 (2006). Be­
cause “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not
necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining
provisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation
Comm’n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932), the “normal
rule” is “that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the
required course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472
U. S. 491, 504 (1985). Putting to one side petitioners’
Appointments Clause challenges (addressed below), the
existence of the Board does not violate the separation of
powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed
by §§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Under the traditional
default rule, removal is incident to the power of appoint­
ment. See, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 70,
n. 17 (1974); Myers, 272 U. S., at 119; Ex parte Hennen, 13
Pet., at 259–260. Concluding that the removal restrictions
are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission
at will, and leaves the President separated from Board
members by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The
Commission is then fully responsible for the Board’s ac­
tions, which are no less subject than the Commission’s
own functions to Presidential oversight.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains “ ‘fully operative as a
law’ ” with these tenure restrictions excised. New York,
505 U. S., at 186 (quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,
480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987)). We therefore must sustain its
remaining provisions “[u]nless it is evident that the Legis­
lature would not have enacted those provisions . . . inde­
