FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER J., dissenting
Appendix D to ,opinion of BREYER, J. 


D
The table below lists 29 departments and other agencies
the heads of which are not subject to any statutory for
cause removal provision, but that do bear certain other
indicia of independence.
The table identifies six criteria that may suggest inde
pendence: (1) whether the agency consists of a multi
member commission; (2) whether its members are re
quired, by statute, to be bipartisan (or nonpartisan); (3)
whether eligibility to serve as the agency’s head depends
on statutorily defined qualifications; (4) whether the
agency has independence in submitting budgetary and
other proposals to Congress (thereby bypassing the Office
of Management and Budget); (5) whether the agency has
authority to appear in court independent of the Depart
ment of Justice, cf. 28 U. S. C. §§516–519; and (6) whether
the agency is explicitly classified as “independent” by
statute. See generally Breger & Edles 1135–1155; supra,
at 35–36. Unless otherwise noted, all information refers
to the relevant agency’s organic statute, which is cited in
the first column. The list of agencies is nonexhaustive.
