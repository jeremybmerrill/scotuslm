BREYER, J., dissenting

that 9-year period, Congress created at least three major
federal agencies without making any of their officers
removable for cause. See 48 Stat. 885, 15 U. S. C. §78d
(Securities and Exchange Commission), 48 Stat. 1066, 47
U. S. C. §154 (Federal Communications Commission); 46
Stat. 797 (Federal Power Commission) (reformed postHumphrey’s Executor as the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission with “for cause” protection, 91 Stat. 582, 42
U. S. C. §7171). By way of contrast, only one month after
Humphrey’s Executor was decided, Congress returned to
its pre-Myers practice of including such provisions in
statutes creating independent commissions. See §3, 49
Stat. 451, 29 U. S. C. §153 (establishing National Labor
Relations Board with an explicit removal limitation).
The fact that Congress did not make the SEC Commis
sioners removable “for cause” does not mean it intended to
create a dependent, rather than an independent agency.
Agency independence is a function of several different
factors, of which “for cause” protection is only one. Those
factors include, inter alia, an agency’s separate (rather
than presidentially dependent) budgeting authority, its
separate litigating authority, its composition as a multi
member bipartisan board, the use of the word “independ
ent” in its authorizing statute, and, above all, a political
environment, reflecting tradition and function, that would
impose a heavy political cost upon any President who tried
to remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.
See generally Breger & Edles 1135–1155.
The absence of a “for cause” provision is thus not fatal to
agency independence. Indeed, a “Congressional Research
Service official suggests that there are at least 13 ‘inde
pendent’ agencies without a removal provision in their
statutes.” Id., at 1143, n. 161 (emphasis added) (citing
congressional testimony). But it does draw the majority’s
rule into further confusion. For not only are we left with
out a definition of an “inferior officer,” but we are also left
