When previously deciding this kind of nontextual ques
tion, the Court has emphasized the importance of examin
ing how a particular provision, taken in context, is likely
to function. Thus, in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 53
(1932), a foundational separation-of-powers case, the
Court said that “regard must be had, as in other cases
where constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere mat

The Court repeated this injunction in Schor and again in
Morrison. See Schor, supra, at 854 (stating that the Court
must look “ ‘beyond form to the substance of what’ Con

whether, given the “functions of the officials in question,”
a removal provision “interfere[s] with the President’s

branches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles
torn from context”).
It is not surprising that the Court in these circum
stances has looked to function and context, and not to
bright-line rules. For one thing, that approach embodies
the intent of the Framers. As Chief Justice Marshall long
