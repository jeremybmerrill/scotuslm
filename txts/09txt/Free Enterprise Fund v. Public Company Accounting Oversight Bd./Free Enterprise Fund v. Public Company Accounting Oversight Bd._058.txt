FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


mately enacted limited Presidential control over the
Comptroller in a different fashion); see supra, at 4. The
Court, however, all but ignores the Board’s adjudicatory
functions when conducting its analysis. See, e.g., ante, at
17–18. And when it finally does address that central
function (in a footnote), it simply asserts that the Board
does not “perform adjudicative . . . functions,” ante, at 26,
n. 10 (emphasis added), an assertion that is inconsistent
with the terms of the statute. See §7215(c)(1) (governing
“proceeding[s] by the Board to determine whether a regis
tered public accounting firm, or an associated person
thereof, should be disciplined”).
Moreover, in addition to their adjudicative functions, the
Accounting Board members supervise, and are themselves,
technical professional experts. See §7211(e)(1) (requiring
that Board members “have a demonstrated” technical
“understanding of the responsibilities” and “obligations of
accountants with respect to the preparation and issuance
of audit reports”). This Court has recognized that the
“difficulties involved in the preparation of” sound auditing
reports require the application of “scientific accounting
principles.” United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 440
(1926). And this Court has recognized the constitutional
legitimacy of a justification that rests agency independ
ence upon the need for technical expertise. See Hum
phrey’s Executor, supra, at 624–626; see also Breger &
Edles, Established by Practice: The Theory and Operation
of Independent Federal Agencies, 52 Admin. L. Rev. 1111,
1131–1133 (2000) (explaining how the need for adminis
trators with “technical competence,” “apolitical expertise,”
and skill in “scientific management” led to original crea
tion of independent agencies) (hereinafter Breger & Ed
les); J. Landis, The Administrative Process 23 (1938)
(similar); Woodrow Wilson, Democracy and Efficiency, 87
Atlantic Monthly 289, 299 (1901) (describing need for
insulation of experts from political influences).
