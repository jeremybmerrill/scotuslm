FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

Opinion of the Court 


See supra, at 4; see also Art. II, §2, cl. 2. We do not decide
the status of other Government employees, nor do we
decide whether “lesser functionaries subordinate to offi­
cers of the United States” must be subject to the same sort
of control as those who exercise “significant authority
pursuant to the laws.” Buckley, supra, at 126, and n. 162.
Nor do the employees referenced by the dissent enjoy
the same significant and unusual protections from Presi­
dential oversight as members of the Board. Senior or
policymaking positions in government may be excepted
from the competitive service to ensure Presidential con­
trol, see 5 U. S. C. §§2302(a)(2)(B), 3302, 7511(b)(2), and
members of the Senior Executive Service may be reas­
signed or reviewed by agency heads (and entire agencies
may be excluded from that Service by the President), see,
e.g., §§3132(c), 3395(a), 4312(d), 4314(b)(3), (c)(3); cf.
§2302(a)(2)(B)(ii). While the full extent of that authority
is not before us, any such authority is of course wholly
absent with respect to the Board. Nothing in our opinion,
therefore, should be read to cast doubt on the use of what
is colloquially known as the civil service system within
independent agencies.10
Finally, the dissent wanders far afield when it suggests
that today’s opinion might increase the President’s author­
——————
10 For similar reasons, our holding also does not address that subset
of independent agency employees who serve as administrative law
judges. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C. §§556(c), 3105. Whether administrative law
judges are necessarily “Officers of the United States” is disputed. See,
e.g., Landry v. FDIC, 204 F. 3d 1125 (CADC 2000). And unlike mem­
bers of the Board, many administrative law judges of course perform
adjudicative rather than enforcement or policymaking functions, see
§§554(d), 3105, or possess purely recommendatory powers. The Gov­
ernment below refused to identify either “civil service tenure-protected
employees in independent agencies” or administrative law judges as
“precedent for the PCAOB.” 537 F. 3d 667, 699, n. 8 (CADC 2008)
(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting); see Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 07–5127
(CADC), pp. 32, 37–38, 42.
