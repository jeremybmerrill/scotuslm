FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 397–399 (1880); (7) United
States attorneys, Myers, supra, at 159; (8) federal mar
shals, Sieblod, supra, at 397; Morrison, 487 U. S., at 676;
(9) military judges, Weiss v. United States, 510 U. S., 163,
170 (1994); (10) judges in Article I courts, Freytag, 501
U. S., at 880–881; and (11) the general counsel of the
Department of Transportation, Edmond v. United States,
520 U. S. 651 (1997). Individual Members of the Court
would add to the list the Federal Communication Commis
sion’s managing director, the Federal Trade Commission’s
“secretary,” the general counsel of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, and more generally, bureau chiefs,
general counsels, and administrative law judges, see
Freytag, supra, at 918–920 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment), as well as “ordinary commis
sioned military officers,” Weiss, supra, at 182 (Souter, J.,
concurring).
Reading the criteria above as stringently as possible, I
still see no way to avoid sweeping hundreds, perhaps
thousands of high level government officials within the
scope of the Court’s holding, putting their job security and
their administrative actions and decisions constitutionally
at risk. To make even a conservative estimate, one would
have to begin by listing federal departments, offices, bu
reaus and other agencies whose heads are by statute
removable only “for cause.” I have found 48 such agencies,
which I have listed in Appendix A, infra. Then it would be
necessary to identify the senior officials in those agencies
(just below the top) who themselves are removable only
“for cause.” I have identified 573 such high-ranking offi
cials, whom I have listed in Appendix B, infra. They
include most of the leadership of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (including that agency’s executive director as
well as the directors of its Office of Nuclear Reactor Regu
lation and Office of Enforcement), virtually all of the
leadership of the Social Security Administration, the
