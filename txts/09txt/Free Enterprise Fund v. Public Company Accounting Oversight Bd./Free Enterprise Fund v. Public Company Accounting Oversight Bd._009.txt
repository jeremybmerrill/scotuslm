Opinion of the Court

I

A

After a series of celebrated accounting debacles, Con­
gress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (or Act), 116
Stat. 745. Among other measures, the Act introduced
tighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Board
is composed of five members, appointed to staggered 5­
year terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in
the securities industry—such as the New York Stock
Exchange—that investigate and discipline their own
members subject to Commission oversight. Congress
created the Board as a private “nonprofit corporation,” and
Board members and employees are not considered Gov­
ernment “officer[s] or employee[s]” for statutory purposes.
15 U. S. C. §§7211(a), (b). The Board can thus recruit its
members and employees from the private sector by paying
salaries far above the standard Government pay scale.
See §§7211(f)(4), 7219.1
Unlike the self-regulatory organizations, however, the
Board is a Government-created, Government-appointed
entity, with expansive powers to govern an entire indus­
try. Every accounting firm—both foreign and domestic—
that participates in auditing public companies under the
securities laws must register with the Board, pay it an
annual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.
§§7211(a), 7212(a), (f), 7213, 7216(a)(1). The Board is
charged with enforcing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the secu­
rities laws, the Commission’s rules, its own rules, and
professional accounting standards. §§7215(b)(1), (c)(4). To
this end, the Board may regulate every detail of an ac­
counting firm’s practice, including hiring and professional
