BREYER, J., dissenting

Here, the justification for insulating the “technical
experts” on the Board from fear of losing their jobs due to
political influence is particularly strong. Congress delib
erately sought to provide that kind of protection. See, e.g.,
148 Cong. Rec. 12036, 12115, 13352–13355. It did so for
good reason. See ante, at 3 (noting that the Accounting
Board was created in response to “a series of celebrated
accounting debacles”); H. R. Rep. No. 107–414, pp. 18–19
(2002) (same); Brief for Former SEC Chairmen 8–9. And
historically, this regulatory subject matter—financial
regulation—has been thought to exhibit a particular need
for independence. See e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 8857 (1914)
(remarks of Sen. Morgan upon creation of the Federal
Trade Commission) (“[I]t is unsafe for an . . . administra
tive officer representing a great political party . . . to hold
the power of life and death over the great business inter
ests of this country. . . . That is . . . why I believe in . . .
taking these business matters out of politics”). And Con
gress, by, for example, providing the Board with a revenue
stream independent of the congressional appropriations
process, §7219, helped insulate the Board from congres
sional, as well as other, political influences. See, e.g., 148
Cong. Rec. 12036 (statement of Sen. Stabenow).
In sum, Congress and the President could reasonably
have thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative Board
members from fear of purely politically based removal. Cf.
Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565
(1973) (“[I]t is not only important that the Government
and its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice,
but it is also critical that they appear to the public to be
avoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative
Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent”).
And in a world in which we count on the Federal Govern
ment to regulate matters as complex as, say, nuclear
power production, the Court’s assertion that we should
simply learn to get by “without being” regulated “by ex
