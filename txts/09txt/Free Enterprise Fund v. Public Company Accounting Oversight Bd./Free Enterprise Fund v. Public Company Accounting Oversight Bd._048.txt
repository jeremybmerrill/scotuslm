BREYER, J., dissenting 


they delegate administrative authority to the President
directly, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §2031(a)(1); 42 U. S. C. §5192(c);
sometimes they place authority in a long-established
Cabinet department, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §1637b(c)(1); 12
U. S. C. §5221(b)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. II); sometimes they
delegate authority to an independent commission or board,
e.g., 15 U. S. C. §4404(b); 28 U. S. C. §994; sometimes they
place authority directly in the hands of a single senior
administrator, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §657d(c)(4); 42 U. S. C.
§421; sometimes they place it in a sub-cabinet bureau,
office, division or other agency, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §4048;
sometimes they vest it in multimember or multiagency
task groups, e.g. 5 U. S. C. §§593–594; 50 U. S. C. §402
(2006 ed. and Supp. II); sometimes they vest it in commis
sions or advisory committees made up of members of more
than one branch, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §42(a); 28 U. S. C.
§991(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 42 U. S. C. §1975; sometimes
they divide it among groups of departments, commissions,
bureaus, divisions, and administrators, e.g., 5 U. S. C.
§9902(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 7 U. S. C. §136i–1(g); and
sometimes they permit state or local governments to
participate as well, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §2009aa–1(a). Statutes
similarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers—
for example, the power to make rules, develop informal
practices, investigate, adjudicate, impose sanctions, grant
licenses, and provide goods, services, advice, and so forth.
See generally 5 U. S. C. §500 et seq.
The upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes gov
erning vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast
numbers of different problems, provide for, or foresee,
their execution or administration through the work of
administrators organized within many different kinds of
administrative structures, exercising different kinds of
administrative authority, to achieve their legislatively
mandated objectives. And, given the nature of the Gov
ernment’s work, it is not surprising that administrative
