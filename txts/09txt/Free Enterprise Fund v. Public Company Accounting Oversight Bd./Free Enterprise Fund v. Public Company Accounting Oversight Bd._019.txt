Opinion of the Court

rior officers in the heads of Departments[,] it may limit
and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the
public interest.’ ” 116 U. S., at 485. Because Perkins had
not been “ ‘dismissed for misconduct . . . [or upon] the
sentence of a court-martial,’ ” the Court agreed that he was
“ ‘still in office and . . . entitled to [his] pay.’ ” Ibid.3
We again considered the status of inferior officers in
Morrison. That case concerned the Ethics in Government
Act, which provided for an independent counsel to investi­
gate allegations of crime by high executive officers. The
counsel was appointed by a special court, wielded the full
powers of a prosecutor, and was removable by the Attor­
ney General only “ ‘for good cause.’ ” 487 U. S., at 663
(quoting 28 U. S. C. §596(a)(1)). We recognized that the
independent counsel was undoubtedly an executive officer,
rather than “ ‘quasi-legislative’ ” or “ ‘quasi-judicial,’ ” but
we stated as “our present considered view” that Congress
had power to impose good-cause restrictions on her re­
moval. 487 U. S., at 689–691. The Court noted that the
statute “g[a]ve the Attorney General,” an officer directly
responsible to the President and “through [whom]” the
President could act, “several means of supervising or
controlling” the independent counsel—“[m]ost importantly

3 When Perkins was decided in 1886, the Secretary of the Navy was a
principal officer and the head of a department, see Rev. Stat. §415, and
the Tenure of Office Act purported to require Senate consent for his
removal. Ch. 154, 14 Stat. 430, Rev. Stat. §1767. This requirement
was widely regarded as unconstitutional and void (as it is universally
regarded today), and it was repealed the next year. See Act of Mar. 3,
1887, ch. 353, 24 Stat. 500; Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 167–
168 (1926); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726 (1986).
Perkins cannot be read to endorse any such restriction, much less in
combination with further restrictions on the removal of inferiors. The
Court of Claims opinion adopted verbatim by this Court addressed only
the authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove inferior officers.
