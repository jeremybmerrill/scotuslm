times be “elusive,” Chadha, 462 U. S., at 932, the answer
here seems clear: The remaining provisions are not “inca­

“[w]hether one is an ‘inferior’ officer depends on whether
he has a superior,” and that “ ‘inferior officers’ are officers
whose work is directed and supervised at some level” by
other officers appointed by the President with the Senate’s
