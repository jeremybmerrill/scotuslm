Opinion of the Court

ity to remove military officers. Without expressing any
view whatever on the scope of that authority, it is enough
to note that we see little analogy between our Nation’s
armed services and the Public Company Accounting Over­
sight Board. Military officers are broadly subject to Presi­
dential control through the chain of command and through
the President’s powers as Commander in Chief. Art. II,
§2, cl. 1; see, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§162, 164(g). The President
and his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry
or courts-martial to hear claims of misconduct or poor
performance by those officers. See, e.g., §§822(a)(1),
823(a)(1), 892(3), 933–934, 1181–1185. Here, by contrast,
the President has no authority to initiate a Board mem­
ber’s removal for cause.
There is no reason for us to address whether these
positions identified by the dissent, or any others not at
issue in this case, are so structured as to infringe the
President’s constitutional authority. Nor is there any
substance to the dissent’s concern that the “work of all
these various officials” will “be put on hold.” Post, at 31.
As the judgment in this case demonstrates, restricting
certain officers to a single level of insulation from the
President affects the conditions under which those officers
might some day be removed, and would have no effect,
absent a congressional determination to the contrary, on
the validity of any officer’s continuance in office. The only
issue in this case is whether Congress may deprive the
President of adequate control over the Board, which is the
regulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement
authority for a vital sector of our economy. We hold that it
cannot.

Petitioners’ complaint argued that the Board’s “freedom
from Presidential oversight and control” rendered it “and
all power and authority exercised by it” in violation of the
