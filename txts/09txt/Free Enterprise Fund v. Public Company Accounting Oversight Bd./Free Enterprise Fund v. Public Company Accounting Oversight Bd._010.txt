FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

Opinion of the Court 


development, promotion, supervision of audit work, the
acceptance of new business and the continuation of old,
internal inspection procedures, professional ethics rules,
and “such other requirements as the Board may pre­
scribe.” §7213(a)(2)(B).
The Board promulgates auditing and ethics standards,
performs routine inspections of all accounting firms, de­
mands documents and testimony, and initiates formal
investigations and disciplinary proceedings. §§7213–7215
(2006 ed. and Supp. II). The willful violation of any Board
rule is treated as a willful violation of the Securities Ex­
change Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U. S. C. §78a et seq.—
a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years’ imprison­
ment or $25 million in fines ($5 million for a natural per­

up to and including the permanent revocation of a firm’s

with any registered firm, and money penalties of $15
million ($750,000 for a natural person). §7215(c)(4).

Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 397 (1995), and that
its members are “ ‘Officers of the United States’ ” who
“exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of
the United States,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125–126
(1976) (per curiam) (quoting Art. II, §2, cl. 2); cf. Brief for
Petitioners 9, n. 1; Brief for United States 29, n. 8.
The Act places the Board under the SEC’s oversight,
particularly with respect to the issuance of rules or the
imposition of sanctions (both of which are subject to Com­
mission approval and alteration). §§7217(b)–(c). But the
individual members of the Board—like the officers and
directors of the self-regulatory organizations—are sub­
