BREYER, J., dissenting

conclude that the term’s sweep is unusually broad. Con
sider the Court’s definitions: Inferior officers are, inter
alia, (1) those charged with “the administration and en
forcement of the public law,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 139;
ante, at 2; (2) those granted “significant authority,” 424
U. S., at 126; ante, at 25; (3) those with “responsibility for
conducting civil litigation in the courts of the United
States,” 424 U. S., at 140; and (4) those “who can be said to
hold an office,” United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508,
510 (1879), that has been created either by “regulations”
or by “statute,” United States v. Mouat, 124 U. S. 303,
307–308 (1888).
Consider the definitional conclusion that the Depart
ment of Justice more recently reached: An “inferior officer”
is anyone who holds a “continuing” position and who is
“invested by legal authority with a portion of the sovereign
powers of the federal Government,” including, inter alia,
the power to “arrest criminals,” “seize persons or property,”
“issue regulations,” “issue . . . authoritative legal opin

sent “the United States to foreign nations,” “command”
military force, or enter into “contracts” on behalf “of the
nation.” OLC Memo 1, 4, 12–13, 15–16 (internal quotation
marks omitted; emphasis added).
And consider the fact that those whom this Court has
held to be “officers” include: (1) a district court clerk,
Hennen, 13 Pet., at 258; (2) “thousands of clerks in the
Departments of the Treasury, Interior and the othe[r]”
departments, Germaine, supra, at 511, who are responsi
ble for “the records, books, and papers appertaining to the
office,” Hennen, supra, at 259; (3) a clerk to “the assistant
treasurer” stationed “at Boston,” United States v. Hart
well, 6 Wall. 385, 392 (1868); (4 & 5) an “assistant
surgeon” and a “cadet-engineer” appointed by the Secre
tary of the Navy, United States v. Moore, 95 U. S. 760, 762
(1878); Perkins, 116 U. S., at 484; (6) election monitors, Ex
