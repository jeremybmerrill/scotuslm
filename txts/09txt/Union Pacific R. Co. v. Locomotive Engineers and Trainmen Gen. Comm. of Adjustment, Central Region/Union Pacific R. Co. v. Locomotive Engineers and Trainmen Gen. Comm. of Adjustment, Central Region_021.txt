Opinion of the Court

file). It bears repetition here that neither the Union nor
the Carrier, in its submissions to the Board, identified
conferencing as a “question in dispute.” See supra, at 7.
It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly
presented “data . . . in support of [the] employee[’s] [griev­
ance],” 29 CFR §301.5(d)—evidence the carrier had no
opportunity to consider prearbitration. A contrary rule
would sandbag the carrier. But conferencing is not a fact
bearing on the merits of a grievance. Indeed, there may be
no disagreement at all about the occurrence of conferenc­
ing, as the Union believed to be the case here. Moreover,
the RLA respects the right of the parties to order for
themselves the conference procedures they will follow.
See 45 U. S. C. §152 Sixth (“[N]othing in this chapter shall
be construed to supersede the provisions of any agreement
(as to conferences) . . . in effect between the parties.”). In
sum, neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be
read to require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB’s exercise of
jurisdiction, submission of proof of conferencing.

By refusing to adjudicate cases on the false premise that
it lacked power to hear them, the NRAB panel failed “to
conform, or confine itself,” to the jurisdiction Congress
gave it. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
It is so ordered.
