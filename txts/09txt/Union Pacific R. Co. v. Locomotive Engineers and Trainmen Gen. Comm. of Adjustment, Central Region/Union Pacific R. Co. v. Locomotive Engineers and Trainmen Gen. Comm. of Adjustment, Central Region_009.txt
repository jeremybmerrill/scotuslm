Opinion of the Court

“supersede the provisions of any agreement (as to confer­
ences) . . . in effect between the parties,” §152 Sixth; it is
undisputed that in common practice the conference may
be as informal as a telephone conversation.
If the parties fail to achieve resolution “in the usual
manner up to and including the chief operating officer of
the carrier designated to handle [minor] disputes,” either
party may refer the matter to the NRAB. §153 First (i).
Submissions to the Board must include “a full statement
of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the
disputes.” Ibid.; see 29 CFR §301.5(d), (e) (submissions
“must clearly and briefly set forth all relevant, argumen­
tative facts, including all documentary evidence”). Arbi­
tration is launched when the party referring the dispute
files a notice of intent with the NRAB; after Board ac­
knowledgment of the notice, the parties have 75 days to
file simultaneous submissions. NRAB, Uniform Rules of
Procedure (rev. June 23, 2003).
In creating the scheme of mandatory arbitration super­
intended by the NRAB, the 1934 Amendment largely

U. S., at 616; see Railway Conductors v. Pitney, 326 U. S.
561, 566 (1946) (“Not only has Congress . . . designated an
agency peculiarly competent to handle [minor disputes],
but . . . it also intended to leave a minimum responsibility
to the courts.”). Congress did provide that an employee
who obtained a monetary award against a carrier could
sue to enforce it, and the court could either enforce the
award or set it aside. Price, 360 U. S., at 616; 45 U. S. C.
§153 First (p) (1934 ed.). In addition to that limited role,
some Courts of Appeals, we noted in Price, reviewed
awards “claimed to result from a denial of due process of
law.” 360 U. S., at 616 (citing Ellerd v. Southern Pacific
R. Co., 241 F. 2d 541 (CA7 1957); Barnett v. PennsylvaniaReading Seashore Lines, 245 F. 2d 579, 582 (CA3 1957)).
In 1966, Congress again amended the scheme, this time
