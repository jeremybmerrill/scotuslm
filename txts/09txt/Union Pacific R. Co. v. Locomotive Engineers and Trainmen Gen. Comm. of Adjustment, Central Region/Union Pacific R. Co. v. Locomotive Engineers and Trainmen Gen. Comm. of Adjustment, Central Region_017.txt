Opinion of the Court

For example, we have held nonjurisdictional and forfeit­
able the provision in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq., requiring complainants to
file a timely charge of discrimination with the Equal Em­
ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before pro­
ceeding to court. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455
U. S. 385, 393 (1982). We have also held nonjurisdictional
and forfeitable the Title VII provision exempting employ­
ers who engage fewer than 15 employees. Arbaugh, 546
U. S., at 503, 515–516. And we have determined that a
Chapter 7 trustee’s (or creditor’s) limited time to object to
the debtor’s discharge, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004, is
a claim-processing, not a jurisdictional, matter. Kontrick,
540 U. S., at 446–447, 460. In contrast, relying on a long
line of this Court’s decisions left undisturbed by Congress,
we have reaffirmed the jurisdictional character of the time
limitation for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.
§2107(a). Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209–211
(2007). See also John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United
States, 552 U. S. 130, 132 (2008) (court must consider
sua sponte timeliness of lawsuit filed against the United
States in the Court of Federal Claims).
With these decisions in mind, we turn back to the re­
quirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last chance
prearbitration, attempt settlement “in conference,” 45
U. S. C. §152 Second, Sixth. See supra, at 4–5, and n. 3.
This obligation is imposed on carriers and grievants alike
but, we hold, its satisfaction does not condition the adjudi­
catory authority of the Board.
The Board’s jurisdiction extends to “all disputes between
carriers and their employees ‘growing out of grievances or
out of the interpretation or application of agreements
concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . .’ ”
Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240
(1950) (quoting §153 First (i)). True, the RLA instructs
that, before any reference to arbitration, the dispute “shall
