Opinion of the Court

divisions and not in conflict with the provisions of this
section”). And when the fact of conferencing is genuinely
contested, we see no reason why the panel could not ad­
journ the proceeding pending cure of any lapse. Circular
One does not exclude such a sensible solution.
The Carrier cites NRAB decisions that allegedly support
characterization of conferencing as jurisdictional. If the
NRAB lacks authority to define the jurisdiction of its
panels, however, surely the panels themselves lack that
authority. Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously
addressed the matter. For example, in NRAB Third Div.
Award No. 15880 (Oct. 26, 1967), the panel, although
characterizing the conferencing requirement as “jurisdic­
tional,” said that “[i]f one of the parties refuses or fails to
avail itself of a conference where there is an opportunity to
do so, it cannot then assert the defense of a lack of juris­
diction.” Id., at 2. See also NRAB Fourth Div. Award No.
5074 (June 21, 2001) (same); NRAB Third Div. Award No.
28147 (Oct. 16, 1989) (same). Cf. Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at
511 (“unrefined” uses of the word “jurisdiction” are enti­
tled to “no precedential effect” (internal quotation marks
omitted)). And in NRAB First Div. Award No. 23867, p. 5
(Apr. 7, 1988), the panel observed that the ordinary rem­
edy for lack of conferencing is to “dismiss th[e] claim with­
out prejudice to allow Claimant to cure the jurisdictional
defect.” That panel reached the merits nevertheless. Ibid.
Cf. Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 94 (“Jurisdiction is power to
declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only
function remaining to the [tribunal] is that of announcing
the fact and dismissing the cause” (quoting Ex parte
McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869)).). We note, in addition,
the acknowledgment of the Carrier’s counsel that, if con­
ferencing has not occurred, NRAB panels have stayed
arbitration to allow the parties to confer. Tr. of Oral Arg.
