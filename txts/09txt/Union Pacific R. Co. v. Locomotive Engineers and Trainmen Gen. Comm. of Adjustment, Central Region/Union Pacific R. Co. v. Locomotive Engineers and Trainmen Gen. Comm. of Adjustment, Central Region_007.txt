agreements or otherwise, in order to avoid any interrup­
tion to commerce or to the operation of any carrier . . . .”
§152 First; see Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co.,
394 U. S. 369, 377–378 (1969) (describing obligation to
pursue agreement as the “heart of the [RLA]”). As part of
its endeavor, Congress provided a framework for the
settlement and voluntary arbitration of “minor disputes.”
See Price, 360 U. S., at 609–610. (In the railroad industry,
the term “minor disputes” means, primarily, “grievances
arising from the application of collective bargaining
agreements to particular situations.” Id., at 609.)1
Many railroads, however, resisted voluntary arbitration.
See id., at 610. Congress therefore amended the Act in
1934 (1934 Amendment) to mandate arbitration of minor
disputes; under the altered scheme, arbitration occurs
before panels composed of two representatives of labor and
two of industry, with a neutral referee serving as tie­
breaker. See id., at 610–613. To supply the representa­
tive arbitrators, Congress established the NRAB, a board
of 34 private persons representing labor and industry in
equal numbers. §153 First (a); see Trainmen v. Chicago R.
& I. R. Co., 353 U. S. 30, 36–37 (1957).2 Neutral referees,
the RLA provides, shall be appointed by the representa­
tive arbitrators or, failing their agreement, by the Na­
tional Mediation Board. §153 First (l). The 1934 Amend­
ment authorized the NRAB to adopt, at a one-time session
in 1934, “such rules as it deems necessary to control pro­

contrast to minor disputes, which assume “the existence of a
collective agreement,” major disputes are those “over the formation of
collective agreements or efforts to secure them. . . . They look to the
acquisition of rights for the future, not to assertion of rights claimed to
have vested in the past.” Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325 U. S. 711,
723 (1945).
2 The RLA divides the NRAB into four Divisions, each covering speci­
fied classes of railroad employees. §153 First (h).
