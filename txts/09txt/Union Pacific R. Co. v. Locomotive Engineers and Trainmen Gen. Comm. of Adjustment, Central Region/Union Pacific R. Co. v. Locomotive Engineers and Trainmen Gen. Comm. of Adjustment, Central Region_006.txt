UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND
TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT
Opinion of the Court

cate grievances of railroad employees that remain unset­
tled after pursuit of internal procedures. 45 U. S. C. §153
First (h), (i). We consider in this case five nearly identical
decisions of a panel of the NRAB dismissing employee
claims “for lack of jurisdiction.” NRAB First Div. Award
No. 26089 etc. (Mar. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert.
65a–107a, 69a (hereinafter Panel Decision). In each case,
the panel declared that a procedural rule raised by a
panel member, unprompted by the parties, was “jurisdic­
tional” in character and therefore commanded threshold
dismissal.
The panel’s characterization, we hold, was misconceived.
Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the
presentation and processing of claims, §153 First (v), but
Congress alone controls the Board’s jurisdiction. By pre­
suming authority to declare procedural rules “jurisdic­
tional,” the panel failed “to conform, or confine itself, to
matters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB]
jurisdiction,” §153 First (q). Because the panel was not
“without authority to assume jurisdiction over the [em­
ployees’] claim[s],” Panel Decision 72a, its dismissals
lacked tenable grounding. We therefore affirm the judg­
ment of the Seventh Circuit setting aside the panel’s
orders.

Concerned that labor disputes would lead to strikes
bringing railroads to a halt, Congress enacted the Railway
Labor Act (RLA or Act), 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45
U. S. C. §151 et seq., in 1926 to promote peaceful and
efficient resolution of those disputes. See Union Pacific R.
Co. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 609 (1959); §151a. The Act
instructs labor and industry “to exert every reasonable
effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates
of pay, rules, and working conditions, and to settle all
