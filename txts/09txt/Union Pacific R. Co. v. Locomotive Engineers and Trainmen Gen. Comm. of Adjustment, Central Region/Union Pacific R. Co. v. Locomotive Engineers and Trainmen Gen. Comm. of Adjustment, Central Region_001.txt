UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD CO. v. BROTHERHOOD 

OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND TRAINMEN 

GENERAL COMMITTEE OF ADJUSTMENT,

CENTRAL REGION 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 08–604.

Argued October 7, 2009—Decided December 8, 2009

The Railway Labor Act (RLA or Act) was enacted to promote peaceful
and efficient resolution of labor disputes. As amended, the Act man
dates arbitration of “minor disputes” before panels composed of two
representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee as
tiebreaker. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 610–613. To

contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences,
but does not “supersede the provisions of any agreement (as to con
ferences) . . . between the parties,” §152 Sixth; in common practice
the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation. If the
parties fail to achieve resolution, either may refer the matter to the
NRAB. §153 First (i). Submissions to the Board must include “a full
statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the dis
putes.” Ibid. Parties may seek court review of an NRAB panel order
on one or more stated grounds: “failure . . . to comply with the re
quirements of [the RLA], . . . failure of the order to conform, or con
