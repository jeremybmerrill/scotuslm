ALBERT HOLLAND, PETITIONER v. FLORIDA
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 14, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
We here decide that the timeliness provision in the
federal habeas corpus statute is subject to equitable toll
ing. See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2244(d). We also consider its
application in this case. In the Court of Appeals’ view,
when a petitioner seeks to excuse a late filing on the basis
of his attorney’s unprofessional conduct, that conduct,
even if it is “negligent” or “grossly negligent,” cannot “rise
to the level of egregious attorney misconduct” that would
warrant equitable tolling unless the petitioner offers
“proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental
impairment or so forth.” 539 F. 3d 1334, 1339 (CA11
2008) (per curiam). In our view, this standard is too rigid.
See Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89,
96 (1990); see also Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 336
(2007). We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and remand for further proceedings.
