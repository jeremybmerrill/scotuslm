HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
Opinion of the Court

“Thank you very much.” App. 222–223.
Collins did not answer this letter. Nor did he file a federal
habeas petition as Holland requested.
On March 1, 2006, Holland filed another complaint
against Collins with the Florida Bar Association. See
Record, Doc. 41, Exh. 1, p. 8. This time the bar asked
Collins to respond, which he did, through his own attor
ney, on March 21. Id., at 2. And the very next day, over
three months after Holland’s AEDPA statute of limita
tions had expired, Collins mailed a proposed federal ha
beas petition to Holland, asking him to review it. See id.,
Doc. 20, Exh. W.
But by that point Holland had already filed a pro se
motion in the District Court asking that Collins be dis
missed as his attorney. App. 192. The State responded to
that request by arguing once again that Holland could not
file a pro se motion seeking to have Collins removed while
he was represented by counsel, i.e., represented by Collins.
See id., at 47–51. But this time the court considered
Holland’s motion, permitted Collins to withdraw from the
case, and appointed a new lawyer for Holland. See Re
cord, Docs. 9–10, 17–18, 22. And it also received briefing
on whether the circumstances of the case justified the
equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period for a
sufficient period of time (approximately five weeks) to
make Holland’s petition timely.
C
After considering the briefs, the Federal District Court
held that the facts did not warrant equitable tolling and
that consequently Holland’s petition was untimely. The
court, noting that Collins had prepared numerous filings
on Holland’s behalf in the state courts, and suggesting
that Holland was a difficult client, intimated, but did not
hold, that Collins’ professional conduct in the case was at
worst merely “negligent.” See District Court opinion 7–8,
