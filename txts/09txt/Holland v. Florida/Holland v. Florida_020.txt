Opinion of the Court

extraordinary circumstance stood in his way” and pre
vented timely filing. Pace, 544 U. S., at 418 (emphasis
deleted). In this case, the “extraordinary circumstances”
at issue involve an attorney’s failure to satisfy professional
standards of care. The Court of Appeals held that, where
that is so, even attorney conduct that is “grossly negligent”
can never warrant tolling absent “bad faith, dishonesty,
divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the
lawyer’s part.” 539 F. 3d, at 1339. But in our view, the
Court of Appeals’ standard is too rigid.
We have said that courts of equity “must be governed by
rules and precedents no less than the courts of law.”
Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996) (internal
quotation marks omitted). But we have also made clear
that often the “exercise of a court’s equity powers . . . must
be made on a case-by-case basis.” Baggett v. Bullitt, 377
U. S. 360, 375 (1964). In emphasizing the need for “flexi
bility,” for avoiding “mechanical rules,” Holmberg v. Arm
brecht, 327 U. S. 392, 396 (1946), we have followed a tradi
tion in which courts of equity have sought to “relieve
hardships which, from time to time, arise from a hard and
fast adherence” to more absolute legal rules, which, if
strictly applied, threaten the “evils of archaic rigidity,”
Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S.
238, 248 (1944). The “flexibility” inherent in “equitable
procedure” enables courts “to meet new situations [that]
demand equitable intervention, and to accord all the relief
necessary to correct . . . particular injustices.” Ibid. (per
mitting postdeadline filing of bill of review). Taken to
gether, these cases recognize that courts of equity can and
do draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for
guidance. Such courts exercise judgment in light of prior
precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific
circumstances, often hard to predict in advance, could
warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.
We recognize that, in the context of procedural default,
