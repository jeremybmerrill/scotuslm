SCALIA, J., dissenting

litigant is entitled to it only if he has diligently pursued
his rights and—the requirement relevant here—if “ ‘some
extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.’ ” Lawrence
v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 336 (2007) (quoting Pace v.
DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005)). Because the
attorney is the litigant’s agent, the attorney’s acts (or
failures to act) within the scope of the representation are
treated as those of his client, see Link v. Wabash R. Co.,
370 U. S. 626, 633–634, and n. 10 (1962), and thus such
acts (or failures to act) are necessarily not extraordinary
circumstances.
To be sure, the rule that an attorney’s acts and over
sights are attributable to the client is relaxed where the
client has a constitutional right to effective assistance of
counsel. Where a State is constitutionally obliged to
provide an attorney but fails to provide an effective one,
the attorney’s failures that fall below the standard set
forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984),
are chargeable to the State, not to the prisoner. See
Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986). But where
the client has no right to counsel—which in habeas pro
ceedings he does not—the rule holding him responsible for
his attorney’s acts applies with full force. See Coleman v.
Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 752–754 (1991).4 Thus, when a
state habeas petitioner’s appeal is filed too late because of
attorney error, the petitioner is out of luck—no less than if
he had proceeded pro se and neglected to file the appeal
himself.5

Court dismisses Coleman as “a case about federalism” and
therefore inapposite here. Ante, at 18 (internal quotation marks
omitted). I fail to see how federalism concerns are not implicated by
ad hoc exceptions to the statute of limitations for attempts to overturn
state-court convictions. In any event, Coleman did not invent, but
merely applied, the already established principle that an attorney’s acts
are his client’s. See 501 U. S., at 754.
