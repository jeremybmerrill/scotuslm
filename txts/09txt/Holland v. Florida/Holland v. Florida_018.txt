Opinion of the Court

the statute sets forth “explicit exceptions to its basic time
limits” that do “not include ‘equitable tolling.’ ” 519 U. S.,
at 351; see Brief for Respondent 27. The statute does
contain multiple provisions relating to the events that
trigger its running. See §2244(d)(1); Clay v. United States,
537 U. S. 522, 529 (2003); see also Cada v. Baxter Health
care Corp., 920 F. 2d 446, 450 (CA7 1990) (“We must . . .
distinguish between the accrual of the plaintiff’s claim and
the tolling of the statute of limitations . . .”); Wims v.
United States, 225 F. 3d 186, 190 (CA2 2000) (same);
Wolin v. Smith Barney Inc., 83 F. 3d 847, 852 (CA7 1996)
(same). And we concede that it is silent as to equitable
tolling while containing one provision that expressly refers
to a different kind of tolling. See §2244(d)(2) (stating that
“[t]he time during which” a petitioner has a pending re
quest for state postconviction relief “shall not be counted
toward” his “period of limitation” under AEDPA). But the
fact that Congress expressly referred to tolling during
state collateral review proceedings is easily explained
without rebutting the presumption in favor of equitable
tolling. A petitioner cannot bring a federal habeas claim
without first exhausting state remedies—a process that
frequently takes longer than one year. See Rose v. Lundy,
455 U. S. 509 (1982); §2254(b)(1)(A). Hence, Congress had
to explain how the limitations statute accounts for the
time during which such state proceedings are pending.
This special need for an express provision undermines any
temptation to invoke the interpretive maxim inclusio
unius est exclusio alterius (to include one item (i.e., sus
pension during state-court collateral review) is to exclude
other similar items (i.e., equitable tolling)). See Young,
supra, at 53 (rejecting claim that an “express tolling provi
sion, appearing in the same subsection as the [limitations]
period, demonstrates a statutory intent not to toll the
[limitations] period”).
Third, and finally, we disagree with respondent that
