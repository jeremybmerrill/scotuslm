HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
SCALIA, J., dissenting

rule that forestalls the start of a limitations period as
“effectively allow[ing] for equitable tolling.” Beggerly,
supra, at 48.
The Court does address §2244(d)(2), which undeniably
provides for poststart tolling, but dismisses it on the basis
that Congress had to resolve a contradiction between
§2244(d)’s 1-year time bar and the rule of Rose v. Lundy,
455 U. S. 509 (1982), that a federal habeas application
cannot be filed while state proceedings are pending. But
there is no contradiction to resolve unless, in the absence
of a statutory tolling provision, equitable tolling would not
apply to a state prisoner barred from filing a federal ha
beas application while he exhausts his state remedies.
The Court offers no reason why it would not, and our
holding in Young, 535 U. S., at 50–51, that tolling was
justified by the Government’s inability to pursue a claim
because of the Bankruptcy Code’s automatic stay, 11
U. S. C. §362, suggests that it would.3

ing provisions Congress included in §2244(d). Ante, at 15. But in the
pertinent passage, Young explained only that the inclusion of an
express tolling rule in a different provision regarding a different limita
tions period, 11 U. S. C. §507(a)(8)(A)(ii) (2000 ed.)—albeit a provision
within the same subparagraph as the provision at issue,
§507(a)(8)(A)(i)—did not rebut the presumption of equitable tolling.
See 535 U. S., at 53. Moreover, Young stressed that §507(a)(8)(A)(ii)
authorized tolling in instances where equity would not have allowed it,
which reinforced the presumption in favor of tolling. Ibid. Here, the
Court does not suggest that any of §2244(d)’s exceptions go beyond
what equity would have allowed.
