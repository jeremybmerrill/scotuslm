ALBERT HOLLAND, PETITIONER v. FLORIDA
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 14, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins as to
all but Part I, dissenting.
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996 (AEDPA), establishes a 1-year limitations period for
state prisoners to seek federal habeas relief, subject to
several specific exceptions. 28 U. S. C. §2244(d). The
Court concludes that this time limit is also subject to
equitable tolling, even for attorney errors that are ordinar
ily attributable to the client. And it rejects the Court of
Appeals’ conclusion that Albert Holland is not entitled to
tolling, without explaining why the test that court applied
was wrong or what rule it should have applied instead. In
my view §2244(d) leaves no room for equitable exceptions,
and Holland could not qualify even if it did.
I
The Court is correct, ante, at 13, that we ordinarily
presume federal limitations periods are subject to equita
ble tolling unless tolling would be inconsistent with the
statute. Young v. United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49 (2002).
That is especially true of limitations provisions applicable
to actions that are traditionally governed by equitable
principles—a category that includes habeas proceedings.
See id., at 50. If §2244(d) merely created a limitations
period for federal habeas applicants, I agree that applying
equitable tolling would be appropriate.
