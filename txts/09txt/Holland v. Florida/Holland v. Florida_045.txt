SCALIA, J., dissenting

do so—any more than it had reason to address the merits
of Holland’s habeas claims. Nor, contrary to the Court’s
implication, has the State conceded the issue. The foot
note of the State’s brief which the Court cites did just the
opposite: After observing that only the extraordinary
circumstance prong of the equitable-tolling test is at issue,
the State (perhaps astutely apprehensive that the Court
might ignore that fact) added that “to the extent the Court
considers the matter” of Holland’s diligence, “Respondent

Respondent 38, n. 19. The Court also cites a statement by
the State’s counsel at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 43,
and Holland’s counsel’s characterization of it as a conces

that the State does not dispute diligence in this Court,
where the only issue is extraordinary circumstances:
“Well, that goes to the issue . . . of diligence, of course,

Notwithstanding the Court’s confidence that the District
Court was wrong, it is not even clear that Holland acted

contacted Collins and the state courts, there were other
reasonable measures Holland could have pursued. For

while Holland’s state habeas petition was still pending—
Holland might have filed a “ ‘protective’ ” federal habeas
application and asked the District Court to stay the fed
eral action until his state proceedings had concluded. He
also presumably could have checked the court records in
the prison’s writ room—from which he eventually learned
of the state court’s decision, 539 F. 3d, at 1337—on a more
