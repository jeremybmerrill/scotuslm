HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
SCALIA, J., dissenting

Congress could, of course, have included errors by state
appointed habeas counsel as a basis for delaying the limi
tations period, but it did not. Nor was that an oversight:
Section 2244(d)(1)(B) expressly allows tolling for state
created impediments that prevent a prisoner from filing
his application, but only if the impediment violates the
Constitution or federal law.
If there were any doubt that equitable tolling is un
available under §2244(d) to excuse attorney error, we
eliminated it in Lawrence. The petitioner there asserted
that his attorney’s miscalculation of the limitations period
for federal habeas applications caused him to miss the
filing deadline. The attorney’s error stemmed from his
mistaken belief that—contrary to Circuit precedent (which
we approved in Lawrence)—the limitations period is tolled
during the pendency of a petition for certiorari from a
state postconviction proceeding. 549 U. S., at 336; see also
Brief for Petitioner in Lawrence v. Florida, O. T. 2006, No.
05–8820, pp. 31, 36. Assuming arguendo that equitable
tolling could ever apply to §2244(d), we held that such
attorney error did not warrant it, especially since the
petitioner was not constitutionally entitled to counsel.
Lawrence, supra, at 336–337.
Faithful application of Lawrence should make short
work of Holland’s claim. Although Holland alleges a wide
array of misconduct by his counsel, Bradley Collins, the
only pertinent part appears extremely similar, if not iden

Coleman, retained, see Brief for Respondent in Coleman v. Thompson,
O. T. 1990, No. 89–7662, pp. 33–34, 40, is irrelevant. The Sixth
Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, we have held,
applies even to an attorney the defendant himself hires. See Cuyler v.
Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 342–345 (1980). The basis for Coleman was
not that Coleman had hired his own counsel, but that the State owed
him no obligation to provide one. See 501 U. S., at 754. It would be
utterly perverse, of course, to penalize the State for providing habeas
petitioners with representation, when the State could avoid equitable
tolling by providing none at all.
