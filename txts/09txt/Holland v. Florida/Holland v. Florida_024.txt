Opinion of the Court

Respondent 38, n. 19; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 52. We think
that the District Court’s conclusion was incorrect. The
diligence required for equitable tolling purposes is “ ‘rea
sonable diligence,’ ” see, e.g., Lonchar, 517 U. S., at 326,
not “ ‘ “maximum feasible diligence,” ’ ” Starns v. Andrews,
524 F. 3d 612, 618 (CA5 2008) (quoting Moore v. Knight,
368 F. 3d 936, 940 (CA7 2004)). Here, Holland not only
wrote his attorney numerous letters seeking crucial in
formation and providing direction; he also repeatedly
contacted the state courts, their clerks, and the Florida
State Bar Association in an effort to have Collins—the
central impediment to the pursuit of his legal remedy—
removed from his case. And, the very day that Holland
discovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to
Collins’ failings, Holland prepared his own habeas petition
pro se and promptly filed it with the District Court.
Because the District Court erroneously relied on a lack
of diligence, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously
relied on an overly rigid per se approach, no lower court
has yet considered in detail the facts of this case to deter
mine whether they indeed constitute extraordinary cir
cumstances sufficient to warrant equitable relief. We are
“[m]indful that this is a court of final review and not first
view.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S.
103, 110 (2001) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks
omitted). And we also recognize the prudence, when faced
with an “equitable, often fact-intensive” inquiry, of allow
ing the lower courts “to undertake it in the first instance.”
Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 540 (2005) (STEVENS,
J., dissenting). Thus, because we conclude that the Dis
trict Court’s determination must be set aside, we leave it
to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the facts in
this record entitle Holland to equitable tolling, or whether
further proceedings, including an evidentiary hearing,
might indicate that respondent should prevail.
The judgment below is reversed, and the case is re
