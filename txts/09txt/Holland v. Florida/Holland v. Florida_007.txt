HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
Opinion of the Court

doned [me]” and said, “[I have] no idea what is going on
with [my] capital case on appeal.” Id., at 152. He added
that “Collins has never made any reasonable effort to
establish any relationship of trust or confidence with
[me],” id., at 155, and stated that he “does not trust” or
have “any confidence in Mr. Collin’s ability to represent
[him],” id., at 152. Holland concluded by asking that
Collins be “dismissed (removed) off his capital case” or
that he be given a hearing in order to demonstrate Collins’

ruling. Specifically, on March 3, 2005, Holland wrote:
“Dear Mr. Collins, P. A.:
“How are you? Fine I hope.
