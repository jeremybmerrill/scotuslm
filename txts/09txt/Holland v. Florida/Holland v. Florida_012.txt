Opinion of the Court

time frame for filing my 2254 petition began to run af
ter my case was affirmed on October 5, 2000, by the
Florida Supreme Court.’ As stated on page three of
[the recently filed] Petition for a writ of certiorari, Oc
tober 1, 2001 is when the United States Supreme
Court denied my initial petition for writ of certiorari
and that is when my case became final. That meant
that the time would be tolled once I filed my [postcon
viction] motion in the trial court.
“Also, Mr. Collins you never told me that my time
ran out (expired). I told you to timely file my 28
U. S. C. 2254 Habeas Corpus Petition before the dead
line, so that I would not be time-barred.
“You never informed me of oral arguments or of the
Supreme Court of Florida’s November 10, 2005 deci
sion denying my postconviction appeals. You never
kept me informed about the status of my case, al
though you told me that you would immediately in
form me of the court’s decision as soon as you heard
anything.
“Mr. Collins, I filed a motion on January 19, 2006
[in federal court] to preserve my rights, because I did
not want to be time-barred. Have you heard anything
about the aforesaid motion? Do you know what the
status of aforesaid motion is?
“Mr. Collins, please file my 2254 Habeas Petition
immediately. Please do not wait any longer, even
though it will be untimely filed at least it will be filed
without wasting anymore time. (valuable time).
“Again, please file my 2254 Petition at once.
“Your letter is the first time that you have ever
mentioned anything to me about my time had run out,
before you were appointed to represent me, and that
my one-year started to run on October 5, 2000.
“Please find out the status of my motion that I filed
on January 19, 2006 and let me know.
