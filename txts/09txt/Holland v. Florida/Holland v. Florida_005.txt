HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
Opinion of the Court

court.” §2244(d)(1). It also says that “[t]he time during
which a properly filed application for State post-conviction
. . . review” is “pending shall not be counted” against the 1
year period. §2244(d)(2).
On January 19, 2006, Albert Holland filed a pro se
habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court for
the Southern District of Florida. Both Holland (the peti
tioner) and the State of Florida (the respondent) agree
that, unless equitably tolled, the statutory limitations
period applicable to Holland’s petition expired approxi

for Respondent 9, and n. 7; Brief for Petitioner 5, and n. 4.
Holland asked the District Court to toll the limitations

AEDPA limitations clock began to run. See 28 U. S. C.

(2009) (slip op., at 6).
Thirty-seven days later, on November 7, 2001, Florida
appointed attorney Bradley Collins to represent Holland
in all state and federal postconviction proceedings. Cf.
Fla. Stat. §§27.710, 27.711(2) (2007). By September 19,
2002—316 days after his appointment and 12 days before
the 1-year AEDPA limitations period expired—Collins,
acting on Holland’s behalf, filed a motion for postconvic
tion relief in the state trial court. Cf. Brief for Respondent
9, n. 7. That filing automatically stopped the running of
