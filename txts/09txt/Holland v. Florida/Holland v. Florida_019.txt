HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
Opinion of the Court

equitable tolling undermines AEDPA’s basic purposes.
We recognize that AEDPA seeks to eliminate delays in the
federal habeas review process. See Day, 547 U. S., at 205–
206; Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003). But
AEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas
corpus principles and while seeking to harmonize the new
statute with prior law, under which a petition’s timeliness
was always determined under equitable principles. See
Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000) (“AEDPA’s
present provisions . . . incorporate earlier habeas corpus
principles”); see also Day, 547 U. S., at 202, n. 1; id., at
214 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman,
Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §24.2, pp.
1123–1136 (5th ed. 2005). When Congress codified new
rules governing this previously judicially managed area of
law, it did so without losing sight of the fact that the “writ
of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitu
tional rights.” Slack, 529 U. S., at 483. It did not seek to
end every possible delay at all costs. Cf. id., at 483–488.
The importance of the Great Writ, the only writ explicitly
protected by the Constitution, Art. I, §9, cl. 2, along with
congressional efforts to harmonize the new statute with
prior law, counsels hesitancy before interpreting AEDPA’s
statutory silence as indicating a congressional intent to
close courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim would
ordinarily keep open.
For these reasons we conclude that neither AEDPA’s
textual characteristics nor the statute’s basic purposes
“rebut” the basic presumption set forth in Irwin. And we
therefore join the Courts of Appeals in holding that
§2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling.
III
We have previously made clear that a “petitioner” is
“entitled to equitable tolling” only if he shows “(1) that he
has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some
