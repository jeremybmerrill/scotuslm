HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
Opinion of ALITO, J.

While Lawrence addressed an allegation of attorney
miscalculation, its rationale fully applies to other forms of
attorney negligence. Instead of miscalculating the filing
deadline, for example, an attorney could compute the
deadline correctly but forget to file the habeas petition on
time, mail the petition to the wrong address, or fail to do
the requisite research to determine the applicable dead
line. In any case, however, counsel’s error would be con
structively attributable to the client.
Second, the mere fact that a missed deadline involves
“gross negligence” on the part of counsel does not by itself
establish an extraordinary circumstance. As explained
above, the principal rationale for disallowing equitable
tolling based on ordinary attorney miscalculation is that
the error of an attorney is constructively attributable to
the client and thus is not a circumstance beyond the liti
gant’s control. See Lawrence, supra, at 336–337; Coleman,
supra, at 752–754; see also Powell v. Davis, 415 F. 3d 722,
727 (CA7 2005); Johnson v. McBride, 381 F. 3d 587, 589–
590 (CA7 2004); Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F. 3d 325, 330
(CA4 2000). That rationale plainly applies regardless
whether the attorney error in question involves ordinary
or gross negligence. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 754 (“[I]t
is not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters, but
that it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to coun
sel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor,
i.e., ‘imputed to the State’ ”); id., at 752 (rejecting the
contention that “[t]he late filing was . . . the result of
attorney error of sufficient magnitude to excuse the de
fault in federal habeas”).
Allowing equitable tolling in cases involving gross
rather than ordinary attorney negligence would not only
fail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also
be impractical in the extreme. Missing the statute of
limitations will generally, if not always, amount to negli
gence, see Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 336, and it has been
