Opinion of the Court

the AEDPA limitations period, §2244(d)(2), with, as we
have said, 12 days left on the clock.
For the next three years, Holland’s petition remained
pending in the state courts. During that time, Holland
wrote Collins letters asking him to make certain that all of
his claims would be preserved for any subsequent federal
habeas corpus review. Collins wrote back, stating, “I
would like to reassure you that we are aware of state-time
limitations and federal exhaustion requirements.” App.
55. He also said that he would “presen[t] . . . to the . . .
federal courts” any of Holland’s claims that the state
courts denied. Ibid. In a second letter Collins added,
“should your Motion for Post-Conviction Relief be denied”
by the state courts, “your state habeas corpus claims will
then be ripe for presentation in a petition for writ of ha

In mid-May 2003 the state trial court denied Holland

Supreme Court. Almost two years later, in February
2005, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral argument in
the case. See 539 F. 3d, at 1337. But during that 2-year

2006, Collins communicated with Holland only three

(SD Fla., Apr. 27, 2007), p. 7, n. 6 (hereinafter District
Court opinion), App. 91, n. 6.
Holland, unhappy with this lack of communication,
twice wrote to the Florida Supreme Court, asking it to
remove Collins from his case. In the second letter, filed on
June 17, 2004, he said that he and Collins had experi
enced “a complete breakdown in communication.” App.
160. Holland informed the court that Collins had “not
kept [him] updated on the status of [his] capital case” and
that Holland had “not seen or spoken to” Collins “since
April 2003.” Id., at 150. He wrote, “Mr. Collins has aban
