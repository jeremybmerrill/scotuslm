ALBERT HOLLAND, PETITIONER v. FLORIDA
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 14, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.
This case raises two broad questions: first, whether the
statute of limitations set out in the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C.
§2244(d), is subject to equitable tolling; and second, as
suming an affirmative answer to the first question,
whether petitioner in this particular case has alleged facts
that are sufficient to satisfy the “extraordinary circum
stances” prong of the equitable tolling test. I agree with
the Court’s conclusion that equitable tolling is available
under AEDPA. I also agree with much of the Court’s
discussion concerning whether equitable tolling is avail
able on the facts of this particular case. In particular, I
agree that the Court of Appeals erred by essentially limit
ing the relevant inquiry to the question whether “gross
negligence” of counsel may be an extraordinary circum
stance warranting equitable tolling. As the Court makes
clear, petitioner in this case has alleged certain facts that
go well beyond any form of attorney negligence, see ante,
at 3–4, 19, and the Court of Appeals does not appear to
have asked whether those particular facts provide an
independent basis for tolling. Accordingly, I concur in the
Court’s decision to reverse the judgment below and re
mand so that the lower courts may properly apply the
correct legal standard.
