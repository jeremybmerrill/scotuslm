HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
Opinion of ALITO, J.

Although I agree that the Court of Appeals applied the
wrong standard, I think that the majority does not do
enough to explain the right standard. It is of course true
that equitable tolling requires “extraordinary circum
stances,” but that conclusory formulation does not provide
much guidance to lower courts charged with reviewing the
many habeas petitions filed every year. I therefore write
separately to set forth my understanding of the principles
governing the availability of equitable tolling in cases
involving attorney misconduct.

“Generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the
burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been
pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraor
dinary circumstance stood in his way.” Pace v. DiGug
lielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005). The dispute in this case
concerns whether and when attorney misconduct amounts
to an “extraordinary circumstance” that stands in a peti
tioner’s way and prevents the petitioner from filing a
timely petition. I agree with the majority that it is not
practical to attempt to provide an exhaustive compilation
of the kinds of situations in which attorney misconduct
may provide a basis for equitable tolling. In my view,
however, it is useful to note that several broad principles
may be distilled from this Court’s precedents.
First, our prior cases make it abundantly clear that
attorney negligence is not an extraordinary circumstance
warranting equitable tolling. In Lawrence v. Florida, 549
U. S. 327, 336 (2007), the Court expressly rejected the
petitioner’s contention that “his counsel’s mistake in mis
calculating the limitations period entitle[d] him to equita
ble tolling.” “Attorney miscalculation,” the Court held, “is
simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, particu
larly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no
constitutional right to counsel.” Id., at 336–337 (citing
