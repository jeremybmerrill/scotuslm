Opinion of ALITO, J.

thwarted by forces wholly beyond the petitioner’s control.
The Court of Appeals apparently did not consider peti
tioner’s abandonment argument or assess whether the
State improperly prevented petitioner from either obtain
ing new representation or assuming the responsibility of
representing himself. Accordingly, I agree with the major
ity that the appropriate disposition is to reverse and re
mand so that the lower courts may apply the correct stan
dard to the facts alleged here.
