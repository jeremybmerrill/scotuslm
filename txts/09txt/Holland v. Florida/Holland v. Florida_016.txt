Opinion of the Court

also id., at 213 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“We have repeat
edly stated that the enactment of time-limitation periods
such as that in §2244(d), without further elaboration,
produces defenses that are nonjurisdictional and thus
subject to waiver and forfeiture” (citing cases)); Brief for
Respondent 22 (describing AEDPA limitations period as
“non-jurisdictional”).
We have previously made clear that a nonjurisdictional
federal statute of limitations is normally subject to a
“rebuttable presumption” in favor “of equitable tolling.”
Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95–96; see also Young v. United States,
535 U. S. 43, 49 (2002) (“It is hornbook law that limita
tions periods are ‘customarily subject to “equitable toll
ing” ’ ” (quoting Irwin, supra, at 95)).
In the case of AEDPA, the presumption’s strength is
reinforced by the fact that “ ‘equitable principles’ ” have
traditionally “ ‘governed’ ” the substantive law of habeas
corpus, Munaf v. Geren, 553 U. S. 674, 693 (2008), for we
will “not construe a statute to displace courts’ traditional
equitable authority absent the ‘clearest command,’ ” Miller
v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 340 (2000) (quoting Califano v.
Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 705 (1979)). The presumption’s
strength is yet further reinforced by the fact that Congress
enacted AEDPA after this Court decided Irwin and there
fore was likely aware that courts, when interpreting
AEDPA’s timing provisions, would apply the presumption.
See, e.g., Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 12).
Second, the statute here differs significantly from the
statutes at issue in United States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S.
347 (1997), and United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38
(1998), two cases in which we held that Irwin’s presump
tion had been overcome. In Brockamp, we interpreted a
statute of limitations that was silent on the question of
equitable tolling as foreclosing application of that doctrine.
But in doing so we emphasized that the statute at issue (1)
