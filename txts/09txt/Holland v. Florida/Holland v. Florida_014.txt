Opinion of the Court

App. 90–93. But the court rested its holding on an alter
native rationale: It wrote that, even if Collins’ “behavior
could be characterized as an ‘extraordinary circum
stance,’ ” Holland “did not seek any help from the court
system to find out the date [the] mandate issued denying
his state habeas petition, nor did he seek aid from ‘outside
supporters.’ ” Id., at 8, App. 92. Hence, the court held,
Holland did not “demonstrate” the “due diligence” neces
sary to invoke “equitable tolling.” Ibid.
On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District
Court that Holland’s habeas petition was untimely. The
Court of Appeals first agreed with Holland that
“ ‘[e]quitable tolling can be applied to . . . AEDPA’s statu
tory deadline.’ ” 539 F. 3d, at 1338 (quoting Helton v.
Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, 259 F. 3d 1310, 1312
(CA11 2001)). But it also held that equitable tolling could
not be applied in a case, like Holland’s, that involves no
more than “[p]ure professional negligence” on the part of a
petitioner’s attorney because such behavior can never
constitute an “extraordinary circumstance.” 539 F. 3d, at
1339. The court wrote:
“We will assume that Collins’s alleged conduct is neg
ligent, even grossly negligent. But in our view, no al
legation of lawyer negligence or of failure to meet a
lawyer’s standard of care—in the absence of an allega
tion and proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty,
mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer’s part—
can rise to the level of egregious attorney misconduct
that would entitle Petitioner to equitable tolling.”
Ibid.
Holland made “no allegation” that Collins had made a
“knowing or reckless factual misrepresentation,” or that
he exhibited “dishonesty,” “divided loyalty,” or “mental
impairment.” Ibid. Hence, the court held, equitable toll
ing was per se inapplicable to Holland’s habeas petition.
