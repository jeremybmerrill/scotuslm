Opinion of the Court

to whether client who was “effectively abandoned” by
lawyer merited tolling); Calderon, 128 F. 3d, at 1289
(allowing tolling where client was prejudiced by a last
minute change in representation that was beyond his
control); Baldayaque, 338 F. 3d, at 152–153 (finding that
where an attorney failed to perform an essential service,
to communicate with the client, and to do basic legal
research, tolling could, under the circumstances, be war

we are not considering, a “garden variety claim” of attor
ney negligence. Rather, the facts of this case present far
more serious instances of attorney misconduct. And, as
we have said, although the circumstances of a case must
be “extraordinary” before equitable tolling can be applied,
we hold that such circumstances are not limited to those
that satisfy the test that the Court of Appeals used in this
case.
IV
The record facts that we have set forth in Part I of this
opinion suggest that this case may well be an “extraordi
nary” instance in which petitioner’s attorney’s conduct
constituted far more than “garden variety” or “excusable
neglect.” To be sure, Collins failed to file Holland’s peti
