SCALIA, J., dissenting

bar is subject to tolling, but whether it is consistent with
§2244(d) for federal courts to toll the time bar for addi
tional reasons beyond those Congress included.
In my view it is not. It is fair enough to infer, when a
statute of limitations says nothing about equitable tolling,
that Congress did not displace the default rule. But when
Congress has codified that default rule and specified the
instances where it applies, we have no warrant to extend
it to other cases. See United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S.
38, 48–49 (1998). Unless the Court believes §2244(d)
contains an implicit, across-the-board exception that
subsumes (and thus renders unnecessary) §2244(d)(1)(B)–
(D) and (d)(2), it must rely on the untenable assumption
that when Congress enumerated the events that toll the
limitations period—with no indication the list is merely
illustrative—it implicitly authorized courts to add others
as they see fit. We should assume the opposite: that by
specifying situations in which an equitable principle ap
plies to a specific requirement, Congress has displaced
courts’ discretion to develop ad hoc exceptions. Cf. Lon
char v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 326–328 (1996).
The Court’s responses are unpersuasive. It brushes
aside §2244(d)(1)(B)–(D), apparently because those subdi
visions merely delay the start of the limitations period but
do not suspend a limitations period already underway.
Ante, at 15. But the Court does not explain why that
distinction makes any difference,2 and we have described a

2 The Court cites several Court of Appeals cases that support its trig
gering-tolling distinction, ante, at 15, but no case of ours that does so.
Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 529 (2003), described
§2244(d)(1)(A) as containing “triggers” for the limitations period, but it
did not distinguish delaying the start of the limitations period from
tolling. The Court of Appeals cases the Court cites, Cada v. Baxter
Healthcare Corp., 920 F. 2d 446, 450 (CA7 1990), Wolin v. Smith
Barney Inc., 83 F. 3d 847, 852 (CA7 1996), and Wims v. United States,
225 F. 3d 186, 190 (CA2 2000), rely on a distinction between accrual
rules and tolling that we have since disregarded, see TRW Inc. v.
