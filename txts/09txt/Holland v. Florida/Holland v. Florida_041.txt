SCALIA, J., dissenting

pending. Ante, at 19–20. But even taken at face value,
Collins’s silence prior to November 10, 2005, did not pre
vent Holland from filing a timely federal application once
the Florida courts were finished with his case. The Court
also appears to think significant Collins’s correspondence
with Holland in January 2006, after the limitations period
had elapsed. Ante, at 5–10, 20. But unless Holland can
establish that the time-bar should be tolled due to events
before December 15, 2005, any misconduct by Collins after

For his part, Holland now asserts that Collins did not

tolling below. See 539 F. 3d 1334, 1339 (CA11 2008) (per
curiam).8 In any event, the deception of which he com

representation that he would protect Holland’s ability to
assert his claims in federal court, see App. 55, 62, coupled
with Collins’s later failure to do so. That, of course, does
not by itself amount to deception, and Holland offers no
evidence that Collins meant to mislead him. Moreover,
Holland can hardly claim to have been caught off guard.
Collins’s failures to respond to Holland’s repeated requests
for information before the State Supreme Court ruled gave
Holland even greater reason to suspect that Collins had
fallen asleep at the switch. Holland indeed was under no

8 Holland insists that he did allege deception below, see Brief for Peti
tioner 31, n. 29, but cites only a conclusory allegation in an unrelated
motion (a motion for appointment of new counsel). See App. 194. His
reply to the State’s response to the order to show cause, drafted by new
counsel, did not allege deception. 1 Record, Doc. 35.
