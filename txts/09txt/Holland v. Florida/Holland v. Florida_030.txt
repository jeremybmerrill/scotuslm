Opinion of ALITO, J.

aptly said that gross negligence is ordinary negligence
with a vituperative epithet added. Therefore, if gross
negligence may be enough for equitable tolling, there will
be a basis for arguing that tolling is appropriate in almost
every counseled case involving a missed deadline. See
ibid. (argument that attorney miscalculation is an ex
traordinary circumstance, if credited, “would essentially
equitably toll limitations periods for every person whose
attorney missed a deadline”). This would not just impose
a severe burden on the district courts; it would also make
the availability of tolling turn on the highly artificial
distinction between gross and ordinary negligence. That
line would be hard to administer, would needlessly con
sume scarce judicial resources, and would almost certainly
yield inconsistent and often unsatisfying results. See
Baldayaque v. United States, 338 F. 3d 145, 155 (CA2
2003) (Jacobs, J., concurring) (noting that the “distinction
between ordinary and extraordinary attorney malpractice
. . . is elusive, hard to apply, and counterintuitive”).
Finally, it is worth noting that a rule that distinguishes
between ordinary and gross attorney negligence for pur
poses of the equitable tolling analysis would have demon
strably “inequitable” consequences. For example, it is
hard to see why a habeas petitioner should be effectively
penalized just because his counsel was negligent rather
than grossly negligent, or why the State should be penal
ized just because petitioner’s counsel was grossly negligent
rather than moderately negligent. Regardless of how one
characterizes counsel’s deficient performance in such
cases, the petitioner is not personally at fault for the
untimely filing, attorney error is a but-for cause of the late
filing, and the governmental interest in enforcing the
statutory limitations period is the same.
