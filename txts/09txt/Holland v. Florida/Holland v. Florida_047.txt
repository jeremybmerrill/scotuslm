SCALIA, J., dissenting

a capital sentence. But the Constitution does not em
power federal courts to rewrite, in the name of equity,
rules that Congress has made. Endowing unelected
judges with that power is irreconcilable with our system,
for it “would literally place the whole rights and property
of the community under the arbitrary will of the judge,”
arming him with “a despotic and sovereign authority,” 1 J.
Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence §19, p. 19
(14th ed. 1918). The danger is doubled when we disregard
our own precedent, leaving only our own consciences
to constrain our discretion. Because both the statute
and stare decisis foreclose Holland’s claim, I respectfully
dissent.
