HOLLAND v. FLORIDA
Opinion of the Court

Collins understood AEDPA law, the limitations period
applicable to Holland’s federal habeas application had in
fact expired in 2000—before Collins had begun to repre
sent Holland. Specifically, Collins wrote:
“Dear Mr. Holland:
“I am in receipt of your letter dated January 20,
2006 concerning operation of AEDPA time limitations.
One hurdle in our upcoming efforts at obtaining fed

statutory time frame for filing such a petition began to

Holland’s 1-year limitations period did not begin to run

which occurred on October 1, 2001. See 28 U. S. C.
§2244(d)(1)(A); Jimenez, 555 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6);
Bond v. Moore, 309 F. 3d 770, 774 (CA11 2002). And when
Collins was appointed (on November 7, 2001) the AEDPA
clock therefore had 328 days left to go.
Holland immediately wrote back to Collins, pointing this
out.
“Dear Mr. Collins:
“I received your letter dated January 31, 2006. You
are incorrect in stating that ‘the one-year statutory
