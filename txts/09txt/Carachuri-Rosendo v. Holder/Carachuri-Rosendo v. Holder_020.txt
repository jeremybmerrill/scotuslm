Opinion of the Court

no empirical data suggesting that “even a single eager
Assistant United States Attorney” has ever sought to
prosecute a comparable federal defendant as a felon. 549
U. S., at 57–58. The Government’s “hypothetical” ap
proach to this case is therefore misleading as well as
speculative, in that Carachuri-Rosendo’s federal-court
counterpart would not, in actuality, have faced any felony
charge.
Finally, as we noted in Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1,
11, n. 8 (2004), ambiguities in criminal statutes referenced
in immigration laws should be construed in the nonciti
zen’s favor. And here the critical language appears in a
criminal statute, 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2).
We note that whether a noncitizen has committed an
“aggravated felony” is relevant, inter alia, to the type of
relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to
whether he is in fact removable. In other words, to the
extent that our rejection of the Government’s broad un
derstanding of the scope of “aggravated felony” may have
any practical effect on policing our Nation’s borders, it is a
limited one. Carachuri-Rosendo, and others in his posi
tion, may now seek cancellation of removal and thereby
avoid the harsh consequence of mandatory removal. But
he will not avoid the fact that his conviction makes him, in
the first instance, removable. Any relief he may obtain
depends upon the discretion of the Attorney General.

In sum, the Government is correct that to qualify as an
“aggravated felony” under the INA, the conduct prohibited
by state law must be punishable as a felony under federal
law. See Lopez, 549 U. S., at 60. But as the text and
structure of the relevant statutory provisions demon
strate, the defendant must also have been actually con
victed of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under
federal law. The mere possibility that the defendant’s
