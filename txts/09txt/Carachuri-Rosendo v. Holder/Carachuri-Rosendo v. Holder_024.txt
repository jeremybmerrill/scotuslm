SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

charged in the indictment. In other words, a misdemeanor
offense with a sentencing factor that raises its punishment
to the felony level qualifies for purposes of establishing the
elements of a “felony punishable under the Controlled
Substances Act”; but does not qualify for purposes of de
termining what elements the alien has been “convicted of.”
Here, Carachuri-Rosendo was only “convicted of” the
crime of knowing possession of a controlled substance
without a valid prescription, a Class A misdemeanor
under Texas law. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.
§§481.117(a) and (b) (West Supp. 2009). Since the ele
ments of that crime did not include recidivism, the crime
of his conviction did not “correspond” to the Controlled
Substances Act felony of possession-plus-recidivism under
21 U. S. C. §844(a).
For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.
