CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

sion conviction before trial, or before a guilty plea. See 21
U. S. C. §851(a)(1).5 Notice, plus an opportunity to chal
lenge the validity of the prior conviction used to enhance
the current conviction, §§851(b)–(c), are mandatory pre
requisites to obtaining a punishment based on the fact of a
prior conviction.6 And they are also necessary prerequi
sites under federal law to “authorize” a felony punish
ment, 18 U. S. C. §3559(a), for the type of simple posses
sion offense at issue in this case.
Neither the definition of an “illicit trafficking” offense
under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(B) nor that of a “drug traf
ficking crime” under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2) describes or
references any state offenses. The “aggravated felony”
definition does explain that the term applies “to an offense
described in this paragraph whether in violation of Fed
eral or State law.” §1101(a)(43). But in Lopez v. Gonzales,
549 U. S. 47, 56 (2006), we determined that, in order to be

5 This subsection provides: “No person who stands convicted of an
offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by
reason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or before
entry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information
with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or
counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be
relied upon.” §851(a)(1).
6 We have previously recognized the mandatory nature of these re
quirements, as have the courts of appeals. See United States v. LaBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 754, n. 1 (1997) (“We note that imposition of an
enhanced penalty [for recidivism] is not automatic. . . . If the Govern
ment does not file such notice [under 21 U. S. C. §851(a)(1)] . . . the
lower sentencing range will be applied even though the defendant may
otherwise be eligible for the increased penalty”); see also, e.g., United
States v. Beasley, 495 F. 3d 142, 148 (CA4 2007); United States v.
Ceballos, 302 F. 3d 679, 690–692 (CA7 2002); United States v. Dodson,
288 F. 3d 153, 159 (CA5 2002); United States v. Mooring, 287 F. 3d 725,
727–728 (CA8 2002). Although §851’s procedural safeguards are not
constitutionally compelled, see Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 247,
they are nevertheless a mandatory feature of the Controlled Substances
Act and a prerequisite to securing a felony conviction under §844(a) for
a successive simple possession offense.
