JOSE ANGEL CARACHURI-ROSENDO, PETITIONER v.
ERIC H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[June 14, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that Carachuri-Rosendo’s 2005
conviction for simple possession of a tablet of Xanax in
violation of Texas law is not a conviction for an “aggra

Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attor
ney General may cancel the removal of an alien from the
United States provided the alien “has not been convicted

statutory definition of “convicted,” but a “conviction” is
defined to mean a “formal judgment of guilt of the alien
entered by a court.” §1101(a)(48)(A). The term “aggra
vated felony” includes, among many other offenses, “a
drug trafficking crime (as defined in [18 U. S. C. §924(c)]).”
§1101(a)(43)(B). A “drug trafficking crime” is in turn

Substances Act.” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(2).
It could be concluded from the provisions discussed
above that only a federal conviction for a felony offense
under the Controlled Substances Act would qualify under
8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(B). But the penultimate sentence
in §1101(a)(43) provides that the statutory definition of
“aggravated felony” “applies to an offense described in this
