CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

came to the United States with his parents in 1983 and
has been a lawful permanent resident of Texas ever since.
His common-law wife and four children are American
citizens, as are his mother and two sisters.
Like so many in this country, Carachuri-Rosendo has
gotten into some trouble with our drug laws. In 2004, he
pleaded guilty to possessing less than two ounces of mari
juana, a Class B misdemeanor, and was sentenced to
confinement for 20 days by a Texas court. See App. 19a–
22a; Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§481.121(a) and
(b)(1) (West 2003). In 2005, he pleaded nolo contendere to
possessing less than 28 grams—one tablet—of alprazolam
(known commercially as Xanax) without a prescription, a
Class A misdemeanor. See App. 31a–34a; Tex. Health &
Safety Code Ann. §§481.117(a) and (b). Although Texas
law, like federal law, authorized a sentencing enhance
ment if the prosecutor proved that Carachuri-Rosendo had
been previously convicted of an offense of a similar class,
the State did not elect to seek an enhancement based on
his criminal history. App. 32a.
In 2006, on the basis of Carachuri-Rosendo’s second
possession offense, the Federal Government initiated
removal proceedings against him. Appearing pro se before
the Immigration Judge, Carachuri-Rosendo did not dis
pute that his conviction for possessing one tablet of Xanax
without a prescription made him removable,7 but he ap
plied for a discretionary cancellation of removal pursuant
to 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a). Under that statutory provision,
the Attorney General may cancel an order of removal or
an order of inadmissibility so long as, inter alia, the non
citizen “has not been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.”
§1229b(a)(3). The Immigration Judge held that peti
——————
7 But for trivial marijuana possession offenses (such as CarachuriRosendo’s 2004 state offense), virtually all drug offenses are grounds
for removal under 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(B)(i).
