CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

first possession offense became final, is always an aggra
vated felony. We now reverse and hold that second or
subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated
felonies under §1101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state
conviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.
I
Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66
Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1101 et seq., a lawful
permanent resident subject to removal from the United
States may apply for discretionary cancellation of removal
if, inter alia, he “has not been convicted of any aggravated
felony,” §1229b(a)(3). The statutory definition of the term
“aggravated felony” includes a list of numerous federal
offenses,1 one of which is “illicit trafficking in a controlled
substance . . . including a drug trafficking crime (as de
fined in section 924(c) of title 18).” §1101(a)(43)(B). Sec
tion 924(c)(2), in turn, defines a “drug trafficking crime” to
mean “any felony punishable under,” inter alia, “the Con
trolled Substances Act (21 U. S. C. 801 et seq.).” A felony
is a crime for which the “maximum term of imprisonment
authorized” is “more than one year.” 18 U. S. C. §3559(a).2
The maze of statutory cross-references continues. Sec
tion 404 of the Controlled Substances Act criminalizes
simple possession offenses, the type of offense at issue in
this case. But it prescribes punishment for both misde
meanor and felony offenses. Except for simple possession
of crack cocaine or flunitrazepam, a first-time simple
possession offense is a federal misdemeanor; the maxi

1 The

term “aggravated felony” “applies to an offense . . . whether in
violation of Federal or State law” (or, in certain circumstances, “the law
of a foreign country”). 8 U. S. C. § 1101(a)(43).
2 The Controlled Substances Act itself defines the term “felony” as
“any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State
law as a felony.” 21 U. S. C. §802(13). The Government concedes that
the classification of felonies under 18 U. S. C. §3559(a) controls in this
case. Brief for Respondent 4.
