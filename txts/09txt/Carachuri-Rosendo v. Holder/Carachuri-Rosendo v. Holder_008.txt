Opinion of the Court

an “aggravated felony” for immigration law purposes, a
state drug conviction must be punishable as a felony
under federal law. We held that “a state offense consti
tutes a ‘felony punishable under the Controlled Sub
stances Act’ only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a
felony under that federal law.” Id., at 60. Despite the fact
that the Lopez petitioner had been punished as a felon
under state law—and, indeed, received a 5-year sen
tence—the conduct of his offense was not punishable as a
felony under federal law, and this prevented the state
conviction from qualifying as an aggravated felony for
immigration law purposes. Id., at 55 (“Unless a state
offense is punishable as a federal felony it does not
count”).
In the case before us, the Government argues that Cara
churi-Rosendo, despite having received only a 10-day
sentence for his Texas misdemeanor simple possession
offense, nevertheless has been “convicted” of an “aggra
vated felony” within the meaning of the INA. This is so,
the Government contends, because had CarachuriRosendo been prosecuted in federal court instead of state
court, he could have been prosecuted as a felon and re
ceived a 2-year sentence based on the fact of his prior
simple possession offense. Our holding in Lopez teaches
that, for a state conviction to qualify as an “aggravated
felony” under the INA, it is necessary for the underlying
conduct to be punishable as a federal felony. Id., at 60.
We now must determine whether the mere possibility, no
matter how remote, that a 2-year sentence might have
been imposed in a federal trial is a sufficient basis for
concluding that a state misdemeanant who was not
charged as a recidivist has been “convicted” of an “aggra
vated felony” within the meaning of §1229b(a)(3).
