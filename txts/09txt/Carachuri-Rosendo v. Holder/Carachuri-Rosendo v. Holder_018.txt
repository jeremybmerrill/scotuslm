Opinion of the Court

(“Whereas the prior version of [§851(a)] made enhance
ments for prior offenses mandatory, the new statutory
scheme gave prosecutors discretion whether to seek en
hancements based on prior convictions”). Because the
procedures are prerequisites to an enhanced sentence,
§851 allows federal prosecutors to choose whether to seek
a conviction that is “punishable” as a felony under §844(a).
Underscoring the significance of the §851 procedures,
the United States Attorney’s Manual places decisions
with respect to seeking recidivist enhancements on
par with the filing of a criminal charge against a
defendant. See Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys’ Manual §9–27.300(B) comment. (1997), online
at
http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/
usam/title9/27mcrm.htm#9-27.300 (as visited June 3,
2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). (“Every
prosecutor should regard the filing of an information
under 21 U. S. C. §851 . . . as equivalent to the filing of
charges”).
Many state criminal codes, like the federal scheme,
afford similar deference to prosecutorial discretion when
prescribing recidivist enhancements. Texas is one such
State. See, e.g., Tex. Penal Code Ann. §§12.42, 12.43
(West 2003) (recidivist enhancement is available “[i]f it is
shown on the trial” that defendant was previously con
victed of identified categories of felonies and misdemean
ors). And, in this case, the prosecutor specifically elected
to “[a]bandon” a recidivist enhancement under state law.
App. 32a (reproducing state judgment). Were we to permit
a federal immigration judge to apply his own recidivist
enhancement after the fact so as to make the noncitizen’s
offense “punishable” as a felony for immigration law pur
poses, we would denigrate the independent judgment of
state prosecutors to execute the laws of those sovereigns.
Third, the Court of Appeals’ hypothetical felony ap
proach is based on a misreading of our decision in Lopez.
