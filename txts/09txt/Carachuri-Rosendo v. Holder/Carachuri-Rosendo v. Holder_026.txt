CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

punishable as a felony under that federal law.” Id., at 60
(emphasis added). Though Lopez addressed a felony
conviction under state law that did not correlate to a
felony under the CSA, the Court’s rule preordained the
result in this case:
“[T]he Court admits that its reading will subject an
alien defendant convicted of a state misdemeanor to
deportation if his conduct was punishable as a felony
under the CSA. Accordingly, even if never convicted
of an actual felony, an alien defendant becomes eligi
ble for deportation based on a hypothetical federal
prosecution.” Id., at 67 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).
Today, the Court engages in jurisprudential gymnastics
to avoid Lopez. I will not contort the law to fit the case.
Lopez was wrongly decided. But because a proper reading
of the statutory text, see id., at 60–63, supports the result
the Court reaches today, I concur in the judgment.
