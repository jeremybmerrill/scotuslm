Opinion of the Court

We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the
Courts of Appeals over whether subsequent simple posses
sion offenses are aggravated felonies.9 558 U. S. ____
(2009).
III
When interpreting the statutory provisions under dis
pute, we begin by looking at the terms of the provisions
and the “commonsense conception” of those terms. Lopez,
549 U. S., at 53. Carachuri-Rosendo is ineligible for can
cellation of removal only if he was “convicted of a[n] ag
gravated felony,” 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a), which, in this case,
could only be a conviction for “illicit trafficking in a con
trolled substance . . . . including a drug trafficking crime,”
§1101(a)(43)(B).
A recidivist possession offense such as CarachuriRosendo’s does not fit easily into the “everyday under
standing” of those terms, Lopez, 549 U. S., at 53. This
type of petty simple possession offense is not typically
thought of as an “aggravated felony” or as “illicit traffick
ing.” We explained in Lopez that “ordinarily ‘trafficking’
means some sort of commercial dealing.” Id., at 53–54
(citing Black’s Law Dictionary 1534 (8th ed. 2004)). And
just as in Lopez, “[c]ommerce . . . was no part of” Cara
——————
Rosendo was not convicted of an “aggravated felony,” and if he contin
ues to satisfy the requirements of 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a), he may still seek
cancellation of removal even after having been removed. See §1229b(a)
(“The Attorney General may cancel removal in the case of an alien who
is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien” meets
several criteria).
9 Compare 570 F. 3d 263 (CA5 2009) (holding state conviction for
simple possession after prior conviction for simple possession is a felony
under the Controlled Substances Act and thus an aggravated felony),
and Fernandez v. Mukasey, 544 F. 3d 862 (CA7 2008) (same), with
Berhe v. Gonzales, 464 F. 3d 74 (CA1 2006) (taking contrary view),
Alsol v. Mukasey, 548 F. 3d 207 (CA2 2008) (same), Gerbier v. Holmes,
280 F. 3d 297 (CA3 2002) (same), and Rashid v. Mukasey, 531 F. 3d 438
(CA6 2008) (same).
