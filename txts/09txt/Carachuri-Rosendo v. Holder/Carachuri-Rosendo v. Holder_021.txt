CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

conduct, coupled with facts outside of the record of convic
tion, could have authorized a felony conviction under
federal law is insufficient to satisfy the statutory com
mand that a noncitizen be “convicted of a[n] aggravated
felony” before he loses the opportunity to seek cancellation
of removal. 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a)(3). The Court of Appeals,
as well as the Government, made the logical error of as
suming that a necessary component of an aggravated
felony is also sufficient to satisfy its statutory definition.
V
We hold that when a defendant has been convicted of a
simple possession offense that has not been enhanced
based on the fact of a prior conviction, he has not been
“convicted” under §1229b(a)(3) of a “felony punishable” as
such “under the Controlled Substances Act,” 18 U. S. C.
§924(c)(2). The prosecutor in Carachuri-Rosendo’s case
declined to charge him as a recidivist. He has, therefore,
not been convicted of a felony punishable under the Con
trolled Substances Act.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
It is so ordered.
