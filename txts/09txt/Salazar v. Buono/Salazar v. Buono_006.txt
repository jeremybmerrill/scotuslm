KEN L. SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR,

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 28, 2010] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE
joins and JUSTICE ALITO joins in part.
In 1934, private citizens placed a Latin cross on a rock
outcropping in a remote section of the Mojave Desert.
Their purpose and intent was to honor American soldiers
who fell in World War I. The original cross deteriorated
over time, but a reconstructed one now stands at the same
place. It is on federal land.
The Court is asked to consider a challenge, not to the
first placement of the cross or its continued presence on
federal land, but to a statute that would transfer the cross
and the land on which it stands to a private party. De
partment of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L.
108–87, §8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. The District Court
permanently enjoined the Government from implementing
the statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We conclude
that its judgment was in error.
