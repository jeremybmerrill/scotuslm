STEVENS, J., dissenting

could try to prevent its display only by making such a
display illegal. But the Government does own this land,
and the transfer statute requires the Executive Branch to
take an affirmative act (transfer to private ownership)

that judgment. The Government faces a high burden in
arguing the District Court exceeded its authority. A de­
