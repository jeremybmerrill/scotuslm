Syllabus
Buono seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue
that relief by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will “re
dress or prevent an actual or imminently threatened injury to [him]
caused by private or official violation of law.” Summers v. Earth Is
land Institute, 555 U. S. ___, ___. He has failed, however, to allege
any such injury. Even assuming that being offended by a religious
display constitutes a cognizable injury, it is merely speculative
whether the cross will remain in place, and in any event Buono has
made clear, by admitting he has no objection to Christian symbols on
private property, that he will not be offended. Neither district courts’
discretion to expand injunctions they have issued nor this District
Court’s characterization of its 2005 order as merely enforcing the ex
isting injunction makes any difference. If in fact a court awards new
relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to do so. Pp. 1–7.
