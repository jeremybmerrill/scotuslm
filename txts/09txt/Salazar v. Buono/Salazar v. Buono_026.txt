KEN L. SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR,

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 28, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.
I join JUSTICE KENNEDY’s opinion in all respects but
one: I would not remand this case for the lower courts to
decide whether implementation of the land-transfer stat
ute enacted by Congress in 2003, Department of Defense
Appropriations Act, 2004, §8121, would violate the District
Court’s injunction or the Establishment Clause. The
factual record has been sufficiently developed to permit
resolution of these questions, and I would therefore decide
them and hold that the statute may be implemented.
The singular circumstances surrounding the monument
on Sunrise Rock presented Congress with a delicate prob
lem, and the solution that Congress devised is true to the
spirit of practical accommodation that has made the
United States a Nation of unparalleled pluralism and
religious tolerance. In brief, the situation that Congress
faced was as follows.
After service in the First World War, a group of veterans
moved to the Mojave Desert, in some cases for health
reasons.1 They joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars
