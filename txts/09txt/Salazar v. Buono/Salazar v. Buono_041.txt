SALAZAR v. BUONO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

are known to differ. In my view, the District Court was
right to enforce its prior judgment by enjoining Congress’
proposed remedy—a remedy that was engineered to leave
the cross intact and that did not alter its basic meaning. I
certainly agree that the Nation should memorialize the
service of those who fought and died in World War I, but it
cannot lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a
starkly sectarian message.

As the history recounted by the plurality indicates, this
case comes to us in a procedural posture that significantly
narrows the question presented to the Court. In the first
stage of this litigation, the District Court and the Court of
Appeals ruled that the Government violated the Estab­
lishment Clause by permitting the display of a single
white Latin cross at Sunrise Rock. Those courts further
ruled that the appropriate remedy was an injunction
prohibiting the Government from “permitting the display
of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mo­
jave National Preserve.” App. 39. The Government de­

“the Sunrise Rock cross will project a message of govern­

Buono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 549 (CA9 2004) (Buono
II), and that the District Court’s remedy for that endorse­
ment was proper.
We are, however, faced with an additional fact: Con­
gress has enacted a statute directing the Secretary of the
Interior to transfer a 1-acre parcel of land containing the
cross to the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), subject to
certain conditions, in exchange for a 5-acre parcel of land
elsewhere in the Preserve. See Department of Defense
Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121, 117 Stat.
