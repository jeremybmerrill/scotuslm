Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

reopen final judgments. See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm,
Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 225–226 (1995). That principle, how
ever, was not a bar to this statute. The Government’s
right to transfer the land was not adjudicated in Buono I
or compromised by the 2002 injunction.
In belittling the Government’s efforts as an attempt to
“evade” the injunction, Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at
1182, the District Court had things backwards. Con
gress’s prerogative to balance opposing interests and its
institutional competence to do so provide one of the princi
pal reasons for deference to its policy determinations. See
Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 513
(1982). Here, Congress adopted a policy with respect to
land it now owns in order to resolve a specific controversy.
Congress, the Executive, and the Judiciary all have a duty
to support and defend the Constitution. See United States
v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 703 (1974) (“In the performance of
assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Govern
ment must initially interpret the Constitution, and the
interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great
respect from the others”). The land-transfer statute em
bodies Congress’s legislative judgment that this dispute is
best resolved through a framework and policy of accom
modation for a symbol that, while challenged under the
Establishment Clause, has complex meaning beyond the
expression of religious views. That judgment should not
have been dismissed as an evasion, for the statute brought
about a change of law and a congressional statement of
policy applicable to the case.
Buono maintains that any governmental interest in
keeping the cross up must cede to the constitutional con
cerns on which the 2002 injunction was based. He argues
that the land transfer would be “an incomplete remedy” to
the constitutional violation underlying the injunction and
that the transfer would make achieving a proper remedy
more difficult. Brief for Respondent 54.
