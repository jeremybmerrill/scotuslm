SALAZAR v. BUONO
Opinion of ALITO, J.

STEVENS characterizes this land exchange as one that
endorses “a particular religious view,” post, at 26 (dissent
ing opinion), it is noteworthy that Congress, in which our
country’s religious diversity is well represented, passed
this law by overwhelming majorities: 95–0 in the Senate
and 407–15 in the House. See 149 Cong. Rec. H8793
(Sept. 24, 2003); id., at S11943 (Sept. 25, 2003). In my
view, there is no legal ground for blocking the implemen
tation of this law.
The dissent contends that the land transfer would vio
late the District Court injunction, but that argument, for
the reasons explained in JUSTICE SCALIA’s opinion, see
post, at 2 (concurring in judgment), is plainly unsound.
The obvious meaning of the injunction was simply that the
Government could not allow the cross to remain on federal
land.
There is also no merit in JUSTICE STEVENS’ contention
that implementation of the statute would constitute an
endorsement of Christianity and would thus violate the
Establishment Clause. Assuming that it is appropriate to
apply the so-called “endorsement test,” this test would not
be violated by the land exchange. The endorsement test
views a challenged display through the eyes of a hypo
thetical reasonable observer who is deemed to be aware of
the history and all other pertinent facts relating to a
challenged display.
See ante, at 16–17 (opinion of
KENNEDY, J.). Here, therefore, this observer would be
familiar with the origin and history of the monument and
would also know both that the land on which the monu
ment is located is privately owned and that the new owner
is under no obligation to preserve the monument’s present
design. With this knowledge, a reasonable observer would
not view the land exchange as the equivalent of the con
struction of an official World War I memorial on the Na
tional Mall. Cf. post, at 26. Rather, a well-informed ob
server would appreciate that the transfer represents an
