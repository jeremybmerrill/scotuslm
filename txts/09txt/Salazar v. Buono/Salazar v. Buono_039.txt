SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

*

*
Keeping within the bounds of our constitutional author
ity often comes at a cost. Here, the litigants have lost
considerable time and money disputing the merits, and we
are forced to forgo an opportunity to clarify the law. But
adhering to Article III’s limits upon our jurisdiction re
spects the authority of those whom the people have chosen
to make and carry out the laws. In this case Congress has
determined that transferring the memorial to private
hands best serves the public interest and complies with
the Constitution, and the Executive defends that decision
and seeks to carry it out. Federal courts have no warrant
to revisit that decision—and to risk replacing the people’s
judgment with their own—unless and until a proper case
has been brought before them. This is not it.

the Government to ban “the display of the Latin cross” on private land
“in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve,” App. to
Pet. for Cert. 146a—an implausible interpretation no one advocates.
