SALAZAR v. BUONO
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

trict Court properly enjoined the Government from im
plementing the land-transfer statute. The District Court
did not consider whether the statute, in isolation, would
have violated the Establishment Clause, and it did not
forbid the land transfer as an independent constitutional
violation. Buono III, supra, at 1182, n. 8. Rather, the
court enjoined compliance with the statute on the premise
that the relief was necessary to protect the rights Buono
had secured through the 2002 injunction.
An injunction is an exercise of a court’s equitable au
thority, to be ordered only after taking into account all of
the circumstances that bear on the need for prospective
relief. See United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106, 114
(1932). See also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S.
305, 312 (1982); Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 321, 329
(1944); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal
Practice and Procedure §2942, pp. 39–42 (2d ed. 1995)
(hereinafter Wright & Miller). Equitable relief is not
granted as a matter of course, see Weinberger, 456 U. S.,
at 311–312, and a court should be particularly cautious
when contemplating relief that implicates public interests,
see id., at 312 (“In exercising their sound discretion, courts
of equity should pay particular regard for the public con
sequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of in
junction”); Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., 289
U. S. 334, 338 (1933) (“Where an important public interest
would be prejudiced, the reasons for denying the injunc
tion may be compelling”). Because injunctive relief “is
drafted in light of what the court believes will be the
future course of events, . . . a court must never ignore
significant changes in the law or circumstances underlying
an injunction lest the decree be turned into an ‘instrument
of wrong.’ ” Wright & Miller §2961, at 393–394 (quoting
Swift & Co., supra, at 115).
Here, the District Court did not engage in the appropri
ate inquiry. The land-transfer statute was a substantial
