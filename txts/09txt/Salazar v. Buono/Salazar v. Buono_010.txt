Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

(1) Before Buono I was filed, Congress passed an appro
priations bill that included a provision forbidding the use
of governmental funds to remove the cross. Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554, §133, 114 Stat.
2763A–230.
(2) While Buono I was pending before the District Court,
Congress designated the cross and its adjoining land “as a
national memorial commemorating United States partici
pation in World War I and honoring the American veter
ans of that war.” Department of Defense Appropriations
Act, 2002, Pub. L. 107–117, §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. The
Secretary of the Interior was directed to expend up to
$10,000 to acquire a replica of the original cross and its
memorial plaque and to install the plaque at a suitable

(3) Three months after Buono I was decided, Congress

directing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the
VFW the Government’s interest in the land that had been
designated a national memorial. Department of Defense
Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117
Stat. 1100. In exchange, the Government was to receive
land elsewhere in the preserve from Henry Sandoz and his
wife. Ibid. Any difference in value between the two par
cels would be equalized through a cash payment.
§§8121(c), (d). The land-transfer statute provided that the
property would revert to the Government if not main
tained “as a memorial commemorating United States
participation in World War I and honoring the American
veterans of that war.” §8121(e), 117 Stat. 1100. The
statute presents a central issue in this case.
