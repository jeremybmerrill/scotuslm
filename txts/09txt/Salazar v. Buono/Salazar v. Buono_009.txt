SALAZAR v. BUONO
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

Government’s actions regarding the cross had a secular
purpose, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1214–1215, or whether they
caused excessive entanglement with religion, id., at 1217,
n. 9. Instead, the court evaluated the primary effect of the
cross by asking how it would be viewed by a “reasonable
observer.” Id., at 1216. Concluding that presence of the
cross on federal land conveyed an impression of govern
mental endorsement of religion, the court granted Buono’s
request for injunctive relief. The court’s order in Buono I
(2002 injunction) permanently forbade the Government
“from permitting the display of the Latin cross in the area
of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” App. to
Pet. for Cert. 146a.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir
cuit stayed the 2002 injunction to the extent that it re
quired the cross to be removed or dismantled but did not
forbid alternative methods of complying with the order.
The Government covered the cross, first with a tarpaulin
and later with a plywood box.
On appeal, the judgment of the District Court was af
firmed, both as to standing and on the merits of Buono’s
Establishment Clause challenge. Buono v. Norton, 371
F. 3d 543 (CA9 2004) (Buono II). Like the District Court,
the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the Govern
ment’s action, or nonaction, with respect to the cross had
been motivated by a secular purpose. Id., at 550. Its
ruling was based instead on the conclusion that a reason
able observer would perceive a cross on federal land as
governmental endorsement of religion. Id., at 549–550.
The Government did not seek review by this Court, so that
the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Buono II became
final.
C
During the relevant proceedings, Congress enacted
certain statutes related to the cross:
