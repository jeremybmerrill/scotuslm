SALAZAR v. BUONO
BREYER, J., dissenting

Clause violation”); see also 527 F. 3d, at 783 (finding that
“[n]othing in the present posture of the case alters . . .
earlier conclusions” regarding what a reasonable observer
would perceive).
In my view, this is a reasonable
conclusion.
The injunction forbids the Government to permit the
display of the cross on Sunrise Rock, and its basic purpose
was to prevent a reasonable observer from believing that
the Government had endorsed the cross. Under the cir
cumstances presented to the District Court, the transfer
would have resulted in such a display and might well have
conveyed such a message. Consequently, the District
Court’s decision that the land transfer violated the injunc
tion as written and intended was not an abuse of discre
tion. And that is what the Ninth Circuit properly held on
appeal. What the Establishment Clause implications of
the changed circumstances may be is a matter not before
us. Cf. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 442 (2004) (“If
the [enjoined defendant] establishes reason to modify the
decree, the court should make the necessary changes;
where it has not done so, however, the decree should be
enforced according to its terms”).
Because my conclusion rests primarily upon the law of
injunctions, because that law is fairly clear, and because
we cannot properly reach beyond that law to consider the
underlying Establishment Clause and standing questions,
I can find no federal question of general significance in
this case. I believe we should not have granted the peti
tion for certiorari. Having granted it, the Court should
now dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. Since the
Court has not done so, however, I believe that we should
simply affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.
With respect, I dissent.
