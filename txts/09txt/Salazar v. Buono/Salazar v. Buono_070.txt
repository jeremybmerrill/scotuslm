BREYER, J., dissenting

cross in its current location, in exchange for a par
cel of land located elsewhere in the Preserve owned
by private individuals who have taken a similar in
terest in the cross. Pub. L. 108–87, §§8121(a) and
(b), 117 Stat. 1100.
•	 The transfer was made “subject to the condition

historical context of the transfer statute); see also Buono

governmental endorsement” perceived by the reasonable
