SALAZAR v. BUONO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Court properly recognized that the transfer was a means
of “permitting”—indeed, encouraging—the display of the
cross. The transfer therefore would violate the terms of
the court’s original injunction. Second, even if the transfer
would not violate the terms of the 2002 injunction, the
District Court properly took into account events that
transpired since 2002 and determined that barring the
transfer was necessary to achieve the intended result of
the 2002 decree, as the transfer would not eliminate gov­
ernment endorsement of religion.

The first step in the analysis is straightforward: The
District Court had to ask whether the transfer of the
property would violate the extant injunction. Under the
terms of that injunction, the answer was yes.
The 2002 injunction barred the Government from “per­

rise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” App. 39. The
land-transfer statute mandated transfer of the land to an
organization that has announced its intention to maintain
the cross on Sunrise Rock. That action surely “permit[s]”
the display of the cross. See 11 Oxford English Dictionary
578 (2d ed. 1989) (defining “permit” as “[t]o admit or allow
the doing or occurrence of; to give leave or opportunity
for”). True, the Government would no longer exert direct
control over the cross. But the transfer itself would be an
act permitting its display.
I therefore disagree with JUSTICE SCALIA that the “only
reasonable reading of the original injunction . . . is that it
proscribed the cross’s display on federal land.” Ante, at 2
(opinion concurring in judgment). If the land were already
privately owned, JUSTICE SCALIA may be correct that the
cross’ display on Sunrise Rock would not violate the in­
junction because the Government would not have to do
anything to allow the cross to stand, and the Government
