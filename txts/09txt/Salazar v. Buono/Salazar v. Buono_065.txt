SALAZAR v. BUONO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

equal respect to all members of the Armed Forces who
perished in the service of our Country in those conflicts.
In this case, by contrast, a sectarian symbol is the memo­
rial. And because Congress has established no other
national monument to the veterans of the Great War, this
solitary cross in the middle of the desert is the national
World War I memorial. The sequence of legislative deci­
sions made to designate and preserve a solitary Latin
cross at an isolated location in the desert as a memorial
for those who fought and died in World War I not only
failed to cure the Establishment Clause violation but also,
in my view, resulted in a dramatically inadequate and
inappropriate tribute.
I believe that most judges would find it to be a clear
Establishment Clause violation if Congress had simply
directed that a solitary Latin cross be erected on the Mall
in the Nation’s Capital to serve as a World War I Memo­
rial. Congress did not erect this cross, but it commanded
that the cross remain in place, and it gave the cross the
imprimatur of Government. Transferring the land pursu­
ant to §8121 would perpetuate rather than cure that
unambiguous endorsement of a sectarian message.
The Mojave Desert is a remote location, far from the
seat of our Government. But the Government’s interest in
honoring all those who have rendered heroic public service
regardless of creed, as well as its constitutional responsi­
bility to avoid endorsement of a particular religious view,
should control wherever national memorials speak on
behalf of our entire country.
I respectfully dissent.
