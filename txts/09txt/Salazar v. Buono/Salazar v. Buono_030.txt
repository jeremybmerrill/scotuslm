well have thought—not without reason—that the addition
of yet another religious symbol would have been unlikely
to satisfy the plaintiff, his attorneys, or the lower courts
that had found the existing monument to be uncon

stemming from the location of the cross on federally owned
land, while at the same time avoiding the disturbing
symbolism associated with the destruction of the historic
monument. The mechanism that Congress selected is one
that is quite common in the West, a “land exchange.”11
Congress enacted a law under which ownership of the
parcel of land on which Sunrise Rock is located would be
transferred to the VFW in exchange for another nearby
parcel of equal value. Congress required that the Sunrise

a war memorial of a different design. Although JUSTICE
