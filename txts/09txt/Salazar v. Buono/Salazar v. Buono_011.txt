SALAZAR v. BUONO
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

effect on the suit of a potential land transfer under the
statute. The court noted that the transfer might “take as
long as two years to complete,” 371 F. 3d, at 545, and that
its effect was not yet known, id., at 545–546. The court
thus “express[ed] no view as to whether a transfer com
pleted under [the statute] would pass constitutional mus
ter.” Id., at 546.
D
After the Court of Appeals affirmed in Buono II, Buono
returned to the District Court seeking to prevent the land
transfer. He sought injunctive relief against the transfer,
either through enforcement or modification of the 2002
injunction. In evaluating his request the trial court de
scribed the relevant question as whether the land transfer
was a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction (as
the Government claimed), or a sham aimed at keeping the
cross in place (as Buono claimed). Buono v. Norton, 364
F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1178 (CD Cal. 2005) (Buono III). In
Buono III, the court did not consider whether the transfer
itself was an “independent violation of the Establishment
Clause.” Id., at 1182, n. 8. The court nevertheless con
cluded that the transfer was an attempt by the Govern
ment to keep the cross atop Sunrise Rock and so was
invalid. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the
2002 injunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it;
and permanently enjoined the Government from imple
menting the land-transfer statute. Id., at 1182.
The Court of Appeals again affirmed, largely following
the reasoning of the District Court. Buono v. Kempthorne,
502 F. 3d 1069 (CA9 2007). The Government’s motion for
rehearing en banc was denied over a dissent by Judge
O’Scannlain, 527 F. 3d 758, and this Court granted certio
rari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).
