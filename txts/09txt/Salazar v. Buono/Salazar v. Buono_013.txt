SALAZAR v. BUONO
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

it is still necessary to evaluate his standing in Buono III to
seek application of the injunction against the land
transfer statute. That measure of relief is embodied in the
judgment upon which we granted review.
This was a measure of relief that Buono had standing to
seek. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor ac
quires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring com
pliance with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.
737, 763 (1984) (plaintiffs’ right to enforce a desegregation
decree to which they were parties is “a personal interest,
created by law, in having the State refrain from taking
specific actions”). Having obtained a final judgment
granting relief on his claims, Buono had standing to seek
its vindication.
The Government does not deny this proposition as a
general matter. Instead, it argues that Buono was not
seeking to vindicate—but rather to extend—the 2002
injunction. The first injunction forbade the Government
from maintaining the cross on Sunrise Rock; yet in Buono
III he sought to preclude the land transfer, a different
governmental action. The Government contends that
Buono lacked standing to seek this additional relief.
Reply Brief for Petitioners 5.
The Government’s argument, however, is properly ad
dressed to the relief granted by the judgment below, not to
Buono’s standing to seek that relief. The Government has
challenged whether appropriate relief was granted in
Buono III in light of the relevant considerations and legal
principles, and we shall consider these questions. The
standing inquiry, by contrast, turns on the alleged injury
that prompted the plaintiff to invoke the court’s jurisdic
tion in the first place. Buono’s entitlement to an injunc
tion having been established in Buono I and II, he sought
in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating
or evading that injunction. Based on the rights he ob
tained under the earlier decree—against the same party,
