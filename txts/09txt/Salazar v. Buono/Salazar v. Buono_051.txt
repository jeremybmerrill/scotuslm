SALAZAR v. BUONO
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Particularly important to this analysis is that although
the transfer might remove the implicit endorsement that
presence on public land signifies, see Capitol Square
Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 801
(1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“The very fact that a sign
is installed on public property implies official recognition
and reinforcement of its message”), it would not change
the fact that the Government has taken several explicit
actions to endorse this cross. In its decision upholding the
initial entry of the injunction, the Court of Appeals found
those actions contributed to a reasonable observer’s per­
ception of government endorsement. Buono II, 371 F. 3d,
at 550. Their significance does not depend upon the own­
ership of the land.
In 2000, and again after the District Court had entered
its initial injunction, Congress passed legislation prohibit­
ing the use of any federal funds to remove the cross from
its location on federal property. See Consolidated Appro­
priations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554, App. D, §133, 114
Stat. 2763A–230; Department of Defense Appropriations
Act, 2003, Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551.
Thus, beyond merely acquiescing in the continued pres­
ence of a cross on federal property, Congress singled out
that cross for special treatment, and it affirmatively com­
manded that the cross must remain.
Congress also made a more dramatic intervention.
Without the benefit of any committee hearings or floor
debate in either the Senate or the House of Representa­
tives—indeed, without a moment of discussion in any
official forum—Congress passed legislation officially des­
ignating the “five-foot-tall white cross” in the Mojave
Desert “as a national memorial commemorating United
States participation in World War I and honoring the
American veterans of that war.” §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278.
Thereafter, the cross was no longer just a local artifact; it
acquired a formal national status of the highest order.
