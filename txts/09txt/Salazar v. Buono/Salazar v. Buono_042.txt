STEVENS, J., dissenting

under §8121 “violate[d] [the] court’s judgment ordering a
permanent injunction” and did not “actually cur[e] the
continuing Establishment Clause violation.” Buono v.
Norton, 364 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1182 (CD Cal. 2005) (Buono
III). The District Court therefore enforced its 2002 judg­
ment by enjoining the transfer, without considering
whether “the land transfer itself is an independent viola­

enjoining the transfer.
In answering that question we, like the District Court,

circumstances nonetheless rendered enforcement of that
judgment inappropriate; or conversely whether they made
it necessary for the District Court to bar the transfer, even
if the transfer is not expressly prohibited by the prior
injunction, in order to achieve the intended objective of the
injunction. The plurality correctly notes that “ ‘a court
must never ignore significant changes in the law or cir­
cumstances underlying an injunction,’ ” ante, at 10 (quot­
