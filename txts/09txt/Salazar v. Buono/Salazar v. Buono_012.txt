Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

II
Before considering the District Court’s order on the
merits, the first inquiry must be with respect to Buono’s
standing to maintain this action. To demonstrate stand
ing, a plaintiff must have “alleged such a personal stake in
the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invoca
tion of federal-court jurisdiction.” Horne v. Flores, 557
U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation
marks omitted). The Government argues that Buono’s
asserted injury is not personal to him and so does not
confer Article III standing. As noted above, Buono does
not find the cross itself objectionable but instead takes
offense at the presence of a religious symbol on federal
land. Buono does not claim that, as a personal matter, he
has been made to feel excluded or coerced, and so, the
Government contends, he cannot object to the presence of
the cross. Brief for Petitioners 12–17.
Whatever the validity of the objection to Buono’s stand
ing, that argument is not available to the Government at
this stage of the litigation. When Buono moved the Dis
trict Court in Buono I for an injunction requiring the
removal of the cross, the Government raised the same
standing objections it proffers now. Rejecting the Gov
ernment’s position, the District Court entered a judgment
in Buono’s favor, which the Court of Appeals affirmed in
Buono II. The Government did not seek review in this
Court. The judgment became final and unreviewable upon
the expiration of the 90-day deadline under 28 U. S. C.
§2101(c) for filing a petition for certiorari. Toledo Scale
Co. v. Computing Scale Co., 261 U. S. 399, 418 (1923); see
Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 45 (1990) (90-day dead
line is “mandatory and jurisdictional”). The Government
cannot now contest Buono’s standing to obtain the final
judgment in Buono I.
Of course, even though the Court may not reconsider
whether Buono had standing to seek the 2002 injunction,
