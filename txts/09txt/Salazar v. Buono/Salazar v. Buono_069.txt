SALAZAR v. BUONO
BREYER, J., dissenting

(CA2 1942). And they have long refused to “permit defen
dants to evade responsibility for violating an injunction,
by doing through subterfuge a thing which is not in terms
a violation, yet produces the same effect by accomplishing
substantially that which they were enjoined from doing.”
Stodder v. Rosen Talking Mach. Co., 247 Mass. 60, 68, 141
N. E. 569, 571 (1923).
These two principles adequately support the District
Court’s interpretation and application of the injunctive
language at issue here. As an initial matter, the plain text

pose of the injunction is to prevent the conveyance of such
a message to the reasonable observer.
With that purpose in mind, consider the following facts
that confronted the District Court when the plaintiff asked
it to enforce the decree:
•	 The Government had designated the “white cross
. . . as well as a limited amount of adjoining [land]”
as a national memorial. Pub. L. 107–117, §8137(a),
115 Stat. 2278–2279.
•	 The new statute directed the transfer of the “prop

private entity with an interest in maintaining the
