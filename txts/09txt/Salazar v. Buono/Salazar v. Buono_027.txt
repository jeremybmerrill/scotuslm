SALAZAR v. BUONO
Opinion of ALITO, J.

(VFW), Death Valley Post 2884, and in 1934, they raised a
simple white cross on an outcropping called Sunrise Rock
to honor fallen American soldiers.2 These veterans se
lected Sunrise Rock “in part because they believed there
was a color shading on the Rock in the shape of an Ameri
can soldier or ‘doughboy.’ ”3
One of these men was John Riley Bembry, a miner who
had served as a medic and had thus presumably witnessed
the carnage of the war firsthand.4 It is said that Mr. Bem
bry was not a particularly religious man, but he neverthe
less agreed to look after the cross and did so for some
years.5
The Sunrise Rock monument was located on land be
longing to the Federal Government, but in this part of the
country, where much of the land is federally owned,
boundaries between Government and private land are
often not marked,6 and private citizens are permitted to go
on and to use federal land for a variety of purposes.7 Al
