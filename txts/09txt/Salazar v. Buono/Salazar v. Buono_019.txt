SALAZAR v. BUONO
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

A court must find prospective relief that fits the remedy
to the wrong or injury that has been established. See
Swift & Co., 286 U. S., at 114 (“A continuing decree of
injunction directed to events to come is subject always to
adaptation as events may shape the need”). See also
United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U. S.
244, 249 (1968). Where legislative action has undermined
the basis upon which relief has previously been granted, a
court must consider whether the original finding of
wrongdoing continues to justify the court’s intervention.
See Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 648–649
(1961); Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co.,
18 How. 421, 430–432 (1856). The relevant question is
whether an ongoing exercise of the court’s equitable au
thority is supported by the prior showing of illegality,
judged against the claim that changed circumstances have
rendered prospective relief inappropriate.
The District Court granted the 2002 injunction based
solely on its conclusion that presence of the cross on fed
eral land conveyed an impression of governmental en
dorsement of religion. The court expressly disavowed any
inquiry into whether the Government’s actions had a
secular purpose or caused excessive entanglement. Buono
I, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1215, 1217, n. 9. The Court of Ap
peals affirmed the injunction on the same grounds, simi
larly eschewing any scrutiny of governmental purpose.
Buono II, 371 F. 3d, at 550.
Although, for purposes of the opinion, the propriety of
the 2002 injunction may be assumed, the following discus
sion should not be read to suggest this Court’s agreement
with that judgment, some aspects of which may be ques
tionable. The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement
does not require eradication of all religious symbols in the
public realm. A cross by the side of a public highway
marking, for instance, the place where a state trooper
perished need not be taken as a statement of governmen
