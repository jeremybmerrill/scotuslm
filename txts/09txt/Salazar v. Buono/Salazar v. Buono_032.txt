Opinion of ALITO, J.

effort by Congress to address a unique situation and
to find a solution that best accommodates conflicting
concerns.
Finally, I reject JUSTICE STEVENS’ suggestion that the
enactment of the land-transfer law was motivated by an
illicit purpose. Id. at 24. I would not be “so dismissive of
Congress.” Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n,
558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 70) (STEVENS, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part). Congress has
shown notable solicitude for the rights of religious minori
ties. See, e.g., Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,
42 U. S. C. §2000bb et seq.; Religious Land Use and Insti
tutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U. S. C. §2000cc et
seq. I would not jump to the conclusion that Congress’ aim
in enacting the land-transfer law was to embrace the
religious message of the cross; rather, I see no reason to
doubt that Congress’ consistent goal, in legislating with
regard to the Sunrise Rock monument, has been to com
memorate our Nation’s war dead and to avoid the disturb
ing symbolism that would have been created by the de
struction of the monument.
For these reasons, I would reverse the decision below
and remand with instructions to vacate the order prohibit
ing the implementation of the land-transfer statute.
