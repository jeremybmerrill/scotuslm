STEVENS, J., dissenting

not end government endorsement of religion.
IV
In sum, I conclude that the transfer ordered by §8121
will not end the pre-existing government endorsement of
the cross, and to the contrary may accentuate the problem
in some respects. Because the transfer would perpetuate
the Establishment Clause violation at issue in the 2002
injunction, I further conclude that enjoining the transfer
was necessary to secure relief. Given the transfer stat­
ute’s fundamental inadequacy as a remedy, there was—
and is—no need for the District Court to consider “less
drastic relief than complete invalidation of the . . . stat­
ute.” Ante, at 18. Allowing the transfer to go forward
would interfere with the District Court’s authority to
enforce its judgment and deprive the District Court of the
ability to ensure a complete remedy. Nor could allowing
the transfer to go forward be made a complete remedy
with add-on measures, such as signs or fences indicating
the ownership of the land. Such measures would not
completely end the government endorsement of this cross,
as the land would have been transferred in a manner
favoring the cross and the cross would remain designated
as a national memorial. Enjoining compliance with §8121
was therefore a proper exercise of the District Court’s
authority to enforce the 2002 judgment.

tion’s history to designate a bare, unadorned cross as the
national war memorial for a particular group of veterans.
Neither the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam War
Memorial, nor the World War II Memorial commemorates
our veterans’ sacrifice in sectarian or predominantly reli­
gious ways. Each of these impressive structures pays
