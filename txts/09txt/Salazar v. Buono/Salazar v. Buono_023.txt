SALAZAR v. BUONO
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

effect unless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary
to the congressional judgment, the land transfer were
thought an insufficient accommodation in light of the
earlier finding of religious endorsement, it was incumbent
upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than
complete invalidation of the land-transfer statute. See
Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546
U. S. 320, 329 (2006) (in granting relief, “we try not to
nullify more of a legislature’s work than is necessary, for
we know that [a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates
the intent of the elected representatives of the people”
(internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original));
Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987).
For instance, if there is to be a conveyance, the question
might arise regarding the necessity of further action, such
as signs to indicate the VFW’s ownership of the land. As
we have noted, Congress directed the Secretary of the
Interior to install near the cross a replica of its original
memorial plaque. One of the signs that appears in early
photographs of the cross specifically identifies the VFW as
the group that erected it.
Noting the possibility of specific remedies, however, is
not an indication of agreement about the continued neces
sity for injunctive relief. The land-transfer statute’s bear
ing on this dispute must first be determined. To date, this
Court’s jurisprudence in this area has refrained from
making sweeping pronouncements, and this case is ill
suited for announcing categorical rules. In light of the
finding of unconstitutionality in Buono I, and the highly
fact-specific nature of the inquiry, it is best left to the
District Court to undertake the analysis in the first in
stance. On remand, if Buono continues to challenge im
plementation of the statute, the District Court should
conduct a proper inquiry as described above.
