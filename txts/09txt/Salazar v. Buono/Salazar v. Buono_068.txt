BREYER, J., dissenting

the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Pre
serve.” App. 39. In my view the law authorizes the Dis
trict Court to do so.
The legal principles that answer the question presented
are found not in the Constitution but in cases that concern
the law of injunctions. First, the law of injunctions grants
a district court considerable leeway to interpret the mean
ing and application of its own injunctive order. Members
of this Court have written that the “construction given to”
an “injunction by the issuing judge . . . is entitled to great
weight.” Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S.
753, 795 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part). And the Courts of Appeals have
consistently held that district courts have considerable
discretion in interpreting and applying their own injunc
tive decrees. See, e.g., JTH Tax, Inc. v. H & R Block East
ern Tax Servs., Inc., 359 F. 3d 699, 705 (CA4 2004); Ala
bama Nursing Home Assn v. Harris, 617 F. 2d 385, 388
(CA5 1980). This principle is longstanding and well estab
lished, as reflected in a prominent treatise writer’s sum
mary of the case law: “The court granting the injunction is
necessarily invested with large discretion in enforcing
obedience to its mandate, and . . . courts of appellate
powers are exceedingly averse to interfering with the
exercise of such judgment and discretion.” 2 J. High, Law
of Injunctions §1458, pp. 1467–1468 (4th ed. 1905).
Second, a court should construe the scope of an injunc
tion in light of its purpose and history, in other words,
“what the decree was really designed to accomplish.”
Mayor of Vicksburg v. Henson, 231 U. S. 259, 273 (1913).
Courts have long looked to “the objects for which the
[injunctive] relief was granted, as well as the circum
stances attending it,” in deciding whether an enjoined
party has complied with an injunction. 2 High, supra,
§1446, at 1455, and n. 68 (citing cases); see also John B.
Stetson Co. v. Stephen L. Stetson Co., 128 F. 2d 981, 983
