(quoting Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.
v. FEC, 518 U. S. 604, 650 (1996) (STEVENS, J., dissent­
ing)). Moreover, the inference that Congress has exercised
its institutional competence—or even its considered judg­
ment—is significantly weaker in a case such as this, when
the legislative action was “buried in a defense appropria­
tions bill,” Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1181, and, so far
as the record shows, undertaken without any deliberation
whatsoever. I am not dismissive of Congress, see ante, at
7 (opinion of ALITO, J.), but §8121 presents no factual
findings, reasoning, or long history of “ ‘careful legislative
adjustment,’ ” Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (STEVENS,
J., dissenting) (slip op., at 71) (quoting FEC v. Beaumont,
539 U. S. 146, 162, n. 9 (2003)), to which I could possibly
defer. Congress did not devote “years of careful study” to
§8121, Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting) (slip op., at 73), nor did it develop a record of
any kind, much less an exhaustive one, see id., at ___ (slip
op., at 20) (noting the legislative record for the Bipartisan
Campaign Reform Act of 2002 spanned 100,000 pages).
The concurrence’s attempt to draw an equivalence be­
tween a provision tucked silently into an appropriations
bill and a major statute debated and developed over many
years is, to say the least, not persuasive. All legislative
acts are not fungible.
Furthermore, in the Establishment Clause context, we
do not accord any special deference to the legislature on
account of its generic advantages as a policymaking body,
and the purpose test is not “satisfied so long as any secu­
lar purpose for the government action is apparent,”
McCreary County, 545 U. S., at 865, n. 13 (emphasis
added). Nor can the Government pursue a secular aim
through religious means. See Van Orden, 545 U. S., at
