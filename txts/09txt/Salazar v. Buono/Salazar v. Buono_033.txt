KEN L. SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, 

ET AL., PETITIONERS v. FRANK BUONO 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 28, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the plurality that the Court of Appeals
erred in affirming the District Court’s order enjoining the
transfer of the memorial to the Veterans of Foreign Wars
(VFW). My reason, however, is quite different: In my view
we need not—indeed, cannot—decide the merits of the
parties’ dispute, because Frank Buono lacks Article III
standing to pursue the relief he seeks. The District Court
had no power to award the requested relief, and our au
thority is limited to “ ‘announcing the fact and dismissing
the cause.’ ” Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,
523 U. S. 83, 94 (1998) (quoting Ex parte McCardle, 7
Wall. 506, 514 (1869)).
The plurality is correct that Buono’s standing to obtain
the original injunction is not before us. See ante, at 7.1
——————
1 The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that Buono had standing to seek
the original injunction does not, however, control our decision here
under the law-of-the-case doctrine. That doctrine comes into play only
if an issue we are asked to resolve has already been decided in the same
litigation. See Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979). In its
earlier decision, the Ninth Circuit addressed only Buono’s standing to
seek the original injunction barring the display of the cross on public
land. See Buono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 546–548 (2004). It had no
occasion to address his standing to seek an expansion of the injunction
to bar a transfer enabling the cross’s display on private property.
