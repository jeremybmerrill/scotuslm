Per Curiam

although Porter instructed him not to speak with Porter’s
ex-wife or son, Porter did not give him any other instruc
tions limiting the witnesses he could interview.
Counsel thus failed to uncover and present any evidence
of Porter’s mental health or mental impairment, his family
background, or his military service. The decision not to
investigate did not reflect reasonable professional judg
ment. Wiggins, supra, at 534. Porter may have been
fatalistic or uncooperative, but that does not obviate the
need for defense counsel to conduct some sort of mitigation
investigation. See Rompilla, supra, at 381–382.

Because we find Porter’s counsel deficient, we must
determine whether the Florida Supreme Court unrea
sonably applied Strickland in holding Porter was not
prejudiced by that deficiency. Under Strickland, a defen
dant is prejudiced by his counsel’s deficient performance if
“there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would
have been different.” 466 U. S., at 694. In Florida, the
sentencing judge makes the determination as to the exis
tence and weight of aggravating and mitigating circum
stances and the punishment, Fla. Stat. §921.141(3), but he
must give the jury verdict of life or death “great weight,”
Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975) (per cu
riam). Porter must show that but for his counsel’s defi
ciency, there is a reasonable probability he would have
received a different sentence. To assess that probability,
we consider “the totality of the available mitigation evi
dence—both that adduced at trial, and the evidence ad
duced in the habeas proceeding”—and “reweig[h] it
against the evidence in aggravation.” Williams, supra, at
397–398.
This is not a case in which the new evidence “would
barely have altered the sentencing profile presented to the
