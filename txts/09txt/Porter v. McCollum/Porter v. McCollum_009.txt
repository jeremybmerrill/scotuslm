weighing the evidence in mitigation, including the trial
evidence suggesting that “this was a crime of passion, that
[Porter] was drinking heavily just hours before the mur
ders, or that [Porter] had a good relationship with his
son.” Id., at *30.
The Eleventh Circuit reversed. It held the District
Court had failed to appropriately defer to the state court’s
factual findings with respect to Porter’s alcohol abuse and
his mental health. 552 F. 3d 1260, 1274, 1275 (2008) (per
curiam). The Court of Appeals then separately considered
each category of mitigating evidence and held it was not
unreasonable for the state court to discount each category
as it did. Id., at 1274. Porter petitioned for a writ of
certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse with respect
to the Court of Appeals’ disposition of Porter’s ineffectiveassistance claim.

466 U. S., at 688. To establish prejudice, he “must show
that there is a reasonable probability that, but for coun

would have been different.” Id., at 694. Finally, Porter is
entitled to relief only if the state court’s rejection of his
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was “contrary to,
or involved an unreasonable application of” Strickland, or
it rested “on an unreasonable determination of the facts in
light of the evidence presented in the State court proceed
ing.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d).
Because the state court did not decide whether Porter’s
counsel was deficient, we review this element of Porter’s
Strickland claim de novo. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S.
374, 390 (2005). It is unquestioned that under the prevail
