defects were present when he was evaluated for compe
tency to stand trial. 2 Tr. 227–228 (Jan. 5, 1996); see also
Record 904–906. Although the State’s experts reached
different conclusions regarding the statutory mitigators,5
each expert testified that he could not diagnose Porter or
rule out a brain abnormality. 2 Tr. 345, 382 (Jan. 5,
1996); 3 id., at 405.
The trial judge who conducted the state postconviction
hearing, without determining counsel’s deficiency, held
that Porter had not been prejudiced by the failure to in

found that Porter had failed to establish any statutory
mitigating circumstances, id., at 1207, and that the non
statutory mitigating evidence would not have made a
difference in the outcome of the case, id., at 1210. He
discounted the evidence of Porter’s alcohol abuse because
it was inconsistent and discounted the evidence of Porter’s
abusive childhood because he was 54 years old at the time
of the trial. He also concluded that Porter’s periods of
being AWOL would have reduced the impact of Porter’s
military service to “inconsequential proportions.” Id., at
1212. Finally, he held that even considering all three
categories of evidence together, the “trial judge and jury
still would have imposed death.” Id., at 1214.
The Florida Supreme Court affirmed. It first accepted

the trial court’s acceptance of the State’s experts’ conclu

State presented two experts, Dr. Riebsame and Dr. Kirkland.
Neither of the State’s experts had examined Porter, but each testified
that based upon their review of the record, Porter met neither statutory
mitigating circumstance.
