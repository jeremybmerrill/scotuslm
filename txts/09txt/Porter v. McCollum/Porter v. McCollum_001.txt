SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
GEORGE PORTER, JR. v. BILL MCCOLLUM,
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA, ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 08–10537.

Decided November 30, 2009 


PER CURIAM.
Petitioner George Porter is a veteran who was both
wounded and decorated for his active participation in two
major engagements during the Korean War; his combat
service unfortunately left him a traumatized, changed
man. His commanding officer’s moving description of
those two battles was only a fraction of the mitigating
evidence that his counsel failed to discover or present
during the penalty phase of his trial in 1988.
In this federal postconviction proceeding, the District
Court held that Porter’s lawyer’s failure to adduce that
evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel
and granted his application for a writ of habeas corpus.
The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, on
the ground that the Florida Supreme Court’s determina
tion that Porter was not prejudiced by any deficient per
formance by his counsel was a reasonable application of
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Like the
District Court, we are persuaded that it was objectively
unreasonable to conclude there was no reasonable prob
ability the sentence would have been different if the sen
tencing judge and jury had heard the significant mitiga
tion evidence that Porter’s counsel neither uncovered nor
presented. We therefore grant the petition for certiorari in
part and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.1
