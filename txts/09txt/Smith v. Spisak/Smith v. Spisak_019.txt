SMITH v. SPISAK
Opinion of the Court

under §2254(d)(1) should not apply to this claim because
the Ohio Supreme Court may not have reached the ques
tion whether counsel’s closing argument caused Spisak
prejudice. That is, the Ohio Supreme Court’s summary
rejection of this claim did not indicate whether that court
rested its conclusion upon a finding (1) that counsel was
not ineffective, or (2) that a better argument would not
have made a difference, or (3) both. See State v. Spisak,
36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N. E. 2d, at 802. Spisak argues
that, under these circumstances, a federal court should
not defer to a state court that may not have decided a
question, but instead should decide the matter afresh.
Lower federal courts have rejected arguments similar to
Spisak’s. See, e.g., Hennon v. Cooper, 109 F. 3d 330, 334–
335 (CA7 1997); see also Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225,
231, 237 (2000) (applying the §2254(d) standard in case
involving a state court’s summary denial of a claim,
though not a Strickland claim, and without full briefing
regarding whether or how §2254(d) applied to a summary
decision); Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 605–606
(CA3 2002) (Alito, J.) (relying on Weeks in holding that
§2254(d) applies where a state court denies a claim on the
merits without giving any indication how it reached its
decision); see generally 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal
Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §32.2, pp. 1574–
1579 (5th ed. 2005 and 2008 Supp.). However, we need
not decide whether deference under §2254(d)(1) is re
quired here. With or without such deference, our conclu
sion is the same.
For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.
It is so ordered.
