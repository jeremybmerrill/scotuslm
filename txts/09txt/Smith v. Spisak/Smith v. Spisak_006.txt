Opinion of the Court

trial. The Court of Appeals held the sentencing instruc
tions unconstitutional because, in its view, the instruc
tions, taken together with the forms, “require[d]” juror
“unanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor”—
contrary to this Court’s holding in Mills v. Maryland,
supra. 465 F. 3d, at 708. Since the parties do not dispute
that the Ohio courts “adjudicated” this claim, i.e., they
considered and rejected it “on the merits,” the law permits
a federal court to reach a contrary decision only if the
state-court decision “was contrary to, or involved an un
reasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United
States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Unlike the Court of
Appeals, we conclude that Spisak’s claim does not satisfy
this standard.
The parties, like the Court of Appeals, assume that
Mills sets forth the pertinent “clearly established Federal
law.” While recognizing some uncertainty as to whether
Mills was “clearly established Federal law” for the purpose
of reviewing the Ohio Supreme Court’s opinion, we shall
assume the same. Compare Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.
362, 390 (2000) (STEVENS, J., for the Court) (applicable
date for purposes of determining whether “Federal law” is
“established” is when the “state-court conviction became
final”), with id., at 412 (O’Connor, J., for the Court) (appli
cable date is “the time of the relevant state-court deci
sion”); see State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N. E. 2d
800 (decided Apr. 13, 1988), cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1071
(decided Mar. 6, 1989); Mills v. Maryland, supra (decided
June 6, 1988).
A
The rule the Court set forth in Mills is based on two
well-established principles. First, the Constitution forbids
imposition of the death penalty if the sentencing judge or
jury is “ ‘ “precluded from considering, as a mitigating
