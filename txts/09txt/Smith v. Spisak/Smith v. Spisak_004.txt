KEITH SMITH, WARDEN, PETITIONER v. FRANK G.

SPISAK, JR. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[January 12, 2010]


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Frank G. Spisak, Jr., the respondent, was convicted in
an Ohio trial court of three murders and two attempted
murders. He was sentenced to death. He filed a habeas
corpus petition in federal court, claiming that constitu
tional errors occurred at his trial. First, Spisak claimed
that the jury instructions at the penalty phase unconstitu
tionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only
those factors that the jury unanimously found to be miti
gating. See Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988).
Second, Spisak claimed that he suffered significant harm
as a result of his counsel’s inadequate closing argument at
the penalty phase of the proceeding. See Strickland v.
Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The Federal Court of
Appeals accepted these arguments and ordered habeas
relief. We now reverse the Court of Appeals.
