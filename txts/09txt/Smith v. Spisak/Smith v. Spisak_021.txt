SMITH v. SPISAK
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

told that it must reach its decision unanimously. The jury
was not instructed on the consequence of their failure to
agree unanimously that Spisak should be sentenced to
death. Spisak and the Court of Appeals both described
these instructions as “acquittal first” because they would
have led a reasonable jury to believe that it first had to
“acquit” the defendant of death—unanimously—before it
could give effect to a lesser penalty.
Following its prior decision in Davis v. Mitchell, 318
F. 3d 682 (CA6 2003), in which it struck down “virtually
identical” jury instructions, Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d
684, 710 (CA6 2006), the Court of Appeals concluded that
the instructions given during Spisak’s penalty phase were
impermissible because they “require[d] the jury to unani
mously reject a death sentence before considering other
sentencing alternatives,” id., at 709. In Davis, the court
had explained that an instruction that requires a capital
jury to “first unanimously reject the death penalty before
it can consider a life sentence . . . precludes the individual
jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence . . . .” 318
F. 3d, at 689. The source of this constitutional infirmity,
the court decided, was our decision in Mills v. Maryland,
——————
solitary juror may prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding
that the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the
mitigating factors. Jurors from this point forward should be so in
structed.” State v. Brooks, 75 Ohio St. 3d 148, 162, 661 N. E. 2d 1030,
1042. Although the Brooks decision signaled a change in Ohio’s capital
jury instructions, it was not a change in state law: One juror had the
power to prevent a death penalty recommendation before Brooks. See
State v. Springer, 63 Ohio St. 3d 167, 172, 586 N. E. 2d 96, 100 (1992)
(holding that an offender must be sentenced to life if the penalty-phase
jury deadlocks). Thus, consistent with our view that “accurate sentenc
ing information is an indispensable prerequisite to a [jury’s] determina
tion of whether a defendant shall live or die,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428
U. S. 153, 190 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS,
JJ.), the Ohio high court laudably improved upon the accuracy of Ohio
capital jury instructions in Brooks.
