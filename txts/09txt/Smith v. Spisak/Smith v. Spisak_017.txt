SMITH v. SPISAK
Opinion of the Court

the Ohio insanity standard at the time of the crimes. Id.,
at 1898–1899, 1911–1912, 1995; id., at 2017, 2022 (July
12, 1983).
During the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense
counsel called three expert witnesses, all of whom testified
that Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.
Dr. Sandra McPherson, a clinical psychologist, said that
Spisak suffered from schizotypal and borderline personal

In light of this background and for the following rea
sons, we do not find that the assumed deficiencies in
defense counsel’s closing argument raise “a reasonable
probability that,” but for the deficient closing, “the result
of the proceeding would have been different.” Strickland,
466 U. S., at 694. We therefore cannot find the Ohio
Supreme Court’s decision rejecting Spisak’s ineffective
assistance-of-counsel claim to be an “unreasonable appli

§2254(d)(1).
First, since the sentencing phase took place immediately
following the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jurors had
fresh in their minds the government’s evidence regarding
the killings—which included photographs of the dead
bodies, images that formed the basis of defense counsel’s
