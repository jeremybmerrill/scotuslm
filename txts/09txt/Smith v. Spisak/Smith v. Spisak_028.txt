Opinion of STEVENS, J.

failure to achieve either of these objectives through his
closing argument. In short, counsel’s argument grossly
transgressed the bounds of what constitutionally compe
tent counsel would have done in a similar situation.
III
Notwithstanding these two serious constitutional errors,
I agree with the Court that these errors do not entitle
Spisak to relief. As JUSTICE BREYER’s discussion in Part
III makes vividly clear, see ante, at 11–14, Spisak’s own
conduct alienated and ostracized the jury, and his crimes
were monstrous. In my judgment even the most skillful of
closing arguments—even one befitting Clarence Darrow—
would not have created a reasonable probability of a dif
ferent outcome in this case. Similarly, in light of Spisak’s
conduct before the jury and the gravity of the aggravating
circumstances of the offense, the instructional error was
also harmless because it did not have a substantial and
injurious effect on this record, Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507
U. S. 619, 623 (1993).
Accordingly, I concur in the judgment and concur in the
Court’s discussion of prejudice in Part III of its opinion.
