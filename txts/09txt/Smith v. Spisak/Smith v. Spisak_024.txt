Opinion of STEVENS, J.

ports such an option.
The acquittal-first jury instructions used during
Spisak’s penalty phase interposed before the jury the same
false choice that our holding in Beck prohibits. By requir
ing Spisak’s jury to decide first whether the State had met
its burden with respect to the death sentence, and to reach
that decision unanimously, the instructions deprived the
jury of a meaningful opportunity to consider the third
option that was before it, namely, a life sentence. Indeed,
these instructions are every bit as pernicious as those at
issue in Beck because they would have led individual
jurors (falsely) to believe that their failure to agree might
have resulted in a new trial and that, in any event, they
could not give effect to their determination that a life
sentence was appropriate unless and until they had first
convinced each of their peers on the jury to reject the
death sentence.
Admittedly, Spisak has never identified Beck as the
source of the constitutional infirmity at issue in this case,
nor did the courts below cite or rely upon it. But Spisak
has consistently pressed his argument in terms that are
wholly consistent with Beck. On direct appeal he con
tended, for example, that he:
“was severely prejudiced by the erroneous jury forms
because the jurors were never informed of what would
happen if they were unable to reach a unanimous de
cision. That may have led to irreparable speculation
that if they failed to agree, Frank Spisak would be
freed or have a new trial or sentencing hearing. Such
improper speculation may have led those not in
agreement with death to go along with a majority.
The jury should have been instructed that if they were
unable to unanimously agree to death they must re
turn a verdict of one of the life sentences or in the al
ternative, the court would impose a life sentence.”
