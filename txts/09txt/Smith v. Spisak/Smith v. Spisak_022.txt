Opinion of STEVENS, J.

486 U. S. 367 (1988). For the reasons cogently examined
in JUSTICE BREYER’s opinion, ante, at 5–9, I agree that
Mills does not clearly establish that the instructions at
issue were unconstitutional. But, in my view, our decision
in Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), does.2
In Beck we held that the death penalty may not be
imposed “when the jury was not permitted to consider a
verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and
when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.”
Id., at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted). At that
time, the Alabama death penalty statute had been “consis
tently construed to preclude any lesser included offense
instructions in capital cases.” Id., at 629, n. 3. Thus, the
Alabama jury was “given the choice of either convicting
the defendant of the capital crime, in which case it [was]
required to impose the death penalty, or acquitting him,
thus allowing him to escape all penalties for his alleged
participation in the crime.” Id., at 628–629. Because of
the unique features of Alabama’s capital punishment
system,3 Beck’s jury believed that either it had to convict
Beck, thus sending him to his death, or acquit him, thus
setting him free. The jury was not presented with the
“third option” of convicting him of a noncapital offense,
thus ensuring that he would receive a substantial pun
ishment but not receive the death penalty. Id., at 642.
We concluded that the false choice before the jury—death

2 Notably,

Beck substantially predates Spisak’s trial and thus my
application of Beck obviates any discussion on when federal law is
established for Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
purposes, see ante, at 3. Regardless, in accordance with the view I
expressed in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 379–380 (2000) (opinion
of STEVENS, J.), I would conclude that our decision in Mills, decided
before Spisak’s conviction became final, is also available to him.
3 Under Alabama law, the judge conducts a separate penalty-phase
proceeding after the jury has returned a conviction on a capital offense.
Beck, 447 U. S., at 629. Thus, the jury reasonably believed that its
verdict would set the defendant’s punishment at death.
