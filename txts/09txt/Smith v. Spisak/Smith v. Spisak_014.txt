Opinion of the Court

2924, the jurors should draw on their own sense of “pride”
for living in “a humane society” made up of “a humane
people,” id., at 2897–2900, 2926–2928. That humanity,
he said, required the jury to weigh the evidence “fairly”
and to be “loyal to that oath” the jurors had taken to up
hold the law. Id., at 2926.
Spisak and his supporting amici say that this argument
was constitutionally inadequate because: (1) It overly
emphasized the gruesome nature of the killings; (2) it
overly emphasized Spisak’s threats to continue his crimes;
(3) it understated the facts upon which the experts based
their mental illness conclusions; (4) it said little or nothing
about any other possible mitigating circumstance; and (5)
it made no explicit request that the jury return a verdict
against death.
We assume for present purposes that Spisak is correct
that the closing argument was inadequate. We neverthe

argument without these defects would have made a sig
nificant difference.
Any different, more adequate closing argument would
have taken place in the following context: Spisak admitted
that he had committed three murders and two other shoot

guilty by reason of insanity. And counsel, apparently
hoping to demonstrate Spisak’s mentally defective condi
tion, called him to the stand.
Spisak testified that he had shot and killed Horace
Rickerson, Timothy Sheehan, and Brian Warford. He also
admitted that he had shot and tried to kill John Har
daway, and shot at Coletta Dartt. He committed these
crimes, he said, because he was a follower of Adolf Hitler,
who was Spisak’s “spiritual leader” in a “war” for “sur
vival” of “the Aryan people.” 4 id., at 1343–1344, 1396
(July 5, 1983). He said that he had purchased guns and
