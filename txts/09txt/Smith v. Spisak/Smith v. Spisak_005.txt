SMITH v. SPISAK
Opinion of the Court

both on direct appeal and on collateral review. State v.
Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N. E. 2d 800 (1988) (per
curiam); State v. Spisak, No. 67229, 1995 WL 229108
(Ohio App., 8th Dist., Cuyahoga Cty., Apr. 13, 1995); State
v. Spisak, 73 Ohio St. 3d 151, 652 N. E. 2d 719 (1995) (per
curiam).
Spisak then sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.
Among other claims, he argued that the sentencing phase
of his trial violated the U. S. Constitution for the two
reasons we consider here. The District Court denied his
petition. Spisak v. Coyle, Case No. 1:95CV2675 (ND Ohio,
Apr. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a. But the Court of
Appeals accepted Spisak’s two claims, namely, his mitiga
tion instruction claim and his ineffective-assistance-of
counsel claim. Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d 684, 703–706,
708–711 (CA6 2006). The Court of Appeals consequently
ordered the District Court to issue a conditional writ of
habeas corpus forbidding Spisak’s execution. Id., at 715–
716.
The State of Ohio then sought certiorari in this Court.
We granted the petition and vacated the Court of Appeals’
judgment. Hudson v. Spisak, 552 U. S. 945 (2007). We
remanded the case for further consideration in light of two
recent cases in which this Court had held that lower fed
eral courts had not properly taken account of the defer
ence federal law grants state-court determinations on
federal habeas review. Ibid.; see 28 U. S. C. §2254(d);
Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70 (2006); Schriro v. Landri
gan, 550 U. S. 465 (2007). On remand, the Sixth Circuit
reinstated its earlier opinion. Spisak v. Hudson, 512 F. 3d
852, 853–854 (2008). The State again sought certiorari.
We again granted the petition. And we now reverse.
