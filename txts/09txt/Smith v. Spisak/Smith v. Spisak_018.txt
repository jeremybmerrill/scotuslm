Opinion of the Court

vivid descriptions of the crimes—as well as Spisak’s boast
ful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit
further acts of violence. We therefore do not see how a
less descriptive closing argument with fewer disparaging
comments about Spisak could have made a significant
difference.
Similarly fresh in the jurors’ minds was the three de
fense experts’ testimony that Spisak suffered from mental
illness. The jury had heard the experts explain the spe
cific facts upon which they had based their conclusions, as
well as what they had learned of his family background
and his struggles with gender identity. And the jury had
heard the experts draw connections between his mental
illness and the crimes. We do not see how it could have
made a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his
actual argument—which emphasized mental illness as a
mitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts’
testimony—by repeating the facts or connections that the
experts had just described.
Nor does Spisak tell us what other mitigating factors
counsel might have mentioned. All those he proposes
essentially consist of aspects of the “mental defect” factor
that the defense experts described.
Finally, in light of counsel’s several appeals to the ju
rors’ sense of humanity—he used the words “humane
people” and “humane society” 10 times at various points in
the argument—we cannot find that a more explicit or
more elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the
result, either alone or together with the other circum
stances just discussed. Thus, we conclude that there is not
a reasonable probability that a more adequate closing
argument would have changed the result, and that the
Ohio Supreme Court’s rejection of Spisak’s claim was not
“contrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of” Strick
land. 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).
Spisak contends that the deferential standard of review
