SMITH v. SPISAK
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

or acquit—“introduce[d] a level of uncertainty and unreli
ability into the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated
in a capital case.” Id., at 643. In other words,
“the difficulty with the Alabama statute is that it in
terjects irrelevant considerations into the factfinding
process, diverting the jury’s attention from the central
issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of
proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
is guilty of a capital crime. Thus, on the one hand, the
unavailability of the third option of convicting on a
lesser included offense may encourage the jury to con

defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should
be punished. On the other hand, the apparently
mandatory nature of the death penalty may encour
age it to acquit for an equally impermissible reason—
that, whatever his crime, the defendant does not de
serve death.” Id., at 642–643.
Although Beck dealt with guilt-phase instructions, the
reach of its holding is not so limited. The “third option” we
discussed in Beck was, plainly, a life sentence. Moreover,
the unusual features of the Alabama capital sentencing
scheme collapsed the guilt and penalty phases before the
jury (but not before the judge). Our concern in Beck was
that presenting the jury with only two options—death or
no punishment—introduced a risk of arbitrariness and
error into the deliberative process that the Constitution
could not abide in the capital context. See Spaziano v.
Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 455 (1984) (“The goal of the Beck
rule, in other words, is to eliminate the distortion of the
factfinding process that is created when the jury is forced
into an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and
innocence”). We held, therefore, that the jury must be
given a meaningful opportunity to consider and embrace
the equivalent of a life-sentence when the evidence sup
