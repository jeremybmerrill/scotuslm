SMITH v. SPISAK
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

marks omitted).
Presumably to “gain credibility” with the jury, Brief of
Petitioner 37, counsel argued that his client deserved no
sympathy for his actions:
“Sympathy, of course, is not part of your considera
tion. And even if it was, certainly, don’t look to him
for sympathy, because he demands none. And, ladies
and gentlemen, when you turn and look at Frank
Spisak, don’t look for good deeds, because he has done
none. Don’t look for good thoughts, because he has
none. He is sick, he is twisted. He is demented, and
he is never going to be any different.” 465 F. 3d, at
705 (internal quotation marks omitted).
And then the strategy really broke down: At no point
did counsel endeavor to direct his negative statements
about his client toward an express appeal for leniency.5
On the contrary, counsel concluded by telling the jury that
“whatever you do, we are going to be proud of you,” ibid.
(internal quotation marks omitted), which I take to mean
that, in counsel’s view, “either outcome, death or life,
would be a valid conclusion,” ibid.
Spisak’s crimes, and the seemingly unmitigated hatred
motivating their commission, were truly awful. But that
does not excuse a lawyer’s duty to represent his client
within the bounds of prevailing professional norms. The
mere fact that counsel, laudably, may have had a “strat
egy” to build rapport with the jury and lessen the impact
of the prosecution’s case, does not excuse counsel’s utter
——————
aggravating circumstances but not including heinous circumstances of
offense).
5 Counsel did attempt to appeal to the jury’s sense of humanity, per
haps implicitly suggesting that humane people do not condemn others,
especially those with mental illness, to death. App. to Pet. for Cert.
339a–341a. But counsel never requested a life sentence on behalf of his
client.
