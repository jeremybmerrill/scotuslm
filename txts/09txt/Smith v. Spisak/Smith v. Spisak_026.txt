Opinion of STEVENS, J.

catastrophe of counsel’s failed strategy. Suffice it to say
that the argument shares far more in common with a
prosecutor’s closing than with a criminal defense attor
ney’s. Indeed, the argument was so outrageous that it
would have rightly subjected a prosecutor to charges of
misconduct. See Brief for Steven Lubet et al. as Amici
Curiae 15–16 (observing that counsel’s closing argument
“would have been improper even coming from the prosecu
tor”). A few examples are in order.
Presumably to take the “sting” out of the prosecution’s
case, Brief for Petitioner 37, counsel described his client’s
acts in vivid detail to the jury:
“[Y]ou can smell almost the blood. You can smell, if

descriptions of Spisak’s crimes were irrelevant under state law even for
purposes of the State’s case for aggravating circumstances. See State v.
Wogenstahl, 75 Ohio St. 3d 344, 356, 662 N. E. 2d 311, 322 (1996)
(“[T]he nature and circumstances of the offense may only enter into the
statutory weighing process on the side of mitigation”); see also State v.
