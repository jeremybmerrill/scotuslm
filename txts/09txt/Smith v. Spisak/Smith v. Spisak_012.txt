Opinion of the Court

sion upholding these forms and instructions was not “con
trary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly
established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States” in Mills.
28 U. S. C.
§2254(d)(1).
We add that the Court of Appeals found the jury in
structions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that
the instructions “require[d] the jury to unanimously reject
a death sentence before considering other sentencing
alternatives.” 465 F. 3d, at 709 (citing Maples v. Coyle,
171 F. 3d 408, 416–417 (CA6 1999)). We have not, how

arguably analogous claim). But see post, at 3–5 (STEVENS,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). What

forms in this case were we to consider them on direct
appeal, the jury instructions at Spisak’s trial were not
contrary to “clearly established Federal law.” 28 U. S. C.
§2254(d)(1).

quate as to violate the Sixth Amendment. To prevail,
Spisak must show both that “counsel’s representation fell
below an objective standard of reasonableness,” Strick
land, 466 U. S., at 688, and that there is a “reasonable
probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors,
the result of the proceeding would have been different,”
id., at 694.
The Ohio Supreme Court held that Spisak’s claim was
