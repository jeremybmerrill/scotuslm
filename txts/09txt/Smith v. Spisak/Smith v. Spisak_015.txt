SMITH v. SPISAK
Opinion of the Court

stockpiled ammunition to further this war. Id., at 1406–
1408. And he had hoped to “create terror” at Cleveland
State University, because it was “one of the prime targets”
where the “Jews and the system . . . are brainwashing the
youth.” Id., at 1426–1428.
Spisak then said that in February 1982 he had shot
Rickerson, who was black, because Rickerson had made a
sexual advance on Spisak in a university bathroom. He
expressed satisfaction at having “eliminated that particu
lar threat . . . to me and to the white race.” 5 id., at 1511
(July 7, 1983). In June he saw a stranger, John Har
daway, on a train platform and shot him seven times
because he had been looking for a black person to kill as
“blood atonement” for a recent crime against two white
women. 4 id., at 1416 (July 5, 1983). He added that he
felt “good” after shooting Hardaway because he had “ac
complished something,” but later felt “[k]ind of bad” when
he learned that Hardaway had survived. Id., at 1424–
1425. In August 1982, Spisak shot at Coletta Dartt be
cause, he said, he heard her “making some derisive re
marks about us,” meaning the Nazi Party. Id., at 1432–
1435. Later that August, he shot and killed Timothy
Sheehan because he “thought he was one of those Jewish
professors . . . that liked to hang around in the men’s room
and seduce and pervert and subvert the young people that
go there.” 5 id., at 1465–1466 (July 7, 1983). Spisak
added that he was “sorry about that” murder because he
later learned Sheehan “wasn’t Jewish like I thought he
was.” Ibid. And three days later, while on a “search and
destroy mission,” he shot and killed Brian Warford, a
young black man who “looked like he was almost asleep”
in a bus shelter, to fulfill his “duty” to “inflict the maxi
mum amount of casualties on the enemies.” Id., at 1454–
1455, 1478.
Spisak also testified that he would continue to commit
similar crimes if he had the chance. He said about War
