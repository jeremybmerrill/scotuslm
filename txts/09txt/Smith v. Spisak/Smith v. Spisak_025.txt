SMITH v. SPISAK
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

Exh. 28D, 16 Record 391 (Brief for Supreme Court of
Ohio).
The untenable choice Spisak describes is perfectly analo
gous to the quandary, discussed above, that we described
in Beck. See also 447 U. S., at 644 (“It is extremely doubt

mistrial option will ultimately lead to the right result.
Thus, they could have no assurance that a second trial
would end in the conviction of the defendant on a lesser
included offense” (footnote omitted)). Spisak and the
Court of Appeals both correctly assailed the jury instruc

a reasonable one and, indeed, was a reasonable strategy
under the difficult circumstances of this case. Even
Spisak concedes that his counsel “faced an admittedly

case.
It is difficult to convey how thoroughly egregious coun
sel’s closing argument was without reproducing it in its
entirety.
The Court’s assessment of the closing as
“lengthy and rambling” and its brief description of its
content, see ante, at 10, does not accurately capture the
