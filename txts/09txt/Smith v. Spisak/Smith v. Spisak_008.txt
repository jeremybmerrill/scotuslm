Opinion of the Court 


B

In evaluating the Court of Appeals’ determination here,
we have examined the jury instructions and verdict forms
at issue in Mills and compared them with those used in
the present case. In the Mills sentencing phase, the trial
judge instructed the jury to fill out a verdict form that had
three distinct parts. Section I set forth a list of 10 specific
aggravating circumstances next to which were spaces
where the jury was to mark “yes” or “no.” Just above the
list, the form said:
“Based upon the evidence we unanimously find that
each of the following aggravating circumstances which
is marked ‘yes’ has been proven . . . and each aggra
vating circumstance which is marked ‘no’ has not been
proven . . . .” 486 U. S., at 384–385 (emphasis added;
internal quotation marks omitted).
Section II set forth a list of eight potentially mitigating
circumstances (seven specific circumstances and the
eighth designated as “other”) next to which were spaces
where the jury was to mark “yes” or “no.” Just above the
list the form said:
“Based upon the evidence we unanimously find that
each of the following mitigating circumstances which
is marked ‘yes’ has been proven to exist . . . and each
mitigating circumstance marked ‘no’ has not been
proven . . . .” Id., at 387 (emphasis added; internal
quotation marks omitted).
Section III set forth the overall balancing question, along
with spaces for the jury to mark “yes” or “no.” It said:
“Based on the evidence we unanimously find that it
has been proven . . . that the mitigating circumstances
marked ‘yes’ in Section II outweigh the aggravating
circumstances marked ‘yes’ in Section I.” Id., at 388–
389 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omit
