SCALIA, J., dissenting

Youngblood v. West Virginia, 547 U. S. 867, 872 (2006)
(same), and the newly-minted Summary Remand for More
Extensive
Opinion
than
Petitioner
Requested
(SRMEOPR), see Webster v. Cooper, 558 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 3). Today the Court adds another beast
to our growing menagerie: the SRIE, Summary Remand
for Inconsequential Error—or, as the Court would have it,
the SRTAEH, Summary Remand to Think About an Evi
dentiary Hearing.
It disrespects the judges of the Courts of Appeals, who
are appointed and confirmed as we are, to vacate and send
back their authorized judgments for inconsequential im
perfection of opinion—as though we were schoolmasters
grading their homework. An appropriately self-respecting
response to today’s summary vacatur would be summary
reissuance of the same opinion, minus the discussion of
Cone. That would also serve the purpose of minimizing
the delay of justice that today’s GVR achieves (Wellons
has already outlived his victim by 20 years; he committed
his murder in 1989).
