ALITO, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
MARCUS A. WELLONS v. HILTON HALL, WARDEN
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 09–5731. Decided January 19, 2010


JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,
dissenting.
The Court’s disposition of this case represents a misuse
of our authority to grant, vacate, and remand (GVR). The
decision of the Court of Appeals plainly rests on two inde

inappropriate relationship that impaired his right to a fair
trial and, second, that petitioner’s claim failed on the
merits. See 554 F. 3d 923, 936 (CA11 2009). While it is
true that the first of these grounds is inconsistent with
Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___ , ___ (2009) (slip op., at 17–18),
there is no basis for vacating the decision below unless
some recent authority or development provides a basis for
reconsideration of the second ground as well. But the per
curiam identifies no such authority. Instead, the per
curiam uses Cone as a vehicle for suggesting that the
Court of Appeals should reconsider its decision on the
merits of petitioner’s claim.
In order to defend this disposition, the per curiam re
fuses to credit the Court of Appeals’ explanation of the
basis of its decision. The Court of Appeals twice stated in
unequivocal terms that its holding on the merits of peti
tioner’s claim was independent of its holding on the ques
tion of procedural default. See 554 F. 3d, at 937–938
(“[E]ven if these claims were properly before us on habeas
review, we would not disturb the Georgia Supreme Court’s
conclusion on the merits of these claims”); id., at 936
(“Even if we assume that Wellons’s misconduct claims are
