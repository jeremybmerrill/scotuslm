SCALIA, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
MARCUS A. WELLONS v. HILTON HALL, WARDEN
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 09–5731. Decided January 19, 2010


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.
Petitioner Marcus Wellons was convicted in Georgia
state court of capital murder and sentenced to death.
After exhausting direct appeal and state postconviction
review, he filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal
court under 28 U. S. C. §2254. Wellons claims, among
other things, that misconduct on the part of the trial
judge, jurors, and court bailiff deprived him of a fair trial.
The District Court denied relief, and the Eleventh Circuit
affirmed.
Today the Court grants Wellons’ petition for certiorari,
vacates the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit, and re
mands (“GVRs”) in light of Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___
(2009). The Eleventh Circuit concluded that Wellons’
claims were procedurally barred because the state post
conviction court, noting that the State Supreme Court had
rejected them on direct appeal, held the claims were res
judicata. See 554 F. 3d 923, 936, and n. 6 (2009). This
was error under Cone, see 556 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op.,
at 17–18), as respondent recognizes; indeed, the Eleventh
Circuit has already recognized the abrogation of the opin
ion below on this point, see Owen v. Secretary for Dept. of
Corrections, 568 F. 3d 894, 915, n. 23, (2009). But, as
JUSTICE ALITO’s dissent demonstrates, post, p. ___, the
Eleventh Circuit (like the District Court) also decided that
petitioner was not entitled to habeas relief on the merits.
554 F. 3d, at 936–938. Thus the Court GVRs in light of
Cone even though the issue on which Cone throws light
