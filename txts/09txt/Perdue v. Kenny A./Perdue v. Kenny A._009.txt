PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of the Court

Unfortunately, the statute does not explain what Congress
meant by a “reasonable” fee, and therefore the task of
identifying an appropriate methodology for determining a
“reasonable” fee was left for the courts.
One possible method was set out in Johnson v. Georgia
Highway Express, Inc., 488 F. 2d 714, 717–719 (CA5
1974), which listed 12 factors that a court should consider
in determining a reasonable fee.4 This method, however,
“gave very little actual guidance to district courts. Setting
attorney’s fees by reference to a series of sometimes sub
jective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges
and produced disparate results.” Delaware Valley I,
supra, at 563.
An alternative, the lodestar approach, was pioneered by
the Third Circuit in Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Philadel

487 F. 2d 161 (1973), appeal after remand, 540 F. 2d 102
(1976), and “achieved dominance in the federal courts”
after our decision in Hensley. Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535
U. S. 789, 801 (2002). “Since that time, ‘[t]he “lodestar”
figure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light
of our fee-shifting jurisprudence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Dague,
supra, at 562).
Although the lodestar method is not perfect, it has
several important virtues. First, in accordance with our
understanding of the aim of fee-shifting statutes, the
lodestar looks to “the prevailing market rates in the rele

and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the
legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney
due to the acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the
fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or
the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9)
the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the ‘unde
sirability’ of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional
relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.” Hensley
v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 430, n. 3 (1983).
