PETITIONERS v. KENNY A., BY HIS NEXT FRIEND

LINDA WINN, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[April 21, 2010] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.
If one were to ask an attorney or a judge to name the
significant cases of his or her career, it would be unsur
prising to find the list includes a case then being argued or
just decided. When immersed in a case, lawyers and
judges find within it a fascination, an intricacy, an impor
tance that transcends what the detached observer sees.
So the pending or just completed case will often seem
extraordinary to its participants. That is the dynamic of
the adversary system, the system that so well serves the
law.
It is proper for the Court today to reject the proposition
that all enhancements are barred; still, it must be under
stood that extraordinary cases are presented only in the
rarest circumstances.
With these comments, I join in full the opinion of the
Court.
