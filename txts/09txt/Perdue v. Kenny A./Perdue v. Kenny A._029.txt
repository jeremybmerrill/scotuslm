PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of BREYER, J.

indicates) and tapped its own law department for an addi
tional 5,200 hours of work. 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1287.
Third, in the face of this opposition, the results obtained
by the plaintiffs’ attorneys appear to have been excep
tional. The 47-page consent decree negotiated over the
course of the mediation sets forth 31 specific steps that the
State will take in order to address the specific deficiencies
of the sort that I described above. See id., at 1289; see
also App. 92–207 (consent decree). And it establishes a
reporting and oversight mechanism that is backed up by
the District Court’s enforcement authority. See 454
F. Supp. 2d, at 1289. As a result of the decree, the State
agreed to comprehensive reforms of its foster-care system,
to the benefit of children in many different communities.
And informed observers have described the decree as
having brought about significant positive results. See,
e.g., Record, Doc. 632, p. 4 (most recent court-appointed
overseers’ report) (“The State’s overall performance . . .
continues the trend of steady improvement . . .”); id., at 4–

provements); see also, Office of the Child Advocate Ann.
