vant community.” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 895
(1984). Developed after the practice of hourly billing had
become widespread, see Gisbrecht, supra, at 801, the
lodestar method produces an award that roughly approxi
mates the fee that the prevailing attorney would have
received if he or she had been representing a paying client
who was billed by the hour in a comparable case. Second,
the lodestar method is readily administrable, see Dague,
505 U. S., at 566; see also Buckhannon Board & Care
Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human
Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 609 (2001); and unlike the John
son approach, the lodestar calculation is “objective,”
Hensley, supra, at 433, and thus cabins the discretion of
trial judges, permits meaningful judicial review, and
produces reasonably predictable results.
III
Our prior decisions concerning the federal fee-shifting
statutes have established six important rules that lead to
our decision in this case.
First, a “reasonable” fee is a fee that is sufficient to
induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation
of a meritorious civil rights case. See Delaware Valley I,
478 U. S., at 565 (“[I]f plaintiffs . . . find it possible to
engage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he
will be paid a ‘reasonable fee,’ the purpose behind the fee
shifting statute has been satisfied”); Blum, supra, at 897
(“[A] reasonable attorney’s fee is one that is adequate to
attract competent counsel, but that does not produce
windfalls to attorneys” (ellipsis, brackets, and internal
quotation marks omitted)). Section 1988’s aim is to en
force the covered civil rights statutes, not to provide “a
form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of
attorneys.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565.
Second, the lodestar method yields a fee that is pre
sumptively sufficient to achieve this objective. See Dague,
