Opinion of the Court

U. S. 557 (1992), when it relied on “ ‘the fact that class
counsel’s compensation was totally contingent upon pre
vailing in this action.’ ” 532 F. 3d, at 1226, 1228 (quoting
affidavit in support of fee request).
Judge Wilson concurred in the judgment but disagreed
with Judge Carnes’ view that Eleventh Circuit precedent
is inconsistent with our decisions. Judge Hill also con
curred in the judgment but expressed no view about the
correctness of the prior Circuit precedent.
The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the
dissent of three judges. See 547 F. 3d 1319 (2008). Judge
Wilson filed an opinion concurring in the denial of rehear
ing; Judge Carnes, joined by Judges Tjoflat and Dubina,
filed an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing;
and Judge Tjoflat filed a separate dissent, contending,
among other things, that the District Court, by basing the
enhancement in large part on a comparison of the per
formance of respondents’ attorneys with all of the un
named attorneys whose work he had observed during his
professional career, had improperly rendered a decision
that was effectively unreviewable on appeal and had
essentially served as a witness in support of the enhance
ment. Id., at 1326–1327.
We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).

The general rule in our legal system is that each party
must pay its own attorney’s fees and expenses, see Hensley
v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 429 (1983), but Congress
enacted 42 U. S. C. §1988 in order to ensure that federal
rights are adequately enforced. Section 1988 provides that
a prevailing party in certain civil rights actions may re
cover “a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.”3

shifting statutes. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562 (1992).
