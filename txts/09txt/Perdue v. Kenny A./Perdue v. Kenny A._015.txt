PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of the Court

have noted, the lodestar was adopted in part because it
provides a rough approximation of general billing prac

an alternative to the lodestar method may have to be
found. However, neither respondents nor their amici

that permitting the award of enhancements on top of the
lodestar figure corresponds to prevailing practice in the

a reduced hourly rate in exchange for the opportunity to
earn a performance bonus is in a position far different
from an attorney in a §1988 case who is compensated at
the full prevailing rate and then seeks a performance
enhancement in addition to the lodestar amount after the
litigation has concluded. Reliance on these comparisons
for the purposes of administering enhancements, there

100% increase that respondents sought? And why 75%
rather than 50% or 25% or 10%?
The District Court commented that the enhancement
