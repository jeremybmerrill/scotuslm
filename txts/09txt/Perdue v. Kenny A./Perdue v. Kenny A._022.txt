ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[April 21, 2010]


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
GINSBURG, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, concurring in
part and dissenting in part.
We granted certiorari in this case to consider “whether
the calculation of an attorney’s fee” that is “based on the
‘lodestar,’ ” ante, at 1 (opinion of the Court), can “ever be
enhanced based solely on [the] quality of [the lawyers’]
performance and [the] results obtained,” Pet. for Cert. i
(emphasis added). The Court answers that question in the
affirmative. See ante, at 1 (“We have stated in previous
cases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary
circumstances, and we reaffirm that rule”); see also ante,
p. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). As our prior precedents
make clear, the lodestar calculation “does not end the [fee]
inquiry” because there “remain other considerations that
may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward.”
Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 434 (1983). For that
reason, “[t]he lodestar method was never intended to be
conclusive in all circumstances.” Ante, at 9. Instead, as
the Court today reaffirms, when “superior attorney per
formance,” ibid., leads to “exceptional success an enhanced
award may be justified,” Hensley supra, at 435; see also
Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for
Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565 (1986); Blum v. Stenson, 465
