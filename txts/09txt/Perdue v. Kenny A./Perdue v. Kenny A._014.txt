Opinion of the Court

attorney’s performance includes an extraordinary outlay of
expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted. As
Judge Carnes noted below, when an attorney agrees to
represent a civil rights plaintiff who cannot afford to pay
the attorney, the attorney presumably understands that
no reimbursement is likely to be received until the suc
cessful resolution of the case, 532 F. 3d, at 1227, and
therefore enhancements to compensate for delay in reim
bursement for expenses must be reserved for unusual
cases. In such exceptional cases, however, an enhance
ment may be allowed, but the amount of the enhancement
must be calculated using a method that is reasonable,
objective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as
by applying a standard rate of interest to the qualifying
outlays of expenses.
Third, there may be extraordinary circumstances in
which an attorney’s performance involves exceptional
delay in the payment of fees. An attorney who expects to
be compensated under §1988 presumably understands
that payment of fees will generally not come until the end
of the case, if at all. See 532 F. 3d, at 1227 (opinion of
Carnes, J.). Compensation for this delay is generally
made “either by basing the award on current rates or by
adjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its
present value.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 282
(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we do not
rule out the possibility that an enhancement may be ap
propriate where an attorney assumes these costs in the
face of unanticipated delay, particularly where the delay is
unjustifiably caused by the defense. In such a case, how
ever, the enhancement should be calculated by applying a
method similar to that described above in connection with
exceptional delay in obtaining reimbursement for
expenses.
We reject the suggestion that it is appropriate to grant
performance enhancements on the ground that departures
