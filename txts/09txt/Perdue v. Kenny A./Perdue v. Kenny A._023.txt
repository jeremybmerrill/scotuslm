PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of BREYER, J.

U. S. 886, 896–900 (1984). I agree with that conclusion.
Where the majority and I part ways is with respect to a
question that is not presented, but that the Court
obliquely, and in my view inappropriately, appears to
consider nonetheless—namely, whether the lower courts
correctly determined in this case that exceptional circum
stances justify a lodestar enhancement. See Parts IV–V,
ante; see also ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). I
would not reach that issue, which lies beyond the narrow
question that we agreed to consider. See 556 U. S. __
(2009) (limiting review to the first question presented);
Pet. for Cert. i (stating question); see also Glover v. United
States, 531 U. S. 198, 205 (2001) (“As a general rule . . . we
do not decide issues outside the questions presented . . .”).
Nor do I believe that this Court, which is twice removed
from the litigation underlying the fee determination, is
properly suited to resolve the fact-intensive inquiry that
42 U. S. C. §1988 demands. But even were I to engage in
that inquiry, I would hold that the District Court did not
abuse its discretion in awarding an enhancement. And
I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.
As the Court explains, the basic question that must be
resolved when considering an enhancement to the lodestar
is whether the lodestar calculation “adequately meas
ure[s]” an attorney’s “value,” as “demonstrated” by his
performance “during the litigation.” Ante, at 10. While I
understand the need for answering that question through
the application of standards, I also believe that the answer
inevitably involves an element of judgment. Moreover,
when reviewing a district court’s answer to that question,
an appellate court must inevitably give weight to the fact
that a district court is better situated to provide that
answer. For it is the district judge, and only the district
judge, who will have read all of the motions filed in the
