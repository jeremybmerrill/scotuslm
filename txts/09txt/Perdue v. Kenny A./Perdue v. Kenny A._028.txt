Opinion of BREYER, J.

the plaintiffs’ efforts with a host of complex procedural, as
well as substantive, objections. The State, for example,
argued that the law forbade the plaintiffs to investigate
the shelters; on the eve of a state-court decision that might
have approved the investigations, the State then removed
the case to federal court; the State then sought protective
orders preventing the attorneys from speaking to the
shelters’ staff; and, after losing its motions, the State
delayed to the point where the District Court “was forced
to admonish [the] State Defendants for ‘relying on techni
cal legal objections to discovery requests in order to delay
and hinder the discovery process.’ ” 454 F. Supp. 2d. 1260,
1268 (ND Ga. 2006) (quoting Record, Doc. 145, p. 4). See
also Doc. 1; Doc. 3, pp. 9–10; Docs. 26, 28–29, 44, 60.
In the meantime, the State moved for dismissal, basing
the motion on complex legal doctrines such as Younger
abstention and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which the
District Court found inapplicable. 218 F. R. D. 277, 284–
290 (ND Ga. 2003). See Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37
(1971); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923),
and District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460
U. S. 462 (1983). The State also opposed the petitioners’
request to certify a class of the 3,000 children in foster
care, but the District Court again rejected the State’s
argument. 218 F. R. D., at 299–302. And, after that, the
State filed a lengthy motion for summary judgment, Re
cord, Docs. 243–245, which plaintiffs’ attorneys opposed in
thorough briefing supported by comprehensive exhibits,
see Docs. 254–258, 260. After losing that motion and
eventually agreeing to mediation, the State forced pro
tracted litigation as to who should be the mediator. See
Docs. 363–364, 366, 369–370, 373, 376, 380. All told, in
opposing the plaintiffs’ efforts to have the foster-care
system reformed, the State spent $2.4 million on outside
counsel (who, because they charge the State reduced rates,
worked significantly more hours than that figure alone
