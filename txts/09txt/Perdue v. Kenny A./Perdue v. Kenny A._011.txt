PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of the Court

supra, at 562; Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565; Blum,
supra, at 897; see also Gisbrecht, supra, at 801–802.
Indeed, we have said that the presumption is a “strong”
one. Dague, supra, at 562; Delaware Valley I, supra, at
565.
Third, although we have never sustained an enhance
ment of a lodestar amount for performance, see Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 12, 17, we have repeat
edly said that enhancements may be awarded in “ ‘rare’ ”
and “ ‘exceptional’ ” circumstances. Delaware Valley I,
supra, at 565; Blum, supra, at 897; Hensley, 461 U. S., at
435.
Fourth, we have noted that “the lodestar figure includes
most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a ‘rea
sonable’ attorney’s fee,” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566,
and have held that an enhancement may not be awarded
based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calcula

726–727 (1987) (Delaware Valley II) (plurality opinion);
Blum, 465 U. S., at 898. We have thus held that the nov
elty and complexity of a case generally may not be used as
a ground for an enhancement because these factors “pre
sumably [are] fully reflected in the number of billable
hours recorded by counsel.” Ibid. We have also held that
the quality of an attorney’s performance generally should
not be used to adjust the lodestar “[b]ecause considera
tions concerning the quality of a prevailing party’s coun
sel’s representation normally are reflected in the reason
able hourly rate.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566.
Fifth, the burden of proving that an enhancement is
necessary must be borne by the fee applicant. Dague,
supra, at 561; Blum, 465 U. S., at 901–902.
Finally, a fee applicant seeking an enhancement must
produce “specific evidence” that supports the award. Id.,
at 899, 901 (An enhancement must be based on “evidence
