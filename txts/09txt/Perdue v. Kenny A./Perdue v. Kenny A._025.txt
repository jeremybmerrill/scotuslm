PERDUE v. KENNY A.
Opinion of BREYER, J.

that the District Judge did not abuse his discretion when
awarding an enhanced fee. I reach this conclusion based
on four considerations.
First, the record indicates that the lawyers’ objective in
this case was unusually important and fully consistent
with the central objectives of the basic federal civil-rights
statute, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Moreover, the problem the
attorneys faced demanded an exceptionally high degree of
skill and effort. Specifically, these lawyers and their
clients sought to have the State of Georgia reform its
entire foster-care system—a system that much in the
record describes as well below the level of minimal consti

reports, mostly prepared by Georgia’s own Office of the

•	 The State’s foster-care system was unable to provide
essential medical and mental health services; children
consequently and unnecessarily suffered illness and
life long medical disabilities, such as permanent hear

locked outside of the shelters at night as punishment,
and abused in other ways. See, e.g., Doc. 50, pp. 32–
36, 55; Doc. 3, Exh. 3A, pp. 2–6; Doc. 3, Exh. 2, pp. 4–
5; Doc. 52, Exh. 1, pp. 6, 12–15, 34.
•	 The shelters themselves were “unsanitary and dilapi
dated,” “unclean,” infested with rats, “overcrowded,”
unsafe, and “ ‘out of control.’ ” See, e.g., Doc. 3, Exh.
3A, at 1–2; Doc. 3, Exh. 3B, p. 2; Doc. 50, at 29.
•	 Due to improper supervision and other deficiencies at
the shelters, 20% of the children abused drugs; some
