ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[April 21, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether the calculation
of an attorney’s fee, under federal fee-shifting statutes,
based on the “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours worked
multiplied by the prevailing hourly rates, may be in
creased due to superior performance and results.1 We
have stated in previous cases that such an increase is
permitted in extraordinary circumstances, and we reaf
firm that rule. But as we have also said in prior cases,
there is a strong presumption that the lodestar is suffi
cient; factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot
be used as a ground for increasing an award above the
lodestar; and a party seeking fees has the burden of identi
fying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take
——————
1 JUSTICE BREYER would have us answer this question “Yes” and then
end the opinion. See post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissent
ing in part). Such an opinion would be of little use to the bench or bar
and would pointlessly invite an additional round of litigation. The
issue of the standards to be applied in granting an enhancement is
fairly subsumed within the question that we agreed to decide and has
been extensively discussed in the briefs filed in this case.
