UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
Opinion of the Court

vance, remains relatively silent), continues to favor the
conclusion that the machinegun provision is an element of
an offense.
Legal tradition and past congressional practice are the
second Castillo factor. The factor is to be consulted when,
as here, a statute’s text is unclear as to whether certain
facts constitute elements or sentencing factors. Sentenc
ing factors traditionally involve characteristics of the
offender—such as recidivism, cooperation with law en
forcement, or acceptance of responsibility. Id., at 126.
Characteristics of the offense itself are traditionally
treated as elements, and the use of a machinegun under
§924(c) lies “closest to the heart of the crime at issue.” Id.,
at 127. This is no less true today than it was 10 years ago
in Castillo. Unsurprisingly, firearm type is treated as an
element in a number of statutes, as “numerous gun crimes
make substantive distinctions between weapons such as
pistols and machineguns.” Ibid.; see, e.g., 18 U. S. C.
§§922(a)(4), 922(b)(4), and 922(o)(1).
The Government counters that this tradition or pattern
has evolved since the version of §924(c) under review in
Castillo was enacted. The Government contends that the
Federal Sentencing Guidelines altered the tradition by
treating the possession of a firearm as a sentencing factor.
Brief for United States 23 (citing United States Sentenc
ing Commission, Guidelines Manual §2K2.1(a)(5) (Nov.
1998) (raising base offense level “if the offense involved a
firearm”)).
The argument is not persuasive. The Sentencing Re
form Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, establishing the Federal
Sentencing Guidelines, was enacted four years before the
version of §924 under review in Castillo, see Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988, §6460, 102 Stat. 4373. While the re
sulting Guidelines were not effective until 1987, this was
still before the 1988 enactment of the statute at issue in
Castillo, and 13 years before this Court’s conclusion in
