UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
Opinion of the Court

pal paragraph. Congress additionally provided mandatory
sentences above the 5-year minimum depending on
whether and how the firearm was used.
Sections
924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii) provide sentencing enhancements
for brandishing or discharging the firearm, and the Court
has held that these enhancements are sentencing factors
to be found by a judge. See Harris, 536 U. S., at 552−556;
see also Dean v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(slip op., at 5) (referring to the brandishing and discharge
provisions as “sentencing factors”). The 1998 amendment
was colloquially known as the “Bailey Fix Act.” 144 Cong.
Rec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine); see also
Dean, supra, at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,
at 3).
Aside from shifting the mandatory sentences to manda
tory minimums, and this so-called Bailey fix, Congress left
the substance of the statute unchanged. Neither of these
substantive changes suggests that Congress meant to
transform the machinegun provision from an element into
a sentencing factor.
The Government stresses a third, structural, difference
in the statute, pointing out that the machinegun provision
now resides in a separate subsection, §924(c)(1)(B),
whereas it once resided in the principal paragraph that
unmistakably lists offense elements. This structural or
stylistic change, though, does not provide a “clear indica
tion” that Congress meant to alter its treatment of ma
chineguns as an offense element. See Grogan, 498 U. S.,
at 290. A more logical explanation for the restructuring is
that it broke up a lengthy principal paragraph, which
exceeded 250 words even before adding more to it for the
Bailey fix, into a more readable statute. This is in step
with current legislative drafting guidelines, which advise
drafters to break lengthy statutory provisions into sepa
rate subsections that can be read more easily. See House
Legislative Counsel’s Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No.
