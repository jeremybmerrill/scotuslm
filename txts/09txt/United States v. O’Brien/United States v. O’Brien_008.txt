Opinion of the Court 


II 

Elements of a crime must be charged in an indictment
and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Hamling
v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117 (1974); Jones v. United
States, 526 U. S. 227, 232 (1999). Sentencing factors, on
the other hand, can be proved to a judge at sentencing by
a preponderance of the evidence. See McMillan v. Penn
sylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92 (1986). Though one excep
tion has been established, see Almendarez-Torres v.
United States, 523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998), “ ‘[i]t is unconsti
tutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the
assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of
penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000) (quoting
Jones, supra, at 252−253 (STEVENS, J., concurring)). In
other words, while sentencing factors may guide or confine
a judge’s discretion in sentencing an offender “within the
range prescribed by statute,” Apprendi, supra, at 481,
judge-found sentencing factors cannot increase the maxi
mum sentence a defendant might otherwise receive based
purely on the facts found by the jury.
Subject to this constitutional constraint, whether a
given fact is an element of the crime itself or a sentencing
factor is a question for Congress. When Congress is not
explicit, as is often the case because it seldom directly
addresses the distinction between sentencing factors and
elements, courts look to the provisions and the framework
of the statute to determine whether a fact is an element or
a sentencing factor. Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 228. In
examining whether the machinegun provision in §924 is
an element or a sentencing factor, the analysis must begin
with this Court’s previous examination of the question in
Castillo.
In Castillo, the Court considered a prior version of §924,
which provided:
