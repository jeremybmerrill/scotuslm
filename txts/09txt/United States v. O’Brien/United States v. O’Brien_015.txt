UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
Opinion of the Court

The 1998 amendment has its own legislative record, dis
cussed below, but the parties accurately observe that it is
silent as to congressional consideration of the distinction
between elements and sentencing factors. Brief for United
States 29; Brief for Respondent O’Brien 28−29. This
silence is not neutral, however, because as explained
below, it tends to counsel against finding that Congress
made a substantive change to this statutory provision.
Four of the five factors the Court relied upon in Castillo
point in the same direction they did 10 years ago. How
the 1998 amendment affects the remaining factor—the
provision’s language and structure—requires closer
examination.

In Castillo, the Court interpreted §924(c) in its original
version, though Congress had at that point already
amended the provision. Here, the applicable principle is
that Congress does not enact substantive changes sub
silentio. See Director of Revenue of Mo. v. CoBank ACB,
531 U. S. 316, 323 (2001). In light of Castillo’s determina

of §924 is an element, a change should not be inferred
“[a]bsent a clear indication from Congress of a change in
policy.” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); see
also Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 313, n.
12 (1994) (“[W]hen this Court construes a statute, it is
explaining its understanding of what the statute has
meant continuously since the date when it became law”).
The Government argues that the 1998 amendment
restructuring §924(c) demonstrates the congressional
judgment to reclassify the machinegun provision as a
sentencing factor, rather than as an offense element. But
the better understanding, as the Government acknowl
edged in its submission in Castillo, is that “there is noth
ing to suggest that the 1998 amendments were intended to
