Syllabus
ence is the machinegun provision’s relocation from the principal
paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements to a separate
subsection, §924(c)(1)(B), but this structural or stylistic change pro
vides no “clear indication” that Congress meant to alter its treatment
of machineguns as an offense element. A more logical explanation is
that the restructuring was intended to break up a lengthy principal
paragraph, which exceeded 250 words, into a more readable statute,
which is in step with current legislative drafting guidelines. While
this Court has recognized that placing factors in separate subsections
is one way Congress might signal that it is treating them as sentenc
ing factors rather than elements, Castillo, supra, at 124−125, it has
rejected the view that such a structural consideration predominates
even when other factors point in the other direction, Harris, supra, at
553. The current structure of §924(c) is more favorable to treating
the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor than was true in
Castillo, particularly because the machinegun provision is now posi
tioned between the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii) and
those in (C)(i) and (ii). This structural point is overcome by the sub
stantial weight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that
Congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear in
dication of its purpose to do so. Pp. 12–16.
