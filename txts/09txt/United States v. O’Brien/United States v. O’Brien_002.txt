UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
Syllabus
crime, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, to be charged in
an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Ham
ling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117, rather than proved to a judge
at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence, McMillan v. Penn
sylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92. Subject to this constitutional con
straint, Congress determines whether a factor is an element or a sen
tencing factor. When Congress is not explicit, courts look to a
statute’s provisions and framework for guidance. Analysis of the cur
rent machinegun provision begins with Castillo, where the Court
found the bare language of §924’s prior version “neutral,” 530 U. S.,
at 124, but ruled that four factors—(1) language and structure, (2)
tradition, (3) risk of unfairness, and (4) severity of the sentence—
favored treating the machinegun provision as an element of an of
fense, id., at 124−131; while a fifth factor—legislative history—did
not favor either side, ibid. Pp. 5–6.
(b) As relevant here, the 1998 amendment divided what was once a
lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs. Thus, with
regard to the first Castillo factor, the Court’s observation that “Con
gress placed the element ‘uses or carries a firearm’ and the word ‘ma
chinegun’ in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes or sepa
rated into subsections,” 530 U. S., at 124−125, no longer holds true.
However, the amendment did not affect the second through fifth Cas
tillo factors. Each of them, except for legislative history (which re
mains relatively silent), continues to favor treating the machinegun
provision as an element. The amendment’s effect on the language
and structure factor requires closer examination. Pp. 6–12.
(c) Given the Court’s determination in Castillo that the machine
gun provision in §924’s prior version is an element, a substantive
change in the statute should not be inferred “[a]bsent a clear indica
tion from Congress of a change in policy,” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S.
279, 290. Nothing in the 1998 amendment indicates such a change.
There are three principal differences between the previous and cur
rent §924(c). The first, a substantive change, shifts what were once
mandatory 5-year and 30-year sentences to mandatory minimum
sentences. The second, also substantive—made in direct response to
the holding in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, that “uses or
carries” in §924’s preamendment version connotes “more than mere
possession,” id., at 143—adds “possesses” to the “uses or carries” lan
guage in §924(c)’s principal paragraph and provides sentencing en
hancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm,
§§924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which do state sentencing factors, Harris v.
United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552−556. Neither of these substantive
changes suggests that Congress meant to transform the machinegun
provision from an element into a sentencing factor. The third differ
