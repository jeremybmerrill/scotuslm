UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
Opinion of the Court

It sentenced Burgess to an 84-month term for his §924(c)
conviction, also to run consecutively to his sentence on the
other charges. The Government appealed the District
Court’s ruling that the §924 machinegun provision consti
tutes an element of an offense instead of a sentencing
factor.
The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
affirmed. It looked primarily to Castillo, 530 U. S. 120,
which held that the machinegun provision in an earlier
version of §924(c) constituted an element of an offense, not
a sentencing factor. The court noted that the statute
under consideration in Castillo had been revised by Con
gress, “break[ing] what was a single run-on sentence into
subparagraphs,” and it acknowledged that the earlier
repealed version of the statute was “slightly more favor
able to the [respondents] than the current version[,] but
not markedly so.” 542 F. 3d 921, 925 (2008). It found “no
evidence that the breaking up of the sentence into the
present subdivisions or recasting of language was any
thing more than a current trend—probably for ease of
reading—to convert lengthy sentences in criminal statutes
into subsections in the fashion of the tax code.” Id., at
926. The court concluded: “Absent a clearer or more dra
matic change in language or legislative history expressing
a specific intent to assign judge or jury functions, we think
that Castillo is close to binding,” and any reconsideration
of the issue should be left to this Court. Ibid.; see also
Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,
490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has
direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons
rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Ap
peals should follow the case which directly controls, leav
ing to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own
decisions”).
We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).
