UNITED STATES v. Oâ€™BRIEN
STEVENS, J., concurring

III
In my view, the simplest, and most correct, solution to
the case before us would be to recognize that any fact
mandating the imposition of a sentence more severe than
a judge would otherwise have discretion to impose should
be treated as an element of the offense. The unanimity of
our decision today does not imply that McMillan is safe
from a direct challenge to its foundation.
