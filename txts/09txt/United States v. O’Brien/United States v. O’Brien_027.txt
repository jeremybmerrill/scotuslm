UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

Nor does it make a difference whether the sentencing fact
“involve[s]
characteristics
of
the
offender”
or
“[c]haracteristics of the offense,” ante, at 8, or which direc
tion the other factors in the Court’s five-factor test may
tilt. One question decides the matter: If a sentencing fact
either “raises the floor or raises the ceiling” of the range of
punishments to which a defendant is exposed, it is, “ ‘by
definition [an] “elemen[t].” ’ ” Harris, supra, at 579
(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 483,
n. 10).
Without a finding that a defendant used a machinegun,
the penalty range for a conviction under §924(c)(1)(A)(i) is
five years to life imprisonment. But once that finding is
added, the penalty range becomes harsher—30 years to
life imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii)—thus “expos[ing] a
defendant to greater punishment than what is otherwise
legally prescribed,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 579 (THOMAS, J.,
dissenting). As a consequence, “it is ultimately beside the
point whether as a matter of statutory interpretation [the
machinegun enhancement] is a sentencing factor.” Id., at
576. “[A]s a constitutional matter,” because it establishes
a harsher range of punishments, it must be treated as an
element of a separate, aggravated offense that is submit
ted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid.
Because the Court reaches this same conclusion based
on its analysis of a five-factor test, see ante, at 6–16, I
concur in the judgment.
