UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
Opinion of the Court

current structure of §924(c) is more favorable to that
interpretation than was true in Castillo, particularly
because the machinegun provision is now positioned be
tween the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii),
see Harris, supra, at 552−556, and the recidivist provi
sions in (C)(i) and (ii), which are typically sentencing
factors as well. See Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 230.
These points are overcome, however, by the substantial
weight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that
Congress would not enact so significant a change without
a clear indication of its purpose to do so. The evident
congressional purpose was to amend the statute to coun
teract Bailey and to make the statute more readable but
not otherwise to alter the substance of the statute. The
analysis and holding of Castillo control this case. The
machinegun provision in §924(c)(1)(B)(ii) is an element of
an offense.
