UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
Opinion of the Court

“(c)(1) Whoever, during and in relation to any crime
of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . , uses or car
ries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment
provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking
crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,
and if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle [or a] short
barreled shotgun to imprisonment for ten years, and if
the firearm is a machinegun, or a destructive device,
or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muf
fler, to imprisonment for thirty years. . . .” 18 U. S. C.
§924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V).
In determining whether the machinegun provision in the
just-quoted version of §924 constituted an element or a
sentencing factor, the Court in Castillo observed that the
bare statutory language was “neutral.” 530 U. S., at 124.
It examined five factors directed at determining congres
sional intent: (1) language and structure, (2) tradition, (3)
risk of unfairness, (4) severity of the sentence, and (5)
legislative history. Id., at 124−131. The Court unani
mously concluded that the machinegun provision provided
an element of an offense, noting that the first four factors
favored treating it as such while legislative history did not
significantly favor either side. Ibid.

Section 924(c) was amended to its current form in 1998.
The amendment had been enacted when the Court consid
ered Castillo, supra, at 125, but the pre-1998 version of
the statute was at issue there. The instant case concerns
the post-1998 (and current) version of the statute, which
provides:
“(A) Except to the extent that a greater minimum
sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or
by any other provision of law, any person who, during
