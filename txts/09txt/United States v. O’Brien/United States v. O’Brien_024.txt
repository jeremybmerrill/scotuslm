STEVENS, J., concurring

federal determinate sentencing schemes in Blakely v.
Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), and United States v.
Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005). But thanks to an unpersua
sive attempt to distinguish Apprendi,5 and a reluctant
Apprendi dissenter, McMillan survived over the protest of
four Members of the Court. See Harris, 536 U. S., at 569–
570 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) (“I cannot easily distinguish Apprendi . . . from
this case in terms of logic. For that reason, I cannot agree
with the plurality’s opinion insofar as it finds such a dis
tinction. At the same time . . . I cannot yet accept [Ap
prendi’s] rule”). It appears, however, that the reluctant
Apprendi dissenter may no longer be reluctant.6
I am therefore in full agreement with JUSTICE THOMAS’
separate writing today, post, at 1–2, as I was with his
Harris dissent. McMillan and Harris should be overruled,
at least to the extent that they authorize judicial factfind
ing on a preponderance of the evidence standard of facts
that “expos[e] a defendant to [a] greater punishment than
what is otherwise legally prescribed . . .” Harris, 536
U. S., at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Any such fact is the
functional equivalent of an element of the offense.

5 Consistent with the attempt in Harris v. United States, 536 U. S.
545 (2002), to distinguish Apprendi, JUSTICE KENNEDY’s fine opinion for
the Court today employs some of the same acrobatics to distinguish
Harris from the present case. Harris also involved §924(c)(1), though a
different subsection; its reading of the mandatory minimum for “bran
dishing” a firearm contained in 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A) as a sentencing
factor is not so easily distinguished from the nearly identical manda
tory minimum for possessing a “machinegun” under §924(c)(1)(B).
6 “But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover mandatory
minimums, but I don’t accept Apprendi. Well, at some point I guess I
have to accept Apprendi, because it’s the law and has been for some
time. So if . . . if that should become an issue about whether mandatory
minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi purposes,
should we reset the case for argument?” Tr. of Oral Arg. 20 (question
by BREYER, J.).
