Opinion of the Court

Castillo that firearm type is traditionally treated as an
offense element. The Government cannot claim the bene
fit of any shift in how the law traditionally treats firearm
type from the Guidelines, for that supposed shift would

The third Castillo factor, potential unfairness, was

that he actively used the pistol.” Ibid. This same concern
arises under the current version of §924, where jurors
might have to determine which among several weapons a
defendant used, carried, or possessed in furtherance of a
crime.

Castillo, which was not alleviated by the restructuring of
§924. And the Government does not suggest that it would
be subjected to any unfairness if the machinegun provision
continues to be treated as an element.
