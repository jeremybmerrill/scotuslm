Opinion of the Court

104.1, §312, pp. 23−25 (1995); Senate Office of the Legisla
tive Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual §112, pp. 10−11
(1997).
While the Court has indicated that placing factors in
separate subsections is one way Congress might signal
that it is treating them as sentencing factors as opposed to
elements, Castillo, 530 U. S., at 124−125, Harris, 536
U. S., at 552−553, it has rejected the view that this struc
tural consideration predominates even when other factors
point in the other direction, id., at 553 (“[E]ven if a statute
‘has a look to it suggesting that the numbered subsections
are only sentencing provisions,’ ” the Court will not ignore
“compelling evidence to the contrary” (quoting Jones, 526
U. S., at 232)). For instance, in Jones the Court found that
the federal carjacking statute set forth elements of multi
ple offenses despite a structure similar to the statute at
issue here. Id., at 232−239. And in Harris, the Court was
careful to point out that, unlike the case at bar, the other
Castillo factors “reinforce[d] the single-offense interpreta
tion implied by the statute’s structure.” 536 U. S., at 553.
In examining the amended version of §924(c)’s struc
ture, there is an additional consideration that supports
interpreting the machinegun provision to be an offense
element. As explained above, the brandishing and dis
charge provisions codified in §924(A)(ii) and (iii) do state
sentencing factors. See Harris, supra, at 552−556; Dean,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). Had Congress intended to
treat firearm type as a sentencing factor, it likely would
have listed firearm types as clauses (iv) and (v) of sub
paragraph (A), instead of as clauses (i) and (ii) of subpara
graph (B). By listing firearm type in stand-alone subpara
graph (B), Congress set it apart from the sentencing
factors in (A)(ii) and (iii); this is consistent with preserving
firearm type as an element of a separate offense.
To be sure, there are some arguments in favor of treat
ing the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor. The
