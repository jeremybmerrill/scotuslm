UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN
STEVENS, J., concurring

criminal offense itself. In these circumstances, I continue
to believe the Constitution requires proof beyond a rea
sonable doubt of this “factor.”
I
We first encountered the use of a “sentencing factor” in
the mandatory minimum context in McMillan v. Pennsyl
vania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), when we examined the consti
tutionality of Pennsylvania’s 1982 Mandatory Minimum
Sentencing Act (Act).2 The Pennsylvania statute subjected
anyone convicted of a specified felony to a mandatory
minimum 5-year sentence if the trial judge found, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant “visibly
possessed a firearm” during the commission of the offense.
See id., at 81–82. In four prosecutions under the Act, the
trial judges had each held that the statute was unconstitu
tional and imposed sentences lower than the 5-year man
datory minimum, presumably because they recognized
that the statute treated the visible possession of a firearm
as the functional equivalent of an offense element. Id., at
82. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court consoli
dated the four cases and reversed.3 Id., at 83. It reasoned
that because visible possession of a firearm was a mere
“sentencing factor,” rather than an element of any of the
specified offenses defined by the legislature, the protec
tions afforded by cases like In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358
(1970),4 did not apply.
A bare majority of the McMillan Court endorsed this

2 See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 485 (2000) (“It was in
McMillan . . . that this Court, for the first time, coined the term ‘sen
tencing factor’ to refer to a fact that was not found by a jury but that
could affect the sentence imposed by the judge”).
3 Commonwealth v. Wright, 508 Pa. 25, 494 A. 2d 354 (1985).
4 In Winship, the Court “explicitly” held that “the Due Process Clause
protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with
which he is charged.” 397 U. S., at 364.
