novel use of the sentencing factor concept. Five Justices
concluded that the prerequisite for a mandatory sentence
is just a “sentencing factor,” rather than an “element of
the offense,” because the factor does not “alte[r] the maxi
mum penalty for the crime” and merely “limit[s] the sen

in McMillan, I continue to believe that McMillan was
incorrectly decided. See id., at 93–94 (Marshall, J., dis

Amendment] for a legislature to remove from the jury the
assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of
penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”
