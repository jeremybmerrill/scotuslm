WONG v. BELMONTES
STEVENS, J., concurring

U. S., at 29–31 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). A review of the
entire record, especially the colloquy between six jurors
and the trial judge, makes it clear to me that “the jury
believed that the law forbade it from giving that evidence
any weight at all.” Id., at 36–39. I therefore remain con
vinced that in its initial review of this case, the Court of
Appeals correctly set aside Belmontes’ death sentence.
The narrow question that is now before us is whether
the additional mitigating evidence that trial counsel failed
to uncover would have persuaded the jury to return a
different verdict. The evidence trial counsel might have
presented hardly matters, however, because in my view
the conscientious jurors’ mistaken understanding of the
law would have prevented them from giving that addi
tional evidence “any weight at all,” id., at 39, let alone
controlling weight. Despite my strong disagreement with
the Court’s decision to review this case once again, I nev
ertheless agree with the Court’s conclusion that trial
counsel’s failure to present additional mitigating evidence
probably did not affect the outcome of the trial.
