SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
ROBERT WONG, WARDEN v. FERNANDO 

BELMONTES, JR. 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 08–1263. Decided November 16, 2009


PER CURIAM.
In 1981, in the course of a burglary, Fernando Belmon
tes bludgeoned Steacy McConnell to death, striking her in
the head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar. See
People v. Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 759–761, 755 P. 2d
310, 315–316 (1988). After the murder, Belmontes and his
accomplices stole McConnell’s stereo, sold it for $100, and
used the money to buy beer and drugs for the night. Id.,
at 764–765, 755 P. 2d, at 318–319.
Belmontes was convicted of murder and sentenced to
death in state court. Unsuccessful on direct appeal and
state collateral review, Belmontes sought federal habeas
relief, which the District Court denied. The Court of Ap
peals reversed, finding instructional error, but we over
turned that decision. Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7
(2006); see also Brown v. Belmontes, 544 U. S. 945 (2005).
On remand, the Court of Appeals again ruled for Bel
montes, this time finding that Belmontes suffered ineffec
tive assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of
his trial. The District Court had previously denied relief
on that ground, finding that counsel for Belmontes had
performed deficiently under Ninth Circuit precedent, but
that Belmontes could not establish prejudice under Strick
land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Belmontes v.

of Appeals agreed that counsel’s performance was defi
