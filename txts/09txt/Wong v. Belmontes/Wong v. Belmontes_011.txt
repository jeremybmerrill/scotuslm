Per Curiam

evidence that Belmontes was responsible for not one but
two murders.
Belmontes counters that some of the potential mitigat
ing evidence might not have opened the door to the prior
murder evidence. The Court of Appeals went so far as to
state, without citation, that “[t]here would be no basis for
suggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different
if the expert were informed that Belmontes committed two
murders rather than one.” Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 869,
n. 20. But it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testi
mony “explain[ing] . . . involvement in criminal activity,”
id., at 853, to know what criminal activity was at issue.
And even if the number of murders were as irrelevant as
the Ninth Circuit asserted, the fact that these two murders
were so different in character made each of them highly
pertinent in evaluating expert testimony of the sort envi
sioned by the Court of Appeals.
The Ninth Circuit noted that the trial court retained
discretion to exclude the Howard evidence even if Schick
opened the door. Id., at 869–870, n. 20. If Schick had
doubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have
secured an answer in advance through a motion in limine.
Ibid. The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he
stood. While ruling that the prosecution could not present
the evidence in its case in chief, Record 2254, the judge
made clear that it would come in for certain rebuttal
purposes, id., at 2256, 2332–2334. When Schick elicited
testimony that Belmontes was not violent, for example,
the judge ordered it stricken and warned Schick that he
would admit the Howard murder evidence—to let the
prosecution “go into the whole background”—if Schick
pressed forward. Id., at 2334.
In balancing the mitigating factors against the aggrava
tors, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the ag
gravating evidence the State presented as “scant.” Bel
