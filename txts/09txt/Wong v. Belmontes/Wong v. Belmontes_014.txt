WONG v. BELMONTES
Per Curiam

Schick had put on more than the nine witnesses he did, or
called expert witnesses to bolster his case, is fanciful.
The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to
proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
