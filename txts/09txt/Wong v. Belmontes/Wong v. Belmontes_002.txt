confidence in the penalty phase verdict. Belmontes v.

Belmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally
ineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient
mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.
To prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the
deficient performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland,
466 U. S., at 687. To show deficient performance, Belmon

Id., at 689.
The challenge confronting Belmontes’ lawyer, John
Schick, was very specific. Substantial evidence indicated
that Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and the
prosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during
the penalty phase of the McConnell trial. The evidence of
the prior murder was extensive, including eyewitness
testimony, Belmontes’ own admissions, and Belmontes’
possession of the murder weapon and the same type of
ammunition used to kill the victim. Record 2239–2250,

The evidence, furthermore, was potentially devastating.
