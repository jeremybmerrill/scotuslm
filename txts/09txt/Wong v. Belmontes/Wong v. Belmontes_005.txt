Per Curiam

The Court’s warning reinforced Schick’s understanding
that he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully
to preserve his success in excluding the Howard murder
evidence. With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put
on nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for
mitigation, without opening the door to the prior murder
evidence. See id., at 2312–2417.
The Court of Appeals determined that in spite of these
efforts, Schick’s performance was constitutionally deficient
under Circuit precedent. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 862–
863. The State challenges that conclusion, but we need
not resolve the point, because we agree with the District
Court that Belmontes cannot establish prejudice.

To establish prejudice, Belmontes must show “a reason
able probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional
errors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif
ferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. That showing
requires Belmontes to establish “a reasonable probability
that a competent attorney, aware of [the available mitigat
ing evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing,”
and “that had the jury been confronted with this . . . miti
gating evidence, there is a reasonable probability that it
would have returned with a different sentence.” Wiggins
v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535, 536 (2003).
The Ninth Circuit determined that a reasonably compe
tent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evi
dence, on top of what Schick had already presented. For
purposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that conclu
sion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable
probability that a jury presented with this additional miti
gation evidence would have returned a different verdict.
In evaluating that question, it is necessary to consider
all the relevant evidence that the jury would have had
before it if Schick had pursued the different path—not just
