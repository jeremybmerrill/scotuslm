STEVENS, J., concurring

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
ROBERT WONG, WARDEN v. FERNANDO 

BELMONTES, JR. 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 08–1263. Decided November 16, 2009


JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.
When Fernando Belmontes was sentenced to death in
1982, California Penal Code §190.3(k)* conveyed the
unmistakable message that juries could not give any
mitigating weight to evidence that did not extenuate the
severity of the crime. See Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7,
27 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The trial judge who
presided at Belmontes’ sentencing hearing so understood
the law, and his instructions to the jury reflected that
understanding. See id., at 33–34. It was only later that
both the California Supreme Court and this Court
squarely held that a jury must be allowed to give weight to
any aspect of a defendant’s character or history that may
provide a basis for a sentence other than death, even if
such evidence does not “ ‘tend to reduce the defendant’s
culpability for his crime.’ ” Id., at 28 (quoting Skipper v.
South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 11 (1986) (Powell, J., concur
ring in judgment)).
The testimony adduced at Belmontes’ sentencing hear
ing described his religious conversion and his positive
contributions to a youth rehabilitation program. Neither
his own testimony, nor that of the two ministers and the
other witnesses who testified on his behalf, made any
attempt to extenuate the severity of his crime. Their
testimony did, however, afford the jury a principled basis
for imposing a sentence other than death. See Ayers, 549
