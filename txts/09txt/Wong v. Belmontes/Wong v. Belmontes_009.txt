also, e.g., Belmontes’ Traverse to Respondent’s Return to
Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5–89–0736–EJG–
JFM (ED Cal.), p. 64 (“[C]ounsel’s presentation was ar
guably adequate only with respect to [evidence] of ‘human
izing’ petitioner”). The sentencing jury was thus “well
acquainted” with Belmontes’ background and potential
humanizing features. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465,
481 (2007). Additional evidence on these points would
have offered an insignificant benefit, if any at all.
The Ninth Circuit also determined that both the evi
dence Schick presented and the additional evidence it
proposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had
submitted expert testimony. Such testimony could “make
connections between the various themes in the mitigation
case and explain to the jury how they could have contrib
uted to Belmontes’s involvement in criminal activity.”
Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 853. See also ibid. (discussing
expert’s federal habeas testimony on importance of expert
testimony). But the body of mitigating evidence the Ninth
Circuit would have required Schick to present was neither
complex nor technical. It required only that the jury make
logical connections of the kind a layperson is well
equipped to make. The jury simply did not need expert
testimony to understand the “humanizing” evidence; it
could use its common sense or own sense of mercy.
What is more, expert testimony discussing Belmontes’
mental state, seeking to explain his behavior, or putting it
in some favorable context would have exposed Belmontes
to the Howard evidence. See Darden v. Wainwright, 477
