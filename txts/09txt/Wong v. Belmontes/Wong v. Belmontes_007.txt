Per Curiam

Schick also called witnesses who detailed Belmontes’
religious conversion while in state custody on the acces
sory charge. These witnesses told stories about Belmon
tes’ efforts advising other inmates in his detention center’s
religious program, to illustrate that he could live a produc
tive and meaningful life in prison. They described his
success working as part of a firefighting crew, detailing his
rise from lowest man on the team to second in command.
Belmontes’ assistant chaplain even said that he would use
Belmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling pro
gram if the jury handed down a life sentence. Id., at
2379–2384, 2396–2398, 2400–2407.
Belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying
about his childhood and religious conversion, both at
sentencing and during allocution. Belmontes described
his childhood as “pretty hard,” but took responsibility for
his actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his
background “as a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now
. . . because of that.” Id., at 2343.
On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals—
addressing Belmontes’ ineffective assistance claim for the
first time—changed its view of this evidence. Instead of
finding Schick’s mitigation case “substantial,” as it previ
ously had, Belmontes, 350 F. 3d, at 907, the Ninth Circuit
this time around labeled it “cursory,” Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,
at 841, 861, n. 14, 866. Compare also Belmontes, 350
F. 3d, at 874, 901, 907 (labeling the mitigation evidence
Schick presented “substantial”), with Belmontes, 529
F. 3d, at 847, n. 3, 874 (labeling the same evidence “insub
stantial”). More evidence, the Court of Appeals now con
cluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more
evidence to “humanize” Belmontes, as that court put it no
fewer than 11 times in its opinion. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,
at 850, 859, 860, 862, 863, 864, 865, and n. 18, 869, 872,
874. The Court determined that the failure to put on this
evidence prejudiced Belmontes.
