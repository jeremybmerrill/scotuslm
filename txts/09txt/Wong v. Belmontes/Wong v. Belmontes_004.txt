WONG v. BELMONTES
Per Curiam

Record 2256; see also People v. Rodriguez, 42 Cal. 3d 730,
791–792, 726 P. 2d 113, 153 (1986); People v. Harris, 28
Cal. 3d 935, 960–962, 623 P. 2d 240, 254 (1981). Schick
thus had “grave concerns” that, even if he succeeded ini
tially in excluding the prior murder evidence, it would still
be admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly.
Accordingly, Schick decided to proceed cautiously, struc
turing his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit
that possibility. Deposition of John Schick 301, 309–310;
see Strickland, supra, at 699 (“Restricting testimony on
respondent’s character to what had come in at the plea
colloquy ensured that contrary character and psychologi
cal evidence and respondent’s criminal history, which
counsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come
in”).
As Schick expected, the prosecution was ready to admit
this evidence during the sentencing phase. Schick moved
to exclude the evidence, arguing that the State should be
allowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been
convicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary
manslaughter—nothing more. Record 2240–2254. Schick
succeeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the
damaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief, but his
client remained at risk: The trial court indicated the evi
dence would come in for rebuttal or impeachment if Schick
opened the door. Id., at 2256.
This was not an empty threat. In one instance, Schick
elicited testimony that Belmontes was not a violent per
son. The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury,
argued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with
the Howard murder evidence. Id., at 2332–2334. The
Court warned Schick that it was “going to have to allow
[the prosecution] to go into the whole background” if
Schick continued his line of questioning. Id., at 2334.
Schick acquiesced, and the court struck the testimony.
