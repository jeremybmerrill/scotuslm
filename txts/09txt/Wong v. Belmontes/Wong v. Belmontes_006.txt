WONG v. BELMONTES
Per Curiam

the mitigation evidence Schick could have presented, but
also the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly
would have come in with it. See Strickland, supra, at
695–696, 700. Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes
must show a reasonable probability that the jury would
have rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire
body of mitigating evidence (including the additional
testimony Schick could have presented) against the entire
body of aggravating evidence (including the Howard mur
der evidence). Belmontes cannot meet this burden.
We begin with the mitigating evidence Schick did pre
sent during the sentencing phase. That evidence was
substantial. The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing the
same record in Belmontes’ first habeas appeal agreed,
recognizing “the substantial nature of the mitigating
evidence” Schick presented. Belmontes v. Woodford, 350
F. 3d 861, 907 (2003). It reiterated the point several
times. See id., at 874, 901, 908.
All told, Schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a
span of two days, and elicited a range of testimony on
Belmontes’ behalf. A number of those witnesses high
lighted Belmontes’ “terrible” childhood. They testified
that his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.
Belmontes’ grandfather described the one-bedroom house
where Belmontes spent much of his childhood as a
“chicken coop.” Belmontes did not do well in school; he
dropped out in the ninth grade. His younger sister died
when she was only 10 months old. And his grandmother
died tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool.
See Record 2314–2319, 2324–2325, 2344.
Family members also testified that, despite these diffi
culties, Belmontes maintained strong relationships with
his grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister. Id., at
2317–2318, 2325–2326. And Belmontes’ best friend of
fered the insights of a close friend and confidant. Id., at
2329–2332.
