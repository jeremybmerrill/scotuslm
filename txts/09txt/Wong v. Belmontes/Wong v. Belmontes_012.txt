WONG v. BELMONTES
Per Curiam

characterization misses Strickland’s point that the review
ing court must consider all the evidence—the good and the
bad—when evaluating prejudice. See Strickland, 466
U. S., at 695–696, 700. Here, the worst kind of bad evi
dence would have come in with the good. The only reason
it did not was because Schick was careful in his mitigation
case. The State’s aggravation evidence could only be
characterized as “scant” if one ignores the “elephant in the
courtroom”—Belmontes’ role in the Howard murder—that
would have been presented had Schick submitted the
additional mitigation evidence. Belmontes v. Ayers, 551
F. 3d 864, 867 (CA9 2008) (Callahan, J., dissenting from
denial of rehearing en banc).
Even on the record before it—which did not include the
Howard murder—the state court determined that Belmon
tes “was convicted on extremely strong evidence that he
committed an intentional murder of extraordinary brutal
ity.” Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 819, 755 P. 2d, at 354.
That court also noted that “[t]he properly admitted aggra
vating evidence in this case—in particular, the circum
stances of the crime—was simply overwhelming.” Id., at
809, 755 P. 2d, at 348 (citation omitted). The Ninth Cir
cuit saw the murder differently. It viewed the circum
stances of the crime as only “conceivably significant” as an
aggravating factor. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 871. In
particular, the Court of Appeals concluded that “[t]he
crime here did not involve . . . needless suffering on the
part of the victim.” Ibid.
We agree with the state court’s characterization of the
murder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by
the Court of Appeals that this case did not involve “need
less suffering.” The jury saw autopsy photographs show
ing Steacy McConnell’s mangled head, her skull crushed
by 15 to 20 blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found
to have been wielded by Belmontes. McConnell’s corpse
showed numerous “defensive bruises and contusions on
