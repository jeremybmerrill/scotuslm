Opinion of the Court

Lorance, supra, at 904, 908–909. Our opinions, it is true,
described the harms of which the unsuccessful plaintiffs in
those cases complained as “present effect[s]” of past dis
crimination. Ledbetter, supra, at 628; see also Lorance,
supra, at 907; Chardon, supra, at 8; Ricks, supra, at 258;
Evans, supra, at 558. But the reason they could not be the
present effects of present discrimination was that the
charged discrimination required proof of discriminatory
intent, which had not even been alleged. That reasoning
has no application when, as here, the charge is disparate
impact, which does not require discriminatory intent.
The Seventh Circuit resisted this conclusion, reasoning
that the difference between disparate-treatment and
disparate-impact claims is only superficial. Both take aim
at the same evil—discrimination on a prohibited basis—
but simply seek to establish it by different means. 528
F. 3d, at 491–492. Disparate-impact liability, the Court of
Appeals explained, “ ‘is primarily intended to lighten the
plaintiff’s heavy burden of proving intentional discrimina
tion after employers learned to cover their tracks.’ ” Id., at
492 (quoting Finnegan v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 967
F. 2d 1161, 1164 (CA7 1992)). But even if the two theories
were directed at the same evil, it would not follow that
their reach is therefore coextensive. If the effect of apply
ing Title VII’s text is that some claims that would be
doomed under one theory will survive under the other,
that is the product of the law Congress has written. It is
not for us to rewrite the statute so that it covers only what
we think is necessary to achieve what we think Congress
really intended. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Ser
vices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80 (1998).
The City also argues that, even if petitioners could have
proved a present disparate-impact violation, they never
did so under the proper test. The parties litigated the
merits—and the City stipulated that the cutoff score
caused disparate impact—after the District Court adopted
