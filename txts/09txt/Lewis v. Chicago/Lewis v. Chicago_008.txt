Opinion of the Court

then, is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct is
timely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the
basis for a disparate-impact claim at all.
We conclude that it can. As originally enacted, Title VII
did not expressly prohibit employment practices that
cause a disparate impact. That enactment made it an
“unlawful employment practice” for an employer “to fail or
refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise
to discriminate against any individual with respect to his
compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ
ment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,
or national origin,” §2000e–2(a)(1), or “to limit, segregate,
or classify his employees or applicants for employment in
any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any indi
vidual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely
affect his status as an employee, because of” any of the
same reasons, §2000e–2(a)(2). In Griggs v. Duke Power
Co., 401 U. S. 424, 431 (1971), we interpreted the latter
provision to “proscrib[e] not only overt discrimination but
also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in
operation.”
Two decades later, Congress codified the requirements
of the “disparate impact” claims Griggs had recognized.
Pub. L. 102–166, §105, 105 Stat. 1074, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–
2(k). That provision states:
“(1)(A) An unlawful employment practice based on dis
parate impact is established under this subchapter
only if—
“(i) a complaining party demonstrates that a re
spondent uses a particular employment practice
that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin and the re
spondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged
practice is job related for the position in question
——————
is correct.
