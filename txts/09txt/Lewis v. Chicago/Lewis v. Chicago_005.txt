LEWIS v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

scored 89 or above (out of 100), whom the City called “well
qualified.” Those drawn from this group would proceed to
the next phase—a physical-abilities test, background
check, medical examination, and drug test—and if they
cleared those hurdles would be hired as candidate fire
fighters. Those who scored below 65, on the other hand,
learned by letters sent the same day that they had failed
the test. Each was told he had not achieved a passing
score, would no longer be considered for a firefighter
position, and would not be contacted again about the
examination.
The applicants in-between—those who scored between
65 and 88, whom the City called “qualified”1—were noti
fied that they had passed the examination but that, based
on the City’s projected hiring needs and the number of
“well-qualified” applicants, it was not likely they would be
called for further processing. The individual notices
added, however, that because it was not possible to predict
how many applicants would be hired in the next few years,
each “qualified” applicant’s name would be kept on the
eligibility list maintained by the Department of Personnel
for as long as that list was used. Eleven days later, the
City officially adopted an “Eligible List” reflecting the
breakdown described above.
On May 16, 1996, the City selected its first class of
applicants to advance to the next stage. It selected a
second on October 1, 1996, and repeated the process nine
more times over the next six years. As it had announced,
in each round the City drew randomly from among those
who scored in the “well-qualified” range on the 1995 test.
In the last round it exhausted that pool, so it filled the

paramedics who scored between 65 and 88 were deemed
“well qualified” pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement, and
certain veterans in the “qualified” range had 5 points added to their
scores and therefore became “well qualified.”
