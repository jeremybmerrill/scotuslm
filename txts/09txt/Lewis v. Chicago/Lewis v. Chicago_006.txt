Opinion of the Court

remaining slots with “qualified” candidates instead.
On March 31, 1997, Crawford M. Smith, an AfricanAmerican applicant who scored in the “qualified” range
and had not been hired as a candidate firefighter, filed a
charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Five others
followed suit, and on July 28, 1998, the EEOC issued all
six of them right-to-sue letters. Two months later, they
filed this civil action against the City, alleging (as relevant
here) that its practice of selecting for advancement only
applicants who scored 89 or above caused a disparate
impact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII. The
District Court certified a class—petitioners here—
consisting of the more than 6,000 African-Americans who
scored in the “qualified” range on the 1995 examination
but had not been hired.2
The City sought summary judgment on the ground that
petitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300
days after their claims accrued. See §2000e–5(e)(1). The
District Court denied the motion, concluding that the
City’s “ongoing reliance” on the 1995 test results consti
tuted a “continuing violation” of Title VII. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 45a. The City stipulated that the 89-point cutoff had
a “severe disparate impact against African Americans,”

but argued that its cutoff score was justified by business
necessity. After an 8-day bench trial, the District Court
ruled for petitioners, rejecting the City’s business
necessity defense. It ordered the City to hire 132 ran
domly selected members of the class (reflecting the num
ber of African-Americans the Court found would have been
hired but for the City’s practices) and awarded backpay to
be divided among the remaining class members.
