Opinion of the Court

disparate impact.
In all events, it is not our task to assess the conse
quences of each approach and adopt the one that produces
the least mischief. Our charge is to give effect to the law
Congress enacted. By enacting §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), Con
gress allowed claims to be brought against an employer
who uses a practice that causes disparate impact, what
ever the employer’s motives and whether or not he has
employed the same practice in the past. If that effect was
unintended, it is a problem for Congress, not one that
federal courts can fix.
III
The City asserts that one aspect of the District Court’s
judgment still must be changed. The first round of hiring
firefighters occurred outside the charging period even for
the earliest EEOC charge. Yet the District Court, apply
ing the continuing-violation theory, awarded relief based
on those acts. Petitioners do not disagree, and they do not
oppose the City’s request for a remand to resolve this
issue. We therefore leave it to the Seventh Circuit to
determine, to the extent that point was properly pre
served, whether the judgment must be modified in light of
our decision.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
