LEWIS v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

and consistent with business necessity . . . .”
Thus, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie disparate
impact claim by showing that the employer “uses a par
ticular employment practice that causes a disparate im
pact” on one of the prohibited bases. Ibid. (emphasis
added). See Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(slip op., at 18).
Petitioners’ claim satisfies that requirement. Title VII
does not define “employment practice,” but we think it
clear that the term encompasses the conduct of which
petitioners complain: the exclusion of passing applicants
who scored below 89 (until the supply of scores 89 or above
was exhausted) when selecting those who would advance.
The City “use[d]” that practice in each round of selection.
Although the City had adopted the eligibility list (embody
ing the score cutoffs) earlier and announced its intention
to draw from that list, it made use of the practice of ex
cluding those who scored 88 or below each time it filled a
new class of firefighters. Petitioners alleged that this
exclusion caused a disparate impact. Whether they ade

their allegations, based on the City’s actual implementa
tion of its policy, stated a cognizable claim.
The City argues that subsection (k) is inapposite be
cause it does not address “accrual” of disparate-impact
claims. Section 2000e–5(e)(1), it says, specifies when the
time to file a charge starts running. That is true but
irrelevant. Aside from the first round of selection in May
1996 (which all agree is beyond the 300-day charging
period), the acts petitioners challenge—the City’s use of its
cutoff score in selecting candidates—occurred within the
charging period. Accordingly, no one disputes that if
petitioners could bring new claims based on those acts,
their claims were timely. The issue, in other words, is not
when petitioners’ claims accrued, but whether they could
