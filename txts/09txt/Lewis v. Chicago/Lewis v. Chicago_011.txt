LEWIS v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

See 528 F. 3d, at 490–491.
The City’s premise is sound, but its conclusion does not
follow. It may be true that the City’s January 1996 deci
sion to adopt the cutoff score (and to create a list of the
applicants above it) gave rise to a freestanding disparate
impact claim. Cf. Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U. S. 440, 445–
451 (1982). If that is so, the City is correct that since no
timely charge was filed attacking it, the City is now “enti
tled to treat that past act as lawful.” United Air Lines,
Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558 (1977). But it does not
follow that no new violation occurred—and no new claims
could arise—when the City implemented that decision
down the road. If petitioners could prove that the City
“use[d]” the “practice” that “causes a disparate impact,”
they could prevail.
The City, like the Seventh Circuit, see 528 F. 3d, at
490–491, insists that Evans and a line of cases following it
require a different result. See also Ledbetter v. Goodyear
Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618 (2007); Lorance v. AT&T
Technologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989); Ricks, 449 U. S.
250. Those cases, we are told, stand for the proposition
that present effects of prior actions cannot lead to Title VII
liability.
We disagree. As relevant here, those cases establish
only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a “present viola
tion” within the limitations period. Evans, supra, at 558
(emphasis deleted). What that requires depends on the
claim asserted.
For disparate-treatment claims—and
others for which discriminatory intent is required—that
means the plaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimi
nation within the limitations period. See Ledbetter, supra,
at 624–629; Lorance, supra, at 904–905; Ricks, supra, at
256–258; Evans, supra, at 557–560; see also Chardon v.
Fernandez, 454 U. S. 6, 8 (1981) (per curiam). But for
claims that do not require discriminatory intent, no such
demonstration is needed. Cf. Ledbetter, supra, at 640;
