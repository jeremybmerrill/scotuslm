LEWIS v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

held that petitioners’ suit was untimely because the earli
est EEOC charge was filed more than 300 days after the
only discriminatory act: sorting the scores into the “well
qualified,” “qualified,” and “not-qualified” categories. The
hiring decisions down the line were immaterial, it rea
soned, because “[t]he hiring only of applicants classified
‘well qualified’ was the automatic consequence of the test
scores rather than the product of a fresh act of discrimina
tion.” Id., at 491. We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. __
(2009).

A

Before beginning a Title VII suit, a plaintiff must first
file a timely EEOC charge. In this case, petitioners’
charges were due within 300 days “after the alleged
unlawful employment practice occurred.” §2000e–5(e)(1).3
Determining whether a plaintiff’s charge is timely thus
requires “identify[ing] precisely the ‘unlawful employment
practice’ of which he complains.” Delaware State College
v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257 (1980). Petitioners here chal
lenge the City’s practice of picking only those who had
scored 89 or above on the 1995 examination when it later
chose applicants to advance. Setting aside the first round
of selection in May 1996, which all agree is beyond the cut
off, no one disputes that the conduct petitioners challenge
occurred within the charging period.4 The real question,

3 All agree that a 300-day deadline applies to petitioners’ charges
pursuant to 29 CFR §§1601.13(a)(4), (b)(1), 1601.80 (2009). Cf. EEOC
v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U. S. 107, 112, 114–122 (1988).
4 Because the District Court certified petitioners as a class, and be
cause a court may award class-wide relief even to unnamed class
members who have not filed EEOC charges, see Franks v. Bowman
Transp. Co., 424 U. S. 747, 771 (1976), petitioners assert and the City
does not dispute that the date of the earliest EEOC charge filed by a
named plaintiff—that filed by Smith on March 31, 1997—controls the
timeliness of the class’s claims. We assume without deciding that this
