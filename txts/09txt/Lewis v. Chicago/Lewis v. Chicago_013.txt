LEWIS v. CHICAGO
Opinion of the Court

petitioners’ “continuing violation” theory. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 45a. That theory, which petitioners have since
abandoned, treated the adoption and application of the

employees and prospective employees may not even know

may induce plaintiffs aware of the danger of delay to file
charges upon the announcement of a hiring practice,
before they have any basis for believing it will produce a
