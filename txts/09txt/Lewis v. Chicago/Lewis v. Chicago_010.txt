Opinion of the Court

accrue at all.
The City responds that subsection (k) does not answer
that question either; that it speaks, as its title indicates,
only to the plaintiff’s “[b]urden of proof in disparate im
pact cases,” not to the elements of disparate-impact
claims, which the City says are be found in §2000e–2(a)(2).
That is incorrect. Subsection (k) does indeed address the
burden of proof—not just who bears it, however, but also
what it consists of. It does set forth the essential ingredi
ents of a disparate-impact claim: It says that a claim “is
established” if an employer “uses” an “employment prac
tice” that “causes a disparate impact” on one of the enu
merated bases. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). That it also sets
forth a business-necessity defense employers may raise,
§2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), and explains how plaintiffs may
prevail despite that defense, §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(ii), is ir
relevant. Unless and until the defendant pleads and
proves a business-necessity defense, the plaintiff wins
simply by showing the stated elements.

Notwithstanding the text of §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i) and
petitioners’ description of the practice they claim was
unlawful, the City argues that the unlawful employment
practice here was something else entirely. The only ac
tionable discrimination, it argues, occurred in 1996 when
it “used the examination results to create the hiring eligi
bility list, limited hiring to the ‘well qualified’ classifica
tion, and notified petitioners.” Brief for Respondent 23.
That initial decision, it concedes, was unlawful. But be
cause no timely charge challenged the decision, that can
not now be the basis for liability. And because, the City
claims, the exclusion of petitioners when selecting classes
of firefighters followed inevitably from the earlier decision
to adopt the cutoff score, no new violations could have
occurred. The Seventh Circuit adopted the same analysis.
