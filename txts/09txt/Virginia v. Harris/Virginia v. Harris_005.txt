ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

The conflict is clear and the stakes are high. The effect
of the rule below will be to grant drunk drivers “one free
swerve” before they can legally be pulled over by police. It
will be difficult for an officer to explain to the family of a
motorist killed by that swerve that the police had a tip
that the driver of the other car was drunk, but that they
were powerless to pull him over, even for a quick check.
Maybe the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court below
was correct, and the Fourth Amendment bars police from
acting on anonymous tips of drunk driving unless they can
verify each tip. If so, then the dangerous consequences of
this rule are unavoidable. But the police should have
every legitimate tool at their disposal for getting drunk
drivers off the road. I would grant certiorari to determine
if this is one of them.
