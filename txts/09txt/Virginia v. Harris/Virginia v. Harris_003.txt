ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

that the Fourth Amendment analysis might be different in
other situations. The Court declined “to speculate about
the circumstances under which the danger alleged in an
anonymous tip might be so great as to justify a search
even without a showing of reliability.” Id., at 273. It also
hinted that “in quarters where the reasonable expectation
of Fourth Amendment privacy is diminished,” it might be
constitutionally permissible to “conduct protective
searches on the basis of information insufficient to justify
searches elsewhere.” Id., at 274.
There is no question that drunk driving is a serious and
potentially deadly crime, as our cases have repeatedly
emphasized. See, e.g., Michigan Dept. of State Police v.
Sitz, 496 U. S. 444, 451 (1990) (“No one can seriously
dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or
the States’ interest in eradicating it. Media reports of
alcohol-related death and mutilation on the Nation’s roads
are legion”). The imminence of the danger posed by drunk
drivers exceeds that at issue in other types of cases. In a
case like J. L., the police can often observe the subject of a
tip and step in before actual harm occurs; with drunk
driving, such a wait-and-see approach may prove fatal.
Drunk driving is always dangerous, as it is occurring.
This Court has in fact recognized that the dangers posed
by drunk drivers are unique, frequently upholding anti
drunk-driving policies that might be constitutionally
problematic in other, less exigent circumstances.1
