ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
VIRGINIA v. JOSEPH A. MOSES HARRIS, JR.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME

COURT OF VIRGINIA

No. 08–1385. Decided October 20, 2009 


The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA
joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
Every year, close to 13,000 people die in alcohol-related
car crashes—roughly one death every 40 minutes. See
Dept. of Transp., Nat. Hwy. Traffic Safety Admin., Traffic
Safety Facts, 2007 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment—

posed by drunk driving, and they frequently report such
conduct to the police. A number of States have adopted
programs specifically designed to encourage such tips—
programs such as the “Drunkbusters Hotline” in New
Mexico and the REDDI program (Report Every Drunk
Driver Immediately) in force in several States. See Dept.
of Transp., Nat. Hwy. Traffic Safety Admin., Programs
Across the United States That Aid Motorists in the Re
porting of Impaired Drivers to Law Enforcement (2007).
By a 4-to-3 vote, the Virginia Supreme Court below
adopted a rule that will undermine such efforts to get
drunk drivers off the road. The decision below commands
that police officers following a driver reported to be drunk
do nothing until they see the driver actually do something
unsafe on the road—by which time it may be too late.
Here, a Richmond police officer pulled Joseph Harris
over after receiving an anonymous tip that Harris was
driving while intoxicated. The tip described Harris, his
car, and the direction he was traveling in considerable
detail. The officer did not personally witness Harris vio
