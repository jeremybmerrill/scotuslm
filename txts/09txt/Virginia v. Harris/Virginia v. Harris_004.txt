VIRGINIA v. HARRIS
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

In the absence of controlling precedent on point, a sharp
disagreement has emerged among federal and state courts
over how to apply the Fourth Amendment in this context.
The majority of courts examining the question have up
held investigative stops of allegedly drunk or erratic driv
ers, even when the police did not personally witness any
traffic violations before conducting the stops.2 These
courts have typically distinguished J. L.’s general rule
based on some combination of (1) the especially grave and
imminent dangers posed by drunk driving; (2) the en
hanced reliability of tips alleging illegal activity in public,
to which the tipster was presumably an eyewitness; (3) the
fact that traffic stops are typically less invasive than
searches or seizures of individuals on foot; and (4) the
diminished expectation of privacy enjoyed by individuals
driving their cars on public roads. A minority of jurisdic
tions, meanwhile, take the same position as the Virginia
Supreme Court, requiring that officers first confirm an
anonymous tip of drunk or erratic driving through their
own independent observation.3 This conflict has been
expressly noted by the lower courts.4
——————
the Court has upheld government measures “aimed at removing drunk
drivers from the road,” distinguishing such measures from those with
the primary purpose of “detect[ing] evidence of ordinary criminal
wrongdoing”).
