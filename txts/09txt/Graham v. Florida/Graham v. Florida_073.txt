THOMAS, J., dissenting

Only the independent moral judgment of this Court is
sufficient to decide the question. See ibid.

Lacking any plausible claim to consensus, the Court
shifts to the heart of its argument: its “independent judg

that analysis with the obligatory preamble that “ ‘[t]he
Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one
penological theory,’ ” ante, at 20 (quoting Harmelin, 501
U. S., at 999 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)), then promptly

imposition of life-without-parole sentences on juvenile

this goal “inadequate” to justify the life-without-parole
sentences here. Ante, at 22 (emphasis added). A similar
fate befalls deterrence. The Court acknowledges that such
sentences will deter future juvenile offenders, at least to

offenders tomorrow if they see fit. Starting today, ours can count itself
among the few in which judicial decree prevents voters from making
that choice.
