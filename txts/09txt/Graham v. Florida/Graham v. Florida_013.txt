Appendix to opinion of the Court
Opinion of the Court

Ewing v. California, 538 U. S. 11 (2003); see also Lockyer
v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63 (2003). The Court has also up
held a sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a
defendant’s third nonviolent felony, the crime of obtaining
money by false pretenses, Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263
(1980), and a sentence of 40 years for possession of mari
juana with intent to distribute and distribution of mari
juana, Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370 (1982) (per curiam).
The controlling opinion in Harmelin explained its ap
proach for determining whether a sentence for a term of
years is grossly disproportionate for a particular defen
dant’s crime. A court must begin by comparing the gravity
of the offense and the severity of the sentence. 501 U. S.,
at 1005 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). “[I]n the rare case in
which [this] threshold comparison . . . leads to an infer
ence of gross disproportionality” the court should then
compare the defendant’s sentence with the sentences
received by other offenders in the same jurisdiction and
with the sentences imposed for the same crime in other
jurisdictions. Ibid. If this comparative analysis “vali
date[s] an initial judgment that [the] sentence is grossly
disproportionate,” the sentence is cruel and unusual. Ibid.
The second classification of cases has used categorical
rules to define Eighth Amendment standards. The previ
ous cases in this classification involved the death penalty.
The classification in turn consists of two subsets, one
considering the nature of the offense, the other consider
ing the characteristics of the offender. With respect to the
nature of the offense, the Court has concluded that capital
punishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes
against individuals. Kennedy, supra, at __ (slip op., at 28);
see also Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Coker v.
Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977). In cases turning on the
characteristics of the offender, the Court has adopted
categorical rules prohibiting the death penalty for defen
dants who committed their crimes before the age of 18,
