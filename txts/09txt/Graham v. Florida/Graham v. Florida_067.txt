GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

latures crack[ed] down on juvenile crime”); ibid. (noting
that, during that period, “legislatures in 47 States and the
District of Columbia enacted laws that made their juvenile
justice systems more punitive,” principally by “ma[king] it
easier to transfer juvenile offenders from the juvenile
justice system to the [adult] criminal justice system”); id.,
at 104. This, in my view, reveals the States’ widespread
agreement that juveniles can sometimes act with the same
culpability as adults and that the law should permit
judges and juries to consider adult sentences—including
life without parole—in those rare and unfortunate cases.
See Feld, Unmitigated Punishment: Adolescent Criminal
Responsibility and LWOP Sentences, 10 J. Law & Family
Studies 11, 69–70 (2007) (noting that life-without-parole
sentences for juveniles have increased since the 1980’s);
Amnesty International & Human Rights Watch, The Rest
of Their Lives: Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in
the United States 2, 31 (2005) (same).
Second, legislatures have moved away from parole over
the same period. Congress abolished parole for federal
offenders in 1984 amid criticism that it was subject to
“gamesmanship and cynicism,” Breyer, Federal Sentenc
ing Guidelines Revisited, 11 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 180
(1999) (discussing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98
Stat. 1987), and several States have followed suit, see T.
Hughes, D. Wilson, & A. Beck, Dept. of Justice, Bureau of
Justice Statistics, Trends in State Parole, 1990–2000, p. 1
(2001) (noting that, by the end of 2000, 16 States had
abolished parole for all offenses, while another 4 States
had abolished it for certain ones). In light of these devel
opments, the argument that there is nationwide consensus
that parole must be available to offenders less than 18
years old in every nonhomicide case simply fails.
