THOMAS, J., dissenting

Moreover, the consistency and direction of recent legis
lation—a factor the Court previously has relied upon when
crafting categorical proportionality rules, see Atkins, 536
U. S., at 315–316; Roper, 543 U. S., at 565–566—
underscores the consensus against the rule the Court
announces here. In my view, the Court cannot point to a
national consensus in favor of its rule without assuming a
consensus in favor of the two penological points it later
discusses: (1) Juveniles are always less culpable than
similarly-situated adults, and (2) juveniles who commit
nonhomicide crimes should always receive an opportunity
to demonstrate rehabilitation through parole. Ante, at 17–
18, 23–25. But legislative trends make that assumption
untenable.
First, States over the past 20 years have consistently
increased the severity of punishments for juvenile offend
ers. See 1999 DOJ National Report 89 (referring to the
1990’s as “a time of unprecedented change as State legis

punishment for the rape of a child where only six States had enacted
statutes authorizing the punishment since Furman v. Georgia, 408
U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam)); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 564,
568 (2005) (prohibiting capital punishment for offenders younger than
18 where 18 of 38 death-penalty States precluded imposition of the
penalty on persons under 18 and the remaining 12 States did not
permit capital punishment at all); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304,
314–315 (2002) (prohibiting capital punishment of mentally retarded
persons where 18 of 38 death-penalty States precluded imposition of
the penalty on such persons and the remaining States did not authorize
capital punishment at all); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826,
829 (1988) (plurality opinion) (prohibiting capital punishment of
offenders under 16 where 18 of 36 death-penalty States precluded
imposition of the penalty on such persons and the remaining States did
not permit capital punishment at all); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S.
782, 789 (1982) (prohibiting capital punishment for felony murder
without proof of intent to kill where eight States allowed the punish
ment without proof of that element); Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584,
593 (1977) (holding capital punishment for the rape of a woman uncon
stitutional where “[a]t no time in the last 50 years have a majority of
the States authorized death as a punishment for rape”).
