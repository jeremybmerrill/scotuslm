THOMAS, J., dissenting

uses average sentences for burglary or robbery offenses as
examples of “similar” offenses, even though it seems that a
run-of-the-mill burglary or robbery is not at all similar to
Graham’s criminal history, which includes a charge for
armed burglary with assault, and a probation violation for
invading a home at gunpoint.
And even if Graham’s sentence is higher than ones he
might have received for an armed burglary with assault in
other jurisdictions, see ante, at 8–9, this hardly seems
relevant if one takes seriously the principle that “ ‘[a]bsent
a constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to tradi
tional notions of federalism, some State will always bear
the distinction of treating particular offenders more se
verely than any other State.’ ” Harmelin, supra, at 1000
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (quoting Rummel, 445 U. S., at
282; emphasis added). Applying Solem, the Court has
upheld a 25-years-to-life sentence for theft under Califor
nia’s recidivist statute, despite the fact that the State and
its amici could cite only “a single instance of a similar
sentence imposed outside the context of California’s three
strikes law, out of a prison population [then] approaching
two million individuals.” Ewing, 538 U. S., at 47 (BREYER,
J., dissenting). It has also upheld a life-without-parole
sentence for a first-time drug offender in Michigan
charged with possessing 672 grams of cocaine despite the
fact that only one other State would have authorized such
a stiff penalty for a first-time drug offense, and even that
State required a far greater quantity of cocaine (10 kilo
grams) to trigger the penalty. See Harmelin, supra, at
1026 (White, J., dissenting). Graham’s sentence is cer
tainly less rare than the sentences upheld in these cases,
so his claim fails even under Solem
