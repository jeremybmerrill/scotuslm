THOMAS, J., dissenting

tion marks omitted). As such, the analysis should end
quickly, because a national “consensus” in favor of the
Court’s result simply does not exist. The laws of all 50
States, the Federal Government, and the District of Co
lumbia provide that juveniles over a certain age may be
tried in adult court if charged with certain crimes.4 See
ante, at 33–35 (Appendix to opinion of the Court). Forty
five States, the Federal Government, and the District of
Columbia expose juvenile offenders charged in adult court
to the very same range of punishments faced by adults
charged with the same crimes. See ante, at 33–34, Part I.
Eight of those States do not make life-without-parole
sentences available for any nonhomicide offender, regard
less of age.5 All remaining jurisdictions—the Federal
Government, the other 37 States, and the District—
authorize life-without-parole sentences for certain non
homicide offenses, and authorize the imposition of such
sentences on persons under 18. See ibid. Only five States

4 Although

the details of state laws vary extensively, they generally
permit the transfer of a juvenile offender to adult court through one or
more of the following mechanisms: (1) judicial waiver, in which the
juvenile court has the authority to waive jurisdiction over the offender
and transfer the case to adult court; (2) concurrent jurisdiction, in
which adult and juvenile courts share jurisdiction over certain cases
and the prosecutor has discretion to file in either court; or (3) statutory
provisions that exclude juveniles who commit certain crimes from
juvenile-court jurisdiction. See Dept. of Justice, Juvenile Offenders and
Victims: 1999 National Report 89, 104 (1999) (hereinafter 1999 DOJ
National Report); Feld, Unmitigated Punishment: Adolescent Criminal
Responsibility and LWOP Sentences, 10 J. Law & Family Studies 11,
38–39 (2007).
5 Alaska entitles all offenders to parole, regardless of their crime.
Alaska Stat. §12.55.015(g) (2008). The other seven States provide
parole eligibility to all offenders, except those who commit certain
homicide crimes. Conn. Gen. Stat. §53a–35a (2009); Haw. Rev. Stat.
§§706–656(1)–(2) (1993 and 2008 Supp. Pamphlet); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.,
Tit. 17–a, §1251 (2006); Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 265, §2 (West 2008);
N. J. Stat. Ann. §§2C:11–3(b)(2)–(3) (West 2005); N. M. Stat. Ann. §31–
18–14 (Supp. 2009); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13, §2303 (2009).
