GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment

sentence as a violation of the Eighth Amendment.
B
The second line of precedent relevant to assessing Gra
ham’s sentence consists of our cases acknowledging that
juvenile offenders are generally—though not necessarily in
every case—less morally culpable than adults who commit
the same crimes. This insight animated our decision in
Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988), in which we
invalidated a capital sentence imposed on a juvenile who
had committed his crime under the age of 16. More re
cently, in Roper, 543 U. S. 551, we extended the prohibi
tion on executions to those who committed their crimes
before the age of 18.
Both Thompson and Roper arose in the unique context
of the death penalty, a punishment that our Court has
recognized “must be limited to those offenders who commit
‘a narrow category of the most serious crimes’ and whose
extreme culpability makes them ‘the most deserving of
execution.’ ” 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins v. Virginia,
536 U. S. 304, 319 (2002)). Roper’s prohibition on the
juvenile death penalty followed from our conclusion that
“[t]hree general differences between juveniles under 18
and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot
with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.”
543 U. S., at 569. These differences are a lack of maturity
and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, a height
ened susceptibility to negative influences and outside
pressures, and the fact that the character of a juvenile is
“more transitory” and “less fixed” than that of an adult.
Id., at 569–570. Together, these factors establish the
“diminished culpability of juveniles,” id., at 571, and “ren
der suspect any conclusion” that juveniles are among “the
worst offenders” for whom the death penalty is reserved,
id., at 570.
Today, the Court views Roper as providing the basis for
