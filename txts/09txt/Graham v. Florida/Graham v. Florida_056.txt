THOMAS, J., dissenting

imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
Graham argues, and the Court holds, that this sentence
violates the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual
Punishments Clause because a life-without-parole sen
tence is always “grossly disproportionate” when imposed
on a person under 18 who commits any crime short of a
homicide. Brief for Petitioner 24; ante, at 21.

The Eighth Amendment, which applies to the States
through the Fourteenth, provides that “[e]xcessive bail
shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” It is by now
well established that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause was originally understood as prohibiting torturous
“ ‘methods of punishment,’ ” Harmelin v. Michigan, 501
U. S. 957, 979 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (quoting
Granucci, “Nor Cruel and Unusual Punishments In

considered cruel and unusual at the time the Bill of
Rights was adopted, Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 99 (2008)
(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). With one arguable
exception, see Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349
(1910); Harmelin, supra, at 990–994 (opinion of
SCALIA, J.) (discussing the scope and relevance of Weems’
holding), this Court applied the Clause with that under
standing for nearly 170 years after the Eighth Amend

More recently, however, the Court has held that the
Clause authorizes it to proscribe not only methods of
punishment that qualify as “cruel and unusual,” but also
any punishment that the Court deems “grossly dispropor
tionate” to the crime committed. Ante, at 8 (internal
