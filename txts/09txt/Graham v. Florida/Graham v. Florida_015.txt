Opinion of the Court

evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted
by the country’s legislatures.’ ” Atkins, supra, at 312
(quoting Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989)). Six
jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for
any juvenile offenders. See Appendix, infra, Part III.
Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile
offenders, but only for homicide crimes. Id., Part II.
Thirty-seven States as well as the District of Columbia
permit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile non
homicide offender in some circumstances. Id., Part I.
Federal law also allows for the possibility of life without
parole for offenders as young as 13. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.
§§2241 (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 5032 (2006 ed.). Relying
on this metric, the State and its amici argue that there is
no national consensus against the sentencing practice at
issue.
This argument is incomplete and unavailing. “There are
measures of consensus other than legislation.” Kennedy,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22). Actual sentencing practices
are an important part of the Court’s inquiry into consen
sus. See Enmund, supra, at 794–796; Thompson, supra,
at 831–832 (plurality opinion); Atkins, supra, at 316;
Roper, supra, at 564–565; Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op.,
at 22–23). Here, an examination of actual sentencing
practices in jurisdictions where the sentence in question is
permitted by statute discloses a consensus against its use.
Although these statutory schemes contain no explicit
prohibition on sentences of life without parole for juvenile
nonhomicide offenders, those sentences are most infre
quent. According to a recent study, nationwide there are
only 109 juvenile offenders serving sentences of life with
out parole for nonhomicide offenses. See P. Annino, D.
Rasmussen, & C. Rice, Juvenile Life without Parole for
Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2
(Sept. 14, 2009) (hereinafter Annino).
The State contends that this study’s tally is inaccurate
