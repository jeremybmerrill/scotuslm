THOMAS, J., dissenting

the Eighth Amendment gives this Court no authority to
reject those judgments.
It would be unjustifiable for the Court to declare other
wise even if it could claim that a bare majority of state laws
supported its independent moral view. The fact that the
Court categorically prohibits life-without-parole sentences
for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the face of an over
whelming legislative majority in favor of leaving that sen
tencing option available under certain cases simply illus
trates how far beyond any cognizable constitutional
principle the Court has reached to ensure that its own
sense of morality and retributive justice pre-empts that of
the people and their representatives.
I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that “[w]e learn, some
times, from our mistakes.” Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion).
Perhaps one day the Court will learn from this one.
I respectfully dissent.
