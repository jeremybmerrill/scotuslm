GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

swayed by studies reflecting the general tendencies of
youth, decree that the people of this country are not fit to
decide for themselves when the rare case requires differ

That is especially so because, in the end, the Court does
not even believe its pronouncements about the juvenile
mind. If it did, the categorical rule it announces today
would be most peculiar because it leaves intact state and
federal laws that permit life-without-parole sentences for
juveniles who commit homicides. See ante, at 18–19. The
Court thus acknowledges that there is nothing inherent in
the psyche of a person less than 18 that prevents him from
acquiring the moral agency necessary to warrant a life
without-parole sentence. Instead, the Court rejects over
whelming legislative consensus only on the question of
which acts are sufficient to demonstrate that moral agency.
The Court is quite willing to accept that a 17-year-old
who pulls the trigger on a firearm can demonstrate suffi
cient depravity and irredeemability to be denied reentry
into society, but insists that a 17-year-old who rapes an 8
year-old and leaves her for dead does not. See ante, at 17–
19; cf. ante, at 9 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)
(describing the crime of life-without-parole offender Mi
lagro Cunningham). Thus, the Court’s conclusion that
life-without-parole sentences are “grossly disproportion
ate” for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in fact has very
little to do with its view of juveniles, and much more to do
with its perception that “defendants who do not kill, in
tend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categori
cally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish
ment than are murderers.” Ante, at 18.
That the Court is willing to impose such an exacting
constraint on democratic sentencing choices based on such
an untestable philosophical conclusion is remarkable. The
