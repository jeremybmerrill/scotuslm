ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment

setting sentences, the variety of legitimate penological
schemes, the state-by-state diversity protected by our
federal system, and the requirement that review be guided
by objective, rather than subjective, factors. Ewing, supra,
at 23 (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 998–1001
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Most importantly, however, we
have explained that the Eighth Amendment “ ‘does not
require strict proportionality between crime and sen
tence’ ”; rather, “ ‘it forbids only extreme sentences that are
“grossly disproportionate” to the crime.’ ” Ewing, supra, at
23 (plurality opinion) (quoting Harmelin, supra, at 1001
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.)).
Our cases indicate that courts conducting “narrow pro
portionality” review should begin with a threshold inquiry
that compares “the gravity of the offense and the harsh
ness of the penalty.” Solem, 463 U. S., at 290–291. This
analysis can consider a particular offender’s mental state
and motive in committing the crime, the actual harm
caused to his victim or to society by his conduct, and any
prior criminal history. Id., at 292–294, 296–297, and n. 22
(considering motive, past criminal conduct, alcoholism,
and propensity for violence of the particular defendant);
see also Ewing, supra, at 28–30 (plurality opinion) (exam
ining defendant’s criminal history); Harmelin, 501 U. S.,
at 1001–1004 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (noting specific
details of the particular crime of conviction).
Only in “the rare case in which a threshold comparison
of the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads
to an inference of gross disproportionality,” id., at 1005,
should courts proceed to an “intrajurisdictional” compari
son of the sentence at issue with those imposed on other
criminals in the same jurisdiction, and an “interjurisdic
tional” comparison with sentences imposed for the same
crime in other jurisdictions. Solem, supra, at 291–292. If
these subsequent comparisons confirm the inference of
gross disproportionality, courts should invalidate the
