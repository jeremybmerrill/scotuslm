GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
Appendix to opinion of the Court
Opinion of the Court

homicide offenders; and the severity of life without parole
sentences all lead to the conclusion that the sentencing
practice under consideration is cruel and unusual. This
Court now holds that for a juvenile offender who did not
commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the
sentence of life without parole. This clear line is necessary
to prevent the possibility that life without parole sen
tences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders
who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punish
ment. Because “[t]he age of 18 is the point where society
draws the line for many purposes between childhood and
adulthood,” those who were below that age when the
offense was committed may not be sentenced to life with
out parole for a nonhomicide crime. Roper, 543 U. S., at
574.
A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to
a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime.
What the State must do, however, is give defendants like
Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release
based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is
for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means
and mechanisms for compliance. It bears emphasis, how
ever, that while the Eighth Amendment forbids a State
from imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile
nonhomicide offender, it does not require the State to
release that offender during his natural life. Those who
commit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out
to be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for
the duration of their lives. The Eighth Amendment does
not foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of
nonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will
remain behind bars for life. It does forbid States from
making the judgment at the outset that those offenders
never will be fit to reenter society.
