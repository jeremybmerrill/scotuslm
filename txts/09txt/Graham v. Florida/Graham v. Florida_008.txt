hearings on Graham’s violations about a year later, in
December 2005 and January 2006. The judge who pre

violated his probation by committing a home invasion
robbery, by possessing a firearm, and by associating with
persons engaged in criminal activity.

imprisonment. The maximum was life imprisonment.
Graham’s attorney requested the minimum nondeparture
sentence of 5 years. A presentence report prepared by the
Florida Department of Corrections recommended that
Graham receive an even lower sentence—at most 4 years’
imprisonment. The State recommended that Graham
receive 30 years on the armed burglary count and 15 years
on the attempted armed robbery count.
