THOMAS, J., dissenting

some degree, but rejects that penological goal, not as
illegitimate, but as insufficient. Ante, at 21 (“[A]ny limited
deterrent effect provided by life without parole is not
enough to justify the sentence.” (emphasis added)).
The Court looks more favorably on rehabilitation, but
laments that life-without-parole sentences do little to
promote this goal because they result in the offender’s
permanent incarceration. Ante, at 23. Of course, the
Court recognizes that rehabilitation’s “utility and proper
implementation” are subject to debate. Ante, at 23. But
that does not stop it from declaring that a legislature may
not “forswea[r] . . . the rehabilitative ideal.” Ibid. In other
words, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate “any one

maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,” ’ ”
and “their characters are ‘not as well formed.’ ” Ante, at
17. As a general matter, this statement is entirely consis

juries impose the sentence at issue quite infrequently,
despite legislative authorization to do so in many more
cases. See Part III–B, supra. Our society tends to treat
the average juvenile as less culpable than the average
adult. But the question here does not involve the average
