lenges and has rejected them all, see Ewing v. California,
538 U. S. 11 (2003); Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63

28 (plurality opinion). The Court correctly notes that
those decisions were “closely divided,” ante, at 8, but so
was Solem itself, and it is now fair to describe Solem as an
outlier.2
Remarkably, the Court today does more than return to
Solem’s case-by-case proportionality standard for noncapi

proportionality rule banning life-without-parole sentences
not just in this case, but in every case involving a juvenile
nonhomicide offender, no matter what the circumstances.
Neither the Eighth Amendment nor the Court’s prece
