THOMAS, J., dissenting

generally were punished either by fines, whipping, or
public “shaming,” or by death, as intermediate sentencing
options such as incarceration were not common).
The Court has nonetheless invoked proportionality to
declare that capital punishment—though not unconstitu
tional per se—is categorically too harsh a penalty to apply
to certain types of crimes and certain classes of offenders.
See Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977) (plurality opin

particular nonprohibited method of punishment to the
judgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty, the
prosecutors who seek it, and the judges and juries that
impose it under circumstances they deem appropriate.
The Court has nonetheless adopted categorical rules
that shield entire classes of offenses and offenders from
the death penalty on the theory that “evolving standards
of decency” require this result. Ante, at 7 (internal quota

that these standards can be reliably measured by “ ‘objec
