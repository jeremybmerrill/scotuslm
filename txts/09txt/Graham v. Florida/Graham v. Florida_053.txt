GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment

*

*
Terrance Graham committed serious offenses, for which
he deserves serious punishment. But he was only 16 years
old, and under our Court’s precedents, his youth is one
factor, among others, that should be considered in decid
ing whether his punishment was unconstitutionally exces
sive. In my view, Graham’s age—together with the nature
of his criminal activity and the unusual severity of his
sentence—tips the constitutional balance. I thus concur in
the Court’s judgment that Graham’s sentence of life with
out parole violated the Eighth Amendment.
I would not, however, reach the same conclusion in
every case involving a juvenile offender. Some crimes are
so heinous, and some juvenile offenders so highly culpable,
that a sentence of life without parole may be entirely
justified under the Constitution. As we have said, “suc
cessful challenges” to noncapital sentences under the
Eighth Amendment have been—and, in my view, should
continue to be—“exceedingly rare.” Rummel, 445 U. S., at
272. But Graham’s sentence presents the exceptional case
that our precedents have recognized will come along. We
should grant Graham the relief to which he is entitled
under the Eighth Amendment. The Court errs, however,
in using this case as a vehicle for unsettling our estab
lished jurisprudence and fashioning a categorical rule
applicable to far different cases.
