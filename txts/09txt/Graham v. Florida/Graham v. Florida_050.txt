tions in Florida 35. Unsurprisingly, Florida’s juvenile
criminals receive similarly low sentences—typically less
than five years for burglary and less than seven years for
robbery. Id., at 36. Graham’s life without parole sentence
was far more severe than the average sentence imposed on
those convicted of murder or manslaughter, who typically
receive under 25 years in prison. Id., at 35. As the Court
explained in Solem, 463 U. S., at 291, “[i]f more serious
crimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious
penalties, that is some indication that the punishment at
issue may be excessive.”
Finally, the inference that Graham’s sentence is dispro

majority opinion explains, Florida is an outlier in its will

and Jakaris Taylor, the Florida juveniles who together
with their friends gang-raped a woman and forced her to
perform oral sex on her 12-year-old son? See 3 Sentenced
to Life for Gang Rape of Mother, Associated Press, Oct. 14,
2009. The fact that Graham cannot be sentenced to life
without parole for his conduct says nothing whatever
about these offenders, or others like them who commit
nonhomicide crimes far more reprehensible than the
conduct at issue here. The Court uses Graham’s case as a
vehicle to proclaim a new constitutional rule—applicable
well beyond the particular facts of Graham’s case—that a
