GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment

reserved. On the contrary, his lack of prior criminal con
victions, his youth and immaturity, and the difficult cir
cumstances of his upbringing noted by the majority, ante,
at 1, all suggest that he was markedly less culpable than a
typical adult who commits the same offenses.
Despite these considerations, the trial court sentenced
Graham to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
This is the second-harshest sentence available under our
precedents for any crime, and the most severe sanction
available for a nonhomicide offense. See Kennedy v. Lou
isiana, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). Indeed, as the majority notes,
Graham’s sentence far exceeded the punishment proposed
by the Florida Department of Corrections (which sug
gested a sentence of four years, Brief for Petitioner 20),
and the state prosecutors (who asked that he be sentenced
to 30 years in prison for the armed burglary, App. 388).
No one in Graham’s case other than the sentencing judge
appears to have believed that Graham deserved to go to
prison for life.
Based on the foregoing circumstances, I conclude that
there is a strong inference that Graham’s sentence of life
imprisonment without parole was grossly disproportionate
in violation of the Eighth Amendment. I therefore proceed
to the next steps of the proportionality analysis.
B
Both intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional compari
sons of Graham’s sentence confirm the threshold inference
of disproportionality.
Graham’s sentence was far more severe than that im
posed for similar violations of Florida law, even without
taking juvenile status into account. For example, indi
viduals who commit burglary or robbery offenses in Flor
ida receive average sentences of less than 5 years and less
than 10 years, respectively. Florida Dept. of Corrections,
