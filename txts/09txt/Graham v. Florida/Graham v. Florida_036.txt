GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
Appendix to opinion of the Court
Opinion of the Court

*
*
*
The Constitution prohibits the imposition of a life with
out parole sentence on a juvenile offender who did not
commit homicide. A State need not guarantee the offender
eventual release, but if it imposes a sentence of life it must
provide him or her with some realistic opportunity to
obtain release before the end of that term. The judgment
of the First District Court of Appeal of Florida is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
