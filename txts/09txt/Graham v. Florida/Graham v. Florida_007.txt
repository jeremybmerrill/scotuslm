Opinion of the Court

Less than 6 months later, on the night of December 2,
2004, Graham again was arrested. The State’s case was
as follows: Earlier that evening, Graham participated in a
home invasion robbery. His two accomplices were Meigo
Bailey and Kirkland Lawrence, both 20-year-old men.
According to the State, at 7 p.m. that night, Graham,
