GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
Appendix to opinion of the Court
Opinion of the Court

Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), or whose intellec
tual functioning is in a low range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536
U. S. 304 (2002). See also Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487
U. S. 815 (1988).
In the cases adopting categorical rules the Court has
taken the following approach. The Court first considers
“objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed in
legislative enactments and state practice” to determine
whether there is a national consensus against the sentenc
ing practice at issue. Roper, supra, at 563. Next, guided
by “the standards elaborated by controlling precedents
and by the Court’s own understanding and interpretation
of the Eighth Amendment’s text, history, meaning, and
purpose,” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), the
Court must determine in the exercise of its own inde
pendent judgment whether the punishment in question
violates the Constitution. Roper, supra, at 564.
The present case involves an issue the Court has not
considered previously: a categorical challenge to a term-of
years sentence. The approach in cases such as Harmelin
and Ewing is suited for considering a gross proportionality
challenge to a particular defendant’s sentence, but here a
sentencing practice itself is in question. This case impli
cates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an
entire class of offenders who have committed a range of
crimes. As a result, a threshold comparison between the
severity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime does
not advance the analysis. Here, in addressing the ques
tion presented, the appropriate analysis is the one used in
cases that involved the categorical approach, specifically
Atkins, Roper, and Kennedy.
