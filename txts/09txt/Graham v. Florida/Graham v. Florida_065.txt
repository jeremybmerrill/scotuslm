GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

prohibit juvenile offenders from receiving a life-without
parole sentence that could be imposed on an adult con
victed of the same crime.6
No plausible claim of a consensus against this sentenc
ing practice can be made in light of this overwhelming
legislative evidence. The sole fact that federal law author
izes this practice singlehandedly refutes the claim that our
Nation finds it morally repugnant. The additional reality
that 37 out of 50 States (a supermajority of 74%) permit
the practice makes the claim utterly implausible. Not only
is there no consensus against this penalty, there is a clear
legislative consensus in favor of its availability.
Undaunted, however, the Court brushes this evidence
aside as “incomplete and unavailing,” declaring that
“ ‘[t]here are measures of consensus other than legisla
tion.’ ” Ante, at 11 (quoting Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 22)). This is nothing short of stunning. Most im
portantly, federal civilian law approves this sentencing
practice.7 And although the Court has never decided how
many state laws are necessary to show consensus, the
Court has never banished into constitutional exile a sen
tencing practice that the laws of a majority, let alone a
supermajority, of States expressly permit.8

Uniform Code of Military Justice to its discernment of consensus, see
Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (statement of KENNEDY,
J., respecting denial of rehearing), juveniles who enlist in the military
are nonetheless eligible for life-without-parole sentences if they commit
certain nonhomicide crimes. See 10 U. S. C. §§505(a) (permitting
enlistment at age 17), 856a, 920 (2006 ed., Supp. II).
