THOMAS, J., dissenting

question of what acts are “deserving” of what punishments
is bound so tightly with questions of morality and social
conditions as to make it, almost by definition, a question
for legislative resolution. It is true that the Court previ
ously has relied on the notion of proportionality in holding
certain classes of offenses categorically exempt from capi
tal punishment. See supra, at 4. But never before today
has the Court relied on its own view of just deserts to
impose a categorical limit on the imposition of a lesser
punishment. Its willingness to cross that well-established
boundary raises the question whether any democratic
choice regarding appropriate punishment is safe from the
Court’s ever-expanding constitutional veto.

Although the concurrence avoids the problems associ

noncapital cases, it employs noncapital proportionality
analysis in a way that raises the same fundamental
concern. Although I do not believe Solem merits stare
decisis treatment, Graham’s claim cannot prevail even
under that test (as it has been limited by the Court’s
subsequent precedents). Solem instructs a court first to
compare the “gravity” of an offender’s conduct to the
“harshness of the penalty” to determine whether an
“inference” of gross disproportionality exists. 463 U. S.,
at 290–291. Only in “the rare case” in which such an
inference is present should the court proceed to the “ob
jective” part of the inquiry—an intra- and interjurisdic
tional comparison of the defendant’s sentence with others
similarly situated. Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1000, 1005
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).
Under the Court’s precedents, I fail to see how an “in
ference” of gross disproportionality arises here. The con
currence notes several arguably mitigating facts—
Graham’s “lack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and
