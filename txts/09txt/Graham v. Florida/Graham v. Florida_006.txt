GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
Appendix to opinion of the Court
Opinion of the Court

before closing time. Graham and another youth, wearing
masks, entered through the unlocked door. Graham’s
masked accomplice twice struck the restaurant manager
in the back of the head with a metal bar. When the man
ager started yelling at the assailant and Graham, the two
youths ran out and escaped in a car driven by the third
accomplice. The restaurant manager required stitches for
his head injury. No money was taken.
Graham was arrested for the robbery attempt. Under
Florida law, it is within a prosecutor’s discretion whether
to charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults or juveniles for
most felony crimes. Fla. Stat. §985.227(1)(b) (2003) (sub
sequently renumbered at §985.557(1)(b) (2007)). Gra
ham’s prosecutor elected to charge Graham as an adult.
The charges against Graham were armed burglary with
assault or battery, a first-degree felony carrying a maxi
mum penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility
of parole, §§810.02(1)(b), (2)(a) (2003); and attempted
armed-robbery, a second-degree felony carrying a maxi
mum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment, §§812.13(2)(b),
777.04(1), (4)(a), 775.082(3)(c).
On December 18, 2003, Graham pleaded guilty to both
charges under a plea agreement. Graham wrote a letter to
the trial court. After reciting “this is my first and last
time getting in trouble,” he continued “I’ve decided to turn
my life around.” App. 379–380. Graham said “I made a
promise to God and myself that if I get a second chance,
I’m going to do whatever it takes to get to the [National
Football League].” Id., at 380.
The trial court accepted the plea agreement. The court
withheld adjudication of guilt as to both charges and
sentenced Graham to concurrent 3-year terms of proba
tion. Graham was required to spend the first 12 months of
his probation in the county jail, but he received credit for
the time he had served awaiting trial, and was released on
June 25, 2004.
