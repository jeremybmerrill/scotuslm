Appendix to opinion of the Court
Opinion of the Court

above, see supra, at 23, it is the policy in some prisons to
withhold counseling, education, and rehabilitation pro
grams for those who are ineligible for parole consideration.
A categorical rule against life without parole for juvenile
nonhomicide offenders avoids the perverse consequence in
which the lack of maturity that led to an offender’s crime
is reinforced by the prison term.
Terrance Graham’s sentence guarantees he will die in
prison without any meaningful opportunity to obtain
release, no matter what he might do to demonstrate that
the bad acts he committed as a teenager are not represen
tative of his true character, even if he spends the next half
century attempting to atone for his crimes and learn from
his mistakes. The State has denied him any chance to
later demonstrate that he is fit to rejoin society based
solely on a nonhomicide crime that he committed while he
was a child in the eyes of the law. This the Eighth
Amendment does not permit.
D
There is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in
continuing to impose life without parole sentences on
juveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States
adheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over.
This observation does not control our decision. The judg
ments of other nations and the international community
are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth
Amendment. But “ ‘[t]he climate of international opinion
concerning the acceptability of a particular punishment’ ”
is also “ ‘not irrelevant.’ ” Enmund, 458 U. S., at 796, n. 22.
The Court has looked beyond our Nation’s borders for
support for its independent conclusion that a particular
punishment is cruel and unusual. See, e.g., Roper, 543
U. S., at 575–578; Atkins, supra, at 317–318, n. 21;
Thompson, 487 U. S., at 830 (plurality opinion); Enmund,
supra, at 796–797, n. 22; Coker, 433 U. S., at 596, n. 10
