GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
Appendix to opinion of the Court
Opinion of the Court

(plurality opinion); Trop, 356 U. S., at 102–103 (plurality
opinion).
Today we continue that longstanding practice in noting
the global consensus against the sentencing practice in
question. A recent study concluded that only 11 nations
authorize life without parole for juvenile offenders under
any circumstances; and only 2 of them, the United States
and Israel, ever impose the punishment in practice. See
M. Leighton & C. de la Vega, Sentencing Our Children to
Die in Prison: Global Law and Practice 4 (2007). An up
dated version of the study concluded that Israel’s “laws
allow for parole review of juvenile offenders serving life
terms,” but expressed reservations about how that parole
review is implemented. De la Vega & Leighton, Sentenc
ing Our Children to Die in Prison: Global Law and Prac
tice, 42 U. S. F. L. Rev. 983, 1002–1003 (2008). But even if
Israel is counted as allowing life without parole for juve
nile offenders, that nation does not appear to impose that
sentence for nonhomicide crimes; all of the seven Israeli
prisoners whom commentators have identified as serving
life sentences for juvenile crimes were convicted of homi
cide or attempted homicide. See Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives: Life with
out Parole for Child Offenders in the United States 106,
n. 322 (2005); Memorandum and Attachment from Ruth
Levush, Law Library of Congress, to Supreme Court Li
brary (Feb. 16, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court’s case
file).
Thus, as petitioner contends and respondent does not
contest, the United States is the only Nation that imposes
life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide
offenders. We also note, as petitioner and his amici em
phasize, that Article 37(a) of the United Nations Conven
tion on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577
U. N. T. S. 3 (entered into force Sept. 2, 1990), ratified by
every nation except the United States and Somalia, pro
