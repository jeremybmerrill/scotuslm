GRAHAM v. FLORIDA
ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment

for noncapital crimes. Some of my colleagues have raised
serious and thoughtful questions about whether, as an
original matter, the Constitution was understood to re
quire any degree of proportionality between noncapital
offenses and their corresponding punishments. See, e.g.,
Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 962–994 (1991)
(principal opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 3–5, and n. 1
(THOMAS, J., dissenting). Neither party here asks us to
reexamine our precedents requiring such proportionality,
however, and so I approach this case by trying to apply
our past decisions to the facts at hand.
A
Graham’s case arises at the intersection of two lines of
Eighth Amendment precedent. The first consists of deci
sions holding that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause embraces a “narrow proportionality principle” that
we apply, on a case-by-case basis, when asked to review
noncapital sentences. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 72
(2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); Solem v. Helm,
463 U. S. 277, 290 (1983); Ewing v. California, 538 U. S.
11, 20 (2003) (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 996–
997 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). This “narrow proportionality principle” does
not grant judges blanket authority to second-guess deci
sions made by legislatures or sentencing courts. On the
contrary, a reviewing court will only “rarely” need “to
engage in extended analysis to determine that a sentence
is not constitutionally disproportionate,” Solem, supra, at
290, n. 16 (emphasis added), and “successful challenges” to
noncapital sentences will be all the more “exceedingly
rare,” Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 272 (1980).
We have “not established a clear or consistent path for
courts to follow” in applying the highly deferential “narrow
proportionality” analysis. Lockyer, supra, at 72. We have,
however, emphasized the primacy of the legislature in
