Opinion of the Court

“was given an unheard of probationary sentence for a life
felony, . . . wrote a letter expressing his remorse and
promising to refrain from the commission of further crime,
and . . . had a strong family structure to support him,” the
court noted, he “rejected his second chance and chose to
continue committing crimes at an escalating pace.” Ibid.
The Florida Supreme Court denied review. 990 So. 2d
1058 (2008) (table).
We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).

The Eighth Amendment states: “Excessive bail shall not
be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and
unusual punishments inflicted.” To determine whether a
punishment is cruel and unusual, courts must look beyond
historical conceptions to “ ‘the evolving standards of de
cency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’ ”
Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop
v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).
“This is because ‘[t]he standard of extreme cruelty is not
merely descriptive, but necessarily embodies a moral
judgment. The standard itself remains the same, but its
applicability must change as the basic mores of society
change.’ ” Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)
(slip op., at 8) (quoting Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238,
382 (1972) (Burger, C. J., dissenting)).
The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits
the imposition of inherently barbaric punishments under
all circumstances. See, e.g., Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730
(2002). “[P]unishments of torture,” for example, “are
forbidden.” Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 136 (1879).
These cases underscore the essential principle that, under
the Eighth Amendment, the State must respect the hu
man attributes even of those who have committed serious
crimes.
For the most part, however, the Court’s precedents
