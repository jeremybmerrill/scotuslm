THOMAS, J., dissenting

not merely apply this standard—it remarkably expands its
reach. For the first time in its history, the Court declares
an entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital
sentence using the categorical approach it previously
reserved for death penalty cases alone.
B
Until today, the Court has based its categorical propor
tionality rulings on the notion that the Constitution gives
special protection to capital defendants because the death
penalty is a uniquely severe punishment that must be
reserved for only those who are “most deserving of execu
tion.” Atkins, supra, at 319; see Roper, supra, at 568;
Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982); Lockett v.
Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978).
Of course, the Eighth
Amendment itself makes no distinction between capital
and noncapital sentencing, but the “ ‘bright line’ ” the
Court drew between the two penalties has for many years
served as the principal justification for the Court’s will
ingness to reject democratic choices regarding the death
penalty. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 275 (1980).
Today’s decision eviscerates that distinction. “Death is
different” no longer. The Court now claims not only the
power categorically to reserve the “most severe punish
ment” for those the Court thinks are “ ‘the most deserving
of execution,’ ” Roper, 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins,
536 U. S., at 319), but also to declare that “less culpable”
persons are categorically exempt from the “second most
severe penalty.” Ante, at 21 (emphasis added). No reli
able limiting principle remains to prevent the Court from
immunizing any class of offenders from the law’s third,
fourth, fifth, or fiftieth most severe penalties as well.
The Court’s departure from the “death is different”
distinction is especially mystifying when one considers
how long it has resisted crossing that divide. Indeed, for a
time the Court declined to apply proportionality principles
