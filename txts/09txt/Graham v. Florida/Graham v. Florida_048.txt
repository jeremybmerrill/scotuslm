ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment

A
I begin with the threshold inquiry comparing the gravity
of Graham’s conduct to the harshness of his penalty.
There is no question that the crime for which Graham
received his life sentence—armed burglary of a nondomicil
with an assault or battery—is “a serious crime deserving
serious punishment.” Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782,
797 (1982). So too is the home invasion robbery that was
the basis of Graham’s probation violation. But these
crimes are certainly less serious than other crimes, such
as murder or rape.
As for Graham’s degree of personal culpability, he com
mitted the relevant offenses when he was a juvenile—a
stage at which, Roper emphasized, one’s “culpability or
blameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree, by
reason of youth and immaturity.” 543 U. S., at 571. Gra
ham’s age places him in a significantly different category
from the defendants in Rummel, Harmelin, and Ewing, all
of whom committed their crimes as adults. Graham’s
youth made him relatively more likely to engage in reck
less and dangerous criminal activity than an adult; it also
likely enhanced his susceptibility to peer pressure. See,
e.g., Roper, supra, at 569; Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350,
367 (1993); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115–117
(1982). There is no reason to believe that Graham should
be denied the general presumption of diminished culpabil
ity that Roper indicates should apply to juvenile offenders.
If anything, Graham’s in-court statements—including his
request for a second chance so that he could “do whatever
it takes to get to the NFL”—underscore his immaturity.
App. 380.
The fact that Graham committed the crimes that he did
proves that he was dangerous and deserved to be pun
ished. But it does not establish that he was particularly
dangerous—at least relative to the murderers and rapists
for whom the sentence of life without parole is typically
