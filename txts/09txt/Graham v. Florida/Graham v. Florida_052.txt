ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment

know that beating and raping an 8-year-old girl and leav
ing her to die under 197 pounds of rocks is horribly wrong.
The single fact of being 17 years old would not afford
Cunningham protection against life without parole if the
young girl had died—as Cunningham surely expected she
would—so why should it do so when she miraculously
survived his barbaric brutality?
The Court defends its categorical approach on the
grounds that a “clear line is necessary to prevent the
possibility that life without parole sentences will be im
posed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not
sufficiently culpable to merit that punishment.” Ante, at
24. It argues that a case-by-case approach to proportional
ity review is constitutionally insufficient because courts
might not be able “with sufficient accuracy [to] distinguish
the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that
have the capacity for change.” Ante, at 27.
The Court is of course correct that judges will never
have perfect foresight—or perfect wisdom—in making
sentencing decisions. But this is true when they sentence
adults no less than when they sentence juveniles. It is
also true when they sentence juveniles who commit mur
der no less than when they sentence juveniles who commit
other crimes.
Our system depends upon sentencing judges applying
their reasoned judgment to each case that comes before
them. As we explained in Solem, the whole enterprise of
proportionality review is premised on the “justified” as
sumption that “courts are competent to judge the gravity
of an offense, at least on a relative scale.” 463 U. S., at
292. Indeed, “courts traditionally have made these judg
ments” by applying “generally accepted criteria” to analyze
“the harm caused or threatened to the victim or society,
and the culpability of the offender.” Id., at 292, 294.
