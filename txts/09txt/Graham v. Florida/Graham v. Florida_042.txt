TERRANCE JAMAR GRAHAM, PETITIONER v.

FLORIDA 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL
OF FLORIDA, FIRST DISTRICT
[May 17, 2010]

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that Terrance Graham’s sentence
of life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment’s
prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishments.” Unlike
the majority, however, I see no need to invent a new con
stitutional rule of dubious provenance in reaching that
conclusion. Instead, my analysis is based on an applica
tion of this Court’s precedents, in particular (1) our cases
requiring “narrow proportionality” review of noncapital
sentences and (2) our conclusion in Roper v. Simmons, 543
U. S. 551 (2005), that juvenile offenders are generally less
culpable than adults who commit the same crimes.
These cases expressly allow courts addressing allega
tions that a noncapital sentence violates the Eighth
Amendment to consider the particular defendant and
particular crime at issue. The standards for relief under
these precedents are rigorous, and should be. But here
Graham’s juvenile status—together with the nature of his
criminal conduct and the extraordinarily severe punish
ment imposed—lead me to conclude that his sentence of
life without parole is unconstitutional.
I
Our Court has struggled with whether and how to apply
the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to sentences
