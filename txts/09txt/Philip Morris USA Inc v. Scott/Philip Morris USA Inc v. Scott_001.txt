PHILIP MORRIS USA INC. ET AL. v. GLORIA 

SCOTT ET AL. 

ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
[September 24, 2010]

JUSTICE SCALIA, Circuit Justice.
Respondents brought this class action against several
tobacco companies on behalf of all Louisiana smokers.
The suit alleged that the companies defrauded the plain
tiff class by “distort[ing] the entire body of public knowl
edge” about the addictive effects of nicotine. Scott v.
American Tobacco Co., 2004–2095, p. 14. (La. App. 2/7/07)
949 So. 2d 1266, 1277. The Fourth Circuit Court of Ap
peal of Louisiana granted relief on that theory, and en
tered a judgment requiring applicants to pay $241,540,488
(plus accumulated interest of about $29 million) to fund a
10-year smoking cessation program for the benefit of the
members of the plaintiff class. Scott v. American Tobacco
Co., 2009–0461, p. 21–23 (5/5/10) 36 So. 3d 1046, 1059–
1060. (Still to be determined are the allowable attorney’s
fees, which will likely be requested in the tens of millions
of dollars.) The Supreme Court of Louisiana declined
review.
Scott v. American Tobacco Co., 2010–1361
(9/3/10), ___ So. 3d ___. The applicants have asked me, in
my capacity as Circuit Justice for the Fifth Circuit, to stay
the judgment until this Court can act on their intended
petition for a writ of certiorari.
