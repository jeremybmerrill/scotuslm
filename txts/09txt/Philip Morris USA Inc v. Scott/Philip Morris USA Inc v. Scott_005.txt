Opinion in Chambers

when ‘a decided balance of convenience’ ” weighs against
it. Barnes, supra, at 1304–1305 (SCALIA, J., in chambers)
(quoting Magnum Import Co. v. Coty, 262 U. S. 159, 164
(1923)). Here, however, the equities favor granting the
application. Refusing a stay may visit an irreversible
harm on applicants, but granting it will apparently do no
permanent injury to respondents. Applicants allege that
similar smoking-cessation measures are freely and readily
available from other sources in Louisiana, and respon
dents have not disputed that. Under those circumstances,
the equitable balance favors issuance of the stay.
The application for a stay of the execution of the judg
ment of the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Fourth Circuit,
is granted pending applicants’ timely filing, and this
Court’s disposition, of a petition for a writ of certiorari.
It is so ordered.
