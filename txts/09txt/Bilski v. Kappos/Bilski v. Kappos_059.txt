STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

Thus, although it is for Congress to “implement the
stated purpose of the Framers by selecting the policy
which in its judgment best effectuates the constitutional
aim,” Graham, 383 U. S., at 6, we interpret ambiguous
patent laws as a set of rules that “wee[d] out those inven
tions which would not be disclosed or devised but for the
inducement of a patent,” id., at 11, and that “embod[y]”
the “careful balance between the need to promote innova
tion and the recognition that imitation and refinement
through imitation are both necessary to invention itself
and the very lifeblood of a competitive economy,” Bonito
Boats, 489 U. S., at 146. And absent a discernible signal
from Congress, we proceed cautiously when dealing with
patents that press on the limits of the “ ‘standard written
into the constitution,’ ” Graham, 383 U. S., at 6, for at the
“fringes of congressional power,” “more is required of
legislatures than a vague delegation to be filled in later,”
Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U. S. 109, 139–140 (1959)
(Black, J., dissenting); see also Greene v. McElroy, 360
U. S. 474, 507 (1959) (“[D]ecisions of great constitutional
import and effect” “requir[e] careful and purposeful con
sideration by those responsible for enacting and imple
menting our laws”). We should not casually risk exceeding
the constitutional limitation on Congress’ behalf.
The Court has kept this “constitutional standard” in
mind when deciding what is patentable subject matter
under §101. For example, we have held that no one can
patent “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract
ideas.” Diehr, 450 U. S., at 185. These “are the basic tools
of scientific and technological work,” Benson, 409 U. S., at
67, and therefore, if patented, would stifle the very pro
gress that Congress is authorized to promote, see, e.g.,
O’Reilly, 15 How., at 113 (explaining that Morse’s patent
on electromagnetism for writing would preempt a wide

technology”).
