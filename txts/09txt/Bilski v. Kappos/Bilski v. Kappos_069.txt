BILSKI v. KAPPOS
BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

with both the opinion of the Court and JUSTICE STEVENS’
opinion concurring in the judgment:
First, although the text of §101 is broad, it is not with
out limit. See ante, at 4–5 (opinion of the Court); ante, at
10 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). “[T]he underly
ing policy of the patent system [is] that ‘the things which
are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive
patent,’ . . . must outweigh the restrictive effect of the
limited patent monopoly.” Graham v. John Deere Co. of
Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 10–11 (1966) (quoting Letter
from Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13,
1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washing
ton ed.)). The Court has thus been careful in interpreting
the Patent Act to “determine not only what is protected,
but also what is free for all to use.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v.
Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 151 (1989). In
particular, the Court has long held that “[p]henomena of
nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and
abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable” under
§101, since allowing individuals to patent these funda
mental principles would “wholly pre-empt” the public’s
access to the “basic tools of scientific and technological
work.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67, 72 (1972);
see also, e.g., Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981);
Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980).
Second, in a series of cases that extend back over a
century, the Court has stated that “[t]ransformation and
reduction of an article to a different state or thing is the
clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not
include particular machines.” Diehr, supra, at 184 (em
phasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also,
e.g., Benson, supra, at 70; Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584,
588, n. 9 (1978); Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788
(1877). Application of this test, the so-called “machine-or
transformation test,” has thus repeatedly helped the Court
to determine what is “a patentable ‘process.’ ” Flook, supra,
