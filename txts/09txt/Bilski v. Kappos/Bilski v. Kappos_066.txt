BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

speculative schemers who make it their business to watch
the advancing wave of improvement, and gather its foam
in the form of patented monopolies, which enable them to
lay a heavy tax upon the industry of the country, without
contributing anything to the real advancement of the
arts.” Atlantic Works, 107 U. S., at 200. Yet business
method patents may have begun to do exactly that. See
eBay Inc., 547 U. S., at 396–397 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).
These many costs of business method patents not only
may stifle innovation, but they are also likely to “stifle
competition,” Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146. Even if a
business method patent is ultimately held invalid, patent
holders may be able to use it to threaten litigation and to
bully competitors, especially those that cannot bear the
costs of a drawn out, fact-intensive patent litigation.57
That can take a particular toll on small and upstart busi
nesses.58 Of course, patents always serve as a barrier to
competition for the type of subject matter that is patented.
But patents on business methods are patents on business
itself. Therefore, unlike virtually every other category of
patents, they are by their very nature likely to depress the
dynamism of the marketplace.59

59 Congress and the courts have worked long and hard to create and
administer antitrust laws that ensure businesses cannot prevent each
other from competing vigorously. If methods of conducting business
were themselves patentable, then virtually any novel, nonobvious
business method could be granted a federally protected monopoly. The
tension this might create with our antitrust regime provides yet an
other reason for skepticism that Congress would have wanted the
patent laws to extend to business methods.
