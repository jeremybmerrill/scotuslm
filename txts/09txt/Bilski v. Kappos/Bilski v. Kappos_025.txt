cial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368 (1998) (State Street), and
AT&T Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc., 172 F. 3d

The en banc Court of Appeals affirmed the Board’s
decision. Eleven of the twelve judges agreed that petition
ers’ claims do not describe a patentable “process,” §101.
Chief Judge Michel’s opinion, joined by eight other judges,
rejected several possible tests for what is a patent-eligible
process, including whether the patent produces a “ ‘useful,
concrete and tangible result,’ ” whether the process relates
to “technological arts,” and “categorical exclusions” for
certain processes such as business methods. In re Bilski,
545 F. 3d 943, 959–960 (2008). Relying on several of our
cases in which we explained how to differentiate a claim
on a “fundamental principle” from a claim on a “process,”
the court concluded that a “claimed process is surely pat
ent-eligible under §101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular
machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular
article into a different state or thing.” Id., at 954–955.
The court further concluded that this “machine-or
transformation test” is “the sole test governing §101
analyses,” id., at 955 (emphasis added), and therefore the
“test for determining patent eligibility of a process under
§101,” id., at 956. Applying that test, the court held that
petitioners’ claim is not a patent-eligible process. Id., at
963–966.
In a separate opinion reaching the same conclusion,
Judge Dyk carefully reviewed the history of American
patent law and English precedents upon which our law is
based, and found that “the unpatentability of processes
not involving manufactures, machines, or compositions of
matter has been firmly embedded . . . since the time of the
Patent Act of 1793.” Id., at 966. Judge Dyk observed,
