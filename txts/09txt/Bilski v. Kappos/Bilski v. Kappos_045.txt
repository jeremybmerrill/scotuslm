(discussing Thomas Jefferson’s observations). It has been
suggested, however, that “[p]erhaps this was in part a
function of an understanding—shared widely among
legislators, courts, patent office officials, and inventors—
about what patents were meant to protect. Everyone
knew that manufactures and machines were at the core of
the patent system.” Merges, Property Rights for Business
Concepts and Patent System Reform, 14 Berkeley Tech.
L. J. 577, 585 (1999) (hereinafter Merges). Thus, although
certain processes, such as those related to the technology
of the time, might have been considered patentable, it is
possible that “[a]gainst this background, it would have
been seen as absurd for an entrepreneur to file a patent”
on methods of conducting business. Ibid.
Development of American Patent Law
During the first years of the patent system, no patents

(1877), in which we held that “a process may be patentable irrespective
of the particular form of the instrumentalities used,” and therefore one
may patent “an act, or series of acts, performed upon the subject matter
to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.” Id., at 788.
