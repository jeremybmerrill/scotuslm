BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

American Patent Law and Administration, 1789–1836,
p. 109 (1998) (hereinafter Walterscheid, To Promote the
Progress).7 The governing English law, the Statute of
Monopolies, responded to abuses whereby the Crown
would issue letters patent, “granting monopolies to court
favorites in goods or businesses which had long before
been enjoyed by the public.” Graham, 383 U. S., at 5. The
statute generally prohibited the Crown from granting such
exclusive rights, 21 Jam. 1, c. 3, §1 (1623), in 4 Statutes of
the Realm 1213 (reprint 1963), but it contained exceptions
that, inter alia, permitted grants of exclusive rights to the
“working or making of any manner of new Manufacture.”
§6.
Pursuant to that provision, patents issued for the
“mode, method, or way of manufacturing,” F. Campin, Law
of Patents for Inventions 11 (1869) (emphasis deleted),
and English courts construed the phrase “working or
making of any manner of new manufactures” to encom
pass manufacturing processes, see, e.g., Boulton v. Bull, 2
H. Bl. 463, 471, 492, 126 Eng. Rep. 651, 655, 666 (C. P.
1795) (holding that the term “manufacture” “applied not
only to things made, but to the practice of making, to
principles carried into practice in a new manner, to new
results of principles carried into practice”). Thus, English
courts upheld James Watt’s famous patent on a method
for reducing the consumption of fuel in steam engines,8 as
