BILSKI v. KAPPOS
Syllabus

545 F. 3d 943, affirmed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to
Parts II–B–2 and II–C–2, concluding that petitioners’ claimed inven
tion is not patent eligible. Pp. 4–8, 10–11, 12–16.
(a) Section 101 specifies four independent categories of inventions
or discoveries that are patent eligible: “process[es],” “machin[es],”
“manufactur[es],” and “composition[s] of matter.” “In choosing such
expansive terms, . . . Congress plainly contemplated that the patent
laws would be given wide scope,” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.
303, 308, in order to ensure that “ ‘ingenuity should receive a liberal
encouragement,’ ” id., at 308–309. This Court’s precedents provide
three specific exceptions to §101’s broad principles: “laws of nature,
physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.” Id., at 309. While not re
quired by the statutory text, these exceptions are consistent with the
notion that a patentable process must be “new and useful.” And, in
any case, the exceptions have defined the statute’s reach as a matter
of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years. See Le Roy v.
Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174. The §101 eligibility inquiry is only a
threshold test. Even if a claimed invention qualifies in one of the
four categories, it must also satisfy “the conditions and requirements
of this title,” §101(a), including novelty, see §102, nonobviousness, see
§103, and a full and particular description, see §112. The invention
at issue is claimed to be a “process,” which §100(b) defines as a “proc
ess, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, ma
chine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.” Pp. 4–5.
(b) The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for pat
ent eligibility under §101. The Court’s precedents establish that al
though that test may be a useful and important clue or investigative
tool, it is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a pat
ent-eligible “process” under §101. In holding to the contrary, the
Federal Circuit violated two principles of statutory interpretation:
Courts “ ‘should not read into the patent laws limitations and condi
tions which the legislature has not expressed,’ ” Diamond v. Diehr,
450 U. S. 175, 182, and, “[u]nless otherwise defined, ‘words will be in
terpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common mean
ing,’ ” ibid. The Court is unaware of any ordinary, contemporary,
common meaning of “process” that would require it to be tied to a
machine or the transformation of an article. Respondent Patent Di
rector urges the Court to read §101’s other three patentable catego
ries as confining “process” to a machine or transformation. However,
the doctrine of noscitur a sociis is inapplicable here, for §100(b) al
ready explicitly defines “process,” see Burgess v. United States, 553
U. S. 124, 130, and nothing about the section’s inclusion of those
other categories suggests that a “process” must be tied to one of them.
