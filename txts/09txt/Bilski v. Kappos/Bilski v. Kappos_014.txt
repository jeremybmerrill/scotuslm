BILSKI v. KAPPOS
Opinion of the Court

tion, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned
technologies from the Information Age should or should
not receive patent protection. This Age puts the possibil
ity of innovation in the hands of more people and raises
new difficulties for the patent law. With ever more people
trying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for
their inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in
striking the balance between protecting inventors and not
granting monopolies over procedures that others would
discover by independent, creative application of general
principles. Nothing in this opinion should be read to take
a position on where that balance ought to be struck.

Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention
that the term “process” categorically excludes business
methods. The term “method,” which is within §100(b)’s
definition of “process,” at least as a textual matter and
before consulting other limitations in the Patent Act and
this Court’s precedents, may include at least some meth
ods of doing business. See, e.g., Webster’s New Interna
tional Dictionary 1548 (2d ed. 1954) (defining “method” as
“[a]n orderly procedure or process . . . regular way or
manner of doing anything; hence, a set form of procedure
adopted in investigation or instruction”). The Court is
unaware of any argument that the “ ‘ordinary, contempo
rary, common meaning,’ ” Diehr, supra, at 182, of “method”
excludes business methods. Nor is it clear how far a pro
hibition on business method patents would reach, and
whether it would exclude technologies for conducting a
business more efficiently. See, e.g., Hall, Business and
Financial Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy, 56
Scottish J. Pol. Econ. 443, 445 (2009) (“There is no precise
definition of . . . business method patents”).
