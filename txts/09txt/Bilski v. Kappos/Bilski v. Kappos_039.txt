Great Britain saw innovations in business organization,17
business models,18 management techniques,19 and novel
solutions to the challenges of operating global firms in
which subordinate managers could be reached only by a
long sea voyage.20 Few if any of these methods of conduct
ing business were patented.21

the United States in the brief period between independence and the
creation of our Constitution—despite the fact that it was a time of great
business innovation, including new processes for engaging in risky
trade and transport, one of which has been called “the quintessential
business innovation of the 1780s.” T. Doerflinger, A Vigorous Spirit of
