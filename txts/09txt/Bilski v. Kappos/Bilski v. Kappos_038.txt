the “prevail[ing]” “principles and practice” in England on
which our patent law was based, Pennock v. Dialogue, 2
Pet. 1, 18 (1829). Such patents were exceedingly rare, and
some of them probably were viewed not as inventions or
discoveries but rather as special state privileges13 that
until the mid-1800’s were recorded alongside inventions in
the patent records, see MacLeod 1–2 (explaining that
various types of patents were listed together). It appears
that the only English patent of the time that can fairly be
described as a business method patent was one issued in
1778 on a “Plan for assurances on lives of persons from 10
to 80 years of Age.” Woodcroft 324.14 And “[t]here is no
indication” that this patent “was ever enforced or its valid
ity tested,” 545 F. 3d, at 974 (Dyk, J., concurring); the
patent may thus have represented little more than the
whim—or error—of a single patent clerk.15
In any event, these patents (or patent) were probably
not known to the Framers of early patent law. In an era
before computerized databases, organized case law, and
treatises,16 the American drafters probably would have

15 “The English patent system” at that time “was one of simple regis
tration. Extensive scrutiny was not expected of the law officers admin
istering it.” MacLeod 41. Thus, as one scholar suggested of the patent
on life insurance, “perhaps the Law Officer was in a very good humour
that day, or perhaps he had forgotten the wording of the statute; most
likely he was concerned only with the promised ‘very considerable
Consumption of [Revenue] Stamps’ which [the patent holder] declared,
would ‘contribute to the increase of the Public Revenues.’ ” Renn 285.
