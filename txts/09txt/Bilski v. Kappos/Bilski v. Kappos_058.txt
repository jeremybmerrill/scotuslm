BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

that the 1999 Congress would never have enacted §273 if
it had foreseen that this Court would rely on the provision
as a basis for concluding that business methods are pat
entable. Section 273 is a red herring; we should be focus
ing our attention on §101 itself.
VI
The constitutionally mandated purpose and function of
the patent laws bolster the conclusion that methods of
doing business are not “processes” under §101.
The Constitution allows Congress to issue patents “[t]o
promote the Progress of . . . useful Arts,” Art. I, §8, cl. 8.
This clause “is both a grant of power and a limitation.”
Graham, 383 U. S., at 5. It “reflects a balance between the
need to encourage innovation and the avoidance of mo
nopolies which stifle competition without any concomitant
advance in the ‘Progress of Science and useful Arts.’ ”
Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146. “This is the standard
expressed in the Constitution and it may not be ignored.
And it is in this light that patent validity ‘requires refer
ence to [the] standard written into the Constitution.’ ”
Graham, 383 U. S., at 6 (quoting Great Atlantic & Pacific
Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U. S. 147,
154 (1950) (Douglas, J., concurring) (emphasis deleted));

(explaining that patent “laws which are passed to give
effect to this [constitutional] purpose ought, we think, to
be construed in the spirit in which they have been
made”).44
