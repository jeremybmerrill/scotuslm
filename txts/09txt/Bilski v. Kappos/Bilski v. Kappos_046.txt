BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

should be patentable.32 Id., at 9. He drafted the 1793 Act,
id., at 7, and, years later, explained that in that Act “ ‘the
whole was turned over to the judiciary, to be matured into
a system, under which every one might know when his
actions were safe and lawful,’ ” id., at 10 (quoting Letter to
Issac McPherson, in VI Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181–
182 (H. Washington ed. 1861)). As the Court has ex
plained, “Congress agreed with Jefferson . . . that the
courts should develop additional conditions for patentabil
ity.” Graham, 383 U. S., at 10. Thus “[a]lthough the
Patent Act was amended, revised or codified some 50
times between 1790 and 1950, Congress steered clear” of
adding statutory requirements of patentability. Ibid. For
nearly 160 years, Congress retained the term “useful arts,”
see, e.g., Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117, leaving
“wide latitude for judicial construction . . . to keep pace
with industrial development,” Berman, Method Claims, 17
J. Pat. Off. Soc. 713, 714 (1935) (hereinafter Berman).
Although courts occasionally struggled with defining
what was a patentable “art” during those 160 years, they
consistently rejected patents on methods of doing busi
ness. The rationales for those decisions sometimes varied.
But there was an overarching theme, at least in dicta:
Business methods are not patentable arts. See, e.g.,
United States Credit Sys. Co. v. American Credit Indem.
Co., 53 F. 818, 819 (CC NY 1893) (“method of insuring
against loss by bad debts” could not be patented “as an
art”); Hotel Security Checking Co. v. Lorraine Co., 160 F.
467, 469 (CA2 1908) (“A system of transacting business

skeptic of patents, Jefferson described this as “drawing a line
between things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of a
patent, and those which are not.” 13 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 335
(Memorial ed. 1904).
