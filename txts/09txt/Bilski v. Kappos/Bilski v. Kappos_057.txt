STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

applied to different statutes.42 The 1999 Act was passed to
limit the impact of the Federal Circuit’s then-recent state
ments on the 1952 Act. Although repudiating that judicial
dictum (as we should) might effectively render the 1999
Act a nullity going forward, such a holding would not
mean that it was a nullity when Congress enacted it.
Section 273 may have been a technically unnecessary
response to confusion about patentable subject matter, but
it appeared necessary in 1999 in light of what was being
discussed in legal circles at the time.43 Consider the logi
cal implications of the Court’s approach to this question:
If, tomorrow, Congress were to conclude that patents on
business methods are so important that the special in
fringement defense in §273 ought to be abolished, and
thus repealed that provision, this could paradoxically
strengthen the case against such patents because there
would no longer be a §273 that “acknowledges . . . business
method patents,” ante, at 11. That is not a sound method
of statutory interpretation.
In light of its history and purpose, I think it obvious
——————
42 The

Court opines that “[t]his principle, of course, applies to inter
preting any two provisions in the U. S. Code, even when Congress
enacted the provisions at different times.” Ante, at 11 (emphasis
added). The only support the Court offers for this proposition is a 1937
opinion for three Justices, in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Or
ganization, 307 U. S. 496, 528–530 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.). But
that opinion is inapposite. Although Justice Stone stated that two
provisions “must be read together,” id., at 530, he did so to explain that
an ambiguity in a later-in-time statute must be understood in light of
the earlier-in-time framework against which the ambiguous statute
was passed, id., at 528–530, particularly because the later statute
explicitly stated that it “shall not be construed to apply” to the provi
sion created by an earlier Act, id., at 528.
43 I am not trying to “overcome” an “established rule of statutory in
terpretation” with “judicial speculation as to the subjective intent of
various legislators,” ante, at 11, but, rather, I am explaining why the
Court has illogically expanded the canon upon which it relies beyond
that canon’s logical underpinnings.
