Opinion of ENNEDY, J.
Opinion of Kthe Court

outside of §101’s scope is further undermined by the fact
that federal law explicitly contemplates the existence of at
least some business method patents. Under 35 U. S. C.
§273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on
“a method in [a] patent,” the alleged infringer can assert a
defense of prior use. For purposes of this defense alone,
“method” is defined as “a method of doing or conducting
business.” §273(a)(3). In other words, by allowing this
defense the statute itself acknowledges that there may be
business method patents. Section 273’s definition of
“method,” to be sure, cannot change the meaning of a
prior-enacted statute. But what §273 does is clarify the
understanding that a business method is simply one kind
of “method” that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible
for patenting under §101.
A conclusion that business methods are not patentable
in any circumstances would render §273 meaningless.
This would violate the canon against interpreting any
statutory provision in a manner that would render an
other provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,
556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9). This principle, of
course, applies to interpreting any two provisions in the
U. S. Code, even when Congress enacted the provisions at
different times. See, e.g., Hague v. Committee for Indus
trial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 529–530 (1939) (opinion
of Stone, J.). This established rule of statutory interpreta
tion cannot be overcome by judicial speculation as to the
subjective intent of various legislators in enacting the
subsequent provision. Finally, while §273 appears to
leave open the possibility of some business method pat
ents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such
claimed inventions.
