BILSKI v. KAPPOS
Syllabus
15.
(e) Because petitioners’ patent application can be rejected under
the Court’s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas, the
Court need not define further what constitutes a patentable “proc
ess,” beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in
§100(b) and looking to the guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.
Nothing in today’s opinion should be read as endorsing the Federal
Circuit’s past interpretations of §101. See, e.g., State Street, 49 F. 3d,
at 1373. The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the
machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case
law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting
business method patents. In disapproving an exclusive machine-or
transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the
Federal Circuit’s development of other limiting criteria that further
the Patent Act’s purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.
