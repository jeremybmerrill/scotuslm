court’s approach. Id., at 966–976.
Three judges wrote dissenting opinions. Judge Mayer
argued that petitioners’ application was “not eligible for
patent protection because it is directed to a method of
conducting business.” Id., at 998. He urged the adoption

were an unpatentable abstract idea. Id., at 1011. Only
Judge Newman disagreed with the court’s conclusion that
petitioners’ application was outside of the reach of §101.

granted but only that the issue should be remanded for
further proceedings to determine whether the application
qualified as patentable under other provisions. Id., at 997.
This Court granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).

that the patent laws would be given wide scope.” Dia
