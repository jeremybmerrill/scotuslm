BERNARD L. BILSKI AND RAND A. WARSAW, 

PETITIONERS v. DAVID J. KAPPOS, UNDER 

SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTEL- 

LECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, 

PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[June 28, 2010]


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court,
except as to Parts II–B–2 and II–C–2.*
The question in this case turns on whether a patent can
be issued for a claimed invention designed for the business
world. The patent application claims a procedure for
instructing buyers and sellers how to protect against the
risk of price fluctuations in a discrete section of the econ
omy. Three arguments are advanced for the proposition
that the claimed invention is outside the scope of patent
law: (1) it is not tied to a machine and does not transform
an article; (2) it involves a method of conducting business;
and (3) it is merely an abstract idea. The Court of Appeals
ruled that the first mentioned of these, the so-called ma
chine-or-transformation test, was the sole test to be used
for determining the patentability of a “process” under the
Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. §101.
