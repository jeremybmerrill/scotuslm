The patent examiner rejected petitioners’ application,
explaining that it “ ‘is not implemented on a specific appa
ratus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and
solves a purely mathematical problem without any limita
tion to a practical application, therefore, the invention is
not directed to the technological arts.’ ” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 148a. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interfer

and was directed to an abstract idea. Id., at 181a–186a.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit heard the case en banc and affirmed. The case

this “machine-or-transformation test” is “the sole test
governing §101 analyses,” id., at 955, and thus the “test
for determining patent eligibility of a process under §101,”
id., at 956. Applying the machine-or-transformation test,
the court held that petitioners’ application was not patent
