BILSKI v. KAPPOS
Opinion of the Court

B
1
Under the Court of Appeals’ formulation, an invention is
a “process” only if: “(1) it is tied to a particular machine or
apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a
different state or thing.” 545 F. 3d, at 954. This Court
has “more than once cautioned that courts ‘should not read
into the patent laws limitations and conditions which the
legislature has not expressed.’ ” Diamond v. Diehr, 450
U. S. 175, 182 (1981) (quoting Chakrabarty, supra, at 308;
some internal quotation marks omitted). In patent law, as
in all statutory construction, “[u]nless otherwise defined,
‘words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, con
temporary, common meaning.’ ” Diehr, supra, at 182
(quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979)).
The Court has read the §101 term “manufacture” in accor
dance with dictionary definitions, see Chakrabarty, supra,
at 308 (citing American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co.,
283 U. S. 1, 11 (1931)), and approved a construction of the
term “composition of matter” consistent with common
usage, see Chakrabarty, supra, at 308 (citing Shell Devel
opment Co. v. Watson, 149 F. Supp. 279, 280 (DC 1957)).
Any suggestion in this Court’s case law that the Patent
Act’s terms deviate from their ordinary meaning has only
been an explanation for the exceptions for laws of nature,
physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. See Parker v.
Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 588–589 (1978). This Court has not
indicated that the existence of these well-established
exceptions gives the Judiciary carte blanche to impose
other limitations that are inconsistent with the text and
the statute’s purpose and design. Concerns about at
tempts to call any form of human activity a “process” can
be met by making sure the claim meets the requirements
of §101.
