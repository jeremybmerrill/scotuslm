BILSKI v. KAPPOS
BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

“method of training janitors to dust and vacuum using
video displays,” a “system for toilet reservations,” and a
“method of using color-coded bracelets to designate dating
status in order to limit ‘the embarrassment of rejection’ ”);
see also Brief for Respondent 40–41, and n. 20 (listing
dubious patents). To the extent that the Federal Circuit’s
decision in this case rejected that approach, nothing in
today’s decision should be taken as disapproving of that
determination. See ante, at 16; ante, at 2, n. 1 (STEVENS,
J., concurring in judgment).
In sum, it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the
“machine-or-transformation” test is not necessarily the
sole test of patentability, the Court intends neither to de
emphasize the test’s usefulness nor to suggest that many
patentable processes lie beyond its reach.
III
With these observations, I concur in the Court’s
judgment.
