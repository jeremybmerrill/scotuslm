BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

(1999).41 The fact that Congress decided it was appropri
ate to create a new defense to claims that business method
patents were being infringed merely demonstrates recog
nition that such claims could create a significant new
problem for the business community.
The Court nonetheless states that the 1999 Act “ac
knowledges that there may be business method patents,”
thereby “clarify[ing]” its “understanding” of §101. Ante, at
11. More specifically, the Court worries that if we were to
interpret the 1952 Act to exclude business methods, our
interpretation “would render §273 meaningless.” Ibid. I
agree that “[a] statute should be construed so that effect is
given to all its provisions.” Corley v. United States, 556
U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation
marks omitted). But it is a different matter altogether
when the Court construes one statute, the 1952 Act, to
give effect to a different statute, the 1999 Act. The canon
on which the Court relies is predicated upon the idea that
“[a] statute is passed as a whole.” 2A N. Singer & J.
Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction §46:5, p. 189
(7th ed. 2007). But the two statutes in question were not
passed as a whole.
Put another way, we ordinarily assume, quite sensibly,
that Congress would not in one statute include two provi
sions that are at odds with each other. But as this case
shows, that sensible reasoning can break down when
