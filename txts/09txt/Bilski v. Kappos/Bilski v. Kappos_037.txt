well as a variety of patents issued for methods of synthe
sizing substances or building mechanical devices.9
Although it is difficult to derive a precise understanding
of what sorts of methods were patentable under English
law, there is no basis in the text of the Statute of Monopo
lies, nor in pre-1790 English precedent, to infer that busi
ness methods could qualify.10 There was some debate
throughout the relevant time period about what processes
could be patented. But it does not appear that anyone
seriously believed that one could patent “a method for
organizing human activity.” 545 F. 3d, at 970 (Dyk, J.,

There were a small number of patents issued between

10 Some English cases made reference to the permissibility of patents
over new “trades.” But so far as I can tell, the term “trade” referred not

and using physical items or to the object of the trade. See, e.g., Cloth
workers of Ipswich Case, 78 Eng. Rep. 147, 148 (K. B. 1603) (“[I]f a
man hath brought in a new invention and a new trade within the
kingdom . . . [the King] may grant by charter unto him”).
