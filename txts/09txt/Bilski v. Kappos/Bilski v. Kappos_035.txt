STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment 


IV 

Because the text of §101 does not on its face convey the
scope of patentable processes, it is necessary, in my view,
to review the history of our patent law in some detail.
This approach yields a much more straightforward answer
to this case than the Court’s. As I read the history, it
strongly supports the conclusion that a method of doing
business is not a “process” under §101.
I am, of course, mindful of the fact that §101 “is a dy
namic provision designed to encompass new and unfore
seen inventions,” and that one must therefore view his
torical conceptions of patent-eligible subject matter at an
appropriately high level of generality. J. E. M. Ag Supply,
534 U. S., at 135; see also Chakrabarty, 447 U. S., at 315–
316. But it is nonetheless significant that while people
have long innovated in fields of business, methods of doing
business fall outside of the subject matter that has “his
torically been eligible to receive the protection of our
patent laws,” Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184, and likely go beyond
what the modern patent “statute was enacted to protect,”
Flook, 437 U. S., at 593. It is also significant that when
Congress enacted the latest Patent Act, it did so against
the background of a well-settled understanding that a
series of steps for conducting business cannot be patented.
These considerations ought to guide our analysis. As
Justice Holmes noted long ago, sometimes, “a page of
history is worth a volume of logic.” New York Trust Co. v.
Eisner, 256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921).
English Backdrop
The Constitution’s Patent Clause was written against
the “backdrop” of English patent practices, Graham v.
John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 5 (1966), and
early American patent law was “largely based on and
incorporated” features of the English patent system, E.
