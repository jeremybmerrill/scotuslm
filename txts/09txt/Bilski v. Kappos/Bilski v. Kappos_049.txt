1952, when Congress updated the patent laws as part of
its ongoing project to revise the United States Code, it
changed the operative language in §101, replacing the
term “art” with “process” and adding a definition of “proc
ess” as a “process, art or method,” §100(b).
That change was made for clarity and did not alter the
scope of a patentable “process.” See Diehr, 450 U. S., at
184. The new terminology was added only in recognition
of the fact that courts had been interpreting the category
“art” by using the terms “process or method”; Congress
thus wanted to avoid “the necessity of explanation that the
word ‘art’ as used in this place means ‘process or method.’ ”

interpreted by the courts as being practically synonymous
with process or method,” and that the switch to the word
“[p]rocess” was intended only for clarity).37
It appears that when Congress changed the language in
§101 to incorporate the prevailing judicial terminology, it
merely codified the prevailing judicial interpretation of
that category of subject matter. See Diehr, 450 U. S., at
184; see also Barber v. Gonzales, 347 U. S. 637, 641 (1954)
(“While it is true that statutory language should be inter
preted whenever possible according to common usage,
some terms acquire a special technical meaning by a
process of judicial construction”). Both the Senate and
House Committee Reports explained that the word “proc

word ‘art’ was changed to ‘process’ in order to clarify its meaning. No
change in substance was intended”).
