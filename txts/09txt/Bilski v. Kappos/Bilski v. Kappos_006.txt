BILSKI v. KAPPOS
Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioners’ application seeks patent protection for a
claimed invention that explains how buyers and sellers of
commodities in the energy market can protect, or hedge,
against the risk of price changes. The key claims are
claims 1 and 4. Claim 1 describes a series of steps in
structing how to hedge risk. Claim 4 puts the concept
articulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.
Claim 1 consists of the following steps:
“(a) initiating a series of transactions between said
commodity provider and consumers of said commodity
wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a
fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed
rate corresponding to a risk position of said consum

“(b) identifying market participants for said com

“(c) initiating a series of transactions between said
commodity provider and said market participants at a
second fixed rate such that said series of market par
ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said
series of consumer transactions.” App. 19–20.
The remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be
applied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to mini
mize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de
mand for energy. For example, claim 2 claims “[t]he
method of claim 1 wherein said commodity is energy and
said market participants are transmission distributors.”
Id., at 20. Some of these claims also suggest familiar
statistical approaches to determine the inputs to use in
claim 4’s equation. For example, claim 7 advises using
well-known random analysis techniques to determine how
much a seller will gain “from each transaction under each
