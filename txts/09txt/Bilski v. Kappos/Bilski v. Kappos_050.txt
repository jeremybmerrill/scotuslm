BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

ess” was used in §101 “to clarify the present law as to the
patentability of certain types of processes or methods as to
which some insubstantial doubts have been expressed.”
S. Rep. 1979, at 5; accord, H. Rep. 1923, at 6. And both
noted that those terms were used to convey the prevailing
meaning of the term “art,” “as interpreted” by courts,
S. Rep. 1979, at 17; accord, H. Rep. 1923, at 17. Indeed,
one of the main drafters of the Act explained that the
definition of the term “process” in §100(b) reflects “how the
courts have construed the term ‘art.’ ” Tr. of address by
Judge Giles S. Rich to the New York Patent Law Associa
tion 7–8 (Nov. 6, 1952).
As discussed above, by this time, courts had consistently
construed the term “art” to exclude methods of doing
business. The 1952 Act likely captured that same mean
ing.38 Cf. Graham, 383 U. S., at 16–17 (reasoning that
because a provision of the 1952 Act “paraphrases language
which has often been used in decisions of the courts” and
was “added to the statute for uniformity and definiteness, ”
that provision should be treated as “a codification of judi
cial precedents”).39 Indeed, Judge Rich, the main drafter

38 The 1952 Act also retained the language “invents or discovers,”
which by that time had taken on a connotation that would tend to
exclude business methods. See B. Evans & C. Evans, A Dictionary of
Contemporary Usage 137 (1957) (explaining that “discover; invent”
means “to make or create something new, especially, in modern usage,
something ingeniously devised to perform mechanical operations”).
39 As explained in Part II, supra, the Court engages in a Jekyll-andHyde form of interpretation with respect to the word “process” in §101.
It rejects the interpretation I proffer because the words “process” and
“method” do not, on their face, distinguish between different series of
acts. Ante, at 10. But it also rejects many sorts of processes without a
textual basis for doing so. See ante, at 4–5, 7, 12–15. And while the
Courts rests a great deal of weight on Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584
(1978), for its analysis of abstract ideas, the Court minimizes Flook’s
rejection of “a purely literal reading of §101,” as well as Flook’s reliance
on the historical backdrop of §101 and our understanding of what “the
statute was enacted to protect,” id., at 588–590, 593; see also Diamond
