BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

Walker on Patents §18, p. 62 (1937).34 Citing many of the
cases listed above, the treatise concluded that a “method of
transacting business” is not an “ ‘art.’ ” Id., §22, at 69; see
also L. Amdur, Patent Law and Practice §39, p. 53 (1935)
(listing “Methods of doing business” as an “Unpatentable
[A]r[t]”); Berman 718 (“[C]ases have been fairly unani
mous in denying patentability to such methods”); Tew,
Method of Doing Business, 16 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 607 (1934)
(“It is probably settled by long practice and many prece
dents that ‘methods of doing business,’ as these words are
generally understood, are unpatentable”). Indeed, “[u]ntil
recently” it was still “considered well established that
[business] methods were non-statutory.” 1 R. Moy, Walker
on Patents §5:28, p. 5–104 (4th ed. 2009).35
Modern American Patent Law
By the mid-1900’s, many courts were construing the
term “art” by using words such as “method, process, sys
tem, or like terms.” Berman 713; see Expanded Metal Co.
v. Bradford, 214 U. S. 366, 382 (1909) (“The word ‘process’
has been brought into the decisions because it is suppos
edly an equivalent form of expression or included in the

34 See also 1 A. Deller, Walker on Patents §26, p. 152 (2d ed. 1964) (A
“ ‘system’ or method of transacting business is not [a process], nor does
it come within any other designation of patentable subject matter”).
35 Although a few patents issued before 1952 that related to methods
of doing business, see United States Patent and Trademark Office,
Automated Financial or Management Data Processing Methods, online
at http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/busmethp/index.html (all Internet
materials as visited June 26, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file), these patents were rare, often issued through self
registration rather than any formalized patent examination, generally
were not upheld by courts, and arguably are distinguishable from pure
patents on business methods insofar as they often involved the manu
facture of new objects. See In re Bilski, 545 F. 3d 943, 974, and n. 18
(CA Fed. 2008) (case below) (Dyk, J., concurring); Pollack 74–75;
