Opinion of the Court

Jefferson 75–76 (H. Washington ed. 1871)).
The Court’s precedents provide three specific exceptions
to §101’s broad patent-eligibility principles: “laws of na
ture, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.” Chakra
barty, supra, at 309. While these exceptions are not re
quired by the statutory text, they are consistent with the
notion that a patentable process must be “new and useful.”
And, in any case, these exceptions have defined the reach
of the statute as a matter of statutory stare decisis going
back 150 years. See Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174–
175 (1853). The concepts covered by these exceptions are
“part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men . . . free to
all men and reserved exclusively to none.” Funk Brothers
Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948).
The §101 patent-eligibility inquiry is only a threshold
test. Even if an invention qualifies as a process, machine,
manufacture, or composition of matter, in order to receive
the Patent Act’s protection the claimed invention must
also satisfy “the conditions and requirements of this title.”
§101. Those requirements include that the invention be
novel, see §102, nonobvious, see §103, and fully and par
ticularly described, see §112.
The present case involves an invention that is claimed
to be a “process” under §101. Section 100(b) defines “proc
ess” as:
“process, art or method, and includes a new use of a
known process, machine, manufacture, composition of
matter, or material.”
The Court first considers two proposed categorical limita
tions on “process” patents under §101 that would, if
adopted, bar petitioners’ application in the present case:
the machine-or-transformation test and the categorical
exclusion of business method patents.
