novel, is not the kind of art protected by the patent acts”);
In re Patton, 127 F. 2d 324, 327–328 (CCPA 1942) (holding
that novel “ ‘interstate and national fire-fighting system’ ”
was not patentable because, inter alia, “a system of trans
acting business, apart from the means for carrying out
such system is not” an art within the meaning of the
patent law, “nor is an abstract idea or theory, regardless of
its importance or . . . ingenuity”); Loew’s Drive-In Thea
tres, Inc. v. Park-In Theatres, Inc., 174 F. 2d 547, 552 (CA1
1949) (“[A] system for the transaction of business, such,
for example, as the cafeteria system for transacting the
restaurant business . . . however novel, useful, or commer
cially successful is not patentable apart from the means
for making the system practically useful, or carrying it
out”); Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Marzall, 180
F. 2d 26, 28 (CADC 1950) (method of focus-group testing
for beverages is not patentable subject matter); see also
In re Howard, 394 F. 2d 869, 872 (CCPA 1968) (Kirk
patrick, J., concurring) (explaining that a “method of doing
business” cannot be patented). Between 1790 and 1952,
this Court never addressed the patentability of business
methods. But we consistently focused the inquiry on
whether an “art” was connected to a machine or physical
transformation,33 an inquiry that would have excluded
methods of doing business.
By the early 20th century, it was widely understood that
a series of steps for conducting business could not be
patented. A leading treatise, for example, listed “ ‘systems’
of business” as an “unpatentable subjec[t].” 1 A. Deller,
