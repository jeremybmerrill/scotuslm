STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

addresses “Patentability of Inventions and Grant of Pat
ents.” Particularly because petitioners’ reading of the
1999 Act would expand §101 to cover a category of proc
esses that have not “historically been eligible” for patents,
Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184, we should be loath to conclude
that Congress effectively amended §101 without saying so
clearly. We generally presume that Congress “does not,
one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman
v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468
(2001).
The Act therefore is, at best, merely evidence of 1999
legislative views on the meaning of the earlier, 1952 Act.
“[T]he views of a subsequent Congress,” however, “form a
hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.”
United States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). When a
later statute is offered as “an expression of how the . . .
Congress interpreted a statute passed by another Con
gress . . . a half century before,” “such interpretation has
very little, if any, significance.” Rainwater v. United
States, 356 U. S. 590, 593 (1958).
Furthermore, even assuming that Congress’ views at
the turn of the 21st century could potentially serve as a
valid basis for interpreting a statute passed in the mid
20th century, the First Inventor Defense Act does not aid
petitioners because it does not show that the later Con
gress itself understood §101 to cover business methods. If
anything, it shows that a few judges on the Federal Cir
cuit understood §101 in that manner and that Congress
understood what those judges had done. The Act appears
to reflect surprise and perhaps even dismay that business
methods might be patented. Thus, in the months follow
ing State Street, congressional authorities lamented that
“business methods and processes . . . until recently were
thought not to be patentable,” H. R. Rep. No. 106–464,
p. 121 (1999); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 106–287, pt. 1, p. 31
