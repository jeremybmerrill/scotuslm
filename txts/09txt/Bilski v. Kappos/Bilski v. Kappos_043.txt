(“[The Framers of the Constitution] undoubtedly contem
plated the industrial, mechanical and manual arts of the
late eighteenth Century, in contrast to the seven ‘liberal
arts’ and the four ‘fine arts’ of classical learning”). Indeed,
just days before the Constitutional Convention, one dele
gate listed examples of American progress in “manufac
tures and the useful arts,” all of which involved the crea

Coxe, An Address to an Assembly of the Friends of Ameri
