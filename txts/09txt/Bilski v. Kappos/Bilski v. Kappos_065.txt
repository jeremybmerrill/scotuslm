STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

487–488 (2004) (hereinafter Long). But as we have long
explained, patents should not “embaras[s] the honest
pursuit of business with fears and apprehensions of con
cealed liens and unknown liabilities to lawsuits and vexa
tious accountings for profits made in good faith.” Atlantic
Works v. Brady, 107 U. S. 192, 200 (1883).55
These effects are magnified by the “potential vagueness”
of business method patents, eBay Inc., 547 U. S., at 397
(KENNEDY, J., concurring). When it comes to patents,
“clarity is essential to promote progress.” Festo Corp., 535
U. S., at 730–731. Yet patents on methods of conducting
business generally are composed largely or entirely of
intangible steps. Compared to “the kinds of goods . . .
around which patent rules historically developed,” it thus
tends to be more costly and time consuming to search
through, and to negotiate licenses for, patents on business
methods. See Long 539, 470.56
The breadth of business methods, their omnipresence in
our society, and their potential vagueness also invite a
particularly pernicious use of patents that we have long
criticized. As early as the 19th century, we explained that
the patent laws are not intended to “creat[e] a class of

55 There is substantial academic debate, moreover, about whether the
normal process of screening patents for novelty and obviousness can
function effectively for business methods. The argument goes that
because business methods are both vague and not confined to any one
industry, there is not a well-confined body of prior art to consult, and
therefore many “bad” patents are likely to issue, a problem that would
need to be sorted out in later litigation. See, e.g., Dreyfuss 268–270;
Eisenberg, Analyze This: A Law and Economics Agenda for the Patent
System, 53 Vand. L. Rev. 2081, 2090 (2000); Merges 589–590.

Law, in 2 Handbook of Law and Economics 1500–1501, 1506 (M.
Polinsky & S. Shavell eds. 2007). Concededly, alterations in the rem
edy structure, such as the First Inventor Defense Act of 1999, §4301 et
seq., 113 Stat. 1536, codified at 35 U. S. C. §273, mitigate these costs.
