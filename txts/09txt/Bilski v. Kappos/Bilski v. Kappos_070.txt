BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

Third, while the machine-or-transformation test has
always been a “useful and important clue,” it has never
been the “sole test” for determining patentability. Ante, at
8; see also ante, at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg
ment); Benson, supra, at 71 (rejecting the argument that
“no process patent could ever qualify” for protection under
§101 “if it did not meet the [machine-or-transformation]
requirements”). Rather, the Court has emphasized that a
process claim meets the requirements of §101 when, “con
sidered as a whole,” it “is performing a function which the
patent laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming or
reducing an article to a different state or thing).” Diehr,
supra, at 192. The machine-or-transformation test is thus
an important example of how a court can determine pat
entability under §101, but the Federal Circuit erred in this
case by treating it as the exclusive test.
Fourth, although the machine-or-transformation test is
not the only test for patentability, this by no means indi
cates that anything which produces a “ ‘useful, concrete,
and tangible result,’ ” State Street Bank & Trust Co. v.
Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA
Fed. 1998), is patentable. “[T]his Court has never made
such a statement and, if taken literally, the statement
would cover instances where this Court has held the con
trary.” Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabo
lite Laboratories, Inc., 548 U. S. 124, 136 (2006) (BREYER,
J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently
granted); see also, e.g., O’Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 117
(1854); Flook, supra, at 590. Indeed, the introduction of
the “useful, concrete, and tangible result” approach to
patentability, associated with the Federal Circuit’s State
Street decision, preceded the granting of patents that
“ranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly ab
surd.” In re Bilski, 545 F. 3d 943, 1004 (CA Fed. 2008)
