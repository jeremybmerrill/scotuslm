STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

therefore can be protected with trade secrecy.50 And for
those methods that occur in public, firms that innovate
often capture long-term benefits from doing so, thanks to
various first mover advantages, including lockins, brand
ing, and networking effects.51 Business innovation, more
over, generally does not entail the same kinds of risk as
does more traditional, technological innovation. It gener
