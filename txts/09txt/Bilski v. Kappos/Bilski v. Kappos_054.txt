BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

must proceed cautiously when we are asked to extend
patent rights” into an area that the Patent Act likely was
not “enacted to protect,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 596, 593, lest
we create a legal regime that Congress never would have
endorsed, and that can be repaired only by disturbing
settled property rights.
V
Despite the strong historical evidence that a method of
doing business does not constitute a “process” under §101,
petitioners nonetheless argue—and the Court suggests in
dicta, ante, at 10–11—that a subsequent law, the First
Inventor Defense Act of 1999, “must be read together”
with §101 to make business methods patentable. Brief for
Petitioners 29. This argument utilizes a flawed method of
statutory interpretation and ignores the motivation for the
1999 Act.
In 1999, following a Federal Circuit decision that inti
mated business methods could be patented, see State
Street, 149 F. 3d 1368, Congress moved quickly to limit
the potential fallout. Congress passed the 1999 Act, codi

to claims of patent infringement, see §273(b), regarding
certain “method[s] of doing or conducting business,”
§273(a)(3).
It is apparent, both from the content and history of the
Act, that Congress did not in any way ratify State Street
(or, as petitioners contend, the broadest possible reading
of State Street). The Act merely limited one potential
effect of that decision: that businesses might suddenly find
themselves liable for innocently using methods they as
sumed could not be patented. The Act did not purport to
amend the limitations in §101 on eligible subject matter.
Indeed, Congress placed the statute in Part III of Title 35,
which addresses “Patents and Protection of Patent
Rights,” rather than in Part II, which contains §101 and
