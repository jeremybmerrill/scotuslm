Opinion of the Court

present in patent law, between stimulating innovation by
protecting inventors and impeding progress by granting
patents when not justified by the statutory design.
III
Even though petitioners’ application is not categorically
outside of §101 under the two broad and atextual ap
proaches the Court rejects today, that does not mean it is
a “process” under §101. Petitioners seek to patent both
the concept of hedging risk and the application of that
concept to energy markets. App. 19–20. Rather than
adopting categorical rules that might have wide-ranging
and unforeseen impacts, the Court resolves this case
narrowly on the basis of this Court’s decisions in Benson,
Flook, and Diehr, which show that petitioners’ claims are
not patentable processes because they are attempts to
patent abstract ideas. Indeed, all members of the Court
agree that the patent application at issue here falls out
side of §101 because it claims an abstract idea.
In Benson, the Court considered whether a patent appli
cation for an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal
numerals into pure binary code was a “process” under
§101. 409 U. S., at 64–67. The Court first explained that
“ ‘[a] principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an
original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no
one can claim in either of them an exclusive right.’ ” Id., at
67 (quoting Le Roy, 14 How., at 175). The Court then held
the application at issue was not a “process,” but an unpat
entable abstract idea. “It is conceded that one may not
patent an idea. But in practical effect that would be the
result if the formula for converting . . . numerals to pure
binary numerals were patented in this case.” 409 U. S., at
71. A contrary holding “would wholly pre-empt the
mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a
patent on the algorithm itself.” Id., at 72.
In Flook, the Court considered the next logical step after
