BILSKI v. KAPPOS
Opinion of the Court

use of well-known random analysis techniques to help
establish some of the inputs into the equation. Indeed,
these claims add even less to the underlying abstract
principle than the invention in Flook did, for the Flook
invention was at least directed to the narrower domain of
signaling dangers in operating a catalytic converter.

Today, the Court once again declines to impose limita
tions on the Patent Act that are inconsistent with the Act’s
text. The patent application here can be rejected under
our precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas.
The Court, therefore, need not define further what consti
tutes a patentable “process,” beyond pointing to the defini
tion of that term provided in §100(b) and looking to the
guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.
And nothing in today’s opinion should be read as endors
ing interpretations of §101 that the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit has used in the past. See, e.g., State
Street, 149 F. 3d, at 1373; AT&T Corp., 172 F. 3d, at 1357.
It may be that the Court of Appeals thought it needed to
make the machine-or-transformation test exclusive pre
cisely because its case law had not adequately identified
less extreme means of restricting business method pat
ents, including (but not limited to) application of our
opinions in Benson, Flook, and Diehr. In disapproving an
exclusive machine-or-transformation test, we by no means
foreclose the Federal Circuit’s development of other limit
ing criteria that further the purposes of the Patent Act
and are not inconsistent with its text.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
