BILSKI v. KAPPOS

STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment 


III 

I agree with the Court that the text of §101 must be the
starting point of our analysis. As I shall explain, however,
the text must not be the end point as well.
Pursuant to its power “[t]o promote the Progress of . . .
useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors
the exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries,” U. S. Const.,
Art. I, §8, cl. 8, Congress has passed a series of patent
laws that grant certain exclusive rights over certain in
ventions and discoveries as a means of encouraging inno
vation. In the latest iteration, the Patent Act of 1952
(1952 Act), Congress has provided that “[w]hoever invents
or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manu
facture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful
improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, sub
ject to the conditions and requirements of this title,” 35
U. S. C. §101, which include that the patent also be novel,
§102, and nonobvious, §103. The statute thus authorizes
four categories of subject matter that may be patented:
processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of
matter. Section 101 imposes a threshold condition. “[N]o
patent is available for a discovery, however useful, novel,
and nonobvious, unless it falls within one of the express
categories of patentable subject matter.” Kewanee Oil Co.
v. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 483 (1974).
Section 101 undoubtedly defines in “expansive terms”
the subject matter eligible for patent protection, as the
statute was meant to ensure that “ ‘ingenuit[ies] receive a
liberal encouragement.’ ” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447
U. S. 303, 308–309 (1980); see also J. E. M. Ag Supply,
Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 130
(2001). Nonetheless, not every new invention or discovery
may be patented. Certain things are “free for all to use.”
