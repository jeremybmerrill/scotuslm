STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

opinion below, the phrase “made by man” “is reminiscent”
of a 1790’s description of the limits of English patent law,
that an “invention must be ‘made by man’ ” and cannot be
“ ‘a philosophical principle only, neither organized or capa
ble of being organized’ from a patentable manufacture.”
545 F. 3d, at 976 (quoting Hornblower v. Boulton, 8 T. R.
95, 98 (K. B. 1799)).
The 1952 Act, in short, cannot be understood as expand
ing the scope of patentable subject matter by suggesting
that any series of steps may be patented as a “process”
under §101. If anything, the Act appears to have codified
the conclusion that subject matter which was understood
not to be patentable in 1952 was to remain unpatentable.
Our recent case law reinforces my view that a series of
steps for conducting business is not a “process” under
§101. Since Congress passed the 1952 Act, we have never
ruled on whether that Act authorizes patents on business
methods. But we have cast significant doubt on that
proposition by giving substantial weight to the machine
or-transformation test, as general methods of doing busi
ness do not pass that test. And more recently, Members of
this Court have noted that patents on business methods
are of “suspect validity.” eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L.

Since at least the days of Assyrian merchants, people
have devised better and better ways to conduct business.
Yet it appears that neither the Patent Clause, nor early
patent law, nor the current §101 contemplated or was
publicly understood to mean that such innovations are
patentable. Although it may be difficult to define with
precision what is a patentable “process” under §101, the
historical clues converge on one conclusion: A business
method is not a “process.” And to the extent that there is
ambiguity, we should be mindful of our judicial role. “[W]e
