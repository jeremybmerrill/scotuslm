BILSKI v. KAPPOS
Opinion of ENNEDY, J.
Opinion of Kthe Court

entability of a process claim that does not include particu
lar machines.” At the same time, it explicitly declined to
“hold that no process patent could ever qualify if it did not
meet [machine or transformation] requirements.” Id., at
71. Flook took a similar approach, “assum[ing] that a
valid process patent may issue even if it does not meet
[the machine-or-transformation test].” 437 U. S., at 588,
n. 9.
This Court’s precedents establish that the machine-or
transformation test is a useful and important clue, an
investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed
inventions are processes under §101. The machine-or
transformation test is not the sole test for deciding
whether an invention is a patent-eligible “process.”

It is true that patents for inventions that did not satisfy
the machine-or-transformation test were rarely granted in
earlier eras, especially in the Industrial Age, as explained
by Judge Dyk’s thoughtful historical review. See 545
F. 3d, at 966–976 (concurring opinion). But times change.
Technology and other innovations progress in unexpected
ways. For example, it was once forcefully argued that
until recent times, “well-established principles of patent
law probably would have prevented the issuance of a valid
patent on almost any conceivable computer program.”
Diehr, 450 U. S., at 195 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But
this fact does not mean that unforeseen innovations such
as computer programs are always unpatentable. See id.,
at 192–193 (majority opinion) (holding a procedure for
molding rubber that included a computer program is
within patentable subject matter). Section 101 is a “dy
namic provision designed to encompass new and unfore
seen inventions.” J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer HiBred Int’l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 135 (2001). A categorical
rule denying patent protection for “inventions in areas not
