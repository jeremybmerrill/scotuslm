BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

Thus, fields such as business and finance were not
generally considered part of the “useful arts” in the found
ing Era. See, e.g., The Federalist No. 8, p. 69 (C. Rossiter
ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (distinguishing between “the arts
of industry, and the science of finance”); 30 The Writings
of George Washington 1745–1799, p. 186 (J. Fitzpatrick
ed. 1939) (writing in a letter that “our commerce has been
considerably curtailed,” but “the useful arts have been
almost imperceptible pushed to a considerable degree of
perfection”). Indeed, the same delegate to the Constitu
tional Convention who gave an address in which he listed
triumphs in the useful arts distinguished between those
arts and the conduct of business. He explained that inves
tors were now attracted to the “manufactures and the
useful arts,” much as they had long invested in “com
merce, navigation, stocks, banks, and insurance compa
nies.” T. Coxe, A Statement of the Arts and Manufactures
of the United States of America for the Year 1810, (1814),
in 2 American State Papers, Finance 666, 688 (1832).
Some scholars have remarked, as did Thomas Jefferson,
that early patent statutes neither included nor reflected
any serious debate about the precise scope of patentable
——————
try, physics, and the like; to make a distinctive contribution to scientific
knowledge”); In re Waldbaum, 457 F. 2d 997, 1003 (CCPA 1972) (Rich,
J., concurring) (“ ‘The phrase “technological arts,” as we have used it, is
synonymous with the phrase “useful arts” as it appears in Article I,
Section 8 of the Constitution’ ”); Paulik v. Rizkalla, 760 F. 2d 1270,
1276 (CA Fed. 1985) (explaining that “useful arts” is “the process today
called technological innovation”); Thomas, The Post-Industrial Patent
System, 10 Fordham Intell. Prop. Media & Ent. L. J. 3, 32–55 (1999)
(cataloguing early understandings of technological arts). This view
may be supported, for example, by an 1814 grant to Harvard University
to create a “Professorship on the Application of Science to the Useful
Arts,” something that today might be akin to applied science or engi
neering. See M. James, Engineering an Environment for Change:
Bigelow, Peirce, and Early Nineteenth-Century Practical Education at
Harvard, in Science at Harvard University: Historical Perspectives 59
(C. Elliott & M. Rossiter eds. 1992).
