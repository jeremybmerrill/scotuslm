STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

of the 1952 Act, later explained that “the invention of a
more effective organization of the materials in, and the
techniques of teaching a course in physics, chemistry, or
Russian is not a patentable invention because it is outside
of the enumerated categories of ‘process, machine, manu
facture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful
improvement thereof.’ ” Principles of Patentability, 28
Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 393, 394 (1960). “Also outside that
group,” he added, was a process for doing business: “the
greatest inventio[n] of our times, the diaper service.”

“Anything Under the Sun”
Despite strong evidence that Congress has consistently
authorized patents for a limited class of subject matter
and that the 1952 Act did not alter the nature of the then
existing limits, petitioners and their amici emphasize a
single phrase in the Act’s legislative history, which sug
gests that the statutory subject matter “ ‘include[s] any
thing under the sun that is made by man.’ ” Brief for
Petitioners 19 (quoting Chakrabarty, 447 U. S., at 309, in
turn quoting S. Rep. 1979, at 5). Similarly, the Court
relies on language from our opinion in Chakrabarty that
was based in part on this piece of legislative history. See
ante, at 4, 6.
This reliance is misplaced. We have never understood

v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 192 (1981) (explaining that a “claim satisfies
the requirements of §101” when it “is performing a function which the
patent laws were designed to protect”).
40 Forty years later, Judge Rich authored the State Street opinion that
some have understood to make business methods patentable. But State
Street dealt with whether a piece of software could be patented and
addressed only claims directed at machines, not processes. His opinion
may therefore be better understood merely as holding that an otherwise
patentable process is not unpatentable simply because it is directed
toward the conduct of doing business—an issue the Court has no
occasion to address today. See State Street, 149 F. 3d, at 1375.
