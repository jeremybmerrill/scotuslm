STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

Clause included the authority to patent methods of doing
business, it might not have passed so quietly.
In 1790, Congress passed the first Patent Act, an “Act to
promote the progress of useful Arts” that authorized pat
ents for persons who had “invented or discovered any
useful art, manufacture, engine, machine, or device, or
any improvement therein not before known or used,” if
“the invention or discovery [was] sufficiently useful and
important.” 1 Stat. 109–110. Three years later, Congress
passed the Patent Act of 1793 and slightly modified the
language to cover “any new and useful art, machine,
manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and
useful improvement on any art, machine, manufacture or
composition of matter.” 1 Stat. 319.
The object of the constitutional patent power and the
statutory authorization for process patents in the early
patent Acts was the term “useful art.” It is not evident
from the face of the statutes or the Constitution whether
the objects of the patent system were “arts” that are also
useful, or rather a more specific category, the class of arts
known as “useful arts.” Cf. Graham, 383 U. S., at 12
(describing the “ ‘new and useful’ tests which have always
existed in the statutory scheme” and apply to all catego
ries of subject matter). However, we have generally as
sumed that “useful art,” at least as it is used in the Patent
Act, is itself a term of art. See Burden, 15 How., at 267–
268.
The word “art” and the phrase “useful arts” are subject
to many meanings. There is room on the margins to de
bate exactly what qualifies as either. There is room,
moreover, to debate at what level of generality we should
understand these broad and historical terms, given that
“[a] rule that unanticipated inventions are without protec
tion would conflict with the core concept of the patent
