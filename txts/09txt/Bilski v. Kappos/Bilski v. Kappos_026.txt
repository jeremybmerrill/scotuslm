BILSKI v. KAPPOS
STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment

moreover, that “[t]here is no suggestion in any of this early
consideration of process patents that processes for organiz
ing human activity were or ever had been patentable.”
Id., at 972.
Three judges wrote dissenting opinions, although two of
those judges agreed that petitioners’ claim is not patent
eligible. Judge Mayer would have held that petitioners’
claim “is not eligible for patent protection because it is
directed to a method of conducting business.” Id., at 998.
He submitted that “[t]he patent system is intended to
protect and promote advances in science and technology,
not ideas about how to structure commercial transac
tions.” Ibid. “Affording patent protection to business
methods lacks constitutional and statutory support, serves
to hinder rather than promote innovation[,] and usurps
that which rightfully belongs in the public domain.” Ibid.
Judge Rader would have rejected petitioners’ claim on
the ground that it seeks to patent merely an abstract idea.
Id., at 1011.
Only Judge Newman disagreed with the court’s conclu
sion that petitioners’ claim seeks a patent on ineligible
subject matter. Judge Newman urged that the en banc
court’s machine-or-transformation test ignores the text
and history of §101, id., at 977–978, 985–990, is in tension
with several of decisions by this Court, id., at 978–985,
and the Federal Circuit, id., at 990–992, and will invali
date thousands of patents that were issued in reliance on
those decisions, id., at 992–994.

Before explaining in more detail how I would decide this
case, I will comment briefly on the Court’s opinion. The
opinion is less than pellucid in more than one respect, and,
if misunderstood, could result in confusion or upset settled
areas of the law. Three preliminary observations may be
clarifying.
