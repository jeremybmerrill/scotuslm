In this case, petitioner excludes students who will not
sign its Statement of Faith or who engage in “unrepentant
homosexual conduct,” App. 226. The expressive associa

tolerate such groups. It need not subsidize them, give
them its official imprimatur, or grant them equal access to
law school facilities.
