CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., 

HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ

that this “accept-all-comers” policy, ante, at 1, is both
viewpoint-neutral and consistent with Hastings’ pro
claimed policy of fostering a diversity of viewpoints among

institutions with a handy weapon for suppressing the
speech of unpopular groups—groups to which, as Hastings
candidly puts it, these institutions “do not wish to . . . lend
their name[s].” Brief for Respondent Hastings College of

The Court bases all of its analysis on the proposition
that the relevant Hastings’ policy is the so-called accept
all-comers policy. This frees the Court from the difficult
task of defending the constitutionality of either the policy
that Hastings actually—and repeatedly—invoked when it
