Opinion of the Court

Time and again, the dissent races away from the facts to
which CLS stipulated. See, e.g., post, at 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11,
24.8 But factual stipulations are “formal concessions . . .
that have the effect of withdrawing a fact from issue and
dispensing wholly with the need for proof of the fact.
Thus, a judicial admission . . . is conclusive in the case.” 2
K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence §254, p. 181 (6th ed.
2006) (footnote omitted). See also, e.g., Oscanyan v. Arms
Co., 103 U. S. 261, 263 (1881) (“The power of the court to
act in the disposition of a trial upon facts conceded by
counsel is as plain as its power to act upon the evidence
produced.”).9
In light of the joint stipulation, both the District Court
and the Ninth Circuit trained their attention on the con­
stitutionality of the all-comers requirement, as described
in the parties’ accord. See 319 Fed. Appx., at 645–646;
App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a; id., at 36a. We reject CLS’s
unseemly attempt to escape from the stipulation and shift
——————

an effort to undermine the stipulation, the dissent emphasizes a
sentence in Hastings’ answer to CLS’s first amended complaint which,
the dissent contends, casts doubt on Hastings’ fidelity to its all-comers
policy. See post, at 5–6, 11. In context, Hastings’ answer—which
responded to CLS’s allegation that the Law School singles out religious
groups for discriminatory treatment—is sensibly read to convey that
Hastings’ policies and regulations apply to all groups equally. See App.
79 (denying that the Nondiscrimination Policy imposes on religious
organizations restraints that are not applied to political, social, and
cultural groups). In any event, the parties’ joint stipulation supersedes
the answer, to the extent of any conflict between the two filings. See
Pepper & Tanner, Inc. v. Shamrock Broadcasting, Inc., 563 F. 2d 391,
393 (CA9 1977) (Parties’ “stipulation of facts . . . superseded all prior
pleadings and controlled the subsequent course of the action.”).
9 The dissent indulges in make-believe when it suggests that we are
making factual findings about Hastings’ all-comers policy. Post, at 1, 2.
As CLS’s petition for certiorari stressed, “[t]he material facts of this case
are undisputed.” Pet. for Cert. 2 (emphasis added). We take the facts
as the joint stipulation describes them, see supra, at 8–11; our decision
respects, while the dissent ignores, the conclusive effect of the parties’
accord.
