CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,
HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ
ALITO, J., dissenting

should qualify as a conduct requirement.
If it does not, then what Hastings’ new policy must
mean is that registered groups may impose some, but not
all, conduct requirements. And if that is the case, it is
incumbent on Hastings to explain which conduct require
ments are acceptable, which are not, and why CLS’s re
quirement is not allowed. Hastings has made no effort to
provide such an explanation.6
VI
I come now to the version of Hastings’ policy that the
Court has chosen to address. This is not the policy that
Hastings invoked when CLS was denied registration. Nor
is it the policy that Hastings now proclaims—and pre
sumably implements. It is a policy that, as far as the
record establishes, was in force only from the time when it
was first disclosed by the former dean in July 2005 until
Hastings filed its brief in this Court in March 2010. Why
we should train our attention on this particular policy and
not the other two is a puzzle. But in any event, it is clear
that the accept-all-comers policy is not reasonable in light
of the purpose of the RSO forum, and it is impossible to
say on the present record that it is viewpoint neutral.

Once a state university opens a limited forum, it “must
respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.” Rosenber
ger, 515 U. S., at 829. Hastings’ regulations on the regis
tration of student groups impose only two substantive
limitations: A group seeking registration must have stu
dent members and must be non-commercial. App. to Pet.

6Nor does the Court clarify this point. Suggesting that any conduct
requirement must relate to “gross misconduct,” ante, at 4, n. 2, is not
helpful.
