CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOCIETY CHAPTER OF THE 

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, HASTINGS COLLEGE

OF THE LAW, AKA HASTINGS CHRISTIAN FELLOW-

SHIP v. MARTINEZ ET AL. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 08–1371. Argued April 19, 2010—Decided June 28, 2010
Respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings), a school within the
University of California public-school system, extends official recog
nition to student groups through its “Registered Student Organiza
tion” (RSO) program. Several benefits attend this school-approved
status, including the use of school funds, facilities, and channels of
communication, as well as Hastings’ name and logo. In exchange for
recognition, RSOs must abide by certain conditions. Critical here, all
RSOs must comply with the school’s Nondiscrimination Policy, which
tracks state law barring discrimination on a number of bases, includ
ing religion and sexual orientation. Hastings interprets this policy, as
it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers:
RSOs must allow any student to participate, become a member, or
seek leadership positions, regardless of her status or beliefs.
At the beginning of the 2004–2005 academic year, the leaders of an
existing Christian RSO formed petitioner Christian Legal Society
(CLS) by affiliating with a national Christian association that char
ters student chapters at law schools throughout the country. These
chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia, require members and of
ficers to sign a “Statement of Faith” and to conduct their lives in ac
cord with prescribed principles. Among those tenets is the belief that
sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man
and a woman. CLS interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation
anyone who engages in “unrepentant homosexual conduct” or holds
religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.
