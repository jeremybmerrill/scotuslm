ALITO, J., dissenting

Agudath Israel of America as Amicus Curiae 3, 8 (affir
mance would “point a judicial dagger at the heart of the
Orthodox Jewish community in the United States” and
permit that community to be relegated to the status of “a
second-class group”); Brief for Union of Orthodox Jewish
Congregations of America as Amicus Curiae 3 (affirmance
“could significantly affect the ability of [affiliated] student
clubs and youth movements . . . to prescribe requirements
for their membership and leaders based on religious be
liefs and commitments”). This is where the Court’s deci
sion leads.

I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that today’s
decision is a serious setback for freedom of expression in
this country. Our First Amendment reflects a “profound
national commitment to the principle that debate on
public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide
open.” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270
(1964). Even if the United States is the only Nation that
shares this commitment to the same extent, I would not
change our law to conform to the international norm. I
fear that the Court’s decision marks a turn in that direc
tion. Even those who find CLS’s views objectionable
should be concerned about the way the group has been
treated—by Hastings, the Court of Appeals, and now this
Court. I can only hope that this decision will turn out to
be an aberration.
