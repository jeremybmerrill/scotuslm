CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., 

HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ 

Syllabus 

that it systematically—and impermissibly—burdens most heavily
those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus
mainstream. This argument fails because “[a] regulation that serves
purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral,
even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but
not others.” Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791. Hast
ings’ requirement that RSOs accept all comers, the Court is satisfied,
is “justified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the
regulated speech.” Id., at 791. It targets the act of rejecting would-be
group members without reference to the reasons motivating that be
havior. Pp. 29–31.
3. Neither lower court addressed CLS’s argument that Hastings se
lectively enforces its all-comers policy. This Court is not the proper
forum to air the issue in the first instance. On remand, the Ninth
Circuit may consider this argument if, and to the extent, it is pre
served. Pp. 31–32.

319 Fed. Appx. 645, affirmed and remanded.
GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS,
KENNEDY, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined. STEVENS, J., and KENNEDY, J., filed concurring opinions. ALITO, J., filed a dissenting opinion,
in which ROBERTS, C. J., and SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ., joined.
