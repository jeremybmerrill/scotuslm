ties.”). Cognizant that judges lack the on-the-ground
expertise and experience of school administrators, how­
ever, we have cautioned courts in various contexts to
resist “substitut[ing] their own notions of sound educa­
tional policy for those of the school authorities which they
review.” Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School
Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 206
(1982). See also, e.g., Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhl
meier, 484 U. S. 260, 273 (1988) (noting our “oft-expressed

type of officially recognized activities in which their stu­
dents participate.” Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 240 (1990).
