ALITO, J., dissenting

which new students enter on a regular basis, it must
possess the means of communicating with these stu
dents. Moreover, the organization’s ability to partici
pate in the intellectual give and take of campus de
bate, and to pursue its stated purposes, is limited by
denial of access to the customary media for communi
cating with the administration, faculty members, and
other students. Such impediments cannot be viewed
as insubstantial.” Id., at 181–182.
It is striking that all of these same burdens are now
borne by CLS. CLS is prevented from using campus facili
ties—unless at some future time Hastings chooses to
provide a timely response to a CLS request and allow the
group, as a favor or perhaps in exchange for a fee, to set
up a table on the patio or to use a room that would other
wise be unoccupied. And CLS, like the SDS in Healy, has
been cut off from “the customary media for communicating
with the administration, faculty members, and other
students.” Id., at 181–182.
It is also telling that the Healy Court, unlike today’s
majority, refused to defer to the college president’s judg
ment regarding the compatibility of “sound educational
policy” and free speech rights. The same deference argu
ments that the majority now accepts were made in defense
of the college president’s decision to deny recognition in
Healy. Respondents in that case emphasized that the
college president, not the courts, had the responsibility of
administering the institution and that the courts should
allow him “ ‘wide discretion . . . in determining what ac
tions are most compatible with its educational objectives.’ ”
