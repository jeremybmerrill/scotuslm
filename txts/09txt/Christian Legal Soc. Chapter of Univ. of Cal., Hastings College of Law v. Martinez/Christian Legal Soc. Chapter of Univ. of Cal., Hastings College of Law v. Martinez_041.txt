STEVENS, J., concurring

of secular or spiritual feeling, hateful or benign motives,
all acts of religious discrimination are equally covered.
The discriminator’s beliefs are simply irrelevant. There is,
moreover, no evidence that the policy was adopted because
of any reason related to the particular views that religious
individuals or groups might have, much less because of a
desire to suppress or distort those views. The policy’s
religion clause was plainly meant to promote, not to un
dermine, religious freedom.
To be sure, the policy may end up having greater conse
quence for religious groups—whether and to what extent
it will is far from clear ex ante—inasmuch as they are
more likely than their secular counterparts to wish to
exclude students of particular faiths. But there is likewise
no evidence that the policy was intended to cause harm to
religious groups, or that it has in practice caused signifi
cant harm to their operations. And it is a basic tenet of
First Amendment law that disparate impact does not, in
itself, constitute viewpoint discrimination.2 The dissent
——————
ual conduct,” App. 226, does not discriminate on the basis of status or
identity, post, at 22–23.) Our First Amendment doctrine has never
required university administrators to undertake the impossible task of
separating out belief-based from status-based religious discrimination.
2 See, e.g., Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 763
(1994); R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 385 (1992); Board of Directors
of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U. S. 537, 549 (1987);
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623, 628 (1984); cf.
Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S.
872, 878–879 (1990) (“We have never held that an individual’s religious
beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohib
iting conduct that the State is free to regulate”). Courts and commen
tators have applied this insight to the exact situation posed by the
Nondiscrimination Policy. See, e.g., Christian Legal Society v. Walker,
453 F. 3d 853, 866 (CA7 2006) (stating that “[t]here can be little doubt
that” comparable nondiscrimination policy “is viewpoint neutral on its
face”); Truth v. Kent School Dist., 542 F. 3d 634, 649–650 (CA9 2008)
(similar); Volokh, Freedom of Expressive Association and Government
Subsidies, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 1919, 1930–1938 (2006).
