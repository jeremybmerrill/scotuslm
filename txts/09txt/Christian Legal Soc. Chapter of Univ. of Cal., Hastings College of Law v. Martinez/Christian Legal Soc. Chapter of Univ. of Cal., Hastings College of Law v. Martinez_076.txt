CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,
HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ
ALITO, J., dissenting

them to create the “social opportunities” they desire by
forming whatever groups they wish to create.
Second, the Court approves the accept-all-comers policy
because it is easier to enforce than the Nondiscrimination
Policy that it replaced. It would be “a daunting labor,” the
Court warns, for Hastings to try to determine whether
a group excluded a member based on belief as opposed to
status. Ante, at 22; see also ante, at 2–3, n. 1 (opinion
of STEVENS, J.) (referring to the “impossible task of
separating out belief-based from status-based religious
discrimination”).
This is a strange argument, since the Nondiscrimination
Policy prohibits discrimination on substantially the same
grounds as the antidiscrimination provisions of many
States,7 including California, and except for the inclusion
of the prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orien
tation, the Nondiscrimination Policy also largely tracks
federal antidiscrimination laws.8 Moreover, Hastings now
willingly accepts greater burdens under its latest policy,
which apparently requires the school to distinguish be
tween certain “conduct requirements” that are allowed
and others that are not. Nor is Hastings daunted by the
labor of determining whether a club admissions exam
legitimately tests knowledge or is a pretext for screening

However, Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination on the
basis of religion, provides that religious associations and schools can
hire on the basis of religion and that any employer can hire on the basis
of religion if it is a bona fide occupational qualification. 42 U. S. C.
