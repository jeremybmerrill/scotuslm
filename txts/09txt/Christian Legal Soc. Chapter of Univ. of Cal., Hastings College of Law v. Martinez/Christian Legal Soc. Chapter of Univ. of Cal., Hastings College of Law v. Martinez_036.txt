others.” Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791
(1989). See also Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc.,
512 U. S. 753, 763 (1994) (“[T]he fact that the injunction
covered people with a particular viewpoint does not itself
render the injunction content or viewpoint based.”).
Even if a regulation has a differential impact on groups
wishing to enforce exclusionary membership policies,
“[w]here the [State] does not target conduct on the basis of
its expressive content, acts are not shielded from regula­
tion merely because they express a discriminatory idea or
philosophy.” R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 390
(1992). See also Roberts, 468 U. S., at 623 (State’s nondis­
crimination law did not “distinguish between prohibited
and permitted activity on the basis of viewpoint.”); Board
of Directors of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481
U. S. 537, 549 (1987) (same).
Hastings’ requirement that student groups accept all
comers, we are satisfied, “is justified without reference to
the content [or viewpoint] of the regulated speech.” Ward,
491 U. S., at 791 (internal quotation marks and emphasis
omitted). The Law School’s policy aims at the act of reject­
ing would-be group members without reference to the
reasons motivating that behavior: Hastings’ “desire to
redress th[e] perceived harms” of exclusionary member­
ship policies “provides an adequate explanation for its [all­
comers condition] over and above mere disagreement with
[any student group’s] beliefs or biases.” Wisconsin v.
Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 488 (1993). CLS’s conduct—not
its Christian perspective—is, from Hastings’ vantage
point, what stands between the group and RSO status.
“In the end,” as Hastings observes, “CLS is simply confus­
ing its own viewpoint-based objections to . . . nondiscrimi­
nation laws (which it is entitled to have and [to] voice)
with viewpoint discrimination.” Brief for Hastings 31.26
