Opinion of the Court

nal quotation marks omitted), the Court has permitted
restrictions on access to a limited public forum, like the
RSO program here, with this key caveat: Any access bar­
rier must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral, e.g.,
Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829. See also, e.g., Good News
Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106–107
(2001); Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 392–393 (1993); Perry Ed.

constrain associational freedom. In the context of public
accommodations, we have subjected restrictions on that

“unrelated to the suppression of ideas”—interests that
cannot be advanced “through . . . significantly less restric­

609, 623 (1984). See also, e.g., Boy Scouts of America v.
Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 648 (2000). “Freedom of association,”
we have recognized, “plainly presupposes a freedom not to
associate.” Roberts, 468 U. S., at 623. Insisting that an
organization embrace unwelcome members, we have
therefore concluded, “directly and immediately affects
associational rights.” Dale, 530 U. S., at 659.
CLS would have us engage each line of cases independ­
ently, but its expressive-association and free-speech ar­
guments merge: Who speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons,
colors what concept is conveyed. See Brief for Petitioner

12 Our decisions make clear, and the parties agree, that Hastings,
through its RSO program, established a limited public forum. See
Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829
(1995); Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (counsel for CLS); Brief for Petitioner 25–26;
Brief for Hastings 27–28; Brief for Hastings Outlaw 27.
