ALITO, J., dissenting

When CLS applied for registration, Judy Hansen Chap
man, the Director of Hastings’ Office of Student Services,
sent an e-mail to an officer of the chapter informing him
that “CLS’s bylaws did not appear to be compliant” with
the Hastings Nondiscrimination Policy, App. 228, 277, a
written policy that provides in pertinent part that “[t]he
University of California, Hastings College of the Law shall
not discriminate unlawfully on the basis of race, color,
religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or
sexual orientation,” id., at 220. As far as the record re
flects, Ms. Chapman made no mention of an accept-all
applicants policy.
A few days later, three officers of the chapter met with
Ms. Chapman, and she reiterated that the CLS bylaws did
not comply with “the religion and sexual orientation provi

need to be amended in order for CLS to become a regis

later, Hastings sent CLS a letter to the same effect. Id., at
228–229, 293–295. On both of these occasions, it appears
that not a word was said about an accept-all-comers
policy.
When CLS refused to change its membership require
ments, Hastings denied its request for registration—thus
making CLS the only student group whose application for
registration has ever been rejected. Brief in Opposition 4.
In October 2004, CLS brought this action under 42
U. S. C. §1983 against the law school’s dean and other
school officials, claiming, among other things, that the law
school, by enacting and enforcing the Nondiscrimination
Policy, had violated CLS’s First Amendment right to
freedom of speech. App. 78.
In May 2005, Hastings filed an answer to CLS’s first
amended complaint and made an admission that is signifi
cant for present purposes. In its complaint, CLS had
alleged that the Nondiscrimination Policy discriminates
