proffered reason for its employment decision support a
finding of pretext.” Kobrin v. University of Minnesota, 34
F. 3d 698, 703 (CA8 1994); see also, e.g., Aragon v. Repub
lic Silver State Disposal Inc., 292 F. 3d 654, 661 (CA9
2002); Cicero v. Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc., 280 F. 3d
579, 592 (CA6 2001).
Timing. The timing of Hastings’ revelation of its new
policies closely tracks the law school’s litigation posture.
When Hastings denied CLS registration, it cited only the
Nondiscrimination Policy. Later, after CLS alleged that
the Nondiscrimination Policy discriminated against reli
gious groups, Hastings unveiled its accept-all-comers
policy. Then, after we granted certiorari and CLS’s open
ing brief challenged the constitutionality—and the plausi
bility—of the accept-all-comers policy, Hastings disclosed
a new policy. As is true in the employment context,
“[w]hen the justification for an adverse . . . action changes
during litigation, that inconsistency raises an issue
whether the proffered reason truly motivated the defen
dant’s decision.” Cicero, supra, at 592.
Lack of documentation. When an employer has a writ
ten policy and then relies on a rule for which there is no
written documentation, that deviation may support an
inference of pretext. See, e.g., Diaz v. Eagle Produce Ltd.
Partnership, 521 F. 3d 1201, 1214 (CA9 2008); Rudin v.
Lincoln Land Community College, 420 F. 3d 712, 727 (CA7
2005); Machinchick v. PB Power, Inc., 398 F. 3d 345, 354,
n. 29 (CA5 2005); Russell v. TG Missouri Corp., 340 F. 3d
735, 746 (CA8 2003); Mohammed v. Callaway, 698 F. 2d
395, 399–400, 401 (CA10 1983).
Here, Hastings claims that it has had an accept-all
comers policy since 1990, but it has not produced a single
written document memorializing that policy. Nor has it
cited a single occasion prior to the dean’s deposition when
this putative policy was orally disclosed to either student
groups interested in applying for registration or to the
