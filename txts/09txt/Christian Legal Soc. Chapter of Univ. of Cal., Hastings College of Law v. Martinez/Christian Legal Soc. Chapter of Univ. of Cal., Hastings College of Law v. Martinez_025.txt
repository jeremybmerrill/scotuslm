Opinion of the Court

ute a newspaper because the publication discussed issues
from a Christian perspective. 515 U. S., at 825–827. By
“select[ing] for disfavored treatment those student journal­
istic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints,” we held,
the university had engaged in “viewpoint discrimination,
which is presumed impermissible when directed against
speech otherwise within the forum’s limitations.” Id., at
831, 830.
In all three cases, we ruled that student groups had
been unconstitutionally singled out because of their points

distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served
by the forum, . . . nor may it discriminate against speech
on the basis of . . . viewpoint.” Ibid. (internal quotation

istics of the school environment.” Widmar, 454 U. S., at
268, n. 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court
is the final arbiter of the question whether a public uni­
versity has exceeded constitutional constraints, and we
owe no deference to universities when we consider that
question. Cf. Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 827 (1974)
