CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., 

HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ 

Opinion of the Court 


“The parties stipulate that Hastings imposes an
open membership rule on all student groups—all
groups must accept all comers as voting members
even if those individuals disagree with the mission of
the group. The conditions on recognition are therefore
viewpoint neutral and reasonable. Truth v. Kent Sch.

group can insist that its leaders support its purposes and
beliefs,” CLS alleges, but “a religious group cannot.” Id.,
at 20.
CLS’s assertion runs headlong into the stipulation of
facts it jointly submitted with Hastings at the summary­
judgment stage. In that filing, the parties specified:
“Hastings requires that registered student organiza­
tions allow any student to participate, become a mem­
ber, or seek leadership positions in the organization,
