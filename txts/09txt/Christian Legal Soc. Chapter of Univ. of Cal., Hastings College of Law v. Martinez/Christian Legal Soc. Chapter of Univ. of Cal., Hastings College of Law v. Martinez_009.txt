Opinion of the Court

status. RSOs are eligible to seek financial assistance from
the Law School, which subsidizes their events using funds
from a mandatory student-activity fee imposed on all
students. Id., at 217. RSOs may also use Law-School
channels to communicate with students: They may place
announcements in a weekly Office-of-Student-Services
newsletter, advertise events on designated bulletin boards,
send e-mails using a Hastings-organization address, and
participate in an annual Student Organizations Fair
designed to advance recruitment efforts. Id., at 216–219.
In addition, RSOs may apply for permission to use the
Law School’s facilities for meetings and office space. Id.,
at 218–219. Finally, Hastings allows officially recognized
groups to use its name and logo. Id., at 216.
In exchange for these benefits, RSOs must abide by
certain conditions. Only a “non-commercial organization
whose membership is limited to Hastings students may
become [an RSO].” App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a. A prospec­
tive RSO must submit its bylaws to Hastings for approval,
id., at 83a–84a; and if it intends to use the Law School’s
name or logo, it must sign a license agreement, App. 219.
Critical here, all RSOs must undertake to comply with
Hastings’ “Policies and Regulations Applying to College
Activities, Organizations and Students.” Ibid.1
The Law School’s Policy on Nondiscrimination (Nondis­
crimination Policy), which binds RSOs, states:
“[Hastings] is committed to a policy against legally
impermissible, arbitrary or unreasonable discrimina­
tory practices. All groups, including administration,
faculty, student governments, [Hastings]-owned stu­
dent residence facilities and programs sponsored by
[Hastings], are governed by this policy of nondis­
——————
1 These policies and regulations address a wide range of matters, for
example, alcoholic beverages at campus events, bake sales, and blood
drives. App. 246.
