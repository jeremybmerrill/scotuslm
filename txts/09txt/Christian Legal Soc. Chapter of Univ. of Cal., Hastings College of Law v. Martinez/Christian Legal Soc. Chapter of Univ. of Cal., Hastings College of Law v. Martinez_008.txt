CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., 

HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ 

Opinion of the Court 


do not share the organization’s core beliefs about religion
and sexual orientation. From the perspective of respon­
dent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings or the Law
School), CLS seeks special dispensation from an across­
the-board open-access requirement designed to further the
reasonable educational purposes underpinning the school’s
student-organization program.
In accord with the District Court and the Court of Ap­

pliance with Hastings’ all-comers policy, we conclude, is a
reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the
student-organization forum. In requiring CLS—in com­

tween welcoming all students and forgoing the benefits of
official recognition, we hold, Hastings did not transgress
constitutional limitations. CLS, it bears emphasis, seeks
not parity with other organizations, but a preferential
exemption from Hastings’ policy. The First Amendment
shields CLS against state prohibition of the organization’s
expressive activity, however exclusionary that activity
may be. But CLS enjoys no constitutional right to state
subvention of its selectivity.

program, Hastings extends official recognition to student
groups. Several benefits attend this school-approved
