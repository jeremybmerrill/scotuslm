CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,
HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ
ALITO, J., dissenting

Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98,
112, and n. 4 (2001). See Rosenberger, supra, at 831;
Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,
508 U. S. 384, 393–394 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent, 454
U. S. 263, 277 (1981).
We have applied this analysis in cases in which student
speech was restricted because of the speaker’s religious
viewpoint, and we have consistently concluded that such
restrictions constitute viewpoint discrimination. E.g.,
Rosenberger, supra, at 845–846; Widmar, supra, at 267,
n. 5, 269, 277; see also Good News Club, supra, at 106–
107, 109–110; Lamb’s Chapel, supra, at 392–393, 394. We
have also stressed that the rules applicable in a limited
public forum are particularly important in the university
setting, where “the State acts against a background of
tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center
of our intellectual and philosophic tradition.” Rosenberger,
supra, at 835.

Analyzed under this framework, Hastings’ refusal to
register CLS pursuant to its Nondiscrimination Policy
plainly fails.3 As previously noted, when Hastings refused
——————
3 CLS sought a declaratory judgment that this policy is unconstitu
tional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement. See App. 80.
Particularly in light of Hastings’ practice of changing its announced
policies, these requests are not moot. It is well settled that the volun
tary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct does not moot a case in
which the legality of that conduct is challenged. See City of Mesquite v.
Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982); see also Allee v.
Medrano, 416 U. S. 802, 810–811 (1974); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416
U. S. 312, 318 (1974) (per curiam). If the rule were otherwise, the
courts would be compelled to leave “ ‘[t]he defendant . . . free to return
to his old ways.’ ” United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export
Assn., Inc., 393 U. S. 199, 203 (1968) (quoting United States v. W. T.
Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632 (1953)). Here, there is certainly a risk
that Hastings will “return to [its] old ways,” and therefore CLS’s
requests for declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Non
