CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,
HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ
ALITO, J., dissenting

appeal with a two-sentence, not-precedential opinion that
solely addressed the accept-all-comers policy. Christian
Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal. v. Kane, 319 Fed. Appx.
645–646 (2009).
Like the majority of this Court, the Ninth Circuit relied
on the following Joint Stipulation, which the parties filed
in December 2005, well after Dean Kane’s deposition:
“Hastings requires that registered student organiza
tions allow any student to participate, become a mem
ber, or seek leadership positions in the organization,
regardless of their status or beliefs.” App. 221.
Citing the binding effect of stipulations, the majority
sternly rejects what it terms “CLS’s unseemly attempt to
escape from the stipulation and shift its target to [the
Nondiscrimination Policy].” Ante, at 11–12.
I agree that the parties must be held to their Joint
Stipulation, but the terms of the stipulation should be
respected. What was admitted in the Joint Stipulation
filed in December 2005 is that Hastings had an accept-all
comers policy. CLS did not stipulate that its application
had been denied more than a year earlier pursuant to such
a policy. On the contrary, the Joint Stipulation notes that
the reason repeatedly given by Hasting at that time was
that the CLS bylaws did not comply with the Nondis
crimination Policy. See App. 228–229. Indeed, the parties
did not even stipulate that the accept-all-comers policy
existed in the fall of 2004. In addition, Hastings itself is
now attempting to walk away from this stipulation by
disclosing that its real policy is an accept-some-comers
policy.

not discriminate on the basis of belief”). Responding to these argu
ments, the law school remarked that CLS “repeatedly asserts that
‘Hastings routinely recognizes student groups that limit membership or
leadership on the basis of belief.’ ” Brief for Appellees in No. 06–15956
(CA9), p. 4.
