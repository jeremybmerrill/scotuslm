Opinion of the Court

115 (CLS maintained a Yahoo! message group to dissemi­
nate information to students.); Christian Legal Society v.
Walker, 453 F. 3d 853, 874 (CA7 2006) (Wood, J., dissent­
ing) (“Most universities and colleges, and most college­
aged students, communicate through email, websites, and
hosts like MySpace . . . . If CLS had its own website, any
student at the school with access to Google—that is, all of
them—could easily have found it.”). See also Brief for
Associated Students of the University of California, Hast­
ings College of Law as Amicus Curiae 14–18 (describing
host of ways CLS could communicate with Hastings’ stu­
dents outside official channels).
Private groups, from fraternities and sororities to social
clubs and secret societies, commonly maintain a presence
at universities without official school affiliation.21 Based
on the record before us, CLS was similarly situated: It
hosted a variety of activities the year after Hastings de­
nied it recognition, and the number of students attending
those meetings and events doubled. App. 224, 229–230.
“The variety and type of alternative modes of access pre­
sent here,” in short, “compare favorably with those in
other [limited public] forum cases where we have upheld
restrictions on access.” Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U. S., at 53–
54. It is beyond dissenter’s license, we note again, see
supra, at 21, n. 17, constantly to maintain that nonrecog­
nition of a student organization is equivalent to prohibit­
ing its members from speaking.

of . . . students” even though “they became completely disassociated
from the university in 1984”).
