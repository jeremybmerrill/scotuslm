Opinion of the Court

§1983. Its complaint alleged that Hastings’ refusal to
grant the organization RSO status violated CLS’s First
and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expres­
sive association, and free exercise of religion. The suit
sought injunctive and declaratory relief.4
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the U. S.
District Court for the Northern District of California ruled
in favor of Hastings. The Law School’s all-comers condi­
tion on access to a limited public forum, the court held,
was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and therefore
did not violate CLS’s right to free speech. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 27a–38a.
Nor, in the District Court’s view, did the Law School
impermissibly impair CLS’s right to expressive associa­
tion. “Hastings is not directly ordering CLS to admit [any]
studen[t],” the court observed, id., at 42a; “[r]ather, Hast­
ings has merely placed conditions on” the use of its facili­
ties and funds, ibid. “Hastings’ denial of official recogni­
tion,” the court added, “was not a substantial impediment
to CLS’s ability to meet and communicate as a group.” Id.,
at 49a.
The court also rejected CLS’s Free Exercise Clause
argument.
“[T]he Nondiscrimination Policy does not
target or single out religious beliefs,” the court noted;
rather, the policy “is neutral and of general applicability.”
Id., at 63a. “CLS may be motivated by its religious beliefs
to exclude students based on their religion or sexual orien­
tation,” the court explained, “but that does not convert the
reason for Hastings’ [Nondiscrimination Policy] to be one
that is religiously-based.” Id., at 63a–64a.
On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in an opinion that
stated, in full:
——————
4 The District Court allowed respondent Hastings Outlaw, an RSO
committed to “combating discrimination based on sexual orientation,”
id., at 97, to intervene in the suit, id., at 104.
