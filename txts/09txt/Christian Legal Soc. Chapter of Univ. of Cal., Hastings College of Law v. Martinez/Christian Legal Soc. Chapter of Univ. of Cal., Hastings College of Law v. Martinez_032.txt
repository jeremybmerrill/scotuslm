CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,
HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ
Opinion of the Court

4
CLS nevertheless deems Hastings’ all-comers policy
“frankly absurd.” Brief for Petitioner 49. “There can be no
diversity of viewpoints in a forum,” it asserts, “if groups
are not permitted to form around viewpoints.” Id., at 50;
accord post, at 25 (ALITO, J., dissenting). This catchphrase
confuses CLS’s preferred policy with constitutional limita­
tion—the advisability of Hastings’ policy does not control
its permissibility. See Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308,
326 (1975). Instead, we have repeatedly stressed that a
State’s restriction on access to a limited public forum
“need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable
limitation.” Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 808.22
CLS also assails the reasonableness of the all-comers
policy in light of the RSO forum’s function by forecasting
that the policy will facilitate hostile takeovers; if organiza­
tions must open their arms to all, CLS contends, saboteurs
will infiltrate groups to subvert their mission and mes­
sage. This supposition strikes us as more hypothetical
than real. CLS points to no history or prospect of RSO­
hijackings at Hastings. Cf. National Endowment for Arts
v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 584 (1998) (“[W]e are reluctant
. . . to invalidate legislation on the basis of its hypothetical
application to situations not before the Court.” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Students tend to self-sort and
presumably will not endeavor en masse to join—let alone
——————
22 CLS’s concern, shared by the dissent, see post, at 25–26, that an
all-comers policy will squelch diversity has not been borne out by
Hastings’ experience. In the 2004–2005 academic year, approximately
60 student organizations, representing a variety of interests, registered
with Hastings, from the Clara Foltz Feminist Association, to the
Environmental Law Society, to the Hastings Chinese Law and Culture
Society. App. 215, 237–238. Three of these 60 registered groups had a
religious orientation: Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students,
Hastings Jewish Law Students Association, and Hastings Koinonia.
Id., at 215–216.
