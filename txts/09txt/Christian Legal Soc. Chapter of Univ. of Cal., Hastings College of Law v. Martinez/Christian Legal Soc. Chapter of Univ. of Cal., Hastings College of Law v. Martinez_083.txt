ALITO, J., dissenting

address this issue of pretext because the Ninth Circuit did
not do so is hard to take, given that the Ninth Circuit
barely addressed anything, disposing of this case in pre
cisely two sentences.
Neither of those two sentences addressed the “novel
question,” ante, at 1, to which the bulk of this Court’s
opinion is devoted, i.e., whether the accept-all-comers

Hastings does not really have an accept-all-comers pol

those who seek a group’s “demise” (who may be kept out)
is hopelessly vague.
Here is an example. Not all Christian denominations
agree with CLS’s views on sexual morality and other
matters. During a recent year, CLS had seven members.
Suppose that 10 students who are members of denomina
tions that disagree with CLS decided that CLS was mis
representing true Christian doctrine. Suppose that these
students joined CLS, elected officers who shared their
