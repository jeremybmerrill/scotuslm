ment rights.” 408 U. S., at 187. Here, too, disapproval of
CLS cannot justify Hastings’ actions.2

The Court pays little attention to Healy and instead
focuses solely on the question whether Hastings’ registra
tion policy represents a permissible regulation in a limited
public forum. While I think that Healy is largely control
ling, I am content to address the constitutionality of Hast
ings’ actions under our limited public forum cases, which
lead to exactly the same conclusion.
In this case, the forum consists of the RSO program.
Once a public university opens a limited public forum, it
“must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.”
Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515
U. S. 819, 829 (1995). The university “may not exclude
speech where its distinction is not ‘reasonable in light of
the purpose served by the forum.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Corne
lius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S.
788, 806 (1985)). And the university must maintain strict
viewpoint neutrality. Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.
System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 234 (2000); Rosen
berger, supra, at 829.
This requirement of viewpoint neutrality extends to the
expression of religious viewpoints. In an unbroken line of
decisions analyzing private religious speech in limited
public forums, we have made it perfectly clear that
“[r]eligion is [a] viewpoint from which ideas are conveyed.”

2 The Court attempts to distinguish Healy on the ground that there
the college “explicitly denied the student group official recognition
because of the group’s viewpoint.” Ante, at 17, n. 15. The same, how
ever, is true here. CLS was denied recognition under the Nondiscrimi
nation Policy because of the viewpoint that CLS sought to express
through its membership requirements. See supra, at 5; infra, at 18–23.
And there is strong evidence that Hastings abruptly shifted from the
Nondiscrimination Policy to the accept-all-comers policy as a pretext for
viewpoint discrimination. See infra, at 31–35.
