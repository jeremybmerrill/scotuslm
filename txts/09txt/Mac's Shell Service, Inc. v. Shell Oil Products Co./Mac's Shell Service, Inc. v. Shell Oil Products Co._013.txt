MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL 

PRODUCTS CO.
Opinion of the Court 





habit of years might lead franchisees to try to make the
new arrangements work, even when the terms have
changed so materially as to make success impossible.” 524
F. 3d, at 46. But surely these same factors compel em
ployees and tenants—no less than service-station franchi
sees—to try to make their changed arrangements work.
Nonetheless, courts have long required plaintiffs asserting
such claims to show an actual severance of the relevant
legal relationship. We see no reason for a different rule
here.
Additionally, allowing franchisees to obtain PMPA relief
for conduct that does not force an end to a franchise would
extend the reach of the Act much further than its text and
structure suggest. Prior to 1978, the regulation of petro
leum franchise agreements was largely a matter of state
law. See Dersch Energies, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F. 3d
846, 861 (CA7 2002); Comment, 32 Emory L. J. 273, 277–
283 (1983). In enacting the PMPA, Congress did not
regulate every aspect of the petroleum franchise relation
ship but instead federalized only the two parts of that
relationship with which it was most concerned: the cir
cumstances in which franchisors may terminate a fran
chise or decline to renew a franchise relationship. See 15
U. S. C. §2802; Dersch Energies, supra, at 861–862. Con
gress left undisturbed state-law regulation of other types
of disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchi
sees. See §2806(a) (pre-empting only those state laws
governing franchise terminations or nonrenewals).
The dealers would have us interpret the PMPA in a
manner that ignores the Act’s limited scope. On their
view, and in the view of the Court of Appeals, the PMPA
prohibits, not just unlawful terminations and nonrenew
als, but also certain serious breaches of contract that do
not cause an end to the franchise. See Brief for Respon
dents in No. 08–372, pp. 28–35 (hereinafter Respondents’
Brief); 524 F. 3d, at 44–47. Reading the Act to prohibit
