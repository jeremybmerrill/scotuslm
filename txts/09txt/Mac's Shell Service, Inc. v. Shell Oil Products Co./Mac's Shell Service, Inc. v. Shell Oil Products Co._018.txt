Opinion of the Court

maintain a constructive termination claim on the basis of
that conduct.
III
The second question we are asked to decide is whether a
franchisee who is offered and signs a renewal agreement
can nonetheless maintain a claim for “constructive nonre
newal” under the PMPA. For reasons similar to those
given above, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a
franchisee that chooses to accept a renewal agreement
cannot thereafter assert a claim for unlawful nonrenewal
under the Act.11
The plain text of the statute leaves no room for a fran
chisee to claim that a franchisor has unlawfully declined
——————
agreements and then signed new agreements that did not include the
subsidy. See App. 161, 164, 316–321 (Mac’s Shell Service, Inc.); id., at
138–139, 314–315 (Cynthia Karol); id., at 154–155, 310–311 (Akmal,
Inc.); id., at 185–186, 268–269 (Sid Prashad); id., at 190, 312–313 (J &
M Avramidis, Inc.); id., at 179–182, 322–323 (RAM Corp., Inc.); id., at
148–153, 324–325 (John A. Sullivan). These dealers necessarily cannot
establish that the elimination of the subsidy “terminate[d]” their
franchises “prior to the conclusion of the term” stated in their franchise
agreements. 15 U. S. C. §2802(a)(1). Whether they ceased operations
after their franchise agreements expired, moreover, is irrelevant.
Indeed, in the Court of Appeals, the dealers abandoned any claim for
constructive termination based on the subsequent franchise agree
ments. See Appellees’ Brief in No. 05–2770 etc. (CA1), p. 40, n. 29.
One dealer did leave his franchise before his franchise agreement
expired. App. 204, 330–331 (Stephen Pisarczyk). But that dealer not
only continued to operate for seven months after the subsidy ended, id.,
at 204, but also during that period entered into an agreement with
Motiva to extend the term of his franchise agreement, id., at 330–331.
Moreover, that dealer had been planning to leave the service-station
business before Motiva eliminated the subsidy, and he never claimed
that his decision to leave had anything to do with Motiva’s rent policies.
See id., at 202–207.
11 As is true with respect to the dealers’ constructive termination
claims, it is not necessary for us to decide in these cases whether the
Act at all recognizes claims for “constructive nonrenewal.” We there
fore do not express a view on that question.
