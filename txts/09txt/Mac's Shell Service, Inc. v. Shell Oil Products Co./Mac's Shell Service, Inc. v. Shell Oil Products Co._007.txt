Opinion of the Court 





cancellation [of the rent subsidy] with thirty days’ notice.”
Marcoux v. Shell Oil Prods. Co., 524 F. 3d 33, 38 (CA1
2008). Nonetheless, Shell representatives made various
oral representations to the franchisees “that the [s]ubsidy
or something like it would always exist.” Ibid.
In 1998, Shell joined with two other oil companies to
create Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva), a joint venture
that combined the companies’ petroleum-marketing opera
tions in the eastern United States. Id., at 37. Shell as
signed to Motiva its rights and obligations under the
relevant franchise agreements. Motiva, in turn, took two
actions that led to this lawsuit. First, effective January 1,
2000, Motiva ended the volume-based rent subsidy, thus
increasing the franchisees’ rent. Id., at 38. Second, as
each franchise agreement expired, Motiva offered the
franchisees new agreements that contained a different
formula for calculating rent. For some (but not all) of the
franchisees, annual rent was greater under the new
formula.

In July 2001, 63 Shell franchisees (hereinafter dealers)
filed suit against Shell and Motiva in Federal District
Court. Their complaint alleged that Motiva’s discontinua
tion of the rent subsidy constituted a breach of contract
under state law. Additionally, the dealers asserted two
claims under the PMPA. First, they maintained that Shell
and Motiva, by eliminating the rent subsidy, had “con
structively terminated” their franchises in violation of the
Act. Second, they claimed that Motiva’s offer of new fran
chise agreements that calculated rent using a different
formula amounted to a “constructive nonrenewal” of their
franchise relationships.3

Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted in Massachusetts, by setting
unreasonable prices under the open-price terms of their fuel-supply
