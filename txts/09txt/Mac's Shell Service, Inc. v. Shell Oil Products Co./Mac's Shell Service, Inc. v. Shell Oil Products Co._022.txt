Opinion of the Court

franchisor seeks nonrenewal, the franchisee runs the risk
that a court will ultimately determine that the proposed
terms were lawful under the PMPA. See §2802(b)(3)(A).
That risk acts as a restraint, limiting the scope of franchi
sor liability under the Act to that with which Congress
was most concerned: the imposition of arbitrary and un
reasonable new terms on a franchisee that are designed to
force an end to the petroleum franchise relationship. See,
e.g., ibid.; Comment, 32 Emory L. J., at 277–283. Allow
ing franchisees both to sign a franchise agreement and to
pursue a claim under the PMPA would eliminate that
restraint and thus permit franchisees to challenge a much
broader range of franchisor conduct—conduct to which the
dealer might object but not consider so serious as to risk
the nonrenewal of the franchise by mounting a legal chal
lenge. As explained, the PMPA was enacted to address
the narrow areas of franchise terminations and nonre
newals, not to govern every aspect of the petroleum fran
chise relationship. See supra, at 10; Dersch Energies, 314
F. 3d, at 861. We thus decline to adopt an interpretation
that would expand the Act in such a fashion.13

We hold that a franchisee who is offered and signs a
renewed franchise agreement cannot maintain a claim for
unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA. We therefore
affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect

13 It also is worth noting that, although the concept of “constructive
nonrenewal” does not arise frequently in other areas of the law, the
little authority on this concept supports our conclusion that a plaintiff
who signs a new agreement cannot maintain a claim for constructive
nonrenewal. See American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Baker, 22 F. 3d
880, 892–894 (CA9 1994) (insured who accepts a successor insurance
policy cannot maintain a claim for constructive nonrenewal of the
previous policy); American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Continisio, 17
F. 3d 62, 65–66 (CA3 1994) (same); Adams v. Greenwood, 10 F. 3d 568,
572 (CA8 1993) (same).
