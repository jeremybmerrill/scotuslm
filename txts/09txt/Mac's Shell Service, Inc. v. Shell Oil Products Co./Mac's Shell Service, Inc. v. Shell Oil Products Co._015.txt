MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL 

PRODUCTS CO.
Opinion of the Court 





whether a breach is serious enough effectively to end a
franchise when the franchisee is still willing and able to
continue its operations? And how is a franchisor to know
in advance which breaches a court will later determine to
have been so serious? The dealers have not provided
answers to these questions. Nor could they. Any standard
for identifying when a simple breach of contract amounts
to a PMPA termination, when all three statutory elements
remain operational, simply evades coherent formulation.

The dealers suggest that this interpretation of the
PMPA fails to provide franchisees with much-needed
protection from unfair and coercive franchisor conduct
that does not force an end to the franchise. That argu
ment, however, ignores the fact that franchisees still have
state-law remedies available to them. The pre-emptive
scope of the PMPA is limited: The Act pre-empts only
those state or local laws that govern the termination of
petroleum franchises or the nonrenewal of petroleum
franchise relationships. See 15 U. S. C. §2806(a). Outside
of those areas, therefore, franchisees can still rely on
state-law remedies to address wrongful franchisor conduct
that does not have the effect of ending the franchise.
Indeed, that happened in this very lawsuit. The dealers
argued in the District Court that Motiva’s elimination of
the rent subsidy not only constructively terminated their
franchises in violation of the PMPA but also amounted to
a breach of contract under state law. The jury found in
their favor on their state-law claims and awarded them
almost $1.3 million in damages. See App. 376–379. Thus,
the dealers’ own experience demonstrates that franchisees
do not need a PMPA remedy to have meaningful protec
tion from abusive franchisor conduct.
The dealers also charge that this interpretation of the
PMPA cannot be correct because it renders other provi
