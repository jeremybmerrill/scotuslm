MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL 

PRODUCTS CO.
Opinion of the Court 





agreement complained of.” Id., at 49. The court thus
reversed the judgment on those claims.
We granted certiorari. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).
II
The first question we are asked to decide is whether a
service-station franchisee may recover for constructive
termination under the PMPA when the franchisor’s alleg
edly wrongful conduct did not force the franchisee to
abandon its franchise. For the reasons that follow, we
conclude that a necessary element of any constructive
termination claim under the Act is that the franchisor’s
conduct forced an end to the franchisee’s use of the fran
chisor’s trademark, purchase of the franchisor’s fuel, or
occupation of the franchisor’s service station.4
A
When given its ordinary meaning, the text of the PMPA
prohibits only that franchisor conduct that has the effect
of ending a franchise. As relevant here, the Act provides
that “no franchisor . . . may . . . terminate any franchise,”
except for an enumerated reason and after providing
written notice. 15 U. S. C. §2802(a)–(b). The Act specifies
that “[t]he term ‘termination’ includes cancellation,”

resolving this question is sufficient to decide these cases,
we need not address Shell and Motiva’s alternative argument that the

Several Courts of Appeals have held that the Act does create a cause of
action for constructive termination. See, e.g., 524 F. 3d, at 44–45 (case
below); Clark v. BP Oil Co., 137 F. 3d 386, 390–391 (CA6 1998); Shukla
v. BP Exploration & Oil, Inc., 115 F. 3d 849, 852–853 (CA11 1997).
Others have reserved judgment on the issue. See, e.g., Abrams Shell v.
Shell Oil Co., 343 F. 3d 482, 486–488 (CA5 2003); Portland 76
Auto/Truck Plaza, Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 153 F. 3d 938, 948
(CA9 1998). We leave the question for another day.
