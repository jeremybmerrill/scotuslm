MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL 

PRODUCTS CO.
Opinion of the Court 





dealers’ assertions, therefore, our interpretation of the Act
gives meaningful effect to the PMPA’s preliminary injunc
tion provisions.
Our interpretation also gives effect to the Act’s alterna
tive statute-of-limitations accrual dates. The 1-year limi
tations period governing PMPA claims runs from the later
of either (1) “the date of termination of the franchise” or
(2) “the date the franchisor fails to comply with the re
quirements of” the Act. §2805(a). Some violations of the
PMPA, however, cannot occur until after a franchise has
been terminated. See, e.g., §2802(d)(1) (franchisor must
share with a franchisee certain parts of a condemnation
award when the termination was the result of a condem
nation or taking); §2802(d)(2) (franchisor must grant a
franchisee a right of first refusal if the franchise was
terminated due to the destruction of the service station
and the station subsequently is rebuilt). The second ac
crual date listed in §2805(a), therefore, shows only that
the limitations period runs from the date of these types of
post-termination violations. It does not suggest that
Congress intended franchisees to maintain claims under
the PMPA to redress franchisor conduct that does not
force an end to the franchise.

We therefore hold that a necessary element of any con
structive termination claim under the PMPA is that the
complained-of conduct forced an end to the franchisee’s
use of the franchisor’s trademark, purchase of the franchi
sor’s fuel, or occupation of the franchisor’s service station.
Because none of the dealers in this litigation abandoned
any element of their franchise operations in response to
Motiva’s elimination of the rent subsidy,10 they cannot
——————
we need not address this argument.
10 After Motiva withdrew the rent subsidy, seven of the dealers con
tinued operating their franchises for the full terms of their franchise
