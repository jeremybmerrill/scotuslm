those terms their ordinary meanings. See Asgrow Seed
Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995).
The word “terminate” ordinarily means “put an end to.”
Webster’s New International Dictionary 2605 (2d ed.
1957); see also The Random House Dictionary of the Eng
lish Language 1465 (1967). The term “cancel” carries a
similar meaning: to “annul or destroy.” Webster’s, supra,
at 389; see also Random House, supra, at 215 (“to make
void; revoke; annul”). The object of the verb “terminate” is
the noun “franchise,” a term the Act defines as “any con
tract” for the provision of one (or more) of the three ele
ments of a typical petroleum franchise. §2801(1). Thus,
when given its ordinary meaning, the Act is violated only
if an agreement for the use of a trademark, purchase of
motor fuel, or lease of a premises is “put [to] an end” or
“annul[ed] or destroy[ed].” Conduct that does not force an
end to the franchise, in contrast, is not prohibited by the
Act’s plain terms.
The same conclusion follows even if Congress was using
the words “terminate” and “cancel” in their technical,
rather than ordinary, senses. When Congress enacted the
PMPA, those terms had established meanings under the
Uniform Commercial Code.5

difference between a “termination” and a “cancellation” under
the Uniform Commercial Code relates to how the contracting party
justifies its ending of the contractual relationship. A “termination”
occurs when “either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or
law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach.” U. C. C.
§2–106(3) (1972 ed.). By contrast, a “cancellation” occurs when “either
party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other.” §2–106(4).
That difference might well explain why Congress felt compelled to
specify that “cancellation[s],” no less than “termination[s],” are covered
by the Act. Prior to the PMPA, franchisors often leveraged their
greater bargaining power to end franchise agreements for minor or
technical breaches by the franchisee. See, e.g., Chestnut Hill Gulf, Inc.
v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 940 F. 2d 744, 746–747 (CA1 1991). By
specifying that the Act covers “cancellation[s]” as well as “termina
