Opinion of the Court

rule under that doctrine is that a tenant must actually
move out in order to claim constructive eviction. See id.,
at 75; Glendon, The Transformation of American Land
lord-Tenant Law, 23 Boston College L. Rev. 503, 513–514
(1982); 1 H. Tiffany, Real Property §§141, 143 (3d ed.
1939).6
As generally understood in these and other contexts, a
termination is deemed “constructive” because it is the
plaintiff, rather than the defendant, who formally puts an
end to the particular legal relationship—not because there
is no end to the relationship at all. There is no reason why
a different understanding should apply to constructive
termination claims under the PMPA. At the time when it
enacted the statute, Congress presumably was aware of
how courts applied the doctrine of constructive termina
tion in these analogous legal contexts. See Fitzgerald v.
Barnstable School Comm., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip

Congress enacted the PMPA, at least one court, it is true,
had held that a tenant asserting constructive eviction could obtain
declaratory relief without abandoning the premises—although the court
observed that the tenant still would have to abandon the premises in
order to obtain rescission. See Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand
Corp., 340 Mass. 124, 129–130, 163 N. E. 2d 4, 7–8 (1959). But as even
the dealers concede, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38, the clear majority of
authority required a tenant to leave the premises before claiming
constructive eviction.
For similar reasons, the Second Restatement of Property is of no help
to the dealers. Although it would allow a tenant to bring a constructive
eviction claim without moving out, it noted that this proposition was
“contrary to the present weight of judicial authority.” 1 Restatement
