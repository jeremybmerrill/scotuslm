tion. It is violated only when a franchisor “fail[s] to renew” a fran
chise relationship for an enumerated reason or fails to provide the
required notice, see §2802, and it defines “fail to renew” as a “failure
to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise relationship,”
§2801(14). A franchisee that signs a renewal agreement cannot carry
the threshold burden of showing a “nonrenewal of the franchise rela
tionship,” §2805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish that the
franchisor has violated the Act. Signing their renewal agreements
“under protest” did not preserve the dealers’ ability to assert nonre
newal claims. When a franchisee signs a renewal agreement—even
“under protest”—there has been no “fail[ure] to renew,” and thus no
violation of the Act. The Act’s structure and purpose confirm this in
terpretation. Accepting the dealers’ contrary reading would greatly
expand the Act’s reach. Pp. 15–19.
524 F. 3d 33, reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.
ALITO, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
