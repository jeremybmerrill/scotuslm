MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL 

PRODUCTS CO.
Opinion of the Court 





however, a “termination” or “cancellation” occurs only
when a contracting party “puts an end to the contract.”
U. C. C. §2–106(3)–(4) (1972 ed.); see also U. C. C. §2–
106(3)–(4), 1 U. L. A. 695, 695–696 (2004). Thus, a fran
chisee who continues operating a franchise—occupying the
same premises, receiving the same fuel, and using the
same trademark—has not had the franchise “termi
nate[d]” in either the ordinary or technical sense of the
word.
Requiring franchisees to abandon their franchises before
claiming constructive termination is also consistent with
the general understanding of the doctrine of constructive
termination. As applied in analogous legal contexts—both
now and at the time Congress enacted the PMPA—a
plaintiff must actually sever a particular legal relationship
in order to maintain a claim for constructive termination.
For example, courts have long recognized a theory of
constructive discharge in the field of employment law. See
Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 141–
143 (2004) (tracing the doctrine to the 1930’s). To recover
for constructive discharge, however, an employee gener
ally is required to quit his or her job. See 1 B. Lindemann
& P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1449
(4th ed. 2007); 3 L. Larson, Labor and Employment Law
§59.05[8] (2009); 2 EEOC Compliance Manual §612.9(a)
(2008); cf. Suders, supra, at 141–143, 148; Young v. South
western Savings & Loan Assn., 509 F. 2d 140, 144 (CA5
1975); Muller v. United States Steel Corp., 509 F. 2d 923,
929 (CA10 1975). Similarly, landlord-tenant law has long
recognized the concept of constructive eviction. See Ra
pacz, Origin and Evolution of Constructive Eviction in the
United States, 1 DePaul L. Rev. 69 (1951). The general
—————— 

tion[s],” Congress foreclosed any argument that a termination for 

breach is not covered by the Act because it is technically a “cancella

tion” rather than a “termination.”
