WROTTEN v. NEW YORK
Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.

“[f]inal judgmen[t]” under 28 U. S. C. §1257(a). Moreover,
even if we found the judgment final, in reviewing the case
at this stage we would not have the benefit of the state
courts’ full consideration.
In light of the procedural difficulties that arise from the
interlocutory posture, I agree with the Court’s decision to
deny the petition for certiorari. But following the example
of some of my colleagues, “I think it appropriate to empha
size that the Court’s action does not constitute a ruling on
the merits and certainly does not represent an expression
of any opinion concerning” the importance of the question
presented. Moreland v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 547
U. S. 1106, 1107 (2006) (STEVENS, J., statement respecting
denial of certiorari).
