Opinion of the Court

claim for relief.” 546 U. S., at 503. We held that it does
the latter.
Our holding turned principally on our examination of
the text of §2000e(b), the section in which Title VII’s nu
merosity requirement appears. Section 2000e(b) does not
“clearly stat[e]” that the employee numerosity threshold
on Title VII’s scope “count[s] as jurisdictional.” Id., at
515–516, and n. 11. And nothing in our prior Title VII
cases compelled the conclusion that even though the nu
merosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it
nonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit. See id., at
511–513. Similarly, §2000e(b)’s text and structure did not
demonstrate that Congress “rank[ed]” that requirement as
jurisdictional. See id., at 513–516. As we observed, the
employee numerosity requirement is located in a provision
“separate” from §2000e–5(f)(3), Title VII’s jurisdiction
granting section, distinguishing it from the “amount-in
controversy threshold ingredient of subject-matter juris
diction . . . in diversity-of-jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.
§1332.” Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 514–515. Accordingly, the
numerosity requirement could not fairly be read to “ ‘speak
in jurisdictional terms or in any way refer to the jurisdic
tion of the district courts.’ ” Id., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.
Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)). We
thus “refrain[ed] from” construing the numerosity re
quirement to “constric[t] §1331 or Title VII’s jurisdictional
provision.” Arbaugh, supra, at 515 (internal quotation
marks omitted).
We now apply this same approach to §411(a).
