Opinion of the Court

Rather, Bowles stands for the proposition that context,
including this Court’s interpretation of similar provisions
in many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks
a requirement as jurisdictional.
In Bowles, we considered 28 U. S. C. §2107, which re
quires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal
within 30 days of the judgment being appealed, and Rule 4
of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which “car
ries §2107 into practice.” 551 U. S., at 208. After analyz
ing §2107’s specific language and this Court’s historical
treatment of the type of limitation §2107 imposes (i.e.,
statutory deadlines for filing appeals), we concluded that
Congress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdic
tional. Our focus in Bowles on the historical treatment of
statutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consis
tent with the Arbaugh framework. Indeed, Bowles em
phasized that this Court had long treated such conditions
as jurisdictional, including in statutes other than §2107,
and specifically in statutes that predated the creation of
the courts of appeals. See 551 U. S., at 209–210, and n. 2.
Bowles therefore demonstrates that the relevant ques
tion here is not (as amicus puts it) whether §411(a) itself
has long been labeled jurisdictional, but whether the type
of limitation that §411(a) imposes is one that is properly
ranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation.
The statutory limitation in Bowles was of a type that we
had long held did “speak in jurisdictional terms” even
absent a “jurisdictional” label, and nothing about §2107’s
text or context, or the historical treatment of that type of
limitation, justified a departure from this view. That was
not the case, however, for the types of conditions in Zipes
and Arbaugh.
Here, that same analysis leads us to conclude that
§411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter jurisdiction
