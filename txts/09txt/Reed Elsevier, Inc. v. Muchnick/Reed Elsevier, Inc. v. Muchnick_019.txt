REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK
Opinion of the Court

whether the District Court had authority to approve the
settlement even under the Court of Appeals’ erroneous
reading of §411. In concluding that the District Court had
jurisdiction to approve the settlement, we express no
opinion on the settlement’s merits.
We also decline to address whether §411(a)’s registra
tion requirement is a mandatory precondition to suit
that—like the threshold conditions in Arizona v. Califor
nia, 530 U. S. 392, 412–413 (2000) (res judicata defense);
Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205–206 (2006) (habeas
statute of limitations); and Hallstrom v. Tillamook
County, 493 U. S. 20, 26, 31 (1989) (Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act of 1976 notice provision)—district courts
may or should enforce sua sponte by dismissing copyright
infringement claims involving unregistered works.

We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit and remand this case for proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
