Opinion of the Court

specific time periods within which a discrimination claim
ant must file a lawsuit after filing a charge with the
EEOC). A statutory condition that requires a party to
take some action before filing a lawsuit is not automati
cally “a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.” Zipes, 455
U. S., at 393 (emphasis added). Rather, the jurisdictional
analysis must focus on the “legal character” of the re
quirement, id., at 395, which we discerned by looking to
the condition’s text, context, and relevant historical treat
ment, id., at 393–395; see also National Railroad Passen
ger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 119–121 (2002).
We similarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types
of threshold requirements that claimants must complete,
or exhaust, before filing a lawsuit.6
The registration requirement in 17 U. S. C. A. §411(a)
fits in this mold. Section 411(a) imposes a precondition to
filing a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional, is
not located in a jurisdiction-granting provision, and ad
mits of congressionally authorized exceptions.
See
§§411(a)–(c). Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of pre
condition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment
under our precedents.

Amicus insists that our decision in Bowles, 551 U. S.

today. Amicus cites Bowles for the proposition that where
Congress did not explicitly label a statutory condition as

trative exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of
1995 (PLRA)—which states that “no action shall be brought with
respect to prison conditions under §1983 of this title, or any other
Federal law, by a prisoner . . . until such administrative remedies as
are available are exhausted,” 42 U. S. C. §1997e(a)—as an affirmative
defense even though “[t]here is no question that exhaustion is manda
tory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought
in court”); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 93 (2006) (same).
