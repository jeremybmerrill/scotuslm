REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK
Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

istrable bright line”:
“If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi
tation on a statute’s scope shall count as jurisdic
tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in
structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.
But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita
tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat
the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character. Ap
plying that readily administrable bright line to this
case, we hold that the threshold number of employees
for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff’s
claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.” 546 U. S.,
at 515–516 (citation and footnote omitted).
As the above-quoted passage indicates, the unanimous
Arbaugh Court anticipated that all federal courts would
thereafter adhere to the “bright line” held dispositive that
day.
Bowles moved in a different direction. A sharply divided
Court there held “mandatory and jurisdictional” the time
limits for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.
§2107(a), (c). 551 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Bowles mentioned Arbaugh only to distinguish
it as involving a statute setting “an employee-numerosity
requirement, not a time limit.” 551 U. S., at 211. Section
2107’s time limits were “jurisdictional,” Bowles explained,
because they were contained in a statute, not merely a
rule, id., at 210–213, and because “[t]his Court ha[d] long
held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed
time is ‘mandatory and jurisdictional,’ ” id., at 209. Fidel
ity to Arbaugh and similarly reasoned decisions,* the
dissent in Bowles observed, would have yielded the conclu
sion that statutory time limits “are only jurisdictional if
