REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK
Opinion of the Court

work shall be instituted until preregistration or regis
tration of the copyright claim has been made in accor
dance with this title. In any case, however, where the
deposit, application, and fee required for registration
have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper
form and registration has been refused, the applicant
is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if
notice thereof, with a copy of the complaint, is served
on the Register of Copyrights. The Register may, at
his or her option, become a party to the action with
respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright
claim by entering an appearance within sixty days af
ter such service, but the Register’s failure to become a
party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to de
termine that issue.”
We must consider whether §411(a) “clearly states” that
its registration requirement is “jurisdictional.” Arbaugh,
supra, at 515. It does not. Amicus disagrees, pointing to
the presence of the word “jurisdiction” in the last sentence
of §411(a) and contending that the use of the term there
indicates the jurisdictional cast of §411(a)’s first sentence
as well. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in
support of Judgment Below 18 (hereinafter Amicus Brief).
But this reference to “jurisdiction” cannot bear the weight
that amicus places upon it. The sentence upon which
amicus relies states:
“The Register [of Copyrights] may, at his or her op
tion, become a party to the [copyright infringement]
action with respect to the issue of registrability of the
copyright claim by entering an appearance within
sixty days after such service, but the Register’s failure
to become a party shall not deprive the court of juris
diction to determine that issue.” §411(a) (emphasis
added).
Congress added this sentence to the Act in 1976, 90
