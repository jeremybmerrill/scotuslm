REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK
Opinion of the Court

jurisdictional, a court nevertheless should treat it as such
if that is how the condition consistently has been inter
preted and if Congress has not disturbed that interpreta
tion. Amicus Brief 26. Specifically, amicus relies on a
footnote in Bowles to argue that here, as in Bowles, it
would be improper to characterize the statutory condition
as nonjurisdictional because doing so would override “ ‘a
century’s worth of precedent’ ” treating §411(a)’s registra
tion requirement as jurisdictional. Amicus Brief 26 (quot
ing Bowles, supra, at 209, n. 2). This argument focuses
on the result in Bowles, rather than on the analysis we
employed.
Bowles did not hold that any statutory condition devoid
of an express jurisdictional label should be treated as
jurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as
such. Nor did it hold that all statutory conditions impos
ing a time limit should be considered jurisdictional.7

7 Bowles, for example, distinguished Scarborough v. Principi, 541
U. S. 401 (2004), which characterized as nonjurisdictional an express
statutory time limit for initiating postjudgment proceedings for attor
ney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. See 551 U. S., at 211.
As we explained, the time limit in Scarborough “concerned ‘a mode of
relief . . . ancillary to the judgment of a court’ that already had plenary
jurisdiction.” 551 U. S., at 211 (quoting Scarborough, supra, at 413;
(emphasis added)). Bowles also distinguished Kontrick v. Ryan, 540
U. S. 443 (2004), and Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per
curiam), as cases in which the Court properly held that certain time
limits were nonjurisdictional because they were imposed by rules that
did not purport to have any jurisdictional significance. See 551 U. S.,
at 210–211. Kontrick involved “time constraints applicable to objec
tions to discharge” in bankruptcy proceedings. 540 U. S., at 453. In
that case, we first examined 28 U. S. C. §157(b)(2)(J), the statute
“conferring jurisdiction over objections to discharge,” and observed that
it did not contain a timeliness requirement. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 453.
Rather, the “time constraints applicable to objections to discharge”
were contained in the Bankruptcy Rules, which expressly state that
they “ ‘shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the
courts.’ ” See ibid. (quoting Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9030). Eberhart, in
turn, treated as nonjurisdictional certain rules that the Court held
