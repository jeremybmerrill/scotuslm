REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK
Opinion of the Court

Nor does any other factor suggest that 17 U. S. C. A.
§411(a)’s registration requirement can be read to “ ‘speak
in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdic
tion of the district courts.’ ” Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515
(quoting Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394). First, and most signifi
cantly, §411(a) expressly allows courts to adjudicate in
fringement claims involving unregistered works in three
circumstances: where the work is not a U. S. work, where
the infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and
integrity under §106A, or where the holder attempted to
register the work and registration was refused. Sepa
rately, §411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement
actions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the
author “declare[s] an intention to secure copyright in the
work” and “makes registration for the work, if required by
subsection (a), within three months after [the work’s] first
transmission.” 17 U. S. C. §§411(c)(1)–(2). It would be at
least unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a
condition subject to these sorts of exceptions.5
That the numerosity requirement in Arbaugh could be
considered an element of a Title VII claim, rather than a
prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit, does not change this
conclusion, as our decision in Zipes demonstrates. Zipes
(upon which Arbaugh relied) held that Title VII’s require
ment that sex-discrimination claimants timely file a dis
crimination charge with the EEOC before filing a civil
action in federal court was nonjurisdictional. See 455
U. S., at 393; 42 U. S. C. §2000e–5(f)(1) (establishing

Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393–394, 397 (relying on the fact that Con
gress had “approved” at least some cases awarding Title VII relief to
claimants who had not complied with the statute’s Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filing requirement in holding that the
filing requirement was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit); United
States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630 (2002) (“[J]urisdiction” properly
refers to a court’s power to hear a case, a matter that “can never be
forfeited or waived”).
