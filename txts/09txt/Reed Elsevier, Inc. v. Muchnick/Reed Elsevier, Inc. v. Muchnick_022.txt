Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

Congress says so.” 551 U. S., at 217 (opinion of Souter, J.).
Bowles and Arbaugh can be reconciled without distort
ing either decision, however, on the ground that Bowles
“rel[ied] on a long line of this Court’s decisions left undis
turbed by Congress.” Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive
Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment,
Central Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13)
(citing Bowles, 551 U. S., at 209–211). The same is true of
our decision, subsequent to Bowles, in John R. Sand &
Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130 (2008). There
the Court concluded, largely on stare decisis grounds, that
the Court of Federal Claims statute of limitations requires
sua sponte consideration of a lawsuit’s timeliness. Id., at
136 (“[P]etitioner can succeed only by convincing us that
this Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn,
its earlier precedent.”).
Plainly read, Arbaugh and Bowles both point to the
conclusion that §411(a) is nonjurisdictional.
Section
411(a) “does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in
any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.” Zipes,
455 U. S., at 394. Arbaugh’s “readily administrable bright
line” is therefore controlling. 546 U. S., at 516.
Bowles does not detract from that determination.
Amicus, reading Bowles as I do, urges on its authority that
we hold §411(a) jurisdictional lest we disregard “ ‘a cen
tury’s worth of precedent.’ ” Brief for Court-Appointed
Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 26 (quoting
Bowles, 551 U. S., at 209, n. 2); see ante, at 12. But in
Bowles and John R. Sand & Gravel Co., as just explained,
we relied on longstanding decisions of this Court typing
the relevant prescriptions “jurisdictional.” Bowles, 551
U. S., at 209–210 (citing, inter alia, Scarborough v. Par
goud, 108 U. S. 567 (1883), and United States v. Curry, 6
How. 106 (1848)); John R. Sand & Gravel Co., 552 U. S.,
at 136. Amicus cites well over 200 opinions that charac
terize §411(a) as jurisdictional, but not one is from this
