Maine, 532 U. S. 742, 750 (2001)).
We agree that some statements in the parties’ submis
sions to the District Court and the Court of Appeals are in
tension with their arguments here. But we decline to
apply judicial estoppel. As we explained in New Hamp
shire, that doctrine typically applies when, among other
things, a “party has succeeded in persuading a court to
accept that party’s earlier position, so that judicial accep

the Court of Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether
§411(a) restricted the District Court’s subject-matter

for Petitioners 3a–5a, and n. 2. Accepting petitioners’
arguments here thus cannot create “inconsistent court
determinations” in their favor. New Hampshire, supra, at

Our holding that §411(a) does not restrict a federal
court’s subject-matter jurisdiction precludes the need for
us to address the parties’ alternative arguments as to
