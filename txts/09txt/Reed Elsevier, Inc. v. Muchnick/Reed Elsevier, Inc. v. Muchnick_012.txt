Opinion of the Court

Stat. 2583, to clarify that a federal court can determine
“the issue of registrability of the copyright claim” even if
the Register does not appear in the infringement suit.
That clarification was necessary because courts had inter
preted §411(a)’s precursor provision,4 which imposed a
similar registration requirement, as prohibiting copyright
owners who had been refused registration by the Register
of Copyrights from suing for infringement until the owners
first sought mandamus against the Register.
See
Vacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus
Watch Co., 260 F. 2d 637, 640–641 (CA2 1958) (construing
§411(a)’s precursor). The 1976 amendment made it clear
that a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to
determine “that issue,” §411(a) (emphasis added)—i.e., the
issue of registrability—regardless of whether the Register
is a party to the infringement suit. The word “jurisdic
tion,” as used here, thus says nothing about whether a
federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate
claims for infringement of unregistered works.
Moreover, §411(a)’s registration requirement, like Title
VII’s numerosity requirement, is located in a provision
“separate” from those granting federal courts subject
matter jurisdiction over those respective claims. See
Arbaugh, supra, at 514–515. Federal district courts have
subject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement
actions based on 28 U. S. C. §§1331 and 1338. But neither
§1331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over
questions of federal law, nor §1338(a), which is specific to
copyright claims, conditions its jurisdictional grant on
whether copyright holders have registered their works
before suing for infringement. Cf. Arbaugh, supra, at 515
(“Title VII’s jurisdictional provision” does not “specif[y]
any threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S. C. §1332’s mone
tary floor”).
