Syllabus
quate pretrial preparation time.
See §§3161(h)(7)(B)(ii),
3161(h)(7)(B)(iv). The Court’s determination that the delay at issue
is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7),
and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only
where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion. The
Court’s precedents also support this reading of subsection (h)(1). See
Zedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 502. Pp. 10–16.
(c) The Act does not force a district court to choose between reject
ing a defendant’s request for time to prepare pretrial motions and
risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the
trial. A court may still exclude preparation time under subsection
(h)(7) by granting a continuance for that purpose based on recorded
findings. Subsection (h)(7) provides “[m]uch of the Act’s flexibility,”
Zedner, 547 U. S., at 498, giving district courts “discretion . . . to ac
commodate limited delays for case-specific needs,” id., at 499. The
Government suggests that a district court may fail to make the nec
essary subsection (h)(7) findings, leading to a windfall gain for a de
fendant who induces delay beyond the 70-day limit. But dismissal
need not represent a windfall. If the court dismisses the charges
without prejudice, the Government may refile charges or reindict. In
ruling on a motion to dismiss under the Act, the district court should
consider, inter alia, the party responsible for the delay. Pp. 16–18.
(d) This Court does not consider whether any of the Act’s other ex
clusions would apply to all or part of the September 7 through Octo
ber 4 period that is not automatically excludable under subsection
(h)(1). P. 18.
