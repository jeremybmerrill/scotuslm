Opinion of the Court

Sixth Circuits, interpret subsection (h)(1) differently,

this conflict.
II
As noted, the Speedy Trial Act requires that a criminal
defendant’s trial commence within 70 days of a defen
dant’s initial appearance or indictment, but excludes from
the 70-day period days lost to certain types of delay.
Section 3161(h) specifies the types of delays that are ex

computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must
commence:

the defendant, including but not limited to—
“(A) delay resulting from any proceeding, including any examinations,
to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the defen
