Opinion of the Court

her residence. The officers who conducted the search
uncovered several items that belonged to petitioner, in
cluding an identification card, cocaine, three firearms,
ammunition, and a bulletproof vest. The police arrested
petitioner the next day.
On August 24, a grand jury indicted petitioner for being
a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18
U. S. C. §922(g)(1), and for knowing and intentional pos
session with intent to distribute more than five grams of
cocaine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. §841(a)(1). The August
24 indictment started the Speedy Trial Act’s 70-day clock.
See 18 U. S. C. §3161(c)(1). After petitioner’s arraignment
on September 1, a Magistrate Judge entered a scheduling
order requiring, inter alia, that the parties file pretrial
motions by September 13.
On September 7, petitioner filed a motion to extend the
deadline to file pretrial motions from September 13 to
September 21. The Magistrate Judge granted the motion
and extended the deadline by an extra four days beyond
petitioner’s request, to September 25. On September 25,
however, petitioner filed a “Waiver of Pretrial Motions”
advising the court that he did not wish to file any pretrial
motions.
On October 4, the Magistrate Judge held a hearing to
consider petitioner’s “waiver,” at which petitioner con
firmed that he wished to waive his right to file pretrial
motions. After a colloquy, the Magistrate Judge found
that petitioner’s waiver was voluntary and intelligent.
Over the next three months, petitioner’s trial was de
layed for several reasons. Though these delays are not
directly relevant to the question presented here, we re
count them to explain the full context in which that ques
tion arises. On November 8, petitioner moved to continue
the trial date, stating that his counsel needed additional
time to prepare for trial. The District Court granted the
motion and reset the trial for December 18.
