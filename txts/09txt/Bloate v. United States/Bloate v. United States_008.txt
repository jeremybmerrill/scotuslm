imprisonment.

Petitioner appealed his convictions and sentence to the
Eighth Circuit, which affirmed the denial of his motion to
dismiss for a Speedy Trial Act violation. As relevant, the
Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the
time from September 7 (the original deadline for filing
pretrial motions) through October 4 (when the trial court
held a hearing on petitioner’s decision to waive the right to
file pretrial motions) was excludable from the Act’s 70-day
limit. Although the District Court did not identify which
provision of the Act supported this exclusion, the Court of
Appeals held that “pretrial motion preparation time” is

covers “delay resulting from other proceedings concerning

cember 19. Nor did it decide whether to exclude the delay from
February 23 to March 5, because even if those days were included,
“only 58 days passed between [petitioner]’s indictment and trial, fewer
than the 70 allowed by the Speedy Trial Act.” 534 F. 3d, at 900.
