BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

v. United States, 476 U. S. 321, 324 (1986). Indeed, in
Henderson we held that 295 days of delay resulting from
the filing of a pretrial motion were automatically exclud
able, and we noted that “Congress was aware of the
breadth of the exclusion it was enacting.” Id., at 327.6
The Court’s suggestion that its interpretation is necessary
to protect the Act’s “timeliness guarantee,” ante, at 13, is
illusory.
For a similar reason, the Court’s interpretation is not
supported by the rule of construction that “ ‘[a] specific
provision’ . . . ‘controls one[s] of more general application.’ ”
Ante, at 10. This rule applies only when specific and
general statutory provisions conflict. National Cable &
Telecommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534
U. S. 327, 335–336 (2002). Here, there is no conflict be
cause, even if subparagraph (D) governs “delay resulting
from any pretrial motion,” there is no basis for concluding
that subparagraph (D) governs all “pretrial motion-related
delay.”

Contrary to the Court’s claim, its decision is not sup
ported by §3161(h)(7)(A), which excludes “delay resulting
from a continuance” provided that the trial court “sets
forth, in the record of the case, . . . its reasons for finding
that the ends of justice served by the granting of such
continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and
the defendant in a speedy trial.” One might argue that a
trial judge grants a “continuance” whenever the judge
postpones a trial date, even when the postponement is the

6 That the delay in Henderson was delay “resulting from [a] pretrial
motion,” §3161(h)(1)(D); see 476 U. S., at 322, 330–331, distinguishes
that case from the scenario here, where no pretrial motion has been
filed and the delay in question “results from a proceeding” that, in the
Court’s view, is “governed by subparagraph (D).” Ante, at 9–10. Cf.
ante, at 15, n. 14.
