ALITO, J., dissenting

intent to narrow the scope of the general rule set out in
subsection (h)(1). For these reasons, I would hold that the
delay in question here is automatically excluded.
II
The Court advances several additional arguments in
support of its analysis, but none is persuasive.
A
Two of these arguments hinge on the Court’s unjustifia
bly broad interpretation of subparagraph (D), i.e., that it
covers all “pretrial motion-related delay.” First, the Court
reasons that under a contrary interpretation, “a court
could extend by weeks or months, without any finding that
the incursion on the Act’s timeliness guarantee is justified,
the entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the
Act sets a default limit of 70 days.” Ante, at 13. But the
same is true of the Court’s interpretation. Even under an
interpretation that automatically excludes delay “only
from the time a motion is filed through the hearing or
disposition point,” ante, at 9, there appears to be no reason
why a district court may not, in its discretion, extend the
automatically excludable period of time under subpara
graph (D) through any number of means, including: (1)
extending the time to file an opposition brief, see Tr. of
Oral Arg. 4; (2) extending the time to file a reply brief, see
United States v. Latham, No. 82–CR–890, 1983 U. S. Dist.
LEXIS 14219, *1–*3 (ND Ill., Aug. 30, 1983); (3) allowing
pre-hearing supplemental briefing, see United States v.
Faison, No. 06–4332, 2007 U. S. App. LEXIS 23298, *6–*9
(CA4, Oct. 4, 2007); (4) deferring the hearing on a pretrial
motion, see United States v. Riley, 991 F. 2d 120, 124 (CA4
1993); (5) conducting multiple hearings on the motion or
motions, e.g., United States v. Boone, Crim. No. 00–3, 2002
WL 31761364, *20, n. 12 (D NJ, Dec. 6, 2002); or (6) allow
ing the filing of post hearing submissions, see Henderson
