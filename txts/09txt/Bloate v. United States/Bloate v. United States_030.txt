BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

subparagraph (D) automatically excludes delay resulting
from the granting of a prosecution request for additional
time to respond to a defendant’s pretrial motions. The
Court has not identified any reason why Congress might
have wanted to provide an automatic exclusion for delay
resulting from the granting of a prosecution request for
additional time to respond to a defendant’s pretrial mo
tions but not for delay resulting from the granting of the
defendant’s request for additional time to prepare those
very motions. Since there is nothing to suggest that Con
gress intended such a strange, asymmetrical result, the
Court’s strained interpretation of subparagraph (D) should
be rejected. Subparagraph (D) should be read to apply
only to delay “resulting from [a] pretrial motion,” and
because the delay involved here does not result from a
pretrial motion, there is no basis for inferring that sub
paragraph (D) was meant to take that delay outside the
scope of the general language of subsection (h)(1).

The circumstances surrounding the adoption of the
current version of subparagraph (D) in 1979 point to the
same conclusion. That language was adopted to expand
the reach of the exclusion. As originally enacted, the
relevant provision of the Act excluded only “delay result
ing from hearings on pretrial motions,” 88 Stat. 2078, and
courts had interpreted this language literally to exclude
only time actually devoted to hearings. See, e.g., United
States v. Lewis, 425 F. Supp. 1166, 1171 (Conn. 1977);
United States v. Conroy, No. 77 Cr. 607 (CHT), 1978 U. S.
Dist. LEXIS 19296, *4 (SDNY, Mar. 1, 1978); accord,
United States v. Simms, 508 F. Supp. 1175, 1177–1178
(WD La. 1979). The House Judiciary Committee stated
that the language on which the Court now relies was
added “to avoid an unduly restrictive interpretation of the
exclusion as extending only to the actual time consumed in
