BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

governed by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the
first day upon which Congress specified that such delay
may be automatically excluded. The result is that the
pretrial motion preparation time at issue in this case is
not automatically excludable.11
B
The foregoing analysis resolves our inquiry into auto
matic excludability because “[a] specific provision” (here,
subparagraph (D)) “controls one[s] of more general appli
cation” (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)). Gozlon-Peretz
v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991). In arguing
that this principle applies, but requires a result different
from the one we reach, the dissent (like the Government
and several Courts of Appeals) departs from the statute in
a manner that underscores the propriety of our approach.

There is no question that subparagraph (D) is more
specific than the “general” language in subsection (h)(1),
post, at 2, 6, or that “[g]eneral language of a statutory
provision, although broad enough to include it, will not be
held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another
part of the same enactment,” D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v.
Popkin, 285 U. S. 204, 208 (1932). We part company with
the dissent because we conclude that subparagraph (D)
governs the period of delay at issue in this case. The
dissent does not object to this conclusion on the ground
that it is foreclosed by the statute. See post, at 5 (assert
ing that the delay at issue in this case is “not necessarily”
covered by subparagraph (D)). Instead, it joins the Gov

11 Whether the defendant actually files a pretrial motion for which he
requests additional time is irrelevant to this analysis. Even if he files
such a motion, that filing may not be used to bootstrap into the period
of automatically excludable delay pre-filing preparation time that
subparagraph (D) does not render automatically excludable.
