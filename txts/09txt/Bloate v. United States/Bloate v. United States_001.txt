BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
No. 08–728.

Argued October 6, 2009—Decided March 8, 2010

The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) requires a criminal defendant’s trial
to commence within 70 days of his indictment or initial appearance,
18 U. S. C. §3161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if
that deadline is not met, §3162(a)(2). As relevant here, the Act
automatically excludes from the 70-day period “delay resulting from
. . . proceedings concerning the defendant,” 18 U. S. C. A. §3161(h)(1)
(hereinafter subsection (h)(1)), and separately permits a district court
to exclude “delay resulting from a continuance” it grants, provided
the court makes findings required by §3161(h)(7) (hereinafter subsec
tion (h)(7)). Petitioner’s indictment on federal firearm and drug pos
session charges started the 70-day clock on August 24, 2006. After
petitioner’s arraignment, the Magistrate Judge ordered the parties to
file pretrial motions by September 13. On September 7, the court
granted petitioner’s motion to extend that deadline, but on the new
due date, September 25, petitioner waived his right to file pretrial
motions. On October 4, the Magistrate Judge found the waiver vol
untary and intelligent. Over the next three months, petitioner’s trial
was delayed several times, often at petitioner’s instigation. On Feb
ruary 19, 2007—179 days after he was indicted—he moved to dismiss
the indictment, claiming that the Act’s 70-day limit had elapsed. In
denying the motion, the District Court excluded the time from Sep
tember 7 through October 4 as pretrial motion preparation time. At
trial, petitioner was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to
concurrent prison terms. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the denial of
the motion to dismiss, holding that the period from September 7
through October 4 was automatically excludable from the 70-day
limit under subsection (h)(1).
Held: The time granted to prepare pretrial motions is not automatically
