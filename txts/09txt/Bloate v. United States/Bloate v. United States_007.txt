BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

The parties then met informally and prepared a plea
agreement, which they provided to the court. The District
Court scheduled a change of plea hearing for December 20.
At the hearing, however, petitioner declined to implement
the agreement and requested a new attorney. The District
Court rescheduled the trial for February 26, 2007, granted
petitioner’s attorney’s subsequent motion to withdraw,
and appointed new counsel.
On February 19, 2007—179 days after petitioner was
indicted—petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment,
claiming that the Act’s 70-day limit had elapsed. The
District Court denied the motion. In calculating how
many of the 179 days counted toward the 70-day limit, the
District Judge excluded the period from September 7
through October 4 as “within the extension of time
granted to file pretrial motions.”3
Order in No.
4:06CR518–SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 2.
In late February, a matter arose in an unrelated case on
the District Court’s docket, which required the court to
reschedule petitioner’s trial. After obtaining the consent
of the parties and finding that a continuance would serve
the public interest, the District Court continued peti
tioner’s trial from February 26 to March 5, 2007. Peti
tioner’s 2-day trial began on that date. The jury found
petitioner guilty on both counts and the District Court
——————
3 In addition, the District Judge excluded the continuance granted on
November 9 (resetting the trial for December 18) under §3161(h)(7)(A),
and excluded the time from November 9 through December 20 as delay
resulting from a plea agreement under §3161(h)(1)(G). He further
excluded the time from December 20 through February 26 “as it . . .
resulted from [petitioner’s] election not to implement a plea agreement,
and his request to the court to have new counsel appointed for him.”
Order in No. 4:06CR518–SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 3. The judge stated
on the record that these continuances were necessary to ensure that
“the ends of justice could more properly be served” and “obviously
outweighed the best interest of the public and the defendant to a
Speedy Trial.” Ibid.
