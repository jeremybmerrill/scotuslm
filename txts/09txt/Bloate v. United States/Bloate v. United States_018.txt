Opinion of the Court

est.” Zedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 502 (2006).14
Courts of Appeals that have read subsection (h)(1) to
exclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time
have reasoned that their interpretation is necessary to
provide defendants adequate time to build their defense.
See, e.g., United States v. Mobile Materials, Inc., 871 F. 2d
902, 913 (per curiam), opinion supplemented on other
grounds on rehearing, 881 F. 2d 866 (CA10 1989) (per
curiam). Yet these same courts have recognized that
reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude all time for preparing
pretrial motions would undermine the guarantee of a
speedy trial, and thus harm the public interest we have
recognized in preserving that guarantee even where one or
both parties to a proceeding would be willing to waive it.
See Zedner, supra, at 502. To avoid a result so inconsis
tent with the statute’s purpose—i.e., “to avoid creating a
big loophole in the statute,” United States v. Tibboel, 753
F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985)—these courts have found it
necessary to craft limitations on the automatic exclusion
for pretrial motion preparation time that their interpreta
tion of subsection (h)(1) otherwise would allow. See, e.g.,
ibid. (stating that pretrial motion preparation time may be
automatically excluded under subsection (h)(1) only when
“the judge has expressly granted a party time for that
purpose” (emphasis added)); Oberoi, 547 F. 3d, at 450

interpretation of the Act accords with this and other prece
dents in a way the dissent’s interpretation does not. In Henderson v.
United States, 476 U. S. 321, 322 (1986), for example, we carefully
examined the text of §3161(h)(1)(F) (now codified as subparagraph (D))
to determine whether certain periods of pretrial motion-related delay
were automatically excludable. Such careful parsing would seem
unnecessary were the dissent right that subparagraph (D) does not
conclusively define the maximum period of excludable delay for the
category of pretrial motion-related proceedings and that such delay
may simply be excluded under subsection (h)(1).
