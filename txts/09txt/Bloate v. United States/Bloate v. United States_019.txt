BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

pretrial motions right up to the eve of trial’ ”).
The fact that courts reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude
preparation time have imposed extratextual limitations on
excludability to avoid “creating a big loophole in the stat
ute,” Tibboel, supra, at 610, underscores the extent to
which their interpretation—and the dissent’s—strays from
the Act’s text and purpose. As noted, subsection (h)(7)
expressly accounts for the possibility that a district court
would need to delay a trial to give the parties adequate

have interpreted subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically
pretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that a
contrary reading of that provision would lay “a trap for

violation if they wish to grant a defendant’s request for
additional time to prepare a pretrial motion, United States
v. Wilson, 835 F. 2d 1440, 1444 (CADC 1987); see also
Oberoi, supra, at 450.
We acknowledge that it would be unpalatable to inter
pret the Speedy Trial Act to “trap” district courts for ac
commodating a defendant’s request for additional time to
prepare pretrial motions, particularly in a case like this.
Petitioner instigated all of the pretrial delays except for
the final continuance from February 26 to March 5. And
the record clearly shows that the Magistrate Judge and
the District Court diligently endeavored to accommodate
petitioner’s requests—granting his motion for an exten
sion of time to decide whether to file pretrial motions, his
motion for a continuance, and his motion for a new attor
