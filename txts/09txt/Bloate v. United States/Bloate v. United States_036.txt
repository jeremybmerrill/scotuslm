BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

statute, but to its overall structure of providing a class of
exceptions to the general rule that continuances require
ends-of-justice findings. And it also recognizes that when
defense counsel argues that adequate pretrial motions
cannot be completed within the time allotted and is
granted an extension, it will generally go without saying
that the judge has considered whether the ends of justice
will be served by the extension, and requiring the judge to
recite this determination on the record will often be an
empty exercise.
III
The Court does not believe that its interpretation will
have serious adverse consequences because trial judges, by
making the on-the-record findings required under
§3161(h)(7), may exclude delay resulting from the grant
ing of a defense request for an extension to file pretrial
motions. As this case illustrates, however, there will be
cases in which busy district judges and magistrate judges
will fail to make those findings, and indictments will be
dismissed for no good reason. If requiring findings on the
record were cost- and risk-free, Congress would not have
provided for the automatic exclusion of the broad category
of delay encompassed by §3161(h)(1).
The Court notes that, when a Speedy Trial Act violation
occurs because of delay caused by an extension requested
by the defense, a district court may dismiss the indictment
without prejudice. But as we have recognized, even when
a new indictment may be obtained, “substantial delay may
well make reprosecution . . . unlikely.” United States v.
Taylor, 487 U. S. 326, 342 (1988). Dismissal without
prejudice is “not a toothless sanction,” ibid., and it is
particularly inappropriate when brought about by a crimi
nal defendant’s own delay.
