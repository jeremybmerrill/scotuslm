BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

70-day limit. Dismissal, however, need not represent a
windfall. A district court may dismiss the charges without
prejudice, thus allowing the Government to refile charges
or reindict the defendant. 18 U. S. C. §3162(a)(1). In
ruling upon a motion to dismiss under the Act, a district
court should consider, among other factors, the party
responsible for the delay. See ibid. (“In determining
whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the
[district] court shall consider, among others, each of the
following factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts
and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal;
and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of
this chapter and on the administration of justice” (empha
sis added)); see also United States v. Taylor, 487 U. S. 326,
343 (1988) (“Seemingly ignored were the brevity of the
delay and the consequential lack of prejudice to respon
dent, as well as respondent’s own illicit contribution to the
delay”).
III
Based on this analysis, we hold that the 28-day period
from September 7 through October 4, which includes the
additional time granted by the District Court for pretrial
motion preparation, is not automatically excludable under
subsection (h)(1). The Court of Appeals did not address
whether any portion of that time might have been other
wise excludable. Nor did the Government assert in its
merits brief that another provision of the Act could sup
port exclusion, presenting the argument that September
25 through October 4 could be excluded separately only in
its brief in opposition to certiorari and during oral argu
ment. We therefore do not consider whether any other
exclusion would apply to all or part of the 28-day period.
Instead, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit and remand the case for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
