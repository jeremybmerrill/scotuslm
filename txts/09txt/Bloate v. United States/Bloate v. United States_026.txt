BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

held1—and I agree—that a delay resulting from the grant
ing of a defense request for additional time to complete
pretrial motions is a delay “resulting from [a] proceedin[g]
concerning the defendant” and is thus automatically ex
cluded under §3161(h)(1).
B
In considering the question presented here, I begin with
the general language of §3161(h)(1), which, as noted,
automatically excludes any “delay resulting from other
proceedings concerning the defendant.” (For convenience,
I will refer to this portion of the statute as “subsection
(h)(1).”) The delay resulting from the granting of a de
fense request for an extension of time to complete pretrial
motions falls comfortably within the terms of subsection
(h)(1).
First, the granting of such a defense request qualifies as
a “proceeding.” A court proceeding is defined as “[a]n act
or step that is part of a larger action” and “an act done by
the authority or direction of the court.” Black’s Law Dic
tionary 1324 (9th ed. 2009) (internal quotation marks
omitted) (hereinafter Black’s Law). The granting of a
defense request for an extension of time to prepare pre
trial motions constitutes both “[a]n act or step that is part
of [the] larger [criminal case]” and “an act done by the
authority or direction of the court.” Second, delay caused
by the granting of such an extension is obviously “delay
resulting from” the successful extension request.
