GINSBURG, J., concurring 


this Court.*

——————
* Bloate contends that the Government forfeited this argument by
earlier failing to urge exclusion of this discrete period in the District
Court or the Eighth Circuit. Reply to Brief in Opposition 10–11; Tr. of
Oral Arg. 58. Whether the Government preserved this issue and, if it
did not, whether any exception to the ordinary forfeiture principle
applies, are matters within the Eighth Circuit’s ken.
