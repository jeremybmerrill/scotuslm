ALITO, J., dissenting

C
The Court does not contend that the granting of a de
fense request for time to prepare pretrial motions falls
outside the plain meaning of subsection (h)(1), but the
Court holds that §3161(h)(1)(D) (hereinafter subparagraph
(D)) narrows the meaning of subsection (h)(1). Subpara
graph (D) sets out one of the eight categories of delay that
are specifically identified as “delay resulting from [a]
proceedin[g] concerning the defendant,” but as noted, this
list is preceded by the phrase “including but not limited
to.” “When ‘include’ is utilized, it is generally improper to
conclude that entities not specifically enumerated are
excluded.” 2A N. Singer & J. Singer, Sutherland on Stat
utes and Statutory Construction §47.23, p. 417 (7th ed.
2007). See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U. S.
569, 577 (1994); Herb’s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470 U. S.
414, 423, n. 9 (1985); Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v.
Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941); Black’s
Law 831 (“The participle including typically indicates a
partial list”). And the inclusion in subsection (h)(1) of the
additional phrase “not limited to” reinforces this point.
See United States v. Tibboel, 753 F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7
1985).
Because subparagraph (D) follows the phrase “including
but not limited to,” the Court has a steep hurdle to clear to
show that this subparagraph narrows the meaning of the
general rule set out in subsection (h)(1). The Court’s
argument is that subparagraph (D) governs not just “delay
resulting from any pretrial motion,” §3161(h)(1)(D), but
also delay resulting from “proceedings involving pretrial
motions,” ante, at 8, and n. 9 (emphasis added), and “all
pretrial motion-related delay,” ante, at 8 (emphasis added).
In the Court’s view, Congress has expressed a judgment
that if a period of “pretrial motion-related delay” does not
fall within the express terms of subparagraph (D), then it
is “excludable only when accompanied by district court
