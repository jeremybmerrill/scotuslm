TAYLOR JAMES BLOATE, PETITIONER v. UNITED 

STATES 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT

[March 8, 2010] 


JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Speedy Trial Act or Act),
18 U. S. C. §3161 et seq., requires that a criminal defen
dant’s trial commence within 70 days after he is charged
or makes an initial appearance, whichever is later, see
§3161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if
that deadline is not met, §3162(a)(2). The Act, however,
excludes from the 70-day period delays due to certain
enumerated events. §3161(h). As relevant here, “delay
resulting from . . . proceedings concerning the defendant”
is automatically excludable from a Speedy Trial Act calcu

1 The excludability of delay “resulting from . . . proceedings” under
subsection (h)(1) is “automatic” in the sense that a district court must
exclude such delay from a Speedy Trial Act calculation without any
further analysis as to whether the benefit of the delay outweighs its
cost. For delays resulting from proceedings under subsection (h)(1),
Congress already has determined that the benefit of such delay out
weighs its cost to a speedy trial, regardless of the specifics of the case.
The word “automatic” serves as a useful shorthand. See, e.g., United
States v. Lucky, 569 F. 3d 101, 106 (CA2 2009) (“Some exclusions are
automatic. Other exclusions require judicial action” (citation omitted)).
