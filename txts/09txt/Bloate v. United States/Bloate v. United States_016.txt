Opinion of the Court

continuances.” Post, at 11.
On the dissent’s reading of subsection (h)(1), a court
could extend by weeks or months, without any finding that
the incursion on the Act’s timeliness guarantee is justified,
the entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the
Act sets a default limit of 70 days. The problem with this
reading is clear: It relies on an interpretation of subsection
(h)(1) that admits of no principled, text-based limit on the
definition of a “proceeding concerning the defendant,” and
thus threatens the Act’s manifest purpose of ensuring
speedy trials by construing the Act’s automatic exclusion
exceptions in a manner that could swallow the 70-day
rule. This approach is not justified, much less compelled,
by the textual ambiguities and legislative history upon
which the dissent relies. Nor is it justified by the pros
pect, however appealing, of reaching a different result in
this case. Hence our conclusion that the text and struc
ture of subsection (h)(1) do not permit automatic exclusion
of the delay at issue in this case.

Our conclusion is further supported by subsection
(h)(1)’s context, particularly neighboring subsection (h)(7).
Subsection (h)(7) provides that delays “resulting from a
continuance granted by any judge” may be excluded, but
only if the judge finds that “the ends of justice served by
taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public
and the defendant in a speedy trial” and records those
findings. In setting forth the statutory factors that justify
a continuance under subsection (h)(7), Congress twice
recognized the importance of adequate pretrial prepara
tion time. See §3161(h)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring a district court
to consider whether the “unusual” or “complex” nature of a
case makes it “unreasonable to expect adequate prepara
tion for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within
the time limits” (emphasis added)); §3161(h)(7)(B)(iv)
