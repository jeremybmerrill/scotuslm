BLOATE v. UNITED STATES
GINSBURG, J., concurring

labeled a pretrial motion, that pleading required a
hearing . . . and served essentially as a motion for
leave to waive the right to file pretrial motions. . . .
The [Speedy Trial Act] clock thus stopped . . . under
18 U. S. C. A. 3161(h)(1)[(D)] until the matter was
heard by the court on October 4, 2006.” Brief in Op
position 11–12.
By the Government’s measure, excluding the time from
September 25 through October 4 would reduce the number
of days that count for Speedy Trial Act purposes to 65, 5
days short of the Act’s 70-day threshold. See id., at 12.
The Government reiterated this contention at oral

Oral Arg. 34. See also id., at 45–48. This argument, the
Government suggested, “should be taken into account on
any remand.” Id., at 34. See also id., at 43–44 (“[I]f the

excluded, . . . the appropriate thing to do in that circum
stance would be for the Court to leave that open on re
mand, assuming that it’s . . . preserved.”).
The question presented and the parties’ merits briefs
address only whether time granted to prepare pretrial
motions is automatically excludable under 18 U. S. C. A.
§3161(h)(1) (Supp. 2009). As a court of ultimate review,
we are not positioned to determine, in the first instance,
and without full briefing and argument, whether the time
from September 25 to October 4 should be excluded from
the Speedy Trial Act calculation. But the Eighth Circuit is
not similarly restricted. It may therefore consider, after
full airing, the Government’s argument that Bloate’s
indictment should not be dismissed despite his success in
