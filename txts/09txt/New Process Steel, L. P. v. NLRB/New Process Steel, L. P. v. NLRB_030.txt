NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

(despite the vacancy clause’s contrary mandate, earlier in
the very same sentence).
The Court’s revisions leave the Board defunct for ex
tended periods of time, a result that Congress surely did
not intend. The Court’s assurance that its interpretation
is designed to give practical effect to the statute should
bring it to the opposite result from the one it reaches. For
these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.
