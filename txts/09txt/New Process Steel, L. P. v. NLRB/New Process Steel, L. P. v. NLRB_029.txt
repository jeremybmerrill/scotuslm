KENNEDY, J., dissenting

or the number of sitting members (excluding vacancies)”).
Petitioner’s reading ignores the operation of the word
“except” in the statute: “[T]hree members of the Board
shall, at all times, constitute a quorum of the Board, ex
cept that two members shall constitute a quorum of any
group.” §153(b).
While the Court does not adopt petitioner’s flawed
reading, it should be noted that its failure to decisively
reject it calls into question various delegations of authority
the Board has made beyond three-member groups. For
instance, §153(d) permits the Board to delegate various
powers to its general counsel, but under petitioner’s view
the general counsel would have lost all authority the
moment the Board fell to two members. See also §153(b)
(permitting Board to delegate certain powers to its re
gional directors). The Court’s assurances that its opinion
“does not cast doubt on the prior delegations of authority
to non-group members,” ante, at 10, n. 4, are cold comfort
when it fails to reject petitioner’s view outright.

It is not optimal for a two-member quorum to exercise
the full powers of the Board for an extended period of
time. But the desire to avoid that situation cannot justify
the Court’s significant revisions to §153(b): (1) It writes
language into the delegation clause, requiring delegee
groups to maintain a membership of three, despite the
conspicuous absence of this requirement and the statutory
rejection of it in the group quorum provision; (2) it excises
the word “not” from the vacancy clause, so that a Board
vacancy does “impair the right of the remaining members
to exercise all of the powers of the Board” in hundreds of
cases; (3) it renders the group quorum provision unintelli
gible, so that its application depends entirely on the rea
son for the third member’s absence, and applies in all
instances except when the absence is due to a vacancy
