Opinion of the Court

ble, as it would render two of §3(b)’s provisions function
ally void.
Second, and relatedly, if Congress had intended to
authorize two members alone to act for the Board on an
ongoing basis, it could have said so in straightforward
language. Congress instead imposed the requirement that
the Board delegate authority to no fewer than three mem
bers, and that it have three participating members to
constitute a quorum. Those provisions are at best an
unlikely way of conveying congressional approval of a two
member Board. Indeed, had Congress wanted to provide
for two members alone to act as the Board, it could have
maintained the NLRA’s original two-member Board quo
rum provision, see 29 U. S. C. §153(b) (1946 ed.), or pro
vided for a delegation of the Board’s authority to groups of
two. The Rube Goldberg-style delegation mechanism
employed by the Board in 2007—delegating to a group of
three, allowing a term to expire, and then continuing with
a two-member quorum of a phantom delegee group—is
surely a bizarre way for the Board to achieve the authority
to decide cases with only two members. To conclude that
Congress intended to authorize such a procedure to con
travene the three-member Board quorum, we would need
some evidence of that intent.
The Government has not adduced any convincing evi
dence on this front, and to the contrary, our interpretation
is consistent with the longstanding practice of the Board.
This is the third factor driving our decision. Although the
Board has throughout its history allowed two members of
a three-member group to issue decisions when one mem
ber of a group was disqualified from a case, see Brief for
Respondent 20; Board Minutes 6a, the Board has not
(until recently) allowed two members to act as a quorum of
a defunct three-member group.2 Instead, the Board con
