NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

quirement into the statutory text bring me to its second
point.
B
The Court’s textual arguments in the end reduce to a
single objection: The Government’s reading of §153(b)
allows two Board members to act as the full Board,
thereby eviscerating the requirement that the Board only
operate with a three-member quorum (or as three-member
panels). This animates the Court’s second reason for
departing from the statutory text, as the Court suggests
that had Congress “intended to authorize two members
alone to act for the Board on an ongoing basis, it could
have said so in straightforward language.” Ante, at 7. But
Congress undoubtedly permitted two members to act for
the Board: Even under the Court’s interpretation, two
members are authorized to exercise the full powers of the
Board so long as they are part of a delegee group that has
fallen to two members due to any reason other than va
cancy. Ante, at 13 (“[T]he group quorum provision still
operates to allow any panel to issue a decision by only two
members if one member is disqualified”).
The Court’s complaint, then, cannot be that Congress
did not intend two members to exercise the powers of the
Board; it must be that Congress did not intend to allow
two members to do so for protracted periods of time. The
Court is likely correct that Congress did not expect a two
member quorum to operate as the Board for extended
periods, but unintended consequences are typically the
result of unforeseen circumstances. And it should be even
more evident that Congress did not intend the Board to
cease operating entirely for an extended period of time, as
the Court’s interpretation of §153(b) now ordains. Mem

ions when they operated as a two-member quorum of a
properly designated group:
