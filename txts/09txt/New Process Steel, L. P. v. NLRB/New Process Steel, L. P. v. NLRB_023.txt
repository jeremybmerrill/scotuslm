KENNEDY, J., dissenting

cise the powers of the Board, notwithstanding the explicit
statutory command to the contrary.
In an effort to avoid the mandates of the group quorum
provision, as buttressed by the vacancy clause, the Court
relies on the delegation clause. The Court reads the
clause as requiring a delegee group to maintain three
members in order for its authority to remain intact. In my
respectful submission, this reading of the statute, in which
any vacancy in a delegee group somehow invalidates the
delegation itself, has no textual basis. Contrary to the
Court’s and petitioner’s assertions, the delegation clause is
not rendered unimportant under the Government’s inter
pretation. The delegation clause establishes what is re
quired for delegation in the first instance, while the va
cancy clause and the group quorum provision allow the
delegee group to proceed in the event that a member’s
term expires or a member resigns.
Congress could have required a delegee group to main
tain three members, but it did not do so; instead, it in
cluded a vacancy clause that is an explicit rejection of such
a requirement. That is no doubt why the Court’s reading
has not been adopted by the five Courts of Appeals to have
rejected its result. See Teamsters Local Union No. 523 v.
NLRB, 590 F. 3d 849 (CA10 2009); Narricot Indus., L. P.
v. NLRB, 587 F. 3d 654 (CA4 2009); Snell Island SNF
LLC v. NLRB, 568 F. 3d 410 (CA2 2009); 564 F. 3d 840
(CA7 2009); Northeastern Land Servs., Ltd. v. NLRB, 560
F. 3d 36 (CA1 2009). While one court of appeals reached
the same result as the Court, it too did not adopt the
Court’s reasoning that a delegee group must maintain
three members. Laurel Baye Healthcare of Lake Lanier,
