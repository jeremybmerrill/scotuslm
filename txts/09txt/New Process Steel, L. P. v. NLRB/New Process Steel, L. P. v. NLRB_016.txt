NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB
Opinion of the Court

we unaware of the costs that delay imposes on the liti
gants. If Congress wishes to allow the Board to decide
cases with only two members, it can easily do so. But
until it does, Congress’ decision to require that the Board’s
full power be delegated to no fewer than three members,
and to provide for a Board quorum of three, must be given
practical effect rather than swept aside in the face of
admittedly difficult circumstances. Section 3(b), as it
currently exists, does not authorize the Board to create a
tail that would not only wag the dog, but would continue
to wag after the dog died.
The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

twenty years . . . Board member turnover and delays in appointments
and in the confirmation process have kept the Board from reaching its
true potential”).
