had “decided to exercise its discretion” to do so. Ibid.
On December 28, 2007, the Board’s delegation to the
three-member group of Members Liebman, Schaumber,
and Kirsanow became effective. On December 31, 2007,
Member Kirsanow’s recess appointment expired. Thus,
starting on January 1, 2008, Members Liebman and
Schaumber became the only members of the Board. They
proceeded to issue decisions for the Board as a two
member quorum of a three-member group. The delegation
automatically terminated on March 27, 2010, when the
President made two recess appointments to the Board,
because the terms of the delegation specified that it would
be revoked when the Board’s membership returned to at

During the 27-month period in which the Board had
only two members, it decided almost 600 cases. See Letter
from Elena Kagan, Solicitor General, to William K. Suter,
Clerk of Court (Apr. 26, 2010). One of those cases involved

sought review of both orders in the Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit, and challenged the authority of the
two-member Board to issue the orders.
The court ruled in favor of the Government. After a
review of the text and legislative history of §3(b) and the
sequence of events surrounding the delegation of authority
in December 2007, the court concluded that the then
sitting two members constituted a valid quorum of a
three-member group to which the Board had legitimately
delegated all its powers. 564 F. 3d 840, 845–847 (CA7
2009). On the same day that the Seventh Circuit issued
its decision in this case, the Court of Appeals for the Dis
