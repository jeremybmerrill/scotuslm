NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

the Board has exercised its discretion to delegate its au
thority to a particular three-member group, and one mem
ber of such a group is unavailable for whatever reason.
The Board’s delegation to a three-member group that
ultimately dwindled to two was a thoughtful and consid
erate exercise of its reasonable discretion when it was
confronted with two imperfect alternatives.
During the past two years, events have turned what
Congress had undoubtedly thought would be an extraordi
nary circumstance into an ordinary one, through no fault
of the Board. That is no reason to dispense with the statu
tory regime that is prescribed when these circumstances
arise, even when they unexpectedly persist.
C
The Court’s final reason for its interpretation is the
Board’s longstanding practice of reconstituting panels
whenever they drop below three members due to a va
cancy. But see Photo-Sonics, Inc. v. NLRB, 678 F. 2d 121,
122−123 (CA9 1982) (upholding decision from a two
member delegee group after third member retired). The
commonsense conclusion from this practice, however, is
that the Board respects the superiority of three-member
groups to two-member quorums of those groups. That the
Board reconstitutes its panels to include three members
does not demonstrate that a two-member group lacks the
authority to act when recomposition is not an option.
The Court is mistaken, then, when it suggests that, if
two-member quorums were permissible, the Board would
have a practice of allowing two-member quorums to per
sist without reconstituting panels. Persuasive authority
shows the contrary to be true. In 2003, the Office of Legal
Counsel advised that two members can operate as a quo
rum of a properly designated group, even if the other seats
on the Board are vacant. The Board agreed to be bound by
that opinion. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel,
