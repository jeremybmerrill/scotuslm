NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

80th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1947) (“The expansion of the
Board . . . would permit it to operate in panels of three,
thereby increasing by 100 percent its ability to dispose of
cases expeditiously”). In furtherance of that objective, the
new statutory language in §153(b) complements the con
gressional intent to preserve the ability of two members of
the Board to exercise the Board’s full powers, in limited
circumstances, by permitting the Board to delegate “any or
all” of its powers “to any group of three or more members,”
two members of which would constitute a quorum.
D
The petitioner, but not the Court, advances an alterna
tive interpretation of §153(b) adopted by the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. See
Brief for Petitioner 16−27; Laurel Baye, 564 F. 3d 469. In
the petitioner’s view, §153(b) requires the Board to have a
quorum of three members “at all times,” and when the
Board’s quorum fell to two members any powers that it
had delegated automatically ceased.
This is a misreading of the statute that the Court
rightly declines to adopt. Ante, at 9−10, n. 4. As ex
plained above, that the Board must meet a three-member
quorum requirement at all times when it wishes to oper
ate as the full Board does not mean it must maintain three
members in order for delegee groups to act. It just means
that the quorum requirement for the full Board, operating
independently of any delegee group, is fixed at three, as
opposed to the various dynamic quorum requirements
found elsewhere in the United States Code. See, e.g., 28
U. S. C. §46(d) (setting the quorum requirements for
courts of appeals at “[a] majority of the number of judges
authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof”); see also
Black’s 1370 (defining “proportional quorum” as: “A quo
rum calculated with reference to some defined or assumed
set, usu. either the number of seats (including vacancies)
