KENNEDY, J., dissenting

and that is precisely what Members Liebman and
Schaumber did. Because the group was properly desig
nated under §153(b) and a two-member quorum of the
group was authorized to act under the statute’s plain
terms, its actions were lawful. See Connecticut Nat. Bank
v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253–254 (1992) (“[I]n interpret
ing a statute a court should always turn first to one, car
dinal canon before all others. . . . [C]ourts must presume
that a legislature says in a statute what it means and
means in a statute what it says”).
Nothing in the statute suggests that a delegation to a
three-member group expires when one member’s seat
becomes vacant, as the Court holds today. In other con
texts, it is settled law that a vacancy in a delegee group
does not void the initial delegation. See Nguyen v. United
States, 539 U. S. 69, 82 (2003) (concerning vacancies in
three-member panels of the courts of appeals). Any doubt
on that point should be resolved by this specific statutory
instruction: “A vacancy in the Board shall not impair the
right of the remaining members to exercise all of the
powers of the Board.” Members Liebman and Schaumber
were exercising the powers of the Board as its remaining
members; yet the Court today holds that the vacancy
impaired their right to exercise those powers in hundreds
of cases. That conclusion is contrary to the statutory
mandate.
By its holding, the Court rejects a straightforward read
ing that it acknowledges is “textually permissible.” Ante,
at 6. It does so because, in its view, it is “structurally
implausible.” Ante, at 6−7. But the only textually permis
sible reading of §153(b) authorizes a two-member quorum
of a delegee group to issue orders, as was done here; and
in any event there is no structural implausibility in read
ing the statute according to its plain terms.
