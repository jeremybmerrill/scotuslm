NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

II
The Court reads the statute to require a delegee group
to maintain three members. Unable to find this require
ment in the statute’s text, the Court gives three reasons
for its interpretation. Those reasons do not withstand
scrutiny.
A
The first reason the Court gives for its interpretation is
that reading the statute to require a delegee group to
maintain three members “is the only way to harmonize
and give meaningful effect to all of the provisions in”
§153(b). Ante, at 5. This is not so. But it should be fur

The Government’s reading of the statute does not render
any clause meaningless. The full Board must have three

delegation of the Board’s authority must be to at least
three members, as required by the delegation clause. Any
group to which the Board has properly delegated its au

by the group quorum provision. This reading gives the
