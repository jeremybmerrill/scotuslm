SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

the general class of offenses to which the statute is di­
rected is plainly within its terms, the statute will not be
struck down as vague . . . . And if this general class of
offenses can be made constitutionally definite by a reason­
able construction of the statute, this Court is under a duty
to give the statute that construction.”).
Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling
contends that it is impossible to identify a salvageable
honest-services core; “the pre-McNally caselaw,” he as­
serts, “is a hodgepodge of oft-conflicting holdings” that are
“hopelessly unclear.” Brief for Petitioner 39 (some capi­
talization and italics omitted). We have rejected an argu­
ment of the same tenor before. In Civil Service Comm’n v.
Letter Carriers, federal employees challenged a provision
of the Hatch Act that incorporated earlier decisions of the
United States Civil Service Commission enforcing a simi­
lar law. “[T]he several thousand adjudications of the Civil
Service Commission,” the employees maintained, were “an
impenetrable jungle”—“undiscoverable, inconsistent, [and]
incapable of yielding any meaningful rules to govern
present or future conduct.” 413 U. S., at 571. Mindful
that “our task [wa]s not to destroy the Act if we c[ould],
but to construe it,” we held that “the rules that had
evolved over the years from repeated adjudications were
subject to sufficiently clear and summary statement.” Id.,
at 571–572.
A similar observation may be made here. Although
some applications of the pre-McNally honest-services
doctrine occasioned disagreement among the Courts of
Appeals, these cases do not cloud the doctrine’s solid core:
The “vast majority” of the honest-services cases involved
offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participated
in bribery or kickback schemes. United States v. Runnels,
