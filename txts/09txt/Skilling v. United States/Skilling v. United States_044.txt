Opinion of the Court

ble-rights theory, Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110
(1941), the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecu­
tion of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from
entrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial
to the bribe payers. “It is not true that because the [city]
was to make and did make a saving by the operations
there could not have been an intent to defraud,” the Court
of Appeals maintained. Id., at 119. “A scheme to get a
public contract on more favorable terms than would likely
be got otherwise by bribing a public official,” the court
observed, “would not only be a plan to commit the crime of
bribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.”
Id., at 115.
The Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Shushan stimulated the
development of an “honest-services” doctrine. Unlike
fraud in which the victim’s loss of money or property
supplied the defendant’s gain, with one the mirror image
of the other, see, e.g., United States v. Starr, 816 F. 2d 94,
101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted cor­
ruption that lacked similar symmetry. While the offender
profited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of
money or property; instead, a third party, who had not
been deceived, provided the enrichment. For example, if a
city mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third
party in exchange for awarding that party a city contract,
yet the contract terms were the same as any that could
have been negotiated at arm’s length, the city (the be­
trayed party) would suffer no tangible loss. Cf. McNally,
483 U. S., at 360. Even if the scheme occasioned a money
or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned,
actionable harm lay in the denial of that party’s right to
the offender’s “honest services.” See, e.g., United States v.
Dixon, 536 F. 2d 1388, 1400 (CA2 1976).
“Most often these cases . . . involved bribery of public
officials,” United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167, 1171
(CA9 1980), but courts also recognized private-sector
