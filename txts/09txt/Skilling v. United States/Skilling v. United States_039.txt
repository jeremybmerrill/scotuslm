SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

members’] statements that [they] could be fair.”). The
jury’s not-guilty verdict on nine insider-trading counts
after nearly five days of deliberation, meanwhile, suggests
the court’s assessments were accurate. See United States
v. Haldeman, 559 F. 2d 31, 60, n. 28 (CADC 1976). Skill­
ing, we conclude, failed to show that his voir dire fell short
of constitutional requirements.31

Skilling also singles out several jurors in particular and
contends they were openly biased. See United States v.
Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 316 (2000) (“[T]he seat­
ing of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause
. . . require[s] reversal.”). In reviewing claims of this type,
the deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: “A
trial court’s findings of juror impartiality may be over­
turned only for manifest error.” Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 428
(internal quotation marks omitted). Skilling, moreover,
unsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for
cause, “strong evidence that he was convinced the [other]
jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as
to his guilt.” Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557–558
(1962). With these considerations in mind, we turn to
Skilling’s specific allegations of juror partiality.

emphasizes that voir dire did not weed out every juror who
suffered from Enron’s collapse because the District Court failed to grant
his for-cause challenge to Venire Member 29, whose retirement fund
lost $50,000 due to ripple effects from the decline in the value of Enron
stock. App. 880a. Critically, however, Venire Member 29 did not sit on
Skilling’s jury: Instead, Skilling struck her using a peremptory chal­
lenge. “[I]f [a] defendant elects to cure [a trial judge’s erroneous for­
cause ruling] by exercising a peremptory challenge, and is subsequently
convicted by a jury on which no biased juror sat,” we have held, “he has
not been deprived of any . . . constitutional right.” United States v.
Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 307 (2000). Indeed, the “use [of] a
peremptory challenge to effect an instantaneous cure of the error”
exemplifies “a principal reason for peremptories: to help secure the
constitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury.” Id., at 316.
