SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

grant Skilling relief on his fair-trial claim.
I
The majority understates the breadth and depth of
community hostility toward Skilling and overlooks signifi­
cant deficiencies in the District Court’s jury selection
process. The failure of Enron wounded Houston deeply.
Virtually overnight, what had been the city’s “largest,
most visible, and most prosperous company,” its “foremost
social and charitable force,” and “a source of civic pride”
was reduced to a “shattered shell.” App. ¶¶11, 13, pp.
649a–650a, 1152a. Thousands of the company’s employ­
ees lost their jobs and saw their retirement savings van­
ish. As the effects rippled through the local economy,
thousands of additional jobs disappeared, businesses
shuttered, and community groups that once benefited from
Enron’s largesse felt the loss of millions of dollars in con­

554 F. 3d 529, 560 (CA5 2009) (“Accounting firms that
serviced Enron’s books had less work, hotels had more
open rooms, restaurants sold fewer meals, and so on”).
Enron’s community ties were so extensive that the entire
local U. S. Attorney’s Office was forced to recuse itself

fall. See 3 Supp. Record 608 (official press release).
With Enron’s demise affecting the lives of so many
Houstonians, local media coverage of the story saturated
the community. According to a defense media expert, the
Houston Chronicle—the area’s leading newspaper—
assigned as many as 12 reporters to work on the Enron
story full time. App. 568a–569a. The paper mentioned
Enron in more than 4,000 articles during the 3-year period
following the company’s December 2001 bankruptcy filing.
Hundreds of these articles discussed Skilling by name.
See 3 Supp. Record 2114. Skilling’s expert, a professional
journalist and academic with 30 years’ experience, could
