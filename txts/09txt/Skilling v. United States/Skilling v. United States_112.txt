Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

The majority suggests, ante, at 17–18, 30, that the jury’s
decision to acquit Skilling on nine relatively minor insider
trading charges confirms its impartiality. This argument,
however, mistakes partiality with bad faith or blind vin­
dictiveness. Jurors who act in good faith and sincerely
believe in their own fairness may nevertheless harbor
disqualifying prejudices. Such jurors may well acquit
where evidence is wholly lacking, while subconsciously
resolving closer calls against the defendant rather than
giving him the benefit of the doubt. Cf. United States v.
McVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 1472 (WD Okla. 1996) (preju­
dice “may go unrecognized in those who are affected by it.
The prejudice that may deny a fair trial is not limited to a
bias or discriminatory attitude. It includes an impairment
of the deliberative process of deductive reasoning from
evidentiary facts resulting from an attribution to some­
thing not included in the evidence. That something has its
most powerful effect if it generates strong emotional re­
sponses”). In this regard, it is significant that the Gov­
ernment placed relatively little emphasis on the nine
insider trading counts during its closing argument, declin­
ing to explain its theory on those counts in any detail
whatsoever. Record 37010. The acquittals on those
counts thus provide scant basis for inferring a lack of
prejudice.

In sum, I cannot accept the majority’s conclusion that
voir dire gave the District Court “a sturdy foundation to
assess fitness for jury service.” Cf. ante, at 29. Taken
together, the District Court’s failure to cover certain vital
subjects, its superficial coverage of other topics, and its
uncritical acceptance of assurances of impartiality leave
me doubtful that Skilling’s jury was indeed free from the
deep-seated animosity that pervaded the community at
large. “[R]egardless of the heinousness of the crime
