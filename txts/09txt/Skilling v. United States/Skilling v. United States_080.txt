Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

ing possible antipathy toward the defendants.5 The par­
ties jointly stipulated to the dismissal of 119 members of
the jury pool for cause, hardship, or disability, but numer­
ous individuals who had made harsh comments about
Skilling remained.6
On December 28, 2005, shortly after the questionnaires

covered in lead newspaper and television stories. A front­
page headline in the Chronicle proclaimed that “Causey’s

5 Another 20 percent (about 59 of 283) indicated that they read the
Chronicle or had otherwise heard about the Enron cases but did not
report that they were victims or make comments suggesting possible
bias against the defendants.
6 See, e.g., Juror 29 (Skilling is “[n]ot an honest man”); Juror 104
(Skilling “knows more than he’s admitting”); Juror 211 (“I believe he
was involved in wrong doings”); Juror 219 (“So many people lost their
life savings because of the dishonesty of some members of the executive
team”; Skilling was “[t]oo aggressive w[ith] accounting”); Juror 234
(“With his level of control and power, hard to believe that he was
unaware and not responsible in some way”); Juror 240 (Skilling
“[s]eems to be very much involved in criminal goings on”); Juror 255
(“[T]housands of people were taken advantage of by executives at
Enron”; Skilling is “arrogant”; “Skilling was Andrew Fastow’s immedi­
ate superior. Fastow has plead[ed] guilty to felony charges. I believe
Skilling was aware of Fastow’s illegal behavior”); Juror 263 (“Nice try
resigning 6 months before the collaps[e], but again, he had to know
what was going on”); Juror 272 (Skilling “[k]new he was getting out
before the [d]am [b]roke”); Juror 292 (Skilling “[b]ailed out when he
knew Enron was going down”); Juror 315 (“[H]ow could they not know
and they seem to be lying about some things”); Juror 328 (“They should
be held responsible as officers of this company for what happened”);
Juror 350 (“I believe he greatly misused his power and affected hun­
dreds of lives as a result”; “I believe they are all guilty. Their ‘doings’
affected not only those employed by Enron but many others as well”);
Juror 360 (“I seem to remember him trying to claim to have mental or
emotional issues that would remove him from any guilt. I think that is
deceitful. It seems as though he is a big player in the downfall”); Juror
378 (“I believe he knew, and certainly should have known as the CEO,
that illegal and improper [activities] were rampant in Enron”; “I believe
all of them were instrumental, and were co-conspirators, in the massive
fraud perpetrated at Enron”). Skilling’s Renewed Venue Motion.
