SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

nary people can understand what conduct is prohibited
and [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement.” Kolender v. Lawson, 461
U. S. 352, 357 (1983). The void-for-vagueness doctrine
embraces these requirements.
According to Skilling, §1346 meets neither of the two
due process essentials. First, the phrase “the intangible
right of honest services,” he contends, does not adequately
define what behavior it bars. Brief for Petitioner 38–39.
Second, he alleges, §1346’s “standardless sweep allows
policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal
predilections,” thereby “facilitat[ing] opportunistic and
arbitrary prosecutions.” Id., at 44 (quoting Kolender, 461
U. S., at 358).
In urging invalidation of §1346, Skilling swims against
our case law’s current, which requires us, if we can, to
construe, not condemn, Congress’ enactments. See, e.g.,
Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571
(1973). See also United States v. National Dairy Products
Corp., 372 U. S. 29, 32 (1963) (stressing, in response to a
vagueness challenge, “[t]he strong presumptive validity
that attaches to an Act of Congress”). Alert to §1346’s
potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on
how best to interpret the statute.36 Uniformly, however,
they have declined to throw out the statute as irremedia­
——————
36 Courts have disagreed about whether §1346 prosecutions must be
based on a violation of state law, compare, e.g., United States v. Brum
ley, 116 F. 3d 728, 734–735 (CA5 1997) (en banc), with, e.g., United
States v. Weyhrauch, 548 F. 3d 1237, 1245–1246 (CA9 2008), vacated
and remanded, post, p. ___; whether a defendant must contemplate that
the victim suffer economic harm, compare, e.g., United States v. SunDiamond Growers of Cal., 138 F. 3d 961, 973 (CADC 1998), with, e.g.,
United States v. Black, 530 F. 3d 596, 600–602 (CA7 2008), vacated and
remanded, post, p. ___; and whether the defendant must act in pursuit
of private gain, compare, e.g., United States v. Bloom, 149 F. 3d 649,
655 (CA7 1998), with, e.g., United States v. Panarella, 277 F. 3d 678,
692 (CA3 2002).
