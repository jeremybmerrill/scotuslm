SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

struing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that
core meaning, we conclude, would encounter a vagueness
shoal. We therefore hold that §1346 covers only bribery

prosecutors and FBI agents from around the Nation. The
Government’s investigation uncovered an elaborate con­
spiracy to prop up Enron’s short-run stock prices by over­
stating the company’s financial well-being. In the years
following Enron’s bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted
dozens of Enron employees who participated in the
scheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the
corporation’s chain of command: On July 7, 2004, a grand
jury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey, Enron’s
former chief accounting officer.
These three defendants, the indictment alleged,
