Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

a verdict based solely on the trial evidence, we would
generally have no reason to doubt the jury’s impartiality.8
The first of these cases, Murphy, 421 U. S. 794, involved
a well-known defendant put on trial for a widely publi­
cized Miami Beach robbery. The state trial court denied
his motion for a change of venue and during voir dire
excused 20 of the 78 prospective jurors for cause. Distin­
guishing Irvin, this Court saw no indication in the voir
dire of “such hostility to [Murphy] by the jurors who
served in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not
be laid aside.” 421 U. S., at 800. Although some jurors
“had a vague recollection of the robbery with which [Mur­
phy] was charged and each had some knowledge of [his]
past crimes,” “none betrayed any belief in the relevance of
[Murphy’s] past to the present case.” Ibid.; see also ibid.,
n. 4 (contrasting a juror’s “mere familiarity with [a defen­
dant] or his past” with “an actual predisposition against
him”). “[T]hese indicia of impartiality,” the Court sug­
gested, “might be disregarded in a case where the general
atmosphere in the community or courtroom is sufficiently
inflammatory, but the circumstances surrounding [Mur­
phy’s] trial [were] not at all of that variety.” Id., at 802.
In a second case, Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, the defendant
was granted a new trial four years after being convicted of
murder. He requested a change of venue, citing pretrial
publicity and the widespread local knowledge that he had
previously been convicted and had made confessions that
would be inadmissible in court. The state trial court
denied Yount’s motion and seated a jury following a 10­
day voir dire of 292 prospective jurors. Nearly all of the

8 Of course, even if the jury selection process is adequate, a trial court
violates a defendant’s right to an impartial jury if it erroneously denies
a for-cause challenge to a biased venire member who ultimately sits on
the jury. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304,
316 (2000) (“[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed
for cause . . . would require reversal”).
