SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

collapse on the Houston community and confirmed the
intense animosity of Houstonians toward Skilling and his
codefendants. More than one-third of the prospective
jurors (approximately 99 of 283, by my count) indicated
that they or persons they knew had lost money or jobs as a
result of the Enron bankruptcy. Two-thirds of the jurors
(about 188 of 283) expressed views about Enron or the
defendants that suggested a potential predisposition to
convict. In many instances, they did not mince words,
describing Skilling as “smug,” “arrogant,” “brash,” “con­
ceited,” “greedy,” “deceitful,” “totally unethical and crimi­
nal,” “a crook,” “the biggest liar on the face of the earth,”
and “guilty as sin” (capitalization omitted).4 Only about 5
percent of the prospective jurors (15 of 283) did not read
the Houston Chronicle, had not otherwise “heard or read
about any of the Enron cases,” Record 13019, were not
connected to Enron victims, and gave no answers suggest­

4 See, e.g., Juror 1 (“Ken Lay and the others are guilty as all get out
and ought to go to jail”; Skilling is “[b]rash, [a]rrogant [and]
[c]onceited”; “I find it morally awful that these people are still running
loose”); Juror 70 (“Mr. Skilling is the biggest liar on the face of the
earth”); Juror 163 (Skilling “would lie to his mother if it would further
his cause”); Juror 185 (“I think [Skilling] was arrogant and a crook”);
Juror 200 (Skilling is a “[s]killful [l]iar [and] crook” who did “a lot of the
dirty work”; the defendants would “have to be blind, deaf, [and] stupid
to be unaware of what was happening!” (emphasis deleted)); Juror 206
(Skilling is “[t]otally unethical and criminal”; the defendants “are all
guilty and should be reduced to having to beg on the corner [and] live
under a bridge”); Juror 238 (“They are all guilty as sin—come on now”);
Juror 299 (Skilling “initiated, designed, [and] authorized certain illegal
actions”); Juror 314 (Lay “should ‘fess up’ and take his punishment like
a man”; “[t]he same goes for Jeffrey Skilling. . . . He and his family . . .
should be stripped of all of their assets [and] made to start over just
like the thousands he made start all over”); Juror 377 (Skilling is
“[s]mug,” “[g]reedy,” and “[d]isingenu[ous]”; he “had an active hand in
creating and sustaining a fraud”). Defendants’ Renewed Motion for
Change of Venue, Record, Doc. 618 (Sealed Exhs.) (hereinafter Skill­
ing’s Renewed Venue Motion); see also App. 794a–797a (summarizing
additional responses).
