Opinion of the Court

Second, although news stories about Skilling were not
kind, they contained no confession or other blatantly
prejudicial information of the type readers or viewers
could not reasonably be expected to shut from sight.
Rideau’s dramatically staged admission of guilt, for in­
stance, was likely imprinted indelibly in the mind of any­
one who watched it. Cf. Parker v. Randolph, 442 U. S. 62,
72 (1979) (plurality opinion) (“[T]he defendant’s own con­
fession [is] probably the most probative and damaging
evidence that can be admitted against him.” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Pretrial publicity about Skill­
ing was less memorable and prejudicial. No evidence of
the smoking-gun variety invited prejudgment of his culpa­
bility. See United States v. Chagra, 669 F. 2d 241, 251–
252, n. 11 (CA5 1982) (“A jury may have difficulty in
disbelieving or forgetting a defendant’s opinion of his own
guilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of
others because they may not be well-founded.”).
Third, unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a
widely reported crime, e.g., Rideau, 373 U. S., at 724, over
four years elapsed between Enron’s bankruptcy and Skill­
ing’s trial. Although reporters covered Enron-related
news throughout this period, the decibel level of media
attention diminished somewhat in the years following
Enron’s collapse. See App. 700a; id., at 785a; Yount, 467
U. S., at 1032, 1034.
Finally, and of prime significance, Skilling’s jury acquit­
ted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly, earlier
instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no over­

App. 375a–376a. In response to the follow-up question “[w]hat words 

come to mind when you hear the name Jeff Skilling?”, two-thirds of

respondents failed to say a single negative word, id., at 376a: 43%

either had never heard of Skilling or stated that nothing came to mind

when they heard his name, and another 23% knew Skilling’s name was

associated with Enron but reported no opinion about him, Record 3210–

3211; see App. 417a–492a.
