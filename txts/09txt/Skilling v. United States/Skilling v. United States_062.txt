Opinion of SCALIA, J.

McNally itself, which rejected it. That case repudiated the
many Court of Appeals holdings that had expanded the
meaning of “fraud” in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud stat­
utes beyond deceptive schemes to obtain property. 483
U. S., at 360. If the repudiated cases stood for a prohibi­
tion of “bribery and kickbacks,” one would have expected
those words to appear in the opinion’s description of the
cases. In fact, they do not. Not at all. Nor did McNally
even provide a consistent definition of the pre-existing
theory of fraud it rejected. It referred variously to a right
of citizens “to have the [State]’s affairs conducted hon­
estly,” id., at 353, to “honest and impartial government,”
id., at 355, to “good government,” id., at 356, and “to have
public officials perform their duties honestly,” id., at 358.
It described prior case law as holding that “a public official
owes a fiduciary duty to the public, and misuse of his office
for private gain is a fraud,” id., at 355.
But the pre-McNally Court of Appeals opinions were not
limited to fraud by public officials. Some courts had held
that those fiduciaries subject to the “honest services”
obligation included private individuals who merely par­
ticipated in public decisions, see, e.g., United States v.
Gray, 790 F. 2d 1290, 1295–1296 (CA6 1986) (citing
United States v. Margiotta, 688 F. 2d 108, 122 (CA2
1982)), and even private employees who had no role in
public decisions, see, e.g., United States v. Lemire, 720
F. 2d 1327, 1335–1336 (CADC 1983); United States v. Von
Barta, 635 F. 2d 999, 1007 (CA2 1980). Moreover, “to say
that a man is a fiduciary only begins [the] analysis; it
gives direction to further inquiry. . . . What obligations
does he owe as a fiduciary?” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318
U. S. 80, 85–86 (1943). None of the “honest services”
cases, neither those pertaining to public officials nor those
pertaining to private employees, defined the nature and
content of the fiduciary duty central to the “fraud” offense.
There was not even universal agreement concerning the
