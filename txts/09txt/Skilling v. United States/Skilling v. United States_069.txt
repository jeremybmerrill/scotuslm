SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

statute be reasonably susceptible of two interpretations,
by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the
other valid, it is our plain duty to adopt that construction
which will save the statute from constitutional infirmity.”
United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware &
Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407 (1909); see also United
States v. Rumely, 345 U. S. 41, 45 (1953) (describing the
canon as decisive “in the choice of fair alternatives”). Here
there is no choice to be made between two “fair alterna­
tives.” Until today, no one has thought (and there is no
basis for thinking) that the honest-services statute prohib­
ited only bribery and kickbacks.
I certainly agree with the Court that we must, “if we
can,” uphold, rather than “condemn,” Congress’s enact­
ments, ante, at 38. But I do not believe we have the
power, in order to uphold an enactment, to rewrite it.
Congress enacted the entirety of the pre-McNally honest­
services law, the content of which is (to put it mildly)
unclear. In prior vagueness cases, we have resisted the
temptation to make all things right with the stroke of our
pen. See, e.g., Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575 (1974).
I would show the same restraint today, and reverse Skill­
ing’s conviction on the basis that §1346 provides no “ascer­
tainable standard” for the conduct it condemns, L. Cohen,
255 U. S., at 89. Instead, the Court today adds to our
functions the prescription of criminal law.
III
A brief word about the appropriate remedy. As I noted
supra, at 2, Skilling has argued that §1346 cannot be
constitutionally applied to him because it affords no defi­
nition of the right whose deprivation it prohibits. Though
this reasoning is categorical, it does not make Skilling’s
challenge a “facial” one, in the sense that it seeks invalida­
tion of the statute in all its applications, as opposed to
preventing its enforcement against him. I continue to
