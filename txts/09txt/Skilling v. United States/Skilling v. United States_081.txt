SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

plea wreaks havoc for Lay, Skilling.” Record 12049, n. 13;
see also ibid. (quoting a former U. S. attorney who de­
scribed the plea as “a serious blow to the defense”). A
Chronicle editorial opined that “Causey’s admission of
securities fraud . . . . makes less plausible Lay’s claim that
most of the guilty pleas were the result of prosecutorial
pressure rather than actual wrongdoing.” Id., at 12391.
With the trial date quickly approaching, Skilling re­
newed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that both the
questionnaire responses and the Causey guilty plea con­
firmed that he could not receive a fair trial in Houston. In
the alternative, Skilling asserted that “defendants are
entitled to a more thorough jury selection process than
currently envisioned by the [c]ourt.” Id., at 12067. The
court had announced its intention to question individual
jurors at the bench with one attorney for each side pre­
sent, and to complete the voir dire in a single day. See,
e.g., id., at 11804–11805, 11808. Skilling proposed, inter
alia, that defense counsel be afforded a greater role in
questioning, id., at 12074; that jurors be questioned pri­
vately in camera or in a closed courtroom where it would
be easier for counsel to consult with their colleagues,
clients, and jury consultants, id., at 12070–12072; and
that the court “avoid leading questions,” which “tend to
[e]licit affirmative responses from prospective jurors that
may not reflect their actual views,” id., at 12072. At a
minimum, Skilling asserted, the court should grant a
continuance of at least 30 days and send a revised ques­
tionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors. Id., at
12074–12075.
The District Court denied Skilling’s motion without a
hearing, stating in a brief order that it was “not persuaded
that the evidence or arguments urged by defendants . . .
establish that pretrial publicity and/or community preju­
dice raise a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.” Id.,
at 14115. According to the court, the “jury questionnaires
