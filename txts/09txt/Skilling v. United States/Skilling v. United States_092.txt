case or would be biased in any way.” Id., at 421.
Rejecting Mu’Min’s attempt to analogize his case to
Irvin, this Court observed that “the cases differ both in the
kind of community in which the coverage took place and in
extent of media coverage.” 500 U. S., at 429. Mu’Min’s
offense occurred in the metropolitan Washington, D. C.,
area, “which has a population of over 3 million, and in
which, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed
each year.” Ibid. While the crime garnered “substantial”
pretrial publicity, the coverage was not as pervasive as in
Irvin and “did not contain the same sort of damaging
information.” 500 U. S., at 429–430. Moreover, in con­
trast to Irvin, the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed
having ever formed an opinion about the case. Given
these circumstances, this Court rebuffed Mu’Min’s asser­
tion that the trial court committed constitutional error by
declining to “make precise inquiries about the contents of
any news reports that potential jurors have read.” 500
U. S., at 424. The Court stressed, however, that its ruling
was context-specific: “Had the trial court in this case been
confronted with the ‘wave of public passion’ engendered by
pretrial publicity that occurred in connection with Irvin’s
trial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend­
ment might well have required more extensive examina­
tion of potential jurors than it undertook here.” Id., at
429.

It is necessary to determine how this case compares to
our existing fair-trial precedents. Were the circumstances
so inherently prejudicial that, as in Rideau, even the most
scrupulous voir dire would have been “but a hollow formal­
ity” incapable of reliably producing an impartial jury? 373
U. S., at 726. If the circumstances were not of this charac­
ter, did the District Court conduct a jury selection process
sufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and
