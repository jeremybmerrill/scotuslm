SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

publicized decision to plead guilty on the eve of trial.”
Ibid. The Court of Appeals, moreover, faulted the District
Court for failing to “consider the wider context.” Id., at
560. “[I]t was not enough for the court merely to assess
the tone of the news reporting. The evaluation of the
volume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy for the
real inquiry: whether there could be a fair trial by an
impartial jury that was not influenced by outside, irrele­
vant sources.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
According to the Court of Appeals, “[t]he district court
seemed to overlook that the prejudice came from more
than just pretrial media publicity, but also from the sheer
number of victims.” Ibid.
Having determined that “Skilling was entitled to a
presumption of prejudice,” the Court of Appeals proceeded
to explain that “the presumption is rebuttable, . . . and the
government may demonstrate from the voir dire that an
impartial jury was actually impanelled.” Id., at 561 (in­
ternal quotation marks omitted). Describing the voir dire
as “exemplary,” “searching,” and “proper and thorough,”
id., at 562, the court concluded that “[t]he government
[had] met its burden of showing that the actual jury that
convicted Skilling was impartial,” id., at 564–565. On this
basis, the Court of Appeals rejected Skilling’s claim and
affirmed his convictions.

The Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and
the due process right to a fundamentally fair trial guaran­
tee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set aside
preconceptions, disregard extrajudicial influences, and

in court.” Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 723 (1961); see
also Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 362 (1966).
Community passions, often inflamed by adverse pretrial
publicity, can call the integrity of a trial into doubt. In
