SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

source of the fiduciary obligation—whether it must be
positive state or federal law, see, e.g., United States v.
Rabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014, 1026 (CA8 1978), or merely gen­
eral principles, such as the “obligations of loyalty and
fidelity” that inhere in the “employment relationship,”
Lemire, supra, at 1336. The decision McNally reversed
had grounded the duty in general (not jurisdiction-specific)
trust law, see Gray, supra, at 1294, a corpus juris fes­
tooned with various duties. See, e.g., Restatement (Sec­
ond) of Trusts §§169–185 (1976). Another pre-McNally
case referred to the general law of agency, United States v.
Ballard, 663 F. 2d 534, 543, n. 22 (CA5 1981), modified on
other grounds by 680 F. 2d 352 (1982), which imposes
duties quite different from those of a trustee.1 See Re­
statement (Second) of Agency §§377–398 (1957).
This indeterminacy does not disappear if one assumes
that the pre-McNally cases developed a federal, common­
law fiduciary duty; the duty remained hopelessly unde­
fined. Some courts described it in astoundingly broad
language. Blachly v. United States, 380 F. 2d 665 (CA5
1967), loftily declared that “[l]aw puts its imprimatur on
the accepted moral standards and condemns conduct
which fails to match the ‘reflection of moral uprightness,
of fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the
general and business life of members of society.’ ” Id., at
671 (quoting Gregory v. United States, 253 F. 2d 104, 109
(CA5 1958)). Other courts unhelpfully added that any
scheme “contrary to public policy” was also condemned by

1 The

Court is untroubled by these divisions because “these debates
were rare in bribe and kickback cases,” in which “[t]he existence of a
fiduciary relationship, under any definition of that term, was usually
beyond dispute,” ante, at 43, n. 41. This misses the point. The Courts
of Appeals may have consistently found unlawful the acceptance of a
bribe or kickback by one or another sort of fiduciary, but they have not
consistently described (as the statute does not) any test for who is a
fiduciary.
