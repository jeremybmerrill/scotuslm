SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

gress’ undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.
Nor are we persuaded that the pre-McNally conflict-of­
interest cases constitute core applications of the honest­
services doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld
honest-services convictions for “some schemes of non­
disclosure and concealment of material information,”
Mandel, 591 F. 2d, at 1361, they reached no consensus on
which schemes qualified. In light of the relative infre­
quency of conflict-of-interest prosecutions in comparison to
bribery and kickback charges, and the intercircuit incon­
sistencies they produced, we conclude that a reasonable
limiting construction of §1346 must exclude this amor­
phous category of cases.
Further dispelling doubt on this point is the familiar
principle that “ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal
statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.” Cleveland,
531 U. S., at 25 (quoting Rewis v. United States, 401 U. S.
808, 812 (1971)). “This interpretive guide is especially
appropriate in construing [§1346] because . . . mail [and
wire] fraud [are] predicate offense[s] under [the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act], 18 U. S. C.
§1961(1) (1994 ed., Supp. IV), and the money laundering
statute, §1956(c)(7)(A).” Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 25.
Holding that honest-services fraud does not encompass
conduct more wide-ranging than the paradigmatic cases of
bribes and kickbacks, we resist the Government’s less
constrained construction absent Congress’ clear instruc­
tion otherwise. E.g., United States v. Universal C. I. T.
Credit Corp., 344 U. S. 218, 221–222 (1952).
In sum, our construction of §1346 “establish[es] a uni­
form national standard, define[s] honest services with
clarity, reach[es] only seriously culpable conduct, and
accomplish[es] Congress’s goal of ‘overruling’ McNally.”
