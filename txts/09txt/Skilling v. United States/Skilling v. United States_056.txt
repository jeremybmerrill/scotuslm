Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback
schemes, §1346 is not unconstitutionally vague. Recall
that the void-for-vagueness doctrine addresses concerns
about (1) fair notice and (2) arbitrary and discriminatory
prosecutions. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. A prohibi­
tion on fraudulently depriving another of one’s honest
services by accepting bribes or kickbacks does not present
a problem on either score.
As to fair notice, “whatever the school of thought con­
cerning the scope and meaning of ” §1346, it has always
been “as plain as a pikestaff that” bribes and kickbacks
constitute honest-services fraud, Williams v. United
States, 341 U. S. 97, 101 (1951), and the statute’s mens rea
requirement further blunts any notice concern, see, e.g.,
Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101–104 (1945)
(plurality opinion). See also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413
U. S. 601, 608 (1973) (“[E]ven if the outermost boundaries

44 If Congress were to take up the enterprise of criminalizing “undis­
closed self-dealing by a public official or private employee,” Brief for
United States 43, it would have to employ standards of sufficient
definiteness and specificity to overcome due process concerns. The
Government proposes a standard that prohibits the “taking of official
action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial
interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he
owes a fiduciary duty,” so long as the employee acts with a specific
intent to deceive and the undisclosed conduct could influence the victim
to change its behavior. Id., at 43–44. See also id., at 40–41. That
formulation, however, leaves many questions unanswered. How direct
or significant does the conflicting financial interest have to be? To
what extent does the official action have to further that interest in
order to amount to fraud? To whom should the disclosure be made and
what information should it convey? These questions and others call for
particular care in attempting to formulate an adequate criminal prohi­
bition in this context.
