Opinion of the Court

v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (1984).13 Prominence does not
necessarily produce prejudice, and juror impartiality, we
have reiterated, does not require ignorance. Irvin v.
Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 722 (1961) (Jurors are not required
to be “totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved”;
“scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will
not have formed some impression or opinion as to the
merits of the case.”); Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S.
145, 155–156 (1879) (“[E]very case of public interest is
almost, as a matter of necessity, brought to the attention
of all the intelligent people in the vicinity, and scarcely
any one can be found among those best fitted for jurors
who has not read or heard of it, and who has not some

Murphy, a convicted murderer who helped mastermind the 1964 heist
of the Star of India sapphire from New York’s American Museum of
Natural History. Pointing to “extensive press coverage” about him,
Murphy moved to transfer venue. 421 U. S., at 796. The trial court
denied the motion and a jury convicted Murphy. We affirmed. Mur­
phy’s trial, we explained, was markedly different from the proceedings
at issue in Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723 (1963), Estes v. Texas,
381 U. S. 532 (1965), and Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),
which “entirely lack[ed] . . . the solemnity and sobriety to which a
defendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of
fairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.” 421 U. S., at 799. Voir dire
revealed no great hostility toward Murphy; “[s]ome of the jurors had a
vague recollection of the robbery with which [he] was charged and each
had some knowledge of [his] past crimes, but none betrayed any belief
in the relevance of [his] past to the present case.” Id., at 800 (footnote
omitted).
13 In Yount, the media reported on Jon Yount’s confession to a brutal
murder and his prior conviction for the crime, which had been reversed
due to a violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). During
voir dire, 77% of prospective jurors acknowledged they would carry an
opinion into the jury box, and 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates
admitted they had formed an opinion as to Yount’s guilt. 467 U. S., at
1029–1030.
Nevertheless, we rejected Yount’s presumption-of­
prejudice claim. The adverse publicity and community outrage, we
noted, were at their height prior to Yount’s first trial, four years before
the second prosecution; time had helped “sooth[e] and eras[e]” commu­
nity prejudice, id., at 1034.
