SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

community animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable
of presuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial
influences?
A
Though the question is close, I agree with the Court that
the prospect of seating an unbiased jury in Houston was
not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the District
Court acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling’s mo­
tion to change venue. Three considerations lead me to this
conclusion. First, as the Court observes, ante, at 16, the
size and diversity of the Houston community make it
probable that the jury pool contained a nontrivial number
of persons who were unaffected by Enron’s collapse, neu­
tral in their outlook, and unlikely to be swept up in the
public furor. Second, media coverage of the case, while
ubiquitous and often inflammatory, did not, as the Court
points out, ante, at 17, contain a confession by Skilling or
similar “smoking-gun” evidence of specific criminal acts.
For many prospective jurors, the guilty plea of codefen­
dant and alleged co-conspirator Causey, along with the
pleas and convictions of other Enron executives, no doubt
suggested guilt by association. But reasonable minds
exposed to such information would not necessarily have
formed an indelible impression that Skilling himself was
guilty as charged. Cf. Rideau, 373 U. S., at 726 (a major­
ity of the county’s residents were “exposed repeatedly and
in depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing
in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be
charged”). Third, there is no suggestion that the court­
room in this case became, as in Estes and Sheppard, a
“carnival” in which the “calmness and solemnity” of the
proceedings was compromised. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at
358, 350 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is thus
appropriate to examine the voir dire and determine
whether it instills confidence in the impartiality of the
