Opinion of SCALIA, J.

doubt whether “striking down” a statute is ever an appro­
priate exercise of our Article III power. See Chicago v.
Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 77 (1999) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
In the present case, the universality of the infirmity Skill­
ing identifies in §1346 may mean that if he wins, anyone
else prosecuted under the statute will win as well, see
Smith, supra, at 576–578. But Skilling only asks that his
conviction be reversed, Brief for Petitioner 57–58, so the
remedy he seeks is not facial invalidation.
I would therefore reverse Skilling’s conviction under
§1346 on the ground that it fails to define the conduct it
prohibits. The fate of the statute in future prosecutions—
obvious from my reasoning in the case—would be a matter
for stare decisis.

It is hard to imagine a case that more clearly fits the
description of what Chief Justice Waite said could not be
done, in a colorful passage oft-cited in our vagueness
opinions, United States v. Reese, 92 U. S., at 221:
“The question, then, to be determined, is, whether
we can introduce words of limitation into a penal
statute so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it
is general only.
“It would certainly be dangerous if the legislature
could set a net large enough to catch all possible of­
fenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and
say who could be rightfully detained, and who should
be set at large. This would, to some extent, substitute
the judicial for the legislative department of the gov­
ernment. . . .
“To limit this statute in the manner now asked
for would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old
one. This is no part of our duty.”
