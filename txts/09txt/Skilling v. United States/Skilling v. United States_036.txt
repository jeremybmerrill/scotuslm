Opinion of the Court

here. Leslie Irvin stood accused of a brutal murder and
robbery spree in a small rural community. 366 U. S., at
719. In the months before Irvin’s trial, “a barrage” of
publicity was “unleashed against him,” including reports
of his confessions to the slayings and robberies. Id., at

[Irvin’s] execution . . . . Another characterized [Irvin]
as remorseless and without conscience but also as
