SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

though it had earlier instructed prospective jurors not to
talk to each other about the case. Id., at 843a. It is thus
not apparent whether other prospective jurors also over­
heard the information and whether they too believed that
it reflected unfavorably on the defendants; nor is it appar­
ent what other outside information may have been shared
among the venire members. At the very least, Juror 101’s
statements indicate that the court’s questions were failing
to bring to light the extent of jurors’ exposure to poten­
tially prejudicial facts and that some prospective jurors were having difficulty following the court’s
directives.
The topics that the District Court did cover were ad­
dressed in cursory fashion. Most prospective jurors were
asked just a few yes/no questions about their general
exposure to media coverage and a handful of additional
questions concerning any responses to the written ques­
tionnaire that suggested bias. In many instances, their
answers were unenlightening.16 Yet the court rarely
sought to draw them out with open-ended questions about
their impressions of Enron or Skilling and showed limited
patience for counsel’s followup efforts. See, e.g., id., at

16 The

court’s exchange with Juror 20 (who sat on the jury) is typical:
“Q. Do you remember reading any particular articles about this case
or Mr. Lay or Mr. Skilling?
“A. Not until just recently this week, but nothing—
“Q. And there have been a lot of articles this week.
“A. Yeah.
“Q. Do you recall any particular articles you’ve read in the last week
or so?
“A. Not word for word, no.
“Q. Did you read all the articles in the Sunday “Chronicle”?
“A. Some of them.
“Q. Which ones do you remember reading?
“A. The one about the trial, I think, and how the trial was going to
work.” Id., at 873a–874a.
