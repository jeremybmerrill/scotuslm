SKILLING v. UNITED STATES 

Opinion of the Court 


III 

We next consider whether Skilling’s conspiracy convic­
tion was premised on an improper theory of honest­
services wire fraud. The honest-services statute, §1346,
Skilling maintains, is unconstitutionally vague. Alterna­
tively, he contends that his conduct does not fall within
the statute’s compass.
A
To place Skilling’s constitutional challenge in context,
we first review the origin and subsequent application of
the honest-services doctrine.
1
Enacted in 1872, the original mail-fraud provision, the
predecessor of the modern-day mail- and wire-fraud laws,
proscribed, without further elaboration, use of the mails to
advance “any scheme or artifice to defraud.” See McNally
v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 356 (1987). In 1909, Con­
gress amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today,
“any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money
or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises.” §1341 (emphasis added); see
id., at 357–358. Emphasizing Congress’ disjunctive phras­
ing, the Courts of Appeals, one after the other, interpreted
the term “scheme or artifice to defraud” to include depri­
vations not only of money or property, but also of intangi­
ble rights.
In an opinion credited with first presenting the intangi­
——————
prejudice due to pretrial publicity. See, e.g., Mu’Min, 500 U. S. 415;
Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (1984); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S.
794 (1975). News coverage of civil and criminal trials of public interest
conveys to society at large how our justice system operates. And it is a
premise of that system that jurors will set aside their preconceptions
when they enter the courtroom and decide cases based on the evidence
presented. Trial judges generally take care so to instruct jurors, and
the District Court did just that in this case. App. 1026a.
