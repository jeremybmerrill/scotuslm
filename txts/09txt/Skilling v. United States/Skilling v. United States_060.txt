JEFFREY K. SKILLING, PETITIONER v. UNITED 

STATES 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, and
with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY joins except as to Part III,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that petitioner Jeffrey Skilling’s
challenge to the impartiality of his jury and to the District
Court’s conduct of the voir dire fails. I therefore join Parts
I and II of the Court’s opinion. I also agree that the deci­
sion upholding Skilling’s conviction for so-called “honest­
services fraud” must be reversed, but for a different rea­
son. In my view, the specification in 18 U. S. C. §1346
(2006 ed., Supp. II) that “scheme or artifice to defraud” in
the mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes, §§1341 and 1343
(2006 ed.), includes “a scheme or artifice to deprive an­
other of the intangible right of honest services,” is vague,
and therefore violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment. The Court strikes a pose of judicial humility
in proclaiming that our task is “not to destroy the Act . . .
but to construe it,” ante, at 42 (internal quotation marks
omitted). But in transforming the prohibition of “honest­
services fraud” into a prohibition of “bribery and kick­
backs” it is wielding a power we long ago abjured: the
power to define new federal crimes. See United States v.
Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).
