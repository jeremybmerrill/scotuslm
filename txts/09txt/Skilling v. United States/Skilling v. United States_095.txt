SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

In conducting this analysis, I am mindful of the “wide
discretion” owed to trial courts when it comes to jury­
related issues. Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 427; cf. ante, at 20–
21. Trial courts are uniquely positioned to assess public
sentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors. Prox­
imity to events, however, is not always a virtue. Persons
in the midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view.
“[A]ppellate tribunals [thus] have the duty to make an
independent evaluation of the circumstances.” Sheppard,
384 U. S., at 362. In particular, reviewing courts are well
qualified to inquire into whether a trial court implemented
procedures adequate to keep community prejudices from
infecting the jury. If the jury selection process does not
befit the circumstances of the case, the trial court’s rulings
on impartiality are necessarily called into doubt. See
Morgan, 504 U. S., at 729–730 (“ ‘Without an adequate
voir dire the trial judge’s responsibility to remove prospec­
tive jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the
court’s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be
fulfilled’ ” (quoting Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451
U. S. 182, 188 (1981) (plurality opinion))); see also
Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 451 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (“Our
willingness to accord substantial deference to a trial
court’s finding of juror impartiality rests on our expecta­
tion that the trial court will conduct a sufficient voir dire
to determine the credibility of a juror professing to be
impartial”).

As the Court of Appeals apprehended, the District Court
gave short shrift to the mountainous evidence of public
hostility. For Houstonians, Enron’s collapse was an event
of once-in-a-generation proportions. Not only was the
volume of media coverage “immense” and frequently in­
temperate, but “the sheer number of victims” created a
climate in which animosity toward Skilling ran deep and
