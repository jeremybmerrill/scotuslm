SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

to forfeit [her] own 401(k) funds to survive layoffs.’ ” Reply
Brief 13. But Juror 20 made clear during voir dire that
she did not “personally blame” Skilling for the loss of her
retirement account. App. 875a. Having not “pa[id] much
attention” to Enron-related news, she “quite honestly” did
not “have enough information to know” whether Skilling
was probably guilty, id., at 873a, and she “th[ought] [she]
could be” fair and impartial, id., at 875a. In light of these
answers, the District Court did not commit manifest error
in finding Juror 20 fit for jury service.
The same is true of Juror 63, who, Skilling points out,
wrote on her questionnaire “that [Skilling] ‘probably knew
[he] w[as] breaking the law.’ ” Reply Brief 13. During voir
dire, however, Juror 63 insisted that she did not “really
have an opinion [about Skilling’s guilt] either way,” App.
936a; she did not “know what [she] was thinking” when
she completed the questionnaire, but she “absolutely”
presumed Skilling innocent and confirmed her under­
standing that the Government would “have to prove” his
guilt, id., at 937a. In response to follow-up questions from
Skilling’s counsel, she again stated she would not presume
that Skilling violated any laws and could “[a]bsolutely”
give her word that she could be fair. Id., at 937a–938a.
“Jurors,” we have recognized, “cannot be expected invaria­
bly to express themselves carefully or even consistently.”
Yount, 467 U. S., at 1039. See also id., at 1040 (“It is here
that the federal [appellate] court’s deference must operate,
for while the cold record arouses some concern, only the
trial judge could tell which of these answers was said with
the greatest comprehension and certainty.”). From where
we sit, we cannot conclude that Juror 63 was biased.
The four remaining jurors Skilling said he would have
excluded with extra peremptory strikes exhibited no sign
of prejudice we can discern. See App. 891a–892a (Juror
38) (remembered no media coverage about Enron and said
nothing in her experience would prevent her from being
