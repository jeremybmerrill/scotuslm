Opinion of the Court

Skilling contends that Juror 11—the only seated juror
he challenged for cause—“expressed the most obvious
bias.” Brief for Petitioner 35. See also post, at 36 (dis­
sent). Juror 11 stated that “greed on Enron’s part” trig­
gered the company’s bankruptcy and that corporate execu­
tives, driven by avarice, “walk a line that stretches
sometimes the legality of something.” App. 854a–855a.
But, as the Fifth Circuit accurately summarized, Juror 11
“had ‘no idea’ whether Skilling had ‘crossed that line,’
and he ‘didn’t say that’ every CEO is probably a crook.
He also asserted that he could be fair and require the
government to prove its case, that he did not believe
everything he read in the paper, that he did not ‘get
into the details’ of the Enron coverage, that he did not
watch television, and that Enron was ‘old news.’ ” 554
F. 3d, at 563–564.
Despite his criticism of greed, Juror 11 remarked that
Skilling “earned [his] salar[y],” App. 857a, and said he
would have “no problem” telling his co-worker, who had
lost 401(k) funds due to Enron’s collapse, that the jury
voted to acquit, if that scenario came to pass, id., at 854a.
The District Court, noting that it had “looked [Juror 11] in
the eye and . . . heard all his [answers],” found his asser­
tions of impartiality credible. Id., at 858a; cf. supra, at 29,
n. 30. We agree with the Court of Appeals that “[t]he
express finding that Juror 11 was fair is not reversible
error.” 554 F. 3d, at 564.32
Skilling also objected at trial to the seating of six spe­
cific jurors whom, he said, he would have excluded had he
not already exhausted his peremptory challenges. See
supra, at 8–9. Juror 20, he observes, “said she was ‘angry’
about Enron’s collapse and that she, too, had been ‘forced

32 Skilling’s trial counsel and jury consultants apparently did not
regard Juror 11 as so “obvious[ly] bias[ed],” Brief for Petitioner 35, as to
warrant exercise of a peremptory challenge.
