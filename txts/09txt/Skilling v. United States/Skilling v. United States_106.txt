Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

this Court has made plain, jurors’ assurances of impartial­
ity simply are not entitled to this sort of talismanic signifi­
cance. See, e.g., Murphy, 421 U. S., at 800 (“[T]he juror’s
assurances that he is equal to th[e] task cannot be disposi­
tive of the accused’s rights”); Irvin, 366 U. S., at 728
(“Where so many, so many times, admi[t] prejudice, . . . a
statement of impartiality can be given little weight”).
Worse still, the District Court on a number of occasions
accepted declarations of impartiality that were equivocal
on their face. Prospective jurors who “hope[d]” they could
presume innocence and did “not necessarily” think Skill­
ing was guilty were permitted to remain in the pool. App.
932a, 857a. Juror 61, for instance, wrote of Lay on her
questionnaire, “Shame on him.” Id., at 931a. Asked by
the court about this, she stated that, “innocent or guilty,
he was at the helm” and “should have known what was
going on at the company.” Ibid.; see also id., at 934a
(Skilling is “probably” “in the same boat as” Lay). The
court then asked, “can you presume, as you start this trial,
that Mr. Lay is innocent?” Id., at 932a. She responded, “I
hope so, but you know. I don’t know. I can’t honestly
answer that one way or the other.” Ibid.; see also id., at
933a (“I bring in my past history. I bring in my biases. I
would like to think I could rise above those, but I’ve never
been in this situation before. So I don’t know how I could
honestly answer that question one way or the other. . . . I
do have some concerns”). Eventually, however, Juror 61
answered “Yes” when the court asked if she would be able
to acquit if she had “a reasonable doubt that the defen­
dants are guilty.” Id., at 933a–934a. Challenging her for
cause, defense counsel insisted that they had not received
“a clear and unequivocal answer” about her ability to be
—————— 

little is known about many of them. Cf. 6 LaFave §23.2(f), at 288 (“The

responses of those not seated casts light on the credibility of the seated

jurors who were familiar with the same publicity”).
