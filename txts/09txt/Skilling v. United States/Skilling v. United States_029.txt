SKILLING v. UNITED STATES 

Opinion of the Court 


B

We next consider whether actual prejudice infected
Skilling’s jury. Voir dire, Skilling asserts, did not ade­
quately detect and defuse juror bias. “[T]he record . . .
affirmatively confirm[s]” prejudice, he maintains, because
several seated jurors “prejudged his guilt.” Brief for Peti­
tioner 21. We disagree with Skilling’s characterization of
the voir dire and the jurors selected through it.

No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth
or breadth of voir dire. See United States v. Wood, 299
U. S. 123, 145–146 (1936) (“Impartiality is not a technical
conception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of
this mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the Con­
stitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is
not chained to any ancient and artificial formula.”). Jury
selection, we have repeatedly emphasized, is “particularly
within the province of the trial judge.” Ristaino v. Ross,
424 U. S. 589, 594–595 (1976) (internal quotation marks
omitted); see, e.g., Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 424; Yount, 467
U. S., at 1038; Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U. S.
182, 188–189 (1981) (plurality opinion); Connors v. United
States, 158 U. S. 408–413 (1895).
When pretrial publicity is at issue, “primary reliance on
the judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good
sense” because the judge “sits in the locale where the
publicity is said to have had its effect” and may base her
evaluation on her “own perception of the depth and extent
of news stories that might influence a juror.” Mu’Min, 500
U. S., at 427. Appellate courts making after-the-fact
——————
jury in Houston was not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the
District Court acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling’s motion to
change venue.” Post, at 20. The dissent’s conclusion that Skilling did
not receive a fair trial accordingly turns on its perception of the ade­
quacy of the jury-selection process.
