JEFFREY K. SKILLING, PETITIONER v. UNITED 

STATES 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.
I join the judgment of the Court and all but Part II of
the Court’s opinion. I write separately to address peti
tioner’s jury-trial argument.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants
a trial before “an impartial jury.” In my view, this re
quirement is satisfied so long as no biased juror is actually
seated at trial. Of course, evidence of pretrial media
attention and widespread community hostility may play a
role in the bias inquiry. Such evidence may be important
in assessing the adequacy of voir dire, see, e.g., Mu’Min v.
Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 428–432 (1991), or in reviewing
the denial of requests to dismiss particular jurors for
cause, see, e.g., Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, 1036–
1040 (1984). There are occasions in which such evidence
weighs heavily in favor of a change of venue. In the end,
however, if no biased jury is actually seated, there is no
violation of the defendant’s right to an impartial jury. See
id., at 1031–1035, 1041; Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794,
800–801, 803 (1975); see also Rivera v. Illinois, 556 U. S.
___, ___–___ (2009) (slip op., at 7–8); United States v.
Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 311, 316–317 (2000);
Smith v. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209, 215–218 (1982).
Petitioner advances a very different understanding of
