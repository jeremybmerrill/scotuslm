SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

the right to trial by an impartial jury. By constitutional
design, that trial occurs “in the State where the . . .
Crimes . . . have been committed.” Art. III, §2, cl. 3. See
also Amdt. 6 (right to trial by “jury of the State and dis­
trict wherein the crime shall have been committed”). The
Constitution’s place-of-trial prescriptions, however, do not
impede transfer of the proceeding to a different district at
the defendant’s request if extraordinary local prejudice
will prevent a fair trial—a “basic requirement of due
process,” In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136 (1955).11

“The theory of our [trial] system is that the conclusions
to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence
and argument in open court, and not by any outside influ­

transfer in federal court is governed by Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 21, which instructs that a “court must transfer the
proceeding . . . to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a
prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that
the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there.” As the
language of the Rule suggests, district-court calls on the necessity of
transfer are granted a healthy measure of appellate-court respect. See
Platt v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 376 U. S. 240, 245 (1964).
Federal courts have invoked the Rule to move certain highly charged
cases, for example, the prosecution arising from the bombing of the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City. See
United States v. McVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 1474 (WD Okla. 1996).
They have also exercised discretion to deny venue-transfer requests in
cases involving substantial pretrial publicity and community impact,
for example, the prosecutions resulting from the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing, see United States v. Salameh, No. S5 93 Cr. 0180
(KTD) (SDNY, Sept. 15, 1993); United States v. Yousef, No. S12 93
Cr. 180 (KTD) (SDNY, July 18, 1997), aff’d 327 F. 3d 56, 155 (CA2
2003), and the prosecution of John Walker Lindh, referred to in the
press as the American Taliban, see United States v. Lindh, 212
F. Supp. 2d 541, 549–551 (ED Va. 2002). Skilling does not argue,
distinct from his due process challenge, that the District Court abused
its discretion under Rule 21 by declining to move his trial. We there­
fore review the District Court’s venue-transfer decision only for compli­
ance with the Constitution.
