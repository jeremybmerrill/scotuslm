SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Circuit observed in its leading analysis of §1346:
“The definite article ‘the’ suggests that ‘intangible
right of honest services’ had a specific meaning to
Congress when it enacted the statute—Congress was
recriminalizing mail- and wire-fraud schemes to de­
prive others of that ‘intangible right of honest ser­
vices,’ which had been protected before McNally, not
all intangible rights of honest services whatever they
might be thought to be.” United States v. Rybicki, 354
F. 3d 124, 137–138 (2003) (en banc).39

Satisfied that Congress, by enacting §1346, “meant to
reinstate the body of pre-McNally honest-services law,”
post, at 8 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), we have surveyed that
case law. See infra, at 42–44, 46. In parsing the Courts of
Appeals decisions, we acknowledge that Skilling’s vague­
ness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions
preceding McNally were not models of clarity or consis­
tency. See Brief for Petitioner 39–42 (describing divisions
of opinions). See also post, at 3–7 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).
While the honest-services cases preceding McNally domi­
nantly and consistently applied the fraud statute to brib­
ery and kickback schemes—schemes that were the basis of
most honest-services prosecutions—there was consider­
able disarray over the statute’s application to conduct
outside that core category. In light of this disarray, Skill­
ing urges us, as he urged the Fifth Circuit, to invalidate
the statute in toto. Brief for Petitioner 48 (Section 1346 “is

39 We considered a similar Court-Congress interplay in McDermott
Int’l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337 (1991), which involved the inter­
pretation of the term “seaman” in the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688
(2000 ed.). The Act, we recognized, “respond[ed] directly to” our deci­
sion in The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158 (1903), and “adopt[ed] without
further elaboration the term used in” that case, so we “assume[d] that
the Jones Act use[d] ‘seaman’ in the same way.” 498 U. S., at 342.
