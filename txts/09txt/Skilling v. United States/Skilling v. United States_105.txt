SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

dire questions contributed to a deeper problem: The Dis­
trict Court failed to make a sufficiently critical assessment
of prospective jurors’ assurances of impartiality. Although
the Court insists otherwise, ante, at 26, the voir dire tran­
script indicates that the District Court essentially took
jurors at their word when they promised to be fair. In­
deed, the court declined to dismiss for cause any prospec­
tive juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of impar­
tiality, no matter how much equivocation preceded it.
Juror 29, for instance, wrote on her questionnaire that
Skilling was “not an honest man.” App. 881a. During
questioning, she acknowledged having previously thought
the defendants were guilty, and she disclosed that she lost
$50,000–$60,000 in her 401(k) as a result of Enron’s col­
lapse. Id., at 880a, 883a. But she ultimately agreed that
she would be able to presume innocence. Id., at 881a,
884a. Noting that she “blame[d] Enron for the loss of her
money” and appeared to have “unshakeable bias,” Skill­
ing’s counsel challenged her for cause. Id., at 885a. The
court, however, declined to remove her, stating that “she
answered candidly she’s going to have an open mind now”
and “agree[ing]” with the Government’s assertion that “we
have to take her at her word.” Id., at 885a–886a.20 As

majority attempts to downplay the significance of Juror 29 by
noting that she did not end up on the jury because Skilling used a
peremptory challenge to remove her. See ante, at 30, n. 31. The
majority makes a similar point with respect to other venire members
who were not ultimately seated. See ante, at 24, n. 24. The comments
of these venire members, however, are relevant in assessing the impar­
tiality of the seated jurors, who were similarly “part of a community
deeply hostile to the accused” and who may have been “unwittingly
influenced by it.” Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 803 (1975); see also
Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 728 (1961). Moreover, the fact that the
District Court failed to remove persons as dubiously qualified as Juror
29 goes directly to the adequacy of its voir dire. If Juror 29 made it
through to the end of the selection process, it is difficult to have confi­
dence in the impartiality of the jurors who sat, especially given how
