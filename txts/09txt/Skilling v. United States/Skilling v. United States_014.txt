Opinion of the Court

ment proposed that they tick boxes from a checklist of
generic labels such as “[t]elevision,” “[n]ewspaper,” and
“[r]adio,” Record 8415; Skilling proposed more probing
questions asking venire members to list the specific names
of their media sources and to report on “what st[ood] out
in [their] mind[s]” of “all the things [they] ha[d] seen,
heard or read about Enron,” id., at 8404–8405.
The District Court rejected the Government’s sparer
inquiries in favor of Skilling’s submission. Skilling’s
questions “[we]re more helpful,” the court said, “because
[they] [we]re generally . . . open-ended and w[ould] allow
the potential jurors to give us more meaningful informa­
tion.” Id., at 9539. The court converted Skilling’s submis­
sion, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page
document that asked prospective jurors about, inter alia,
their sources of news and exposure to Enron-related pub­
licity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its col­
lapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possi­
ble guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company
and to anyone affected by its demise.4
