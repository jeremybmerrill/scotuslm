SKILLING v. UNITED STATES 

Opinion of SCALIA, J. 


I

A criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it
proscribes, see Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,
108 (1972). A statute that is unconstitutionally vague
cannot be saved by a more precise indictment, see Lan
zetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939), nor by
judicial construction that writes in specific criteria that its
text does not contain, see United States v. Reese, 92 U. S.
214, 219–221 (1876). Our cases have described vague
statutes as failing “to provide a person of ordinary intelli­
gence fair notice of what is prohibited, or [as being] so
standardless that [they] authoriz[e] or encourag[e] seri­
ously discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Wil
liams, 553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). Here, Skilling argues
that §1346 fails to provide fair notice and encourages
arbitrary enforcement because it provides no definition of
the right of honest services whose deprivation it prohibits.
Brief for Petitioner 38–39, 42–44. In my view Skilling is
correct.
The Court maintains that “the intangible right of honest
services ” means the right not to have one’s fiduciaries
accept “bribes or kickbacks.” Its first step in reaching
that conclusion is the assertion that the phrase refers to
“the doctrine developed” in cases decided by lower federal
courts prior to our decision in McNally v. United States,
483 U. S. 350 (1987). Ante, at 39. I do not contest that. I
agree that Congress used the novel phrase to adopt the
lower-court case law that had been disapproved by
McNally—what the Court calls “the pre-McNally honest­
services doctrine,” ante, at 42. The problem is that that
doctrine provides no “ascertainable standard of guilt,”
United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89
(1921), and certainly is not limited to “bribes or kick­
backs.”
Investigation into the meaning of “the pre-McNally
honest-services doctrine” might logically begin with
