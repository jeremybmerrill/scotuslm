the statute, United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167,
1171 (CA9 1980). See also United States v. Mandel, 591
F. 2d 1347, 1361 (CA4 1979) (any scheme that is “contrary
to public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of
moral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and
right dealing”). Even opinions that did not indulge in such
grandiloquence did not specify the duty at issue beyond
loyalty or honesty, see, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1005–
1006. Moreover, the demands of the duty were said to be
greater for public officials than for private employees, see,
e.g., Lemire, supra, at 1337, n. 13; Ballard, supra, at 541,
n. 17, but in what respects (or by how much) was never
made clear.
The indefiniteness of the fiduciary duty is not all. Many
courts held that some je-ne-sais-quoi beyond a mere
breach of fiduciary duty was needed to establish honest­
services fraud. See, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1006 (col­
lecting cases); United States v. George, 477 F. 2d 508, 512
(CA7 1973). There was, unsurprisingly, some dispute
about that, at least in the context of acts by persons owing
duties to the public. See United States v. Price, 788 F. 2d
234, 237 (CA4 1986). And even among those courts that
did require something additional where a public official
was involved, there was disagreement as to what the
addition should be. For example, in United States v. Bush,
522 F. 2d 641 (1975), the Seventh Circuit held that mate­
rial misrepresentations and active concealment were
enough, id., at 647–648. But in Rabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014,
the Eighth Circuit held that actual harm to the State was
needed, id., at 1026.
Similar disagreements occurred with respect to private
employees. Courts disputed whether the defendant must
use his fiduciary position for his own gain. Compare
Lemire, supra, at 1335 (yes), with United States v. Bron
ston, 658 F. 2d 920, 926 (CA2 1981) (no). One opinion
upheld a mail-fraud conviction on the ground that the
