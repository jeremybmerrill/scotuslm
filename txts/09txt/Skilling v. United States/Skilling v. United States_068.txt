Opinion of SCALIA, J.

and it seems to me clearly beyond judicial power. This is
not, as the Court claims, ante, at 41, simply a matter of
adopting a “limiting construction” in the face of potential
unconstitutionality. To do that, our cases have been care­
ful to note, the narrowing construction must be “fairly
possible,” Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 331 (1988), “rea­
sonable,” Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895),
or not “plainly contrary to the intent of Congress,” Edward
J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &
Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). As we
have seen (and the Court does not contest), no court before
McNally concluded that the “deprivation of honest ser­
vices” meant only the acceptance of bribes or kickbacks. If
it were a “fairly possible” or “reasonable” construction, not
“contrary to the intent of Congress,” one would think that
some court would have adopted it. The Court does not
even point to a post-McNally case that reads §1346 to
cover only bribery and kickbacks, and I am aware of none.
The canon of constitutional avoidance, on which the
Court so heavily relies, see ante, at 41–42, states that
“when the constitutionality of a statute is assailed, if the

vice Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973). That case in­
volved a provision of the Hatch Act incorporating prior adjudications of
the Civil Service Commission. We upheld the provision against a
vagueness challenge—not, however, by “paring down” the adjudications
to a more narrow rule that we invented, but by concluding that what
they held was not vague. See id., at 571–574. The string of cases the
Court lists, see ante, at 41, n. 40, (almost none of which addressed
claims of vagueness), have nothing to do with “paring down.” The one
that comes closest, United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U. S.
363 (1971), specified a time limit within which proceedings authorized
by statute for the forfeiture of obscene imported materials had to be
commenced and completed. That is not much different from “reading
in” a reasonable-time requirement for obligations undertaken in con­
tracts, and can hardly be described as a rewriting or “paring down” of
the statute. The Court relied on legislative history anticipating that
the proceedings would be prompt, id., at 370–371, and noted that
(unlike here) it was not “decid[ing] issues of policy,” id., at 372.
