SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

In November 2005, the District Court mailed the ques­
tionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses
from nearly all the addressees. The court granted hard­
ship exemptions to approximately 90 individuals, id., at
11773–11774, and the parties, with the court’s approval,
further winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for
cause, hardship, or physical disability, id., at 11891,
13594. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, “each
and every” prospective juror who said that a preexisting
opinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her
from impartially considering the evidence at trial. Id., at
13668.
On December 28, 2005, three weeks before the date
scheduled for the commencement of trial, Causey pleaded
guilty. Skilling’s attorneys immediately requested a con­
tinuance, and the District Court agreed to delay the pro­
ceedings until the end of January 2006. Id., at 14277. In
the interim, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion,
arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive
bias and that news accounts of Causey’s guilty plea fur­
ther tainted the jury pool. If Houston remained the trial
venue, Skilling urged that “jurors need to be questioned
individually by both the Court and counsel” concerning
their opinions of Enron and “publicity issues.” Id., at
12074.
The District Court again declined to move the trial.
Skilling, the court concluded, still had not “establish[ed]
that pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise[d]
a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.” Id., at 14115.
The questionnaires and voir dire, the court observed,
provided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.
