SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

way of excusing the attorney, that he would be subject
to disbarment should he refuse to represent Irvin. On
the day before the trial the newspapers carried the
story that Irvin had orally admitted [to] the murder of
[one victim] as well as ‘the robbery-murder of [a sec­
ond individual]; the murder of [a third individual],
and the slaughter of three members of [a different
family].’ ” Id., at 725–726.
“[N]ewspapers in which the[se] stories appeared were
delivered regularly to 95% of the dwellings in” the county
where the trial occurred, which had a population of only
30,000; “radio and TV stations, which likewise blanketed
that county, also carried extensive newscasts covering the
same incidents.” Id., at 725.
Reviewing Irvin’s fair-trial claim, this Court noted that
“the pattern of deep and bitter prejudice” in the commu­
nity “was clearly reflected in the sum total of the voir
dire”: “370 prospective jurors or almost 90% of those exam­
ined on the point . . . entertained some opinion as to guilt,”
and “[8] out of the 12 [jurors] thought [Irvin] was guilty.”
Id., at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although
these jurors declared they could be impartial, we held
that, “[w]ith his life at stake, it is not requiring too much
that [Irvin] be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so
huge a wave of public passion and by a jury other than one
in which two-thirds of the members admit, before hearing
any testimony, to possessing a belief in his guilt.” Id., at
728.
In this case, as noted, supra, at 17, news stories about
Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor­
mation rife in reports about Irvin’s rampage of robberies
and murders. Of key importance, Houston shares little in
common with the rural community in which Irvin’s trial
proceeded, and circulation figures for Houston media
sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level
