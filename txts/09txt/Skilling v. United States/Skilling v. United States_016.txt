Opinion of the Court

Id., at 14115–14116.
Denying Skilling’s request for attorney-led voir dire, the
court said that in 17 years on the bench:
“I’ve found . . . I get more forthcoming responses from
potential jurors than the lawyers on either side. I
don’t know whether people are suspicious of lawyers—
but I think if I ask a person a question, I will get a
candid response much easier than if a lawyer asks the
question.” Id., at 11805.
But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to
ask follow-up questions, ibid., and it agreed that venire
members should be examined individually about pretrial
publicity, id., at 11051–11053. The court also allotted the
defendants jointly 14 peremptory challenges, 2 more than
the standard number prescribed by Federal Rule of Crimi­
nal Procedure 24(b)(2) and (c)(4)(B). Id., at 13673–13675.
Voir dire began on January 30, 2006. The District Court
first emphasized to the venire the importance of impartial­
ity and explained the presumption of innocence and the
Government’s burden of proof. The trial, the court next
instructed, was not a forum “to seek vengeance against
Enron’s former officers,” or to “provide remedies for” its
victims. App. 823a. “The bottom line,” the court stressed,
“is that we want . . . jurors who . . . will faithfully, consci­
entiously and impartially serve if selected.” Id., at 823a–
824a. In response to the court’s query whether any pro­
spective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these
instructions, two individuals indicated that they could not
be fair; they were therefore excused for cause, id., at 816a,
819a–820a.
After questioning the venire as a group,5 the District
Court brought prospective jurors one by one to the bench
——————
5 Among other questions, the court asked whether sympathy toward
the victims of Enron’s collapse or a desire to see justice done would
overpower prospective jurors’ impartiality. App. 839a–840a.
