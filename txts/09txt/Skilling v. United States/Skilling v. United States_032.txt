Opinion of the Court

assessing the quality of voir dire as a whole.”).22 In other
Enron-related prosecutions, we note, District Courts, after
inspecting venire members’ responses to questionnaires,
completed the jury-selection process within one day. See
supra, at 8, n. 6.23
The District Court conducted voir dire, moreover, aware
of the greater-than-normal need, due to pretrial publicity,
to ensure against jury bias. At Skilling’s urging, the court
examined each prospective juror individually, thus pre­
venting the spread of any prejudicial information to other
venire members. See Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 425. To en­
courage candor, the court repeatedly admonished that
there were “no right and wrong answers to th[e] ques­
tions.” E.g., App. 843a. The court denied Skilling’s re­
quest for attorney-led voir dire because, in its experience,
potential jurors were “more forthcoming” when the court,
rather than counsel, asked the question. Record 11805.
The parties, however, were accorded an opportunity to ask
follow-up questions of every prospective juror brought to

22 The dissent’s analysis undervalues the 77-item questionnaire, a
part of the selection process difficult to portray as “cursory,” post, at 30,
or “anemic,” post, at 35. Notably, the “open-ended questions about
[prospective jurors’] impressions of Enron or Skilling” that the dissent
contends should have been asked, post, at 30, were asked—on the
questionnaire, see supra, at 5–6, n. 4. Moreover, the District Court
gave Skilling’s counsel relatively free rein to ask venire members about
their responses on the questionnaire. See, e.g., App. 869a–870a; id., at
878a, 911a, 953a. The questionnaire plus follow-up opportunity to
interrogate potential jurors surely gave Skilling’s counsel “clear ave­
nue[s] for . . . permissible inquiry.” But see post, at 31, n. 17. See also
App. 967a (counsel for Skilling) (“Judge, for the record, if I don’t ask
any questions, it’s because the Court and other counsel have covered
it.”).
23 One of the earlier prosecutions targeted the “Big Five” public ac­
counting firm Arthur Andersen. See supra, at 8, n. 6. Among media
readers and auditors, the name and reputation of Arthur Andersen
likely sparked no less attention than the name and reputation of
Jeffrey Skilling. Cf. supra, at 16–17, n. 15.
