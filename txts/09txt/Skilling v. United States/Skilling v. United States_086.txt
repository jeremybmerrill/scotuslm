Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

some instances, this Court has observed, the hostility of
the community becomes so severe as to give rise to a “pre­
sumption of [juror] prejudice.” Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S.
1025, 1031 (1984).
The Court of Appeals incorporated the concept of pre­
sumptive prejudice into a burden-shifting framework:
Once the defendant musters sufficient evidence of com­
munity hostility, the onus shifts to the Government to
prove the impartiality of the jury. The majority similarly
envisions a fixed point at which public passions become so
intense that prejudice to a defendant’s fair-trial rights
must be presumed. The majority declines, however, to
decide whether the presumption is rebuttable, as the
Court of Appeals held.
This Court has never treated the notion of presumptive
prejudice so formalistically. Our decisions instead merely
convey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of
public enmity rises, so too does the danger that the preju­

and argument in open court, and not by any outside influ­

Colorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., 205 U. S. 454,
462 (1907).
The inquiry is necessarily case specific. In selecting a
jury, a trial court must take measures adapted to the
intensity, pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial
publicity and community animus.
Reviewing courts,
meanwhile, must assess whether the trial court’s proce­
dures sufficed under the circumstances to keep the jury
free from disqualifying bias. Cf. Murphy v. Florida, 421
U. S. 794, 799 (1975) (scrutinizing the record for “any
indications in the totality of circumstances that peti­
tioner’s trial was not fundamentally fair”). This Court’s
precedents illustrate the sort of steps required in different
