SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

the bench for colloquy. Skilling’s counsel declined to ask
anything of more than half of the venire members ques­
tioned individually, including eight eventually selected for
the jury, because, he explained, “the Court and other
counsel have covered” everything he wanted to know.
App. 967a.
Inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the
individuals who actually served as jurors satisfies us that,
notwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection
process successfully secured jurors who were largely un­
touched by Enron’s collapse.24 Eleven of the seated jurors
and alternates reported no connection at all to Enron,
while all other jurors reported at most an insubstantial
link. See, e.g., Supp. App. 101sa (Juror 63) (“I once met a
guy who worked for Enron. I cannot remember his
name.”).25 As for pretrial publicity, 14 jurors and alter­
nates specifically stated that they had paid scant attention
to Enron-related news. See, e.g., App. 859a–860a (Juror

24 In considering whether Skilling was tried before an impartial jury,
the dissent relies extensively on venire members not selected for that
jury. See, e.g., post, at 6, n. 4 (quoting the questionnaires of ten venire
members; all were excused for cause before voir dire commenced, see
Record 11891); post, at 7, n. 6 (quoting the questionnaires of 15 venire
members; none sat on Skilling’s jury); post, at 10–11, n. 7 (quoting voir
dire testimony of six venire members; none sat on Skilling’s jury); post,
at 28–34 (reporting at length voir dire testimony of Venire Members 17,
29, 61, 74, 75, and 101; none sat on Skilling’s jury). Statements by
nonjurors do not themselves call into question the adequacy of the jury­
selection process; elimination of these venire members is indeed one
indicator that the process fulfilled its function. Critically, as discussed
infra, at 24–26, the seated jurors showed little knowledge of or interest
in, and were personally unaffected by, Enron’s downfall.
25 See also Supp. App. 11sa (Juror 10) (“knew some casual co-workers
that owned Enron stock”); id., at 26sa (Juror 11) (“work[s] with some­
one who worked at Enron”); id., at 117sa; App. 940a (Juror 64) (two
acquaintances lost money due to Enron’s collapse); Supp. App. 236sa
(Juror 116) (work colleague lost money as a result of Enron’s
bankruptcy).
