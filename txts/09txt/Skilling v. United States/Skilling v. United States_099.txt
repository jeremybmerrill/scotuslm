SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

coverage reinforced this view. See supra, at 7–8. The trial
of Skilling and Lay was the culmination of all that had
come before. See Record 40002 (noting that “prosecutors
followed the classic pattern of working their way up
through the ranks”). As the Chronicle put it in July 2005,
shortly after the trial of several Enron Broadband Services
executives ended without convictions, “The real trial, the
true measure of justice in the Enron saga, begins in Janu­
ary. Let the small fry swim free if need be. We’ve got
bigger fish in need of frying.” App. 1460a (paragraph
breaks omitted); see also ibid. (“From the beginning, the
Enron prosecution has had one true measure of success:
Lay and Skilling in a cold steel cage”).
Any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the Houston
community remained overwhelmingly negative was dis­
pelled by prospective jurors’ responses to the written
questionnaires. As previously indicated, supra, at 5–7,
more than one-third of the prospective jurors either knew
victims of Enron’s collapse or were victims themselves,
and two-thirds gave responses suggesting an antidefen­
dant bias. In many instances their contempt for Skilling
was palpable. See nn. 4, 6, supra. Only a small fraction of
the prospective jurors raised no red flags in their re­
sponses. And this was before Causey’s guilty plea and the
flurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of
trial. One of Skilling’s experts, a political scientist who
had studied pretrial publicity “for over 35 years” and
consulted in more than 200 high-profile cases (in which he
had recommended against venue changes more often than
not), “c[a]me to the conclusion that the extent and depth of
bias shown in these questionnaires is the highest or at
least one of the very highest I have ever encountered.”
