Opinion of the Court

States 42, and n. 4 (citing dozens of examples).41 Indeed,
the McNally case itself, which spurred Congress to enact
§1346, presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern.
483 U. S., at 352–353, 360. Congress’ reversal of McNally
and reinstatement of the honest-services doctrine, we
conclude, can and should be salvaged by confining its
scope to the core pre-McNally applications.
As already noted, supra, at 34–36, the honest-services
doctrine had its genesis in prosecutions involving bribery
allegations. See Shushan, 117 F. 2d, at 115 (public sec­
tor); Procter & Gamble Co., 47 F. Supp., at 678 (private
sector). See also United States v. Orsburn, 525 F. 3d 543,
546 (CA7 2008). Both before McNally and after §1346’s
enactment, Courts of Appeals described schemes involving
bribes or kickbacks as “core . . . honest services fraud
precedents,” United States v. Czubinski, 106 F. 3d 1069,
1077 (CA1 1997); “paradigm case[s],” United States v.
deVegter, 198 F. 3d 1324, 1327–1328 (CA11 1999); “[t]he
most obvious form of honest services fraud,” United States
v. Carbo, 572 F. 3d 112, 115 (CA3 2009); “core misconduct
covered by the statute,” United States v. Urciuoli, 513
F. 3d 290, 294 (CA1 2008); “most [of the] honest services
cases,” United States v. Sorich, 523 F. 3d 702, 707 (CA7
2008); “typical,” United States v. Brown, 540 F. 2d 364,

41 JUSTICE

SCALIA emphasizes divisions in the Courts of Appeals re­
garding the source and scope of fiduciary duties. Post, at 3–5. But
these debates were rare in bribe and kickback cases. The existence of a
fiduciary relationship, under any definition of that term, was usually
beyond dispute; examples include public official-public, see, e.g., United
States v. Mandel, 591 F. 2d 1347 (CA4 1979); employee-employer, see,
e.g., United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167 (CA9 1980); and union
official-union members, see, e.g., United States v. Price, 788 F. 2d 234
(CA4 1986). See generally Chiarella v. United States, 445 U. S. 222,
233 (1980) (noting the “established doctrine that [a fiduciary] duty
arises from a specific relationship between two parties”).
