“honest services.” Most often these cases involved bribery of public
officials, but over time, the courts increasingly recognized that the
doctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to
his employer, often by accepting bribes or kickbacks. By 1982, all
Courts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud.
Pp. 34–37.
(2) In 1987, this Court halted the development of the intangi
ble-rights doctrine in McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360,
which held that the mail-fraud statute was “limited in scope to the
protection of property rights.” “If Congress desires to go further,” the
Court stated, “it must speak more clearly.” Ibid. P. 37.
(3) Congress responded the next year by enacting §1346, which
provides: “For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the U. S. Code that
prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, §1341, and wire fraud, §1343], the
term ‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ includes a scheme or artifice to
deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” Pp 37–38.
(b) Section 1346, properly confined to core cases, is not unconsti
tutionally vague. Pp. 38–51.
(1) To satisfy due process, “a penal statute [must] define the
criminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people
can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that
does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357. The void-for-vagueness doc
trine embraces these requirements. Skilling contends that §1346
meets neither of the two due-process essentials. But this Court must,
if possible, construe, not condemn, Congress’ enactments. See, e.g.,
Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571. Alert to
§1346’s potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how
best to interpret the statute. Uniformly, however, they have declined
to throw out the statute as irremediably vague. This Court agrees
that §1346 should be construed rather than invalidated. P. 38–39.
(2) The Court looks to the doctrine developed in pre-McNally
cases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase “the in
tangible right of honest services.” There is no doubt that Congress
intended §1346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doc
trine recognized in Courts of Appeals’ decisions before McNally de
railed the intangible-rights theory of fraud. Congress, it bears em
phasis, enacted §1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the
statute using that decision’s terminology. See 483 U. S., at 355, 362.
Pp. 39–40.
(3) To preserve what Congress certainly intended §1346 to
cover, the Court pares the pre-McNally body of precedent down to its
core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes
to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks
