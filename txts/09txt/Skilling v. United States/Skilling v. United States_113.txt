SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

charged, the apparent guilt of the offender[,] or the station
in life which he occupies,” our system of justice demands
trials that are fair in both appearance and fact. Irvin, 366
U. S., at 722. Because I do not believe Skilling’s trial met
this standard, I would grant him relief.
