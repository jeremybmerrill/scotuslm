Opinion of the Court

3
The Government urges us to go further by locating
within §1346’s compass another category of proscribed
conduct: “undisclosed self-dealing by a public official or
private employee—i.e., the taking of official action by the
employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial
interests while purporting to act in the interests of those
to whom he owes a fiduciary duty.” Id., at 43–44. “[T]he
theory of liability in McNally itself was nondisclosure of a
conflicting financial interest,” the Government observes,
and “Congress clearly intended to revive th[at] nondisclo­
sure theory.” Id., at 44. Moreover, “[a]lthough not as
numerous as the bribery and kickback cases,” the Gov­
ernment asserts, “the pre-McNally cases involving undis­
closed self-dealing were abundant.” Ibid.
Neither of these contentions withstands close inspec­
tion. McNally, as we have already observed, supra, at 36–
37, 43, involved a classic kickback scheme: A public offi­
cial, in exchange for routing Kentucky’s insurance busi­
ness through a middleman company, arranged for that
company to share its commissions with entities in which
the official held an interest. 483 U. S., at 352–353, 360.
This was no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest;
rather, the official conspired with a third party so that
both would profit from wealth generated by public con­
tracts. See id., at 352–353. Reading §1346 to proscribe
bribes and kickbacks—and nothing more—satisfies Con­
——————
lion’s share of honest-services cases, limiting §1346 to these heartland
applications is surely “fairly possible.” Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,
331 (1988); cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380 (2005) (opinion of
the Court by SCALIA, J.) (when adopting a limiting construction, “[t]he
lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern”). So construed,
the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. See infra, at 47–48; post, at
8. Only by taking a wrecking ball to a statute that can be salvaged
through a reasonable narrowing interpretation would we act out of step
with precedent.
