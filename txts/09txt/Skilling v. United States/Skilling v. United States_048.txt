Opinion of the Court

bly vague.37
We agree that §1346 should be construed rather than
invalidated. First, we look to the doctrine developed in
pre-McNally cases in an endeavor to ascertain the mean­
ing of the phrase “the intangible right of honest services.”
Second, to preserve what Congress certainly intended the
statute to cover, we pare that body of precedent down to
its core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved
fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services
through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who
had not been deceived. Confined to these paramount
applications, §1346 presents no vagueness problem.

There is no doubt that Congress intended §1346 to refer
to and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recognized
in Court of Appeals’ decisions before McNally derailed the
intangible-rights theory of fraud. See Brief for Petitioner
39; Brief for United States 37–38; post, at 2, 8 (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Congress
enacted §1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the
statute using that decision’s terminology. See 483 U. S.,
at 355 (“intangible righ[t]”); id., at 362 (STEVENS, J., dis­
senting) (“right to . . . honest services”).38 As the Second

(en banc); United States v. Hausmann, 345 F. 3d 952, 958 (CA7 2003);
United States v. Welch, 327 F. 3d 1081, 1109, n. 29 (CA10 2003); United
States v. Frega, 179 F. 3d 793, 803 (CA9 1999); Brumley, 116 F. 3d, at
732–733; United States v. Frost, 125 F. 3d 346, 370–372 (CA6 1997);
United States v. Waymer, 55 F. 3d 564, 568–569 (CA11 1995); United
States v. Bryan, 58 F. 3d 933, 941 (CA4 1995).
38 Although verbal formulations varied slightly, the words employed
by the Courts of Appeals prior to McNally described the same concept:
“honest services,” e.g., United States v. Bruno, 809 F. 2d 1097, 1105
(CA5 1987); “honest and faithful services,” e.g., United States v. Brown,
540 F. 2d 364, 374 (CA8 1976); and “faithful and honest services,” e.g.,
United States v. Diggs, 613 F. 2d 988, 998 (CADC 1979).
