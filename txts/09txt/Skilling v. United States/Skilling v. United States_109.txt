SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

Juror 11 wrote that he “work[ed] with someone who
worked at Enron”; that he got Enron-related news from
the “Houston Chronicle, Channel 2 News, Channel 13
News, O’Reilly Factor, [and] talking with friends and co­
workers”; that he regularly visited the Chronicle Web site;
that “greed on Enron’s part” caused the company’s col­
lapse; and that “a lot of people were hurt financially.”
Supp. App. 26sa–30sa. During questioning, he stated that
he would have “no problem” requiring the Government to
prove its case, but he also told the court that he believed
Lay was “greedy” and that corporate executives are often
“stretching the legal limits . . . . I’m not going to say that
they’re all crooks, but, you know.” App. 857a, 854a.
Asked whether he would “star[t] the case with sort of an
inkling that because [Lay is] greedy he must have done
something illegal,” he offered an indeterminate “not neces­
sarily.” Id., at 857.23
——————
23 Many other seated jurors and alternates expressed similarly trou­
bling sentiments. See, e.g., Supp. App. 57sa–60sa (Juror 20) (obtained
Enron-related news from the Chronicle and “local news stations”;
blamed Enron’s collapse on “[n]ot enough corporate controls or effective
audit procedures to prevent mismanagement of corporate assets”; and
was “angry that so many people lost their jobs and their retirement
savings”); id., at 72sa–75sa (Juror 38) (followed Enron-related news
from various sources, including the Chronicle; was “angry about what
happened”; and “fe[lt] bad for those that worked hard and invested in
the corp[oration] only to have it all taken away”); id., at 117sa–118sa
(Juror 64) (had several friends who worked at Enron and lost money;
heard about the Enron cases on the news; described the collapse as
“sad” because “people lost jobs [and] money—lots of money”; and
believed the Government “did the right thing” in its investigation); id.,
at 177sa–181sa (Juror 87) (received Enron-related news from the
Chronicle, Channel 13 news, the O’Reilly Factor, Internet news sources,
and friends, family, and co-workers; attributed Enron’s collapse to
“[p]oor management [and] bad judgment—greed”; lamented “[t]he sad
state of the long-term loyal employees who are left with nothing in their
retirement accounts”; and “admire[d] [the] bravery” of Enron whistle­
blower Sherron Watkins “for bringing the situation to the attention of
the public, which stopped things from getting worse”); id., at 191sa–
