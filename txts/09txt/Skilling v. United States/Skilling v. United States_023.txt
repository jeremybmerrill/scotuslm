SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

script of the voir dire,” that “[t]he kangaroo court proceed­
ings” trailing the televised confession violated due process.
Id., at 726–727.
We followed Rideau’s lead in two later cases in which
media coverage manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution.
In Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 538 (1965), extensive
publicity before trial swelled into excessive exposure
during preliminary court proceedings as reporters and
television crews overran the courtroom and “bombard[ed]
. . . the community with the sights and sounds of” the
pretrial hearing. The media’s overzealous reporting ef­
forts, we observed, “led to considerable disruption” and
denied the “judicial serenity and calm to which [Billie Sol
Estes] was entitled.” Id., at 536.
Similarly, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),
news reporters extensively covered the story of Sam
Sheppard, who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant
wife to death. “[B]edlam reigned at the courthouse during
the trial and newsmen took over practically the entire
courtroom,” thrusting jurors “into the role of celebrities.”
Id., at 353, 355. Pretrial media coverage, which we char­
acterized as “months [of] virulent publicity about
Sheppard and the murder,” did not alone deny due proc­
ess, we noted. Id., at 354. But Sheppard’s case involved
more than heated reporting pretrial: We upset the murder
conviction because a “carnival atmosphere” pervaded the
trial, id., at 358.
In each of these cases, we overturned a “conviction
obtained in a trial atmosphere that [was] utterly corrupted
by press coverage”; our decisions, however, “cannot be
made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to
. . . news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively
deprives the defendant of due process.” Murphy v. Flor
ida, 421 U. S. 794, 798–799 (1975).12 See also, e.g., Patton
