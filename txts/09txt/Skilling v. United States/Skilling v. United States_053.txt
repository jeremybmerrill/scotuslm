SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

cover[ed],” United States v. Paradies, 98 F. 3d 1266, 1283,
n. 30 (CA11 1996). See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (counsel
for the Government) (“[T]he bulk of pre-McNally honest
services cases” entailed bribes or kickbacks); Brief for
Petitioner 49 (“Bribes and kickbacks were the paradigm
[pre-McNally] cases,” constituting “[t]he overwhelming
majority of prosecutions for honest services fraud.”).
In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress
intended §1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks.
Reading the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive
conduct, we acknowledge, would raise the due process
concerns underlying the vagueness doctrine.42 To preserve
the statute without transgressing constitutional limita­
tions, we now hold that §1346 criminalizes only the bribe­
and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.43
——————
42 Apprised

that a broader reading of §1346 could render the statute
impermissibly vague, Congress, we believe, would have drawn the
honest-services line, as we do now, at bribery and kickback schemes.
Cf. Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,
at 11) (“[C]ourts may attempt . . . to implement what the legislature
would have willed had it been apprised of the constitutional infir­
mity.”); United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 246 (2005) (“We seek to
determine what ‘Congress would have intended’ in light of the Court’s
constitutional holding.”).
43 JUSTICE SCALIA charges that our construction of §1346 is “not inter­
pretation but invention.” Post, at 8. Stating that he “know[s] of no
precedent for . . . ‘paring down’ ” the pre-McNally case law to its core,
ibid., he contends that the Court today “wield[s] a power we long ago
abjured: the power to define new federal crimes,” post, at 1. See also,
e.g., post, at 9, 10, 11. As noted supra, at 41–42, and n. 40, cases
“paring down” federal statutes to avoid constitutional shoals are legion.
These cases recognize that the Court does not legislate, but instead
respects the legislature, by preserving a statute through a limiting
interpretation. See United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 267–268,
n. 6 (1997) (This Court does not “create a common law crime” by adopt­
ing a “narrow[ing] constru[ction].” (internal quotation marks omitted));

recognized bribery and kickback schemes as honest-services fraud
before McNally, 483 U. S. 350, and that these schemes composed the
