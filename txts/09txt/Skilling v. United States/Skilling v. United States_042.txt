Opinion of the Court

fair and impartial); Supp. App. 131sa–133sa, 136sa (Juror
67) (had no connection to Enron and no anger about its
collapse); App. 969a (Juror 78) (did not “know much about”
Enron); Supp. App. 165sa, App. 971a (Juror 84) (had not
heard or read anything about Enron and said she did not
“know enough to answer” the question whether she was
angry about the company’s demise). Skilling’s counsel
declined to ask follow-up questions of any of these jurors
and, indeed, told Juror 84 he had nothing to ask because
she “gave all the right answers.” Id., at 972a. Whatever
Skilling’s reasons for wanting to strike these four indi­
viduals from his jury, he cannot credibly assert they dis­
played a disqualifying bias.33
In sum, Skilling failed to establish that a presumption
of prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that
tried him. Jurors, the trial court correctly comprehended,
need not enter the box with empty heads in order to de­
termine the facts impartially. “It is sufficient if the ju­
ror[s] can lay aside [their] impression[s] or opinion[s] and
render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.”
Irvin, 366 U. S., at 723. Taking account of the full record,
rather than incomplete exchanges selectively culled from
it, we find no cause to upset the lower courts’ judgment
that Skilling’s jury met that measure. We therefore affirm
the Fifth Circuit’s ruling that Skilling received a fair
trial.34

33 Although

Skilling raised no objection to Juror 10 and Juror 87 at
trial, his briefs in this Court impugn their impartiality. Brief for
Petitioner 14–15; Reply Brief 13. Even if we allowed these tardy pleas,
the voir dire testimony of the two jurors gives sufficient assurance that
they were unbiased. See, e.g., App. 850a–853a (Juror 10) (did not
prejudge Skilling’s guilt, indicated he could follow the court’s instruc­
tions and make the Government prove its case, stated he could be fair
to Skilling, and said he would “judge on the facts”); id., at 974a (Juror
87) (had “not formed an opinion” on whether Skilling was guilty and
affirmed she could adhere to the presumption of innocence).
