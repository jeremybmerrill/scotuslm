SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

of [a statute are] imprecise, any such uncertainty has little
relevance . . . where appellants’ conduct falls squarely
within the ‘hard core’ of the statute’s proscriptions.”).
Today’s decision clarifies that no other misconduct falls
within §1346’s province. See United States v. Lanier, 520
U. S. 259, 266 (1997) (“[C]larity at the requisite level may
be supplied by judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain
statute.”).
As to arbitrary prosecutions, we perceive no significant
risk that the honest-services statute, as we interpret it
today, will be stretched out of shape. Its prohibition on
bribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the preMcNally case law, but also from federal statutes proscrib­
ing—and defining—similar crimes. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.
§§201(b), 666(a)(2); 41 U. S. C. §52(2) (“The term ‘kick­
back’ means any money, fee, commission, credit, gift,
gratuity, thing of value, or compensation of any kind
which is provided, directly or indirectly, to [enumerated
persons] for the purpose of improperly obtaining or re­
warding favorable treatment in connection with [enumer­
ated circumstances].”).45 See also, e.g., United States v.
Ganim, 510 F. 3d 134, 147–149 (CA2 2007) (Sotomayor, J.)
(reviewing honest-services conviction involving bribery in
light of elements of bribery under other federal statutes);
United States v. Whitfield, 590 F. 3d 325, 352–353 (CA5
2009); United States v. Kemp, 500 F. 3d 257, 281–286
(CA3 2007). A criminal defendant who participated in
a bribery or kickback scheme, in short, cannot tenably
complain about prosecution under §1346 on vagueness
grounds.

45 Overlap with other federal statutes does not render §1346 superflu­
ous. The principal federal bribery statute, §201, for example, generally
applies only to federal public officials, so §1346’s application to state
and local corruption and to private-sector fraud reaches misconduct
that might otherwise go unpunished.
