SKILLING v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

fraud.”) with Reply Brief 30 (The Government “cannot
show that the conspiracy conviction rested only on the
securities-fraud theory, rather than the distinct, legally­
flawed honest-services theory.”). We leave this dispute for
resolution on remand.46
Whether potential reversal on the conspiracy count
touches any of Skilling’s other convictions is also an open
question. All of his convictions, Skilling contends, hinged
on the conspiracy count and, like dominoes, must fall if it
falls. The District Court, deciding Skilling’s motion for
bail pending appeal, found this argument dubious, App.
1141a–1142a, but the Fifth Circuit had no occasion to rule
on it. That court may do so on remand.

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Fifth Circuit’s
ruling on Skilling’s fair-trial argument, vacate its ruling
on his conspiracy conviction, and remand the case for
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

46 The Fifth Circuit appeared to prejudge this issue, noting that, “if
any of the three objects of Skilling’s conspiracy offers a legally insuffi­
cient theory,” it “must set aside his conviction.” 554 F. 3d, at 543. That
reasoning relied on the mistaken premise that Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555
U. S. ___ (2008) (per curiam), governs only cases on collateral review.
See 554 F. 3d, at 543, n. 10. Harmless-error analysis, we clarify,
applies equally to cases on direct appeal. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit,
on remand, should take a fresh look at the parties’ harmless-error
arguments.
