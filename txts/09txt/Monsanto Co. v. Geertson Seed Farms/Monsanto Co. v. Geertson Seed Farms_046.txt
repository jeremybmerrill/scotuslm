MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
STEVENS, J., dissenting

complete study, presented in an EIS, showed that
the known problem of gene flow could, in reality, be
prevented.14
The District Court’s decision that more study was
needed to assess whether limits on deregulation could
prevent environmental damage is further reinforced by
the statutory context in which the issue arose. A court’s
equitable discretion must be guided by “recognized, de
fined public policy.” Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320 U. S.
228, 235 (1943); see also Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S.
321, 331 (1944) (explaining that when a court evaluates an
agency’s decision against the background of a federal
statute, the court’s discretion “must be exercised in light of
the large objectives of the Act”). Congress recognized in
NEPA that complex environmental cases often require
exceptionally sophisticated scientific determinations, and
that agency decisions should not be made on the basis of
“incomplete information.” Marsh v. Oregon Natural Re
sources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 371 (1989). Congress also
recognized that agencies cannot fully weigh the conse
quences of these decisions without obtaining public com
ments through an EIS. See Robertson v. Methow Valley
Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 350 (1989).15 While a
court may not presume that a NEPA violation requires an
injunction, it may take into account the principles embod

14 I suspect that if APHIS and petitioners had come back to the court
with more convincing evidence prior to completing an EIS, and moved
to modify the court’s order, the court would have done so. Indeed, the
District Court showed a willingness to recalibrate its order when it
amended its judgment just a few months after the judgment’s issuance
in light of APHIS’s submission that certain requirements were imprac
tical. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a–114a.
15 Accordingly, while “NEPA itself does not mandate particular re
sults,” it does mandate a particular process and embodies the principle
that federal agencies should “carefully conside[r] detailed information”
before incurring potential environmental harm. Robertson, 490 U. S.,
at 350, 349.
