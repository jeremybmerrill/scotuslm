Opinion of the Court

in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest
would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.” eBay
Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391 (2006).
The traditional four-factor test applies when a plaintiff
seeks a permanent injunction to remedy a NEPA violation.
See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555
U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 21–23).
Petitioners argue that the lower courts in this case
proceeded on the erroneous assumption that an injunction
is generally the appropriate remedy for a NEPA violation.
In particular, petitioners note that the District Court cited
pre-Winter Ninth Circuit precedent for the proposition
that, in “ ‘the run of the mill NEPA case,’ ” an injunction
delaying the contemplated government project is proper
“ ‘until the NEPA violation is cured.’ ” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 65a (quoting Idaho Watersheds Project v. Hahn, 307
F. 3d 815, 833 (CA9 2002)); see also App. to Pet. for Cert.
55a (quoting same language in preliminary injunction
order). In addition, petitioners observe, the District Court
and the Court of Appeals in this case both stated that, “in
unusual circumstances, an injunction may be withheld, or,
more likely, limited in scope” in NEPA cases. Id., at 66a
(quoting National Parks & Conservation Assn. v. Babbitt,
241 F. 3d 722, 737, n. 18 (CA9 2001) (internal quotation
marks omitted)); 570 F. 3d, at 1137.
Insofar as the statements quoted above are intended to
guide the determination whether to grant injunctive relief,
they invert the proper mode of analysis. An injunction
should issue only if the traditional four-factor test is satis­
fied. See Winter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21–24). In
contrast, the statements quoted above appear to presume
that an injunction is the proper remedy for a NEPA viola­
tion except in unusual circumstances. No such thumb on
the scales is warranted. Nor, contrary to the reasoning of
the Court of Appeals, could any such error be cured by a
court’s perfunctory recognition that “an injunction does
