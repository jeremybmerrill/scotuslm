STEVENS, J., dissenting

with a proposed partial deregulation order which, the
court explained, was incompatible with its determination
that there is a substantial risk of gene spreading and that
APHIS lacks monitoring capacity. That same concern
would apply to any partial deregulation order. The court
therefore had good reason to make it clear, upfront, that
the parties should not continue to expend resources pro
posing such orders, instead of just moving ahead with an
EIS. Cf. Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312
U. S. 496, 500 (1941) (“The resources of equity are equal to
an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative
decision”). Indeed, it was APHIS itself that “sought to
‘streamline’ ” the process. Ante, at 18.

Second, the District Court’s judgment can be understood
as a reasonable response to the nature of the risks posed
by RRA. Separate and apart from NEPA’s requirement of
an EIS, these risks were sufficiently serious, in my view,
that the court’s injunction was a permissible exercise of its
equitable authority.
The District Court found that gene transfer can and
does occur, and that if it were to spread through open land
the environmental and economic consequences would be
devastating. Cf. Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480
U. S. 531, 545 (1987) (“Environmental injury, by its na
ture, can seldom be adequately remedied by money dam
ages and is often permanent or at least of long duration,
i.e., irreparable”). Although “a mere possibility of a future
nuisance will not support an injunction,” courts have
never required proof “that the nuisance will occur”; rather,
“it is sufficient . . . that the risk of its happening is greater
than a reasonable man would incur.” 5 J. Pomeroy, A
Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence and Equitable Reme
dies, §1937 (§523), p. 4398 (2d ed. 1919). Once gene trans
fer occurred in American fields, it “would be difficult—if
