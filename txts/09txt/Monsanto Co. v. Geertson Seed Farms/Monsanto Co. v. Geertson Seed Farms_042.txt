MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
STEVENS, J., dissenting

from analysis to rationalization.” Herrmann, Injunctions
for NEPA Violations: Balancing the Equities, 59 U. Chi.
L. Rev. 1263, 1289 (1992); see also see 40 CFR §1502.5
(EIS should be implemented in manner assuring it “will
not be used to rationalize or justify decisions already
made”).
Although the majority does not dispute that the District
Court could have reasonably concluded that NEPA re
quires an EIS for even partial deregulation of RRA, it
suggests that any such conclusion would have been in
compatible with the court’s decision to permit limited
harvesting by farmers who had already planted RRA. See
ante, at 20.10 I do not see the “inconsisten[cy].” Ibid.
NEPA does not apply to actions by federal courts. See 40
CFR §1508.12. Exercising its equitable discretion to
balance the interests of the parties and the public, the
District Court would have been well within its rights to
find that NEPA requires an EIS before the agency grants
“Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even in part,” App. to
Pet. for Cert. 108a, yet also to find that a partial stay of
the vacatur was appropriate to protect the interests of
those farmers who had already acted in good-faith reliance
on APHIS.
Similarly, I do not agree that the District Court’s ruling
was “premature” because APHIS had not yet effected any
partial deregulations, ante, at 19. Although it is “for the
agency to decide whether and to what extent” it will pur
sue deregulation, ante, at 17, the court’s application of
NEPA to APHIS’s regulation of RRA might have con
trolled any deregulation during the pendency of the EIS.
Petitioners and APHIS had already come back to the court
——————
10 The Court states that the order permitted both harvesting and
planting. But the court’s final judgment permitted only sale and
harvesting of RRA planted before March 30, 2007, more than a month
before the judgment. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a; see also id., at
79a.
