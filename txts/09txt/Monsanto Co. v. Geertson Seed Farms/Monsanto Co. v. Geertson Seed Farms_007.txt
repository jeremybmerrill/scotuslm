Opinion of the Court

Club, 427 U. S. 390, 410, n. 20 (1976).
An agency need not complete an EIS for a particular
proposal if it finds, on the basis of a shorter “environ­
mental assessment” (EA), that the proposed action will not
have a significant impact on the environment. 40 CFR
§§1508.9(a), 1508.13 (2009). Even if a particular agency
proposal requires an EIS, applicable regulations allow the
agency to take at least some action in furtherance of that
proposal while the EIS is being prepared. See §1506.1(a)
(“no action concerning the proposal shall be taken which
would: (1) Have an adverse environmental impact; or (2)
Limit the choice of reasonable alternatives”); §1506.1(c)
(“While work on a required program environmental impact
statement is in progress and the action is not covered by
an existing program statement, agencies shall not under­
take in the interim any major Federal action covered by
the program which may significantly affect the quality of
the human environment unless such action” satisfies
certain requirements).

This case involves Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a kind
of alfalfa crop that has been genetically engineered to be
tolerant of glyphosate, the active ingredient of the herbi­
cide Roundup. Petitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto)
owns the intellectual property rights to RRA. Monsanto
licenses those rights to co-petitioner Forage Genetics
International (FGI), which is the exclusive developer of
RRA seed.
APHIS initially classified RRA as a regulated article,
but in 2004 petitioners sought nonregulated status for two
strains of RRA. In response, APHIS prepared a draft EA
assessing the likely environmental impact of the requested
deregulation. It then published a notice in the Federal
Register advising the public of the deregulation petition
and soliciting public comments on its draft EA. After
