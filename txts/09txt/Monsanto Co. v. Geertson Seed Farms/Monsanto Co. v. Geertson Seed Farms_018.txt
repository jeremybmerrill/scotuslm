MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
Opinion of the Court

mere fact that respondents also seek to avoid certain
economic harms that are tied to the risk of gene flow does
not strip them of prudential standing.
In short, respondents have standing to seek injunctive

review of the Ninth Circuit’s judgment affirming the entry
of such relief. We therefore proceed to the merits of the

A

The District Court sought to remedy APHIS’s NEPA
violation in three ways: First, it vacated the agency’s
decision completely deregulating RRA; second, it enjoined
APHIS from deregulating RRA, in whole or in part, pend­
ing completion of the mandated EIS; and third, it entered
a nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all future
planting of RRA. Id., at 108a–110a. Because petitioners
and the Government do not argue otherwise, we assume
without deciding that the District Court acted lawfully in
vacating the deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7
(“[T]he district court could have vacated the order in its
entirety and sent it back to the agency”); accord, id., at 15–
16. We therefore address only the latter two aspects of the
District Court’s judgment. Before doing so, however, we
provide a brief overview of the standard governing the
entry of injunctive relief.

law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to com­
pensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of
hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy
