MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
Opinion of the Court

agency were to issue a partial deregulation order, any
party aggrieved by that order could bring a separate suit
under the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the
particular deregulation attempted. See 5 U. S. C. §702.
In this case, APHIS apparently sought to “streamline”
the proceedings by asking the District Court to craft a
remedy that, in effect, would have partially deregulated
RRA until such time as the agency had finalized the EIS
needed for a complete deregulation. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
16, 23–24; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a. To justify that dispo­
sition, APHIS and petitioners submitted voluminous
documentary submissions in which they purported to show
that the risk of gene flow would be insignificant if the
District Court allowed limited planting and harvesting
subject to APHIS’s proposed conditions. Respondents, in
turn, submitted considerable evidence of their own that
seemed to cut the other way. This put the District Court
in an unenviable position. “The parties’ experts disagreed
over virtually every factual issue relating to possible
environmental harm, including the likelihood of genetic
contamination and why some contamination had already
occurred.” 570 F. 3d, at 1135.
The District Court may well have acted within its dis­
cretion in refusing to craft a judicial remedy that would
have authorized the continued planting and harvesting of
RRA while the EIS is being prepared. It does not follow,
however, that the District Court was within its rights in
enjoining APHIS from allowing such planting and harvest­
ing pursuant to the authority vested in the agency by law.
When the District Court entered its permanent injunction,
APHIS had not yet exercised its authority to partially
deregulate RRA. Until APHIS actually seeks to effect a
partial deregulation, any judicial review of such a decision
is premature.5
