MONSANTO COMPANY, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

GEERTSON SEED FARMS ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 21, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case arises out of a decision by the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to deregulate a
variety of genetically engineered alfalfa. The District
Court held that APHIS violated the National Environ­
mental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, 42
U. S. C. §4321 et seq., by issuing its deregulation deci­
sion without first completing a detailed assessment of
the environmental consequences of its proposed course of
action. To remedy that violation, the District Court
vacated the agency’s decision completely deregulating
the alfalfa variety in question; ordered APHIS not to act
on the deregulation petition in whole or in part until it
had completed a detailed environmental review; and
enjoined almost all future planting of the genetically
engineered alfalfa pending the completion of that review.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s entry
of permanent injunctive relief. The main issue now in
dispute concerns the breadth of that relief. For the
reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand for
further proceedings.
