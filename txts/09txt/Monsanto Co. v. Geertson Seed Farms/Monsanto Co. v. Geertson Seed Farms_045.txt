STEVENS, J., dissenting

correct, the Court ignores the District Court’s findings
that gene flow is likely and that APHIS has little ability to
monitor any conditions imposed on a partial deregulation.
Limits on planting or harvesting may operate fine in a
laboratory setting, but the District Court concluded that
many limits will not be followed and cannot be enforced in
the real world.13
Against that background, it was perfectly reasonable to
wait for an EIS. APHIS and petitioners argued to the
District Court that partial deregulation could be safely
implemented, they submitted evidence intended to show
that planting restrictions would prevent the spread of the
newly engineered gene, and they contested “virtually
every factual issue relating to possible environmental
harm.” Geertson Seed Farms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130,
1135 (CA9 2009). But lacking “the benefit of the develop
ment of all the relevant data,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a,
the District Court did not find APHIS’s and petitioners’
assertions to be convincing. I cannot say that I would
have found otherwise. It was reasonable for the court to
conclude that planting could not go forward until more
——————
cannot monitor such limits, rules that protect these or any other parties
may be merely hortatory in practice. Moreover, although we have not
squarely addressed the issue, in my view “[t]here is no general re
quirement that an injunction affect only the parties in the suit.”
Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F. 2d 1163, 1169 (CA9 1987). To limit an injunc
tion against a federal agency to the named plaintiffs “would only
encourage numerous other” regulated entities “to file additional law
suits in this and other federal jurisdictions.” Livestock Marketing Assn.
v. United States Dept. of Agriculture, 207 F. Supp. 2d 992, 1007 (SD
2002), aff’d, 335 F. 3d 711, 726 (CA8 2003).
13 The majority notes that the District Court acknowledged, at a hear
ing several months before it issued the judgment, that a simple but
slightly overinclusive remedy may be preferable to an elaborate set of
planting conditions. See ante, at 22, n. 6. Quite right. As the District
Court said to APHIS’s lawyer at that hearing, if the agency issues an
elaborate set of precautions, “I don’t know how you even start to enforce
it.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 190a–191a.
