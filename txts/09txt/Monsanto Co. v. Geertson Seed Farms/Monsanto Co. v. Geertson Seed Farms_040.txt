MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
STEVENS, J., dissenting

quires an EIS under NEPA. See generally D. Mandelker,
NEPA Law and Litigation §§8:33–8:48 (2d ed. 2009) (de
scribing when an EIS is required); cf. Marsh v. Oregon
Natural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 371 (1989)
(NEPA embodies “sweeping commitment” to environ
mental safety and principle that “the agency will not act
on incomplete information, only to regret its decision after
it is too late to correct”). Indeed, it appears that any de
regulation of a genetically modified, herbicide-resistant
crop that can transfer its genes to other organisms and
cannot effectively be monitored easily fits the criteria for
when an EIS is required.7 That is especially so when, as
in this case, the environmental threat is novel. See Winter
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___,
___ (2008) (slip op., at 13) (EIS is more important when
party “is conducting a new type of activity with completely
unknown effects on the environment”).8

petition for nonregulated status. USDA, Introduction of Genetically
Engineered Organisms, Draft Environmental Impact Statement, July
2007, p. 11, online at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/brs/pdf/complete_
eis.pdf (as visited June 18, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file). In 2007, APHIS began contemplating a “new system” to
allow for the release and use of genetically modified organisms, for
“special cases” in which there are risks “that could be mitigated with
conditions to ensure safe commercial use.” Introduction 39024 (em
phasis added).
7 See, e.g., 40 CFR §1508.8 (2009) (determination whether an EIS is
required turns on both “[d]irect effects” and “[i]ndirect effects,” and
“include[s] those resulting from actions which may have both beneficial
and detrimental effects even if on balance the agency believes that the
effect will be beneficial”); §1508.27(b)(4) (determination whether an EIS
is required turns on “[t]he degree to which the effects on the quality of
the human environment are likely to be highly controversial”);
§1508.27(b)(5) (determination whether an EIS is required turns on
“[t]he degree to which the possible effects on the quality of the human
environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown
risks”).

limited to a remote area in which alfalfa is not grown, and issues an
