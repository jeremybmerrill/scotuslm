MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
STEVENS, J., dissenting

American business, and that limits on RRA deregulation
might not be followed or enforced—and that even if they
were, the newly engineered gene might nevertheless
spread to other crops. Confronted with those disconcert
ing submissions, with APHIS’s unlawful deregulation
decision, with a group of farmers who had staked their
livelihoods on APHIS’s decision, and with a federal statute
that prizes informed decisionmaking on matters that
seriously affect the environment, the court did the best it
could. In my view, the District Court was well within its
discretion to order the remedy that the Court now re
verses. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
