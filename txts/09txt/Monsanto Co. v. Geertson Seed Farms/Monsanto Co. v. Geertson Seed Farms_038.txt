MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
STEVENS, J., dissenting

for abuse of discretion. “[D]eference,” we have explained,
“is the hallmark of abuse-of-discretion review.” General
Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U. S. 136, 143 (1997). Although
equitable remedies are “not left to a trial court’s ‘inclina
tion,’ ” they are left to the court’s “ ‘judgment.’ ” Albemarle
Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 416 (1975) (quoting
United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC
Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.)). The principles set forth in
applicable federal statutes may inform that judgment.
See United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coopera
tive, 532 U. S. 483, 497 (2001) (“[A] court sitting in equity
cannot ignore the judgment of Congress, deliberately
expressed in legislation” (internal quotation marks omit
ted)). And historically, courts have had particularly broad
equitable power—and thus particularly broad discretion—
to remedy public nuisances and other “ ‘purprestures upon
public rights and properties,’ ” Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S.
623, 672 (1887),3 which include environmental harms.4
In my view, the District Court did not “unreasonably
exercis[e]” its discretion, Bennett v. Bennett, 208 U. S. 505,
512 (1908), even if it did categorically prohibit partial
deregulation pending completion of the EIS. Rather, the
District Court’s judgment can be understood as either of
two reasonable exercises of its equitable powers.
Equitable Application of Administrative Law
First, the District Court’s decision can be understood as
an equitable application of administrative law. Faced
with two different deregulation proposals, the District
Court appears to have vacated the deregulation that had
already occurred, made clear that NEPA requires an EIS
