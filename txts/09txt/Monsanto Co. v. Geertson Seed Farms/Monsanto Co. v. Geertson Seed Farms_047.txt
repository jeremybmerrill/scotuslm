STEVENS, J., dissenting

ied in the statute in considering whether an injunction
would be appropriate. This District Court had before it
strong evidence that gene transmission was likely to occur
and that limits on growing could not be enforced. It also
had a large amount of highly detailed evidence about
whether growing restrictions, even if enforced, can prevent
transmission. That evidence called into question the
agency’s own claims regarding the risks posed by partial
deregulation. In enjoining partial deregulation until it
had the benefit of an EIS to help parse the evidence, the
court acted with exactly the sort of caution that Congress
endorsed in NEPA.
Finally, it bears mention that the District Court’s ex
perience with the case may have given it grounds for
skepticism about the representations made by APHIS and
petitioners. Sometimes “one judicial actor is better posi
tioned than another to decide the issue in question.”
Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985). A “district
court may have insights not conveyed by the record.”
Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 560 (1988). In this
case, the agency had attempted to deregulate RRA without
an EIS in spite of ample evidence of potential environ
mental harms. And when the court made clear that the
agency had violated NEPA, the agency responded by
seeking to “ ‘streamline’ ” the process, ante, at 18, submit
ting a deregulation proposal with Monsanto that suffered
from some of the same legal and empirical holes as its
initial plan to deregulate. Against that background, the
court may have felt it especially prudent to wait for an EIS
before concluding that APHIS could manage RRA’s threat
to the environment.
