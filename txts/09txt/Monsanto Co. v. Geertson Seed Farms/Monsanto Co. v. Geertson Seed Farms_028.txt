MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
Opinion of the Court

the District Court’s injunction against planting does not
have any meaningful practical effect independent of its
vacatur. See Brief for Respondents 24; see also Tr. of Oral
Arg. 37 (“[T]he mistake that was made [by the District
Court] was in not appreciating . . . that the vacatur did
have [the] effect” of independently prohibiting the growth
and sale of almost all RRA). An injunction is a drastic and
extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a
matter of course. See, e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,
456 U. S. 305, 311–312 (1982). If a less drastic remedy
(such as partial or complete vacatur of APHIS’s deregula­
tion decision) was sufficient to redress respondents’ injury,
no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an
injunction was warranted. See ibid.; see also Winter, 555
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21–23).
E
In sum, the District Court abused its discretion in en­
joining APHIS from effecting a partial deregulation and in
prohibiting the possibility of planting in accordance with
the terms of such a deregulation. Given those errors, this
Court need not express any view on whether injunctive
relief of some kind was available to respondents on the
record before us. Nor does the Court address the question
whether the District Court was required to conduct an
evidentiary hearing before entering the relief at issue
here. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
