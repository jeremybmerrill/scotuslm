MONSANTO COMPANY, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

GEERTSON SEED FARMS ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
The Court does not dispute the District Court’s critical
findings of fact: First, Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA) can

genetic contamination from RRA could decimate farmers’
livelihoods and the American alfalfa market for years to
come. See id., at 71a; see also id., at 29a–30a. Instead,
the majority faults the District Court for “enjoining
APHIS from partially deregulating RRA.” Ante, at 16.
