MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
Opinion of the Court

I

A

The Plant Protection Act (PPA), 114 Stat. 438, 7 U. S. C.
§7701 et seq., provides that the Secretary of the Depart­
ment of Agriculture (USDA) may issue regulations “to
prevent the introduction of plant pests into the United
States or the dissemination of plant pests within the
United States.” §7711(a). The Secretary has delegated
that authority to APHIS, a division of the USDA. 7 CFR
§§2.22(a), 2.80(a)(36) (2010). Acting pursuant to that
delegation, APHIS has promulgated regulations governing
“the introduction of organisms and products altered or
produced through genetic engineering that are plant pests
or are believed to be plant pests.” See §340.0(a)(2) and
n. 1. Under those regulations, certain genetically engi­
neered plants are presumed to be “plant pests”—and thus
“regulated articles” under the PPA—until APHIS deter­
mines otherwise. See ibid.; §§340.1, 340.2, 340.6; see also
App. 183. However, any person may petition APHIS for a
determination that a regulated article does not present a
plant pest risk and therefore should not be subject to the
applicable regulations. 7 U. S. C. §7711(c)(2); 7 CFR
§340.6. APHIS may grant such a petition in whole or in
part. §340.6(d)(3).
In deciding whether to grant nonregulated status to a
genetically engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply
with NEPA, which requires federal agencies “to the fullest
extent possible” to prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) for “every recommendation or report on
proposals for legislation and other major Federal actio[n]
significantly affecting the quality of the human environ­
ment.”
42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C).
The statutory text
“speaks solely in terms of proposed actions; it does not
require an agency to consider the possible environmental
impacts of less imminent actions when preparing the
impact statement on proposed actions.” Kleppe v. Sierra
