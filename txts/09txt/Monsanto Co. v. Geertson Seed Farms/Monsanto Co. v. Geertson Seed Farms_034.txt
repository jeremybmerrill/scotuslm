MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS
STEVENS, J., dissenting

court imposed a variety of conditions on the crops’ han
dling and distribution. Id., at 77a.
As to all other RRA, however, the court sided with the
plaintiffs and enjoined planting during the pendency of
the EIS. Balancing the equities, the court explained that
the risk of harm was great. “[C]ontamination cannot be
undone; it will destroy the crops of those farmers who do
not sell genetically modified alfalfa.” Id., at 71a. And
because those crops “cannot be replanted for two to four
years,” that loss will be even greater. Ibid. On the other
side of the balance, the court recognized that some farmers
may wish to switch to genetically modified alfalfa immedi
ately, and some companies like Monsanto want to start
selling it to them just as fast. But, the court noted, RRA is
a small percentage of those companies’ overall business;
unsold seed can be stored; and the companies “ ‘have [no]
cause to claim surprise’ ” as to any loss of anticipated
revenue, as they “were aware of plaintiffs’ lawsuit” and
“nonetheless chose to market” RRA. Id., at 72a.
Thus, the District Court stated that it would “vacat[e]
the June 2005 deregulation decision”; “enjoi[n] the plant
ing of [RRA] in the United States after March 30, 2007,”
the date of the decision, “pending the government’s com
pletion of the EIS and decision on the deregulation peti
tion”; and impose “conditions on the handling and identifi
cation of already-planted [RRA].” Id., at 79a. On the
same day, the court issued its judgment. In relevant part,
the judgment states:
“The federal defendants’ June 14, 2005 Determination
of Nonregulated Status for [RRA] is VACATED. Be
fore granting Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even
in part, the federal defendants shall prepare an [EIS].
Until the federal defendants prepare the EIS and de
cide the deregulation petition, no [RRA] may be
planted. . . . [RRA already] planted before March 30,
