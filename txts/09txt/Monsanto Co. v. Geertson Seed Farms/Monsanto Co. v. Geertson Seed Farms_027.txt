Opinion of the Court

to challenge it, and to seek appropriate preliminary relief,
if and when such a decision is made. In light of these
particular circumstances, we hold that the District Court
did not properly exercise its discretion in enjoining a
partial deregulation of any kind pending APHIS’s prepa­
ration of an EIS. It follows that the Court of Appeals
erred in affirming that aspect of the District Court’s

We now turn to petitioners’ claim that the District Court
erred in entering a nationwide injunction against planting
RRA. Petitioners argue that the District Court did not
apply the right test for determining whether to enter
permanent injunctive relief; that, even if the District
Court identified the operative legal standard, it erred as a
matter of law in applying that standard to the facts of this
case; and that the District Court was required to grant
petitioners an evidentiary hearing to resolve contested
issues of fact germane to the remedial dispute between the
parties. We agree that the District Court’s injunction
against planting went too far, but we come to that conclu­
sion for two independent reasons.
First, the impropriety of the District Court’s broad
injunction against planting flows from the impropriety of
its injunction against partial deregulation. If APHIS may
partially deregulate RRA before preparing a full-blown
EIS—a question that we need not and do not decide here—
farmers should be able to grow and sell RRA in accordance
with that agency determination. Because it was inappro­
priate for the District Court to foreclose even the possibil­
ity of a partial and temporary deregulation, it necessarily
follows that it was likewise inappropriate to enjoin any
and all parties from acting in accordance with the terms of
such a deregulation decision.
Second, respondents have represented to this Court that
