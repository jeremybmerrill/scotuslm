ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

that Watson brought this criminal prosecution under her
authority as a private citizen. 940 A. 2d, at 1058. To
reach that conclusion, the court relied on Justice Black
mun’s separate opinion in Dixon. See 940 A. 2d, at 1057
(“As Justice Blackmun said in United States v. Dixon,

KENNEDY, J.); see id., at 720 (White, J., joined by STEVENS
and Souter, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dis
senting in part).

Founding, prosecutions by victims of crime and their
families were the rule, not the exception.” Brief for Re
spondent 38–39. But such prosecutions, though brought
by a private party, were commonly understood as an
exercise of sovereign power—the private party acting on
behalf of the sovereign, seeking to vindicate a public
wrong.
In England, for example, private parties could initiate
criminal prosecutions, but the Crown—entrusted with the
constitutional responsibility for law enforcement—could
