ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

$10,000 in restitution. App. 2, 63–64. Robertson filed a
motion to vacate the judgment, which the court denied.
Robertson appealed. Criminal contempt prosecutions,
he argued, “are between the public and the defendant,”
and thus could “only be brought in the name of the rele
vant sovereign, . . . the United States.” Brief for Petitioner
8, 10 (quoting Brief for Appellant in No. 00–FM–1269 etc.
(D. C.), pp. 20–21, and 940 A. 2d, at 1057; internal quota
tion marks omitted). So viewed, the prosecution based on
the June 26 incident could not be brought, because the
plea agreement barred the “gov[ernmen]t” from pursuing
any charges arising from that incident.
The Court of Appeals rejected Robertson’s arguments, in
a two-step holding. Step one: “the criminal contempt
prosecution in this case was conducted as a private action
brought in the name and interest of Ms. Watson, not as a
public action brought in the name and interest of the
United States or any other governmental entity.” 940
A. 2d, at 1057–1058 (internal quotation marks and brack
ets omitted). Step two: because the criminal contempt
prosecution was brought as an exercise of private power,
that prosecution did not implicate a plea agreement that
bound only the government. Id., at 1059–1060.
We granted certiorari to review the first step of that
holding.

Our decision in United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688
(1993), provides the answer to the question presented
here. The question in Dixon was one of double jeopardy—
whether a private party’s prosecution for criminal con
tempt barred the Government’s subsequent prosecution
for the “same criminal offense.” Id., at 696. The private
prosecution in that case was brought under the same D. C.
contempt law at issue here. Id., at 692 (citing D. C. Code
