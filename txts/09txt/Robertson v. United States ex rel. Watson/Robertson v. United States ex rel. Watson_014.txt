JOHN ROBERTSON, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
EX REL. WYKENNA WATSON
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 

COURT OF APPEALS

[May 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY
joins, dissenting.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE would hold that criminal prosecu
tions, including criminal contempt proceedings, must be
brought on behalf of the government. I join his opinion
with the understanding that the narrow holding it pro
poses does not address civil contempt proceedings or con
sider more generally the legitimacy of existing regimes for
the enforcement of restraining orders.
