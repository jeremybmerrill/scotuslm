ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Second Treatise of Civil Government §88, pp. 43–44 (J.
Gough ed. 1947) (“[E]very man who has entered into civil
society, and is become a member of any commonwealth,
has thereby quitted his power to punish offences against
the law of nature in prosecution of his own private judg
ment[.] . . . [H]e has given a right to the commonwealth to
employ his force for the execution of the judgments of the
commonwealth” (footnote omitted)). As this Court has
said before, “[c]rimes and offenses against the laws of any
State can only be defined, prosecuted and pardoned by the
sovereign authority of that State.” Huntington v. Attrill,
146 U. S. 657, 669 (1892); see also Heath, supra, at 88
(“The dual sovereignty doctrine [of the Double Jeopardy
Clause] is founded on the common-law conception of crime
as an offense against the sovereignty of the government”).
These core principles are embodied in the Constitution.
The protections our Bill of Rights affords those facing
criminal prosecution apply to “any person,” “any criminal
case,” and “all criminal prosecutions.” Amdts. 5, 6 (em

the government; “[i]ndividual invasion of individual rights”
is not covered. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 11 (1883)
(Fourteenth Amendment). If the safeguards of the Bill of
Rights are to be available in “all criminal prosecutions,”
then any such prosecution must be considered to be one on
behalf of the government—otherwise the constitutional
limits do not apply. “The Constitution constrains govern
mental action ‘by whatever instruments or in whatever
modes that action may be taken,’ ” Lebron v. National
Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 392 (1995)
(quoting Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346–347 (1880)),
but the action still must be governmental action.
The court below, however, rejected this understanding,
concluding that Watson’s “criminal contempt prosecution”
was not “a public action” but “a private action,” such that
it was not covered by an agreement binding the govern
