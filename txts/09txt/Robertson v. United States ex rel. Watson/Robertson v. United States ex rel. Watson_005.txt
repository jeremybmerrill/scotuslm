ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

§16–1005 (1989)).
We thought it “obvious” in Dixon that double jeopardy
protections barred the Government’s subsequent prosecu
tion. 509 U. S., at 696. The Double Jeopardy Clause, of
course, bars the second prosecution for the same offense
only if that prosecution is brought by the same sovereign
as the first. See Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 88–89
(1985). Thus, the only possible way the Government’s
second prosecution could have offended the Double Jeop
ardy Clause is if the Court understood the criminal con
tempt prosecution to be the Government’s first prosecu
tion—i.e., one brought on behalf of the Government. See
United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 451 (1989) (“The
protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are not trig
gered by litigation between private parties”), overruled on
other grounds by Hudson v. United States, 522 U. S. 93
(1997).
That we treated the criminal contempt prosecution in
Dixon as an exercise of government power should not be
surprising. More than two centuries ago, Blackstone
wrote that the king is “the proper person to prosecute for
all public offenses and breaches of the peace, being the
person injured in the eye of the law.” 1 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries *268. Blackstone repeated that principle
throughout his fourth book. See, e.g., 4 id., at *2, *8, *177.
Not long after Blackstone, then-Representative John
Marshall agreed, stating on the House floor that “adminis
ter[ing] criminal judgment . . . is a duty to be performed at
the demand of the nation, and with which the nation has a
right to dispense. If judgment . . . is to be pronounced, it
must be at the prosecution of the nation.” 10 Annals of
Cong. 615 (1800).
This principle has deep historical roots. See, e.g., 1 F.
Wharton, Criminal Law §10, p. 11 (9th ed. 1885) (“Penal
justice . . . is a distinctive prerogative of the State, to be
exercised in the service [of] the State”); see also J. Locke,
