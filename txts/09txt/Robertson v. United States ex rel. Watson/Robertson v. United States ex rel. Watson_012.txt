ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

sovereign. Id., at 29–32. The difficult aspects of that legal
issue, however, should not cause us to shy away from
answering the fundamental threshold question whether a
criminal prosecution may be brought on behalf and in the
interest of a private party. Having decided that threshold
question in favor of Robertson, I would remand to the
court below to consider the plea agreement from the
proper starting point.
In light of all the foregoing, it is worth stressing that the
majority’s determination not to decide that question “car
ries with it no implication whatever regarding the Court’s
views on the merits.” Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show,
Inc., 338 U. S. 912, 919 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., respecting
denial of certiorari).

Allegorical depictions of the law frequently show a
figure wielding a sword—the sword of justice, to be used to
smite those who violate the criminal laws. Indeed, outside
our own courthouse you will find a statue of more than 30
tons, Authority of Law, which portrays a male figure with
such a sword. According to the sculptor, James Earle
Fraser (who also designed the buffalo nickel), the figure
sits “wait[ing] with concentrated attention, holding in his
left hand the tablet of laws, backed by the sheathed sword,
symbolic of enforcement through law.” Supreme Court of
the United States, Office of the Curator, Contemplation of
Justice and Authority of Law Information Sheet 2 (2009)
(available in Clerk of Court’s case file). A basic step in
organizing a civilized society is to take that sword out of
private hands and turn it over to an organized govern
ment, acting on behalf of all the people. Indeed, “[t]he . . .
power a man has in the state of nature is the power to
punish the crimes committed against that law. [But this]
he gives up when he joins [a] . . . political society, and
incorporates into [a] commonwealth.”
Locke, Second
