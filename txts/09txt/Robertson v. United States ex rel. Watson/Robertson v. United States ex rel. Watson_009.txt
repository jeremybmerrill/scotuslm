ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

enter a nolle prosequi to halt the prosecution. See, e.g.,
King v. Guerchy, 1 Black W. 545, 96 Eng. Rep. 315 (K. B.
1765); King v. Fielding, 2 Burr. 719, 720, 97 Eng. Rep. 531
(K. B. 1759); see also King v. State, 43 Fla. 211, 223, 31 So.
254, 257 (1901) (Private prosecutions in England were
understood to be “conducted on behalf of the crown by the
privately retained counsel of private prosecutors”); P. Dev
lin, The Criminal Prosecution in England 21 (1958).
Watson’s arguments based on American precedent fail
largely for the same reason: To say that private parties
could (and still can, in some places) exercise some control
over criminal prosecutions says nothing to rebut the
widely accepted principle that those private parties neces
sarily acted (and now act) on behalf of the sovereign. See,
e.g., Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A. 2d 866, 877
(R. I. 2001) (“[A]ttorneys conducting private prosecutions
stand in the shoes of the state”); State v. Westbrook, 279
N. C. 18, 36, 181 S. E. 2d 572, 583 (1971) (“The prosecut
ing attorney, whether the solicitor or privately employed
counsel, represents the State”); Sidman, The Outmoded
Concept of Private Prosecution, 25 Am. U. L. Rev. 754, 774
(1976) (“[T]he privately retained attorney becomes, in
effect, a temporary public prosecutor”). Indeed, many of
the state court authorities Watson herself cites expressly
recognize this fundamental point. See, e.g., Katz v. Com
monwealth, 379 Mass. 305, 312, 399 N. E. 2d 1055, 1060
(1979) (“[I]t is clear with respect to the criminal aspects of
the present case that the Commonwealth . . . is the ad
verse party”).
We have no need to take issue with that proposition, but
this case is different. The whole point of the ruling below
was that this was not a “public action” that happened to
be litigated by a private party, but “a private action
brought in the name and interest of [Ms.] Watson.” 940
A. 2d, at 1057–1058. That holding was critical in explain
ing why Watson’s criminal action was not barred by a plea
