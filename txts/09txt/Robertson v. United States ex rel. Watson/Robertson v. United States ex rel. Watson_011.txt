speech.” Gompers v. United States, 233 U. S. 604, 610
(1914).
The United States bears some responsibility for leading
the court below astray. In that court, the Government
argued that the criminal contempt prosecution was “ ‘a
private action brought in the name and interest of [Ms.]
Watson, not . . . a public action brought in the name and

understood as a purely ‘private action’ ”). We should do

private power, a plea agreement that by its terms bound
only the “gov[ernmen]t” would not bind her.
With a proper view of Watson’s role in this case, how
ever, the plea agreement question becomes significantly
more difficult. The Solicitor General argues that the
agreement does not bar the contempt prosecution, even if
that prosecution is correctly viewed as on behalf of the
