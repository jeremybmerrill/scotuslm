ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

ment. 940 A. 2d, at 1057–1058 (internal quotation marks
omitted). But as we have explained, “[t]he purpose of a
criminal court is not to provide a forum for the ascertain
ment of private rights. Rather it is to vindicate the public
interest in the enforcement of the criminal law while at
the same time safeguarding the rights of the individual
defendant.” Standefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 25
(1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The holding below gives rise to a broad array of unset
tling questions. Take the Due Process Clause. It guaran
tees particular rights in criminal prosecutions because the
prosecutor is a state actor, carrying out a “duty on the part
of the Government.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 433
(1995) (emphasis added). But if the criminal prosecution
is instead viewed as “a private action,” not an exercise of
sovereign power, how would those rights attach? Cf.
DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489
U. S. 189, 195–196 (1989). What about Brady v. Mary
land, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)? The private prosecutor is likely
to have evidence pertinent to the proceeding—particularly
if, as here, the private prosecutor is also the victim of the
crime. But if the prosecutor is not exercising governmen
tal authority, what would be the constitutional basis for
any Brady obligations? May the private prosecutor inter
view the defendant without Miranda warnings, since she
is not acting on behalf of any sovereign but only in a pri
vate capacity? See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436
(1966).
Our entire criminal justice system is premised on the
notion that a criminal prosecution pits the government
against the governed, not one private citizen against
another. The ruling below is a startling repudiation of
that basic understanding.
