ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Treatise, §128, at 64.
The ruling below contravenes that fundamental proposi
tion, and should not be allowed to stand. At the very least,
we should do what we decided to do when we granted
certiorari, and took the unusual step of rephrasing the
question presented: answer it.
I respectfully dissent from the Court’s belated determi
nation not to answer that question.
