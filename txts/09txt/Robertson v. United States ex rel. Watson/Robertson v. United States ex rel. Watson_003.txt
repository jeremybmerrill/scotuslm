ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

the remaining questions.
I
In March 1999, Wykenna Watson was assaulted by her
then-boyfriend, John Robertson. App. 40. Watson sought
and secured a civil protective order against Robertson,
prohibiting him from approaching within 100 feet of her
and from assaulting, threatening, harassing, physically
abusing, or contacting her. Id., at 20. At the same time,
the United States Attorney’s Office (USAO) was independ
ently pursuing criminal charges against Robertson arising
from the assault.
On June 26, Robertson violated the protective order by
again violently assaulting Watson. On July 8, he was
indicted for the previous March incident; shortly thereaf
ter, the USAO offered, and Robertson accepted, a plea
agreement resolving those charges. Id., at 26–30. At the
top of the boilerplate plea form, the Assistant U. S. Attor
ney added in longhand: “In exchange for Mr. Robertson’s
plea of guilty to attempt[ed] aggravated assault, the gov’t
agrees to: DISMISS the [remaining] charges[,] [and] [n]ot
pursue any charges concerning an incident on 6-26-99.”
Id., at 28. The Superior Court accepted Robertson’s plea
and sentenced him to 1 to 3 years’ imprisonment. Id., at
30, 46, 53.
A few months later, Watson filed a motion to initiate
criminal contempt proceedings against Robertson for
violating the civil protective order, based on the June 26
assault. See D. C. Code §16–1005(f) (2009 Supp.); D. C.
Super. Ct. Domestic Violence Rule 12(d) (Lexis 2010); In re
Robertson, 940 A. 2d 1050, 1053 (D. C. 2008). After a 2
day bench trial, the court found Robertson guilty on three
counts of criminal contempt and sentenced him to three
consecutive 180-day terms of imprisonment, suspending
execution of the last in favor of five years’ probation. The
court also ordered Robertson to pay Watson roughly
