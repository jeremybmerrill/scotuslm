JOHN ROBERTSON, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
EX REL. WYKENNA WATSON
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 

COURT OF APPEALS

[May 24, 2010] 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA,
JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join,
dissenting.
This is a complicated case, but it raises a straightfor
ward and important threshold issue. When we granted
certiorari, we rephrased the question presented to focus on
that issue: “Whether an action for criminal contempt in a
congressionally created court may constitutionally be
brought in the name and pursuant to the power of a pri
vate person, rather than in the name and pursuant to the
power of the United States.” 558 U. S ___ (2009). The
answer to that question is no. The terrifying force of the
criminal justice system may only be brought to bear
against an individual by society as a whole, through a
prosecution brought on behalf of the government. The
court below held otherwise, relying on a dissenting opinion
in one of our cases, and on the litigating position of the
United States, which the Solicitor General has properly
abandoned in this Court. See Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 12–13, n. 3. We should correct the lower
court’s error and return the case to that court to resolve
