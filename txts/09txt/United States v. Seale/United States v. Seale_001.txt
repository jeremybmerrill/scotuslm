Statement of STEVENS, J.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
UNITED STATES v. JAMES FORD SEALE
ON CERTIFIED QUESTION BY THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 09–166.

Decided November 2, 2009

The question certified by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is dismissed.
Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE
SCALIA joins, respecting the dismissal of the certified
question.

was a capital offense when the victim was harmed, and

when the kidnaping results in the loss of life. But for
more than two decades in between, Seale’s crime was not
punishable by death.
Several developments accounted for this. In 1968 this
Court held that the death penalty provision in the old
§1201 was unconstitutional because it applied “only to
those defendants who assert the right to contest their guilt
