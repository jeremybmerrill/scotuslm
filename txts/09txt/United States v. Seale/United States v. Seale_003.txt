Statement of STEVENS, J.

judicial business.” Ibid.
The certification process has all but disappeared in
recent decades. The Court has accepted only a handful of
certified cases since the 1940s and none since 1981; it is a
newsworthy event these days when a lower court even
tries for certification. Section 1254(2) and this Court’s
Rule 19 remain part of our law because the certification
process serves a valuable, if limited, function. We ought to
avail ourselves of it in an appropriate case. In my judg
ment, this case should be briefed and set for argument.
