Per Curiam

would be sufficiently likely to redress “collateral conse
quences adequate to meet Article III’s injury-in-fact re
quirement.” Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 14 (1998).
Perhaps the most likely potential “collateral conse
quenc[e]” that might be remedied by a judgment in re
spondent’s favor is the requirement that respondent re
main registered as a sex offender under Montana law.
(“By the time of the court of appeals’ decision, respondent
had become registered as a sex offender in Montana,
where he continues to be registered today.” Pet. for Cert.
29.) We thus must know whether a favorable decision in
this case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent
“could remove his name and identifying information from
the Montana sex offender registry.” Ibid. Therefore, we
certify the following question to the Supreme Court of
Montana, pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Proce
dure 15 (2009):
Is respondent’s duty to remain registered as a sex of
fender under Montana law contingent upon the valid
ity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juve
nile-supervision order that required him to register as
a sex offender, see Mont. Code Ann. §§46–23–
502(6)(b), 41–5–1513(1)(c) (2005); State v. Villanueva,
328 Mont. 135, 138–140, 118 P. 3d 179, 181–182
(2005); see also §46–23–502(9)(b) (2009), or is the duty
an independent requirement of Montana law that is
unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal
juvenile-supervision conditions, see §46–23–502(10)
(2009); 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 483, §31, p. 2185?
We respectfully request that the Montana Supreme
Court accept our certified question. The court’s answer to
this question will help determine whether this case pre
sents a live case or controversy, and there is no controlling
appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute on
point. Mont. Rule App. Proc. 15(3). We understand that
