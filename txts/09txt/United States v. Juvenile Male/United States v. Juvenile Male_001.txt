SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 09–940

Decided June 7, 2010 


PER CURIAM.
In 2005, respondent was charged in the United States
District Court for the District of Montana with juvenile
delinquency under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act
(FJDA), 18 U. S. C. §5031 et seq. Respondent eventually

SORNA requires individuals who have been adjudicated

to keep their registrations current in each jurisdiction
where they live, work, and go to school. §§16911(8);
16913. In February 2007, the Attorney General issued an
interim rule specifying that SORNA’s requirements “apply
to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of
the offense for which registration is required prior to the
enactment of [SORNA].” 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28
