tice” standard is superior, because determining when a
hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have
“discover[ed]” the necessary facts is too complicated for
judges to undertake. But courts applying the traditional
discovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably
diligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad
circumstances. And courts in at least five Circuits already
ask this kind of question in securities fraud cases. See,
e.g., Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F. 3d 81, 97 (CA2 2000); New
England Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 501; Young, supra, at
1, 9–10; Sterlin v. Biomune Systems, 154 F. 3d 1191, 1201
(CA10 1998); Marks v. CDW Computer Centers, Inc., 122
F. 3d 363, 367–368 (CA7 1997). Merck has not shown this
precedent to be unworkable. We consequently find that
the “discovery” of facts that put a plaintiff on “inquiry
notice” does not automatically begin the running of the
limitations period.
We conclude that the limitations period in §1658(b)(1)
begins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasona
bly diligent plaintiff would have “discover[ed] the facts
constituting the violation”—whichever comes first. In
determining the time at which “discovery” of those “facts”
occurred, terms such as “inquiry notice” and “storm warn
ings” may be useful to the extent that they identify a time
when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent
plaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations period
does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discov
ers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discov
ered “the facts constituting the violation,” including sci
enter—irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff
undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.

Finally, Merck argues that, even if all its other legal
arguments fail, the record still shows that, before Novem
