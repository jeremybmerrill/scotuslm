Opinion of SCALIA, J.

True, the sensible presumption that a word means the
same thing when it appears more than once in the same
statutory context—or even in the very same statute—is
rebuttable. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.
Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595–596 (2004). Context may make
clear that in one instance the word carries one meaning,
and in a second instance another. See, e.g., id., at 596–
597. But nothing in the context of §77m or §1658(b)(1)
suggests that is the case. Both provisions impose limita
tions periods for federal-law claims based on various false
statements or omissions involving securities. The former
applies to false statements or omissions in registration
statements, §77k, and offers to sell securities, §77l(a)(2);
the broad language of the latter (“claim[s] of fraud, deceit,
manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula
tory requirement concerning the securities laws”) covers
other “manipulative or deceptive device[s] or contriv
ance[s]” made “in connection with the purchase or sale” of
a security in violation of Securities and Exchange Com
mission regulations, §78j(b), including SEC Rule 10b–5, 17
CFR §240.10b–5(b) (2009). There is good reason, more
over, for providing an actual-discovery rule for private
§10(b) claims but providing (explicitly) a constructive
discovery rule for claims governed by §77m: The elements
of §10(b) claims, which include scienter, are likely more
difficult to discover than the elements of claims under
§77k or §77l(a)(2), which do not, see Herman & MacLean
v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 382 (1983); Ernst & Ernst v.
Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 208–209 (1976); In re Morgan
Stanley Information Fund Securities Litigation, 592 F. 3d
347, 359 (CA2 2010). And a constructive-discovery stan
dard may be easier to apply to the claims covered by §77m.
Determining when the plaintiff should have uncovered an
untrue assertion in a registration statement or prospectus
is much simpler than assessing when a plaintiff should
have learned that the defendant deliberately misled him
