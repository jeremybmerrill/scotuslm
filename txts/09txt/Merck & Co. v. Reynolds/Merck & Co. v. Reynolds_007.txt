Opinion of the Court

the body’s production of an enzyme called COX–2 (cyclooxygenase-2). COX–2 is associated with pain and inflammation. Unlike some other anti-inflammatory drugs in its
class like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, Vioxx does not
inhibit production of a second enzyme called COX–1
(cyclooxygenase-1). COX–1 plays a part in the functioning
of the gastrointestinal tract and also in platelet aggregation
(associated with blood clots). App. 50–51.
2. March 2000. Merck announced the results of a study,
called the “VIGOR” study. Id., at 291–294. The study
compared Vioxx with another painkiller, naproxen. The
study showed that persons taking Vioxx suffered fewer
gastrointestinal side effects (as Merck had hoped). But
the study also revealed that approximately 4 out of every
1,000 participants who took Vioxx suffered heart attacks,
compared to only 1 per 1,000 participants who took
naproxen. Id., at 296, 306; see Bombardier et al., Comparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib
and Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, 343
New England J. Medicine 1520, 1523, 1526–1527 (2000).
Merck’s press release acknowledged VIGOR’s adverse
cardiovascular data. But Merck said that these data were
“consistent with naproxen’s ability to block platelet aggregation.” App. 291. Merck noted that, since “Vioxx, like all
COX–2 selective medicines, does not block platelet aggregation[, it] would not be expected to have similar effects.”
Ibid. And Merck added that “safety data from all other
completed and ongoing clinical trials . . . showed no indication of a difference in the incidence of thromboembolic
events between Vioxx” and either a placebo or comparable
drugs. Id., at 293 (emphasis deleted).
This theory—that VIGOR’s troubling cardiovascular
findings might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred
by naproxen rather than due to a harm caused by Vioxx—
later became known as the “naproxen hypothesis.” In
advancing that hypothesis, Merck acknowledged that the
