Opinion of the Court

known the “facts constituting the violation” at least two
years earlier, moved to dismiss the complaint, saying it
was filed too late. The District Court granted the motion.
The court held that the (March 2001) VIGOR study, the
(September 2001) FDA warning letter, and Merck’s (Octo
ber 2001) response should have alerted the plaintiffs to a
“possibility that Merck had knowingly misrepresented
material facts” no later than October 9, 2001, thus placing
the plaintiffs on “inquiry notice” to look further. In re
Merck & Co. Securities, Derivative & “ERISA” Litigation,
483 F. Supp. 2d 407, 423 (NJ 2007) (emphasis added).
Finding that the plaintiffs had failed to “show that they
exercised reasonable due diligence but nevertheless were
unable to discover their injuries,” the court took October 9,
2001, as the date that the limitations period began to run
and therefore found the complaint untimely. Id., at 424.
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. A
majority held that the pre-November 2001 events, while
constituting “storm warnings,” did not suggest much by
way of scienter, and consequently did not put the plaintiffs
on “inquiry notice,” requiring them to investigate further.
In re Merck & Co. Securities, Derivative & “ERISA” Litiga
tion, 543 F. 3d 150, 172 (2008). A dissenting judge consid
ered the pre-November 2001 events sufficient to start the
2-year clock running. Id., at 173 (opinion of Roth, J.).
Merck sought review in this Court, pointing to dis
agreements among the Courts of Appeals. Compare Theo
harous v. Fong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001) (limita
tions period begins to run when information puts plaintiffs
on “inquiry notice” of the need for investigation), with
Shah v. Meeker, 435 F. 3d 244, 249 (CA2 2006) (same; but
if plaintiff does investigate, period runs “from the date
such inquiry should have revealed the fraud” (internal
quotation marks omitted)), and New England Health Care
Employees Pension Fund v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 336 F. 3d
