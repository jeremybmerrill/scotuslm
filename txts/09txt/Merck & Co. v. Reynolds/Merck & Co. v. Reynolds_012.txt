MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS
Opinion of the Court

put on “inquiry notice,” should have discovered facts con

Before turning to Merck’s arguments, we consider a
more basic matter. The parties and the Solicitor General
agree that §1658(b)(1)’s word “discovery” refers not only to
a plaintiff’s actual discovery of certain facts, but also to
the facts that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have
discovered. We agree. But because the statute’s language
does not make this interpretation obvious, and because we

fraud, where a defendant’s deceptive conduct may prevent
a plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been
defrauded. Otherwise, “the law which was designed to
prevent fraud” could become “the means by which it is
