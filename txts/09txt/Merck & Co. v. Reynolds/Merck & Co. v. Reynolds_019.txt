Opinion of the Court

Brief for Petitioners 20. And some, but not all, Courts of
Appeals have used the term in roughly similar ways. See,
e.g., Franze v. Equitable Assurance, 296 F. 3d 1250, 1254
(CA11 2002) (“[I]nquiry notice [is] “ ‘the term used for
knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to
begin investigating the possibility that his legal rights had
been infringed’ ”). Cf. Dodds, 12 F. 3d, at 350 (“duty of
inquiry” arises once “circumstances would suggest to an
investor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she
had been defrauded”); Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. v.
Kapoor, 115 F. 3d 1332, 1335–1336 (CA7 1997) (“The facts
constituting [inquiry] notice must be sufficien[t] . . . to
incite the victim to investigate” and “to enable him to tie
up any loose ends and complete the investigation in time
to file a timely suit”); Great Rivers Cooperative of South
eastern Iowa v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893,
896 (CA8 1997) (“Inquiry notice exists when the victim is
aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to
investigate and consequently acquire actual knowledge of
the defendant’s misrepresentations” (emphasis added)).
If the term “inquiry notice” refers to the point where the
facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investi
gate further, that point is not necessarily the point at which
the plaintiff would already have discovered facts showing
scienter or other “facts constituting the violation.” But the
statute says that the plaintiff’s claim accrues only after the
“discovery” of those latter facts. Nothing in the text sug
gests that the limitations period can sometimes begin before
“discovery” can take place. Merck points out that, as we
have discussed, see supra, at 8–9, the court-created “discov
ery rule” exception to ordinary statutes of limitations is not
generally available to plaintiffs who fail to pursue their
claims with reasonable diligence. But we are dealing here
with a statute, not a court-created exception to a statute.
Because the statute contains no indication that the limita
tions period should occur at some earlier moment before
