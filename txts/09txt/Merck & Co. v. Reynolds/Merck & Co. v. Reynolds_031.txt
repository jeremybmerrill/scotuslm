Opinion of SCALIA, J.

1997) (applying pre-Lampf rule under 15 U. S. C. §78aa–
1). And of those that were undecided, two had cast doubt
on a constructive-discovery view in dicta—of which the
omniscient Congress of the Court’s imagining should also
have been aware. See Berry v. Valence Technology, Inc.,
175 F. 3d 699, 703–705 (CA9 1999); Gruber v. Price Water
house, 911 F. 2d 960, 964, n. 4 (CA3 1990).
This motley assortment of approaches comes nowhere
near establishing that the word “discovery” in §78i(e)
meant constructive rather than actual discovery despite
§77m. Absent any textual or contextual reason to read
“discovery” differently in §1658(b)(1) and §77m, I would
hold that only actual discovery suffices to start the limita
tions period for §10(b) claims. Since Merck points to no
evidence showing respondents actually discovered scienter
more than two years before bringing this suit, I agree with
the Court that the suit was not time barred.
Respondents suggested at oral argument, Tr. of Oral
Arg. 29, and their amici imply, see Faculty Brief 33–34,
that in fraud-on-the-market cases there is little if any
difference between actual and constructive discovery
because of the presumption of reliance applicable in such
cases, see Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 247 (1988).
It seems to me Basic has no bearing on the question dis
cussed here. A presumption of reliance upon market-price
signals is not a presumption of knowledge of all public
information, much less knowledge of nonpublic informa
tion that a reasonably diligent investor would have inde
pendently uncovered. In any event, whether or not a
constructive-discovery standard will in many cases yield
the same result, actual discovery is what §1658(b)(1)
requires to start the limitations period.
