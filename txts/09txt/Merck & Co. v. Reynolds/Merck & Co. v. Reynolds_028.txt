MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

using a deceptive device covered by §10(b).1
Unable to identify anything in the statutory context that
warrants giving “discovery” two meanings, the Court
relies on the historical treatment of “discovery” in limita
tions periods (particularly for fraud claims) as incorporat
ing a constructive-discovery rule. Ante, at 8–10, 12. But
that history proves only that “discovery” can carry that
technical meaning, and that without §77m it would be
reasonable (other things equal) to read it that way here.
It does not show what “discovery” means in §1658(b)(1) in
light of §77m’s codification of a constructive-discovery
rule. In my view, the meaning of “discovery” in the
broader context of limitations provisions is overcome by its
meaning in the more specific context of the federal securi
ties laws.
The Court’s other reason for rejecting the more natural
reading of §1658(b)(1) rests on a consensus among the
Courts of Appeals before the provision’s enactment. Ante,
at 11–12. In Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v.
Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), the Court notes, we
explicitly adopted the terms of §78i(e)—which like
§1658(b)(1) refers only to discovery with no mention of
reasonable diligence—as the limitations period for the
private §10(b) cause of action we created. Id., at 364, and
——————
1 The Court appears to believe that §77m’s distinction between actual
and constructive discovery has no bearing on §1658(b)(1)’s meaning
because the latter does not itself draw the same distinction. Ante, at
11–12. The point, however, is that both provisions use the same word
(“discovery”) with no contextual clue that it carries different meanings;
and its use in §77m makes clear that the meaning is actual discovery.
The Court suggests that usages of the same word in other statutes
are irrelevant, ante, at 11–12, but of course it does not believe that. Its
entire argument rests on the meaning courts have ascribed to “discov
ery” in other limitations provisions (some enacted decades ago by state
legislatures), ante, at 8–10. Yet while the Court considers that broader
context, it provides no explanation for ignoring the more specific
context of securities-fraud claims under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.
