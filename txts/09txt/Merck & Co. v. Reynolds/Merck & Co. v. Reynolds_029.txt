Opinion of SCALIA, J.

n. 9.2 Since every Circuit to address the issue between
Lampf and §1658(b)(1)’s enactment 11 years later had held
constructive discovery applicable to §10(b) claims—and
since Congress copied §78i(e)’s key text into §1658(b)(1)
with no indication it intended to adopt a contrary rule—the
Court assumes Congress meant to codify (or at least not to
disturb) that consensus. Ante, at 11–12.
Even assuming that Congress intended to incorporate
the Circuits’ views—which requires the further unrealistic
assumption that a majority of each House knew of and
agreed with the Courts of Appeals’ opinions—that would
be entirely irrelevant. Congress’s collective intent (if such
a thing even exists) cannot trump the text it enacts, and in
any event we have no reliable way to ascertain that intent
apart from reading the text. See Graham County Soil and
Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,
559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).
The only way in which the Circuits’ pre-2002 decisions
might bear on §1658(b)(1)’s meaning is if all (or nearly all)
of the Circuits had interpreted “discovery” in §78i(e) to
mean constructive discovery. If that were true, one could
say that those decisions had established the public mean
ing of the term in this context—whether Congress knew of
(or agreed with) that meaning or not. Jerman v. Carlisle,
McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich LPA, 559 U. S. ___, ___,
n. 1 (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring
——————
2 The Court notes that Lampf chose §78i(e)’s limitations period as the
time bar for §10(b) claims, even though it was aware of §77m, 501 U. S.,
at 360, and n. 7, 364, and n. 9; see ante, at 10–11. But I fail to see how
that provides any support for the Court’s interpretation. To the con
trary, the fact that in enacting §1658(b)(1) Congress did not copy
§77m’s constructive-discovery proviso—but decreed instead that “dis
covery” alone starts the clock (as it had done in §78i(e), which we
borrowed in Lampf)—is what makes equating §77m and §1658(b)(1) so
implausible.
