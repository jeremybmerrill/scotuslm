MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS
Opinion of the Court

naproxen benefit “had not been observed previously.” Id.,
at 291. Journalists and stock market analysts reported all
of the above—the positive gastrointestinal results, the
troubling cardiovascular finding, the naproxen hypothesis,
and the fact that the naproxen hypothesis was unproved.
See id., at 355–391, 508–557.
3. February 2001 to August 2001. Public debate about
the naproxen hypothesis continued. In February 2001, the
FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee convened to consider
Merck’s request that the Vioxx label be changed to reflect
VIGOR’s positive gastrointestinal findings. The VIGOR
cardiovascular findings were also discussed. Id., at 392–
395, 558–577. In May 2001, a group of plaintiffs filed a
products-liability lawsuit against Merck, claiming that
“Merck’s own research” had demonstrated that “users of
Vioxx were four times as likely to suffer heart attacks as
compared to other less expensive, medications.” Id., at
869. In August 2001, the Journal of the American Medical
Association wrote that the available data raised a “cau
tionary flag” and strongly urged that “a trial specifically
assessing cardiovascular risk” be done. Id., at 331–332;

Events Associated with Selective Cox-2 Inhibitors, 286
JAMA 954 (2001). At about the same time, Bloomberg
News quoted a Merck scientist who claimed that Merck
had “additional data” that were “very, very reassuring,”
and Merck issued a press release stating that it stood
“behind the overall and cardiovascular safety profile . . . of
Vioxx.” App. 434, 120 (emphasis deleted; internal quota
tion marks omitted).
4. September and October 2001. The FDA sent Merck a
warning letter released to the public on September 21,
2001. It said that, in respect to cardiovascular risks,
Merck’s Vioxx marketing was “false, lacking in fair bal
ance, or otherwise misleading.” Id., at 339. At the same
time, the FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis
