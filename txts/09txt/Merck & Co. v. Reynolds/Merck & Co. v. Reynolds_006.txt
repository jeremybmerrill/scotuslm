MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS
Opinion of the Court

ing the use of Merck’s pain-killing drug, Vioxx (leading to
economic losses when the risks later became apparent).
The plaintiffs brought an action for securities fraud under
§10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See 48 Stat.
891, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b); SEC Rule 10b–5, 17
CFR §240.10b–5(b) (2009); Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.
Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342 (2005).
The applicable statute of limitations provides that a
“private right of action” that, like the present action,
“involves a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or con
trivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement
concerning the securities laws . . . may be brought not
later than the earlier of—
“(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting
the violation; or
“(2) 5 years after such violation.” 28 U. S. C. §1658(b).
The complaint in this case was filed on November 6,
2003, and no one doubts that it was filed within five years
of the alleged violation. Therefore, the critical date for
timeliness purposes is November 6, 2001—two years
before this complaint was filed. Merck claims that before
this date the plaintiffs had (or should have) discovered the
“facts constituting the violation.” If so, by the time the
plaintiffs filed their complaint, the 2-year statutory period
in §1658(b)(1) had run. The plaintiffs reply that they had
not, and could not have, discovered by the critical date
those “facts,” particularly not the facts related to scienter,
and that their complaint was therefore timely.
