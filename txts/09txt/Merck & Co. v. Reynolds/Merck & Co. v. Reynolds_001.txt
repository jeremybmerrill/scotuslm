MERCK & CO., INC., ET AL. v. REYNOLDS ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 08–905.

Argued November 30, 2009—Decided April 27, 2010

On November 6, 2003, respondent investors filed a securities fraud ac
tion under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging
that petitioner Merck & Co. knowingly misrepresented the heart
attack risks associated with its drug Vioxx. A securities fraud com
plaint is timely if filed no more than “2 years after the discovery of
the facts constituting the violation” or 5 years after the violation. 28
U. S. C. §1658(b). The District Court dismissed the complaint as un
timely because the plaintiffs should have been alerted to the possibil

2 years before the complaint was filed, and they had failed to under
take a reasonably diligent investigation at that time. Among the
relevant circumstances were (1) a March 2000 “VIGOR” study com
paring Vioxx with the painkiller naproxen and showing adverse car
diovascular results for Vioxx, which Merck suggested might be due to
the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than a harm
caused by Vioxx (the naproxen hypothesis); (2) an FDA warning let
ter, released to the public on September 21, 2001, saying that Merck’s
Vioxx marketing with regard to the cardiovascular results was “false,
lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading”; and (3) pleadings
filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 al
leging that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and inten
tionally downplayed its risks. The Third Circuit reversed, holding
that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted
with scienter, an element of a §10(b) violation, and consequently did
not commence the running of the limitations period.
Held:
1. The limitations period in §1658(b)(1) begins to run once the
plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would
