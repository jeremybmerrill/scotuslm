Opinion of the Court

ous formulations the one in 15 U. S. C. §77m, on which the
concurrence relies. See post, at 2–4 (SCALIA, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment); Lampf, supra, at 360,
and n. 7 (quoting §77m).)
Subsequently, every Court of Appeals to decide the
matter held that “discovery of the facts constituting the
violation” occurs not only once a plaintiff actually discov
ers the facts, but also when a hypothetical reasonably
diligent plaintiff would have discovered them. See, e.g.,
Law v. Medco Research, Inc., 113 F. 3d 781, 785–786 (CA7
1997); Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., 12 F. 3d 346, 350,
353 (CA2 1993); see In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation,
306 F. 3d 1314, 1325, n. 4 (CA3 2002) (collecting cases).
Some of those courts noted that other limitations provi
sions in the federal securities laws explicitly provide that
the period begins to run “ ‘after the discovery of the untrue
statement . . . or after such discovery should have been
made by [the] exercise of reasonable diligence,’ ” whereas
the formulation adopted by the Court in Lampf from 15
U. S. C. §78i(e) does not. Tregenza, supra, at 721 (quoting
§77m; emphasis added in Tregenza); see Lampf, supra, at
364, n. 9. But, courts reasoned, because the term “discov
ery” in respect to statutes of limitations for fraud has long
been understood to include discoveries a reasonably dili
gent plaintiff would make, the omission of an explicit
provision to that effect did not matter. Tregenza, supra, at
721; accord, New England Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 499–
500.
In 2002, when Congress enacted the present limitations
statute, it repeated Lampf’s critical language. The statute
says that an action based on fraud “may be brought not
later than the earlier of . . . 2 years after the discovery of
the facts constituting the violation” (or “5 years after such
violation”). §804 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 116 Stat. 801,
codified at 28 U. S. C. §1658(b) (emphasis added). (This
statutory provision does not make the linguistic distinc
