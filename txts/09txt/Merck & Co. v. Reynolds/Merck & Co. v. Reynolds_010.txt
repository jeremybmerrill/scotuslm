MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS
Opinion of the Court

Merck defended Vioxx and pointed to the study’s limita
tions. Id., at 165–167.
2. September 30, 2004. Merck withdrew Vioxx from the
market. It said that a new study had found “an increased
risk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18
months of continuous therapy.” Id., at 182 (internal quo
tation marks omitted). A Merck representative publicly
described the results as “totally unexpected.” Id., at 186.
Merck’s shares fell by 27% the same day. Id., at 185, 856.
3. November 1, 2004. The Wall Street Journal published
an article stating that “internal Merck e-mails and mar
keting materials as well as interviews with outside scien
tists show that the company fought forcefully for years to
keep safety concerns from destroying the drug’s commer
cial prospects.” Id., at 189–190. The article said that an
early e-mail from Merck’s head of research had said that
the VIGOR “results showed that the cardiovascular events
‘are clearly there,’ ” that it was “ ‘a shame but . . . a low
incidence,’ ” and that it “ ‘is mechanism based as we wor
ried it was.’ ” Id., at 192. It also said that Merck had
given its salespeople instructions to “ ‘DODGE’ ” questions
about Vioxx’s cardiovascular effects. Id., at 193.

The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 6,
2003. As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged
that Merck had defrauded investors by promoting the
naproxen hypothesis, knowing the hypothesis was false.
It said, for example, that Merck “knew, at least as early as
1996, of the serious safety issues with Vioxx,” and that a
“1998 internal Merck clinical trial . . . revealed that . . .
serious cardiovascular events . . . occurred six times more
frequently in patients given Vioxx than in patients given a
different arthritis drug or placebo.” Id., at 56, 58–59
(emphasis and capitalization deleted).
