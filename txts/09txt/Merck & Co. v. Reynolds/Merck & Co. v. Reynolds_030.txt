MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

in judgment) (slip op., at 2, n. 1).
But as amici note, that is not so. See Brief for Faculty
at Law and Business Schools as Amici Curiae 23–29 (here
inafter Faculty Brief). Some circuit cases cited by the
Court and amici can conceivably be read as interpreting
the language Lampf adopted from §78i(e) as imposing
some form of constructive discovery. See Theoharous v.
Fong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001); Menowitz v.
Brown, 991 F. 2d 36, 41 (CA2 1993) (per curiam); Howard
v. Haddad, 962 F. 2d 328, 329–330 (CA4 1992); Anixter v.
Home-Stake Production Co., 947 F. 2d 897, 898–899 (CA10
1991), vacated on other grounds, 503 U. S. 978 (1992).
Others, however, cannot be so construed. Two were not
interpreting §78i(e) at all, but looked directly to §77m,
despite Lampf’s explicit selection of §78i(e)’s terms. Great
Rivers Cooperative of Southeastern Iowa v. Farmland
Industries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893, 896 (CA8 1997); Topalian
v. Ehrman, 954 F. 2d 1125, 1135 (CA5 1992). Another
court candidly acknowledged that §78i(e)’s text—unlike
§77m’s—forecloses constructive discovery, but it nonethe
less held that courts remain “free to apply to [§78i(e)] the
judge-made doctrine of inquiry notice” as a “modest and
traditional . . . exercise of judicial creativity,” since “Con
gress could not have known when it enacted [§78i(e)] that
this section would someday provide the statute of limita
tions for a wide range of securities frauds.” Tregenza v.
Great American Communications Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721–
722 (CA7 1993) (Posner, J.).
The rest of the Circuits apparently had not decided the
issue before §1658(b)(1)’s enactment. See Betz v. Trainer
Wortham & Co., 519 F. 3d 863, 874 (CA9 2008); New
England Health Care Employees Pension Fund v. Ernst &
Young, LLP, 336 F. 3d 495, 500–501, and n. 3 (CA6 2003);
In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation, 306 F. 3d 1314,
1325 (CA3 2002); see also Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito
