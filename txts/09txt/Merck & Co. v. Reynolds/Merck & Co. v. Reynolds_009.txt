Opinion of the Court

was a “possible explanation” of the VIGOR results. Id., at
340. But it found that Merck’s “promotional campaign
selectively present[ed]” that hypothesis without adequately
acknowledging “another reasonable explanation,” namely,
“that Vioxx may have pro-thrombotic [i.e., adverse cardio
vascular] properties.” Ibid. The FDA ordered Merck to
send healthcare providers a corrective letter. Id., at 353.
After the FDA letter was released, more products
liability lawsuits were filed. See id., at 885–956. Merck’s
share price fell by 6.6% over several days. See id., at 832.
By October 1, the price rebounded. See ibid. On October
9, 2001, the New York Times said that Merck had reexam
ined its own data and “found no evidence that Vioxx in
creased the risk of heart attacks.” App. 504. It quoted the
president of Merck Research Laboratories as positing
“ ‘two possible interpretations’ ”: “ ‘Naproxen lowers the
heart attack rate, or Vioxx raises it.’ ” Ibid. Stock ana
lysts, while reporting the warning letter, also noted that
the FDA had not denied that the naproxen hypothesis
remained an unproven but possible explanation. See id.,
at 614, 626, 628.
B
We next set forth three important events that occurred
after the critical date.
1. October 2003. The Wall Street Journal published the
results of a Merck-funded Vioxx study conducted at Bos
ton’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. After examining
the medical records of more than 50,000 Medicare pa
tients, researchers found that those given Vioxx for 30-to
90 days were 37% more likely to have suffered a heart
attack than those given either a different painkiller or no
painkiller at all. Id., at 164–165. (That is to say, if pa
tients given a different painkiller or given no painkiller at
all suffered 10 heart attacks, then the same number of
patients given Vioxx would suffer 13 or 14 heart attacks.)
