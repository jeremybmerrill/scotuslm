MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS
Opinion of the Court

tion that the concurrence finds in a different statute,
§77m, and upon which its argument rests. Cf. 29 U. S. C.
§1113(2) (statute in which Congress provided that an
action be brought “three years after the earliest date on
which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or
violation” (emphasis added)).)
Not surprisingly, the
Courts of Appeals unanimously have continued to inter
pret the word “discovery” in this statute as including not
only facts a particular plaintiff knows, but also the facts
any reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g.,
Staehr v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc., 547 F. 3d
406, 411 (CA2 2008); Sudo Properties, Inc. v. Terrebonne
Parish Consolidated Govt., 503 F. 3d 371, 376 (CA5 2007).
We normally assume that, when Congress enacts stat
utes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent. See, e.g.,
Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116–117,
and n. 13 (2002); Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus
tries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993). Given the history
and precedent surrounding the use of the word “discovery”
in the limitations context generally as well as in this
provision in particular, the reasons for making this as
sumption are particularly strong here. We consequently
hold that “discovery” as used in this statute encompasses
not only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also
those facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have
known. And we evaluate Merck’s claims accordingly.

We turn now to Merck’s arguments in favor of holding
that petitioners’ claims accrued before November 6, 2001.
First, Merck argues that the statute does not require
“discovery” of scienter-related “facts.” See Brief for Peti
tioners 19–28. We cannot agree, however, that facts about
scienter are unnecessary.
The statute says that the limitations period does not
begin to run until “discovery of the facts constituting the
