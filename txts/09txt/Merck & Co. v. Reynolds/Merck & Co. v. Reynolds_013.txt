made successful and secure.” Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall.
342, 349 (1875). Accordingly, “where a plaintiff has been
injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without
any fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar
of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is
discovered.” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397
(1946) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis
added). And for more than a century, courts have under
stood that “[f]raud is deemed to be discovered . . . when, in
the exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been
discovered.” 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions §276b(11),
p. 1402 (4th ed. 1916); see id., at 1401–1403, and nn. 74–
84 (collecting cases and statutes); see, e.g., Holmberg,
supra, at 397; Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern
R. Co., 120 U. S. 130, 138 (1887) (The rule “regard[s] the
cause of action as having accrued at the time the fraud
was or should have been discovered”).
More recently, both state and federal courts have ap
plied forms of the “discovery rule” to claims other than
fraud. See 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions §§11.1.2.1,
11.1.2.3, pp. 136–142, and nn. 6–13, 18–23 (1991 and 1993
Supp.) (hereinafter Corman) (collecting cases); see, e.g.,
United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111 (1979). Legisla
tures have codified the discovery rule in various contexts.
2 Corman §11.2, at 170–171, and nn. 1–9 (collecting stat
utes); see, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §2409a(g) (actions to quiet title
against the United States). In doing so, legislators have
written the word “discovery” directly into the statute. And
when they have done so, state and federal courts have
typically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual
discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a
reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g., Pea
cock v. Barnes, 142 N. C. 215, 217–220, 55 S. E. 99, 100
(1906); Davis v. Hibernia Sav. & Loan Soc., 21 Cal. App.
444, 448, 132 P. 462, 464 (1913); Roether v. National
Union Fire Ins. Co., 51 N. D. 634, 640–642, 200 N. W. 818,
