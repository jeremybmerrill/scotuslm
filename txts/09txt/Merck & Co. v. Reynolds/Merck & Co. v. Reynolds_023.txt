Opinion of the Court

together, reveal “facts” indicating scienter. Regardless of
which, if any, of the events following November 6, 2001,
constituted “discovery,” we need only conclude that prior
to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and
Merck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff
would have discovered, “the facts constituting the viola
tion.” In light of our interpretation of the statute, our
holdings in respect to scienter, and our application of
those holdings to the circumstances of this case, we must,
and we do, reach that conclusion. Thus, the plaintiffs’ suit
is timely. We need not—and do not—pass upon the Court
of Appeals’ suggestion that the November 2003 Brigham
and Women’s study might have triggered the statute of
limitations. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
