violation.”
28 U. S. C. §1658(b)(1) (emphasis added).
Scienter is assuredly a “fact.” In a §10(b) action, scienter
refers to “a mental state embracing intent to deceive,
manipulate, or defraud.” Ernst & Ernst, 425 U. S., at 194,
n. 12. And the “ ‘state of a man’s mind is as much a fact as
the state of his digestion.’ ” Postal Service Bd. of Gover
nors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716 (1983) (quoting Edging
ton v. Fitzmaurice, [1885] 29 Ch. Div. 459, 483).
And this “fact” of scienter “constitut[es]” an important
and necessary element of a §10(b) “violation.” A plaintiff
cannot recover without proving that a defendant made a
material misstatement with an intent to deceive—not
merely innocently or negligently. See Tellabs, Inc. v.
Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319 (2007);
Ernst & Ernst, supra. Indeed, Congress has enacted
special heightened pleading requirements for the scienter
element of §10(b) fraud cases. See 15 U. S. C. §78u–4(b)(2)
(requiring plaintiffs to “state with particularity facts
giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted
with the required state of mind” (emphasis added)). As a
result, unless a §10(b) plaintiff can set forth facts in the
complaint showing that it is “at least as likely as” not that the
defendant acted with the relevant knowledge or intent, the
claim will fail. Tellabs, supra, at 328 (emphasis deleted). It
would therefore frustrate the very purpose of the discovery
rule in this provision—which, after all, specifically applies
only in cases “involv[ing] a claim of fraud, deceit, manipu
lation, or contrivance,” §1658(b)—if the limitations period
began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had discov
ered any facts suggesting scienter. So long as a defendant
concealed for two years that he made a misstatement with
an intent to deceive, the limitations period would expire
before the plaintiff had actually “discover[ed]” the fraud.
We consequently hold that facts showing scienter are
among those that “constitut[e] the violation.” In so hold
ing, we say nothing about other facts necessary to support
