MERCK & CO., INC., ET AL., PETITIONERS v. RICHARD
REYNOLDS ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[April 27, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
Private suits under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b), must be brought within
“(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the
violation” or “(2) 5 years after such violation,” whichever
comes first. 28 U. S. C. §1658(b)(1). I agree with the
Court that scienter is among the “facts constituting the
violation” that a plaintiff must “discove[r]” for the limita

marks omitted). I also agree that respondents’ suit is
timely, but for a reason different from the Court’s: Merck
has not shown that respondents actually “discover[ed]”
scienter more than two years before bringing suit.
In ordinary usage, “discovery” occurs when one actually
learns something new. See Webster’s New International
Dictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1957)
(defining “discovery” as “[f]inding out or ascertaining
something previously unknown or unrecognized”). As the
Court notes, however, ante, at 8–10, in the context of
statutes of limitations “discovery” has long carried an
additional meaning: It also occurs when a plaintiff, exer
cising reasonable diligence, should have discovered the
facts giving rise to his claim. See, e.g., Wood v. Carpenter,
101 U. S. 135, 140–142 (1879); 2 H. Wood, Limitations of
