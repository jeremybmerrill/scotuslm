MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS
Opinion of the Court

821 (1924); Goldenberg v. Bache & Co., 270 F. 2d 675, 681
(CA5 1959); Mobley v. Hall, 202 Mont. 227, 232, 657 P. 2d
604, 606 (1983); Tregenza v. Great American Communica
tions Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721–722 (CA7 1993); J. Geils Band
Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76
F. 3d 1245, 1254 (CA1 1996).
Thus, treatise writers now describe “the discovery rule”
as allowing a claim “to accrue when the litigant first
knows or with due diligence should know facts that will
form the basis for an action.” 2 Corman §11.1.1, at 134
(emphasis added); see also ibid., n. 1 (collecting cases); 37
Am. Jur. 2d, Fraud and Deceit §347, p. 354 (2001 and
Supp. 2009) (noting that the various formulations of “dis
covery” all provide that “in addition to actual knowledge of
the fraud, once a reasonably diligent party is in a position
that they should have sufficient knowledge or information
to have actually discovered the fraud, they are charged
with discovery”); id., at 354–355, and nn. 2–11 (collecting
cases).
Like the parties, we believe that Congress intended
courts to interpret the word “discovery” in §1658(b)(1)
similarly. Before Congress enacted that statute, this
Court, having found in the federal securities laws the
existence of an implied private §10(b) action, determined
its governing limitations period by looking to other limita
tions periods in the federal securities laws. Lampf, Pleva,
Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350
(1991). Noting the existence of various formulations
“differ[ing] slightly in terminology,” the Court chose the
language in 15 U. S. C. §78i(e), the statutory provision
that governs securities price manipulation claims. 501
U. S., at 364, n. 9. And in doing so, the Court said that
private §10(b) actions “must be commenced within one
year after the discovery of the facts constituting the viola
tion and within three years after such violation.” Id., at
364 (emphasis added). (The Court listed among the vari
