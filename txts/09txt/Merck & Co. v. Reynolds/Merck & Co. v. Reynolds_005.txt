MERCK & CO., INC., ET AL., PETITIONERS v. RICHARD
REYNOLDS ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[April 27, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the timeliness of a complaint filed in
a private securities fraud action. The complaint was
timely if filed no more than two years after the plaintiffs
“discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation.” 28
U. S. C. §1658(b)(1). Construing this limitations statute
for the first time, we hold that a cause of action accrues (1)
when the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a rea
sonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, “the facts
constituting the violation”—whichever comes first. We
also hold that the “facts constituting the violation” include
the fact of scienter, “a mental state embracing intent to
deceive, manipulate, or defraud,” Ernst & Ernst v.
Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976). Applying this
standard, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ determination
that the complaint filed here was timely.

The action before us involves a claim by a group of inves

ingly misrepresented the risks of heart attacks accompany
