MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

Actions §276b(11)–(13), pp. 1401–1408 (4th ed. 1916);
Dawson, Undiscovered Fraud and Statutes of Limitation,
31 Mich. L. Rev. 591, 619, and n. 77 (1933). Read in isola
tion, “discovery” in §1658(b)(1) might mean constructive
discovery.
In context, however, I do not believe it can. Section 13
of the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, explicitly estab
lished a constructive-discovery rule for claims under §§11
and 12 of that Act:
“No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability
created under section 77k or 77l(a)(2) of this title
unless brought within one year after the discovery of
the untrue statement or the omission, or after such
discovery should have been made by the exercise of
reasonable diligence . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §77m.
“[D]iscovery” in §77m obviously cannot mean constructive
discovery, since that would render superfluous the phrase
“or after such discovery should have been made by the
exercise of reasonable diligence.” Ibid. With §77m al
ready on the books, Congress added limitations periods in
the 1934 Act, 15 U. S. C. §§78i(e), 78r(c), that did not
contain similar qualifying language; instead, each estab
lished a time bar that runs from “discovery” simpliciter.
When Congress enacted §1658(b)(1) in 2002, establishing
a limitations period for private actions for “fraud, deceit,
manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula
tory requirement concerning the securities laws,” specifi
cally including the 1933 and 1934 Acts, see 15 U. S. C.
§78c(a)(47), it likewise included no constructive-discovery
caveat. To interpret §1658(b)(1) as imposing a construc
tive-discovery standard, one must therefore assume, con
trary to common sense, that the same word means two
very different things in the same statutory context of
limitations periods for securities-fraud actions under the
1933 and 1934 Acts.
