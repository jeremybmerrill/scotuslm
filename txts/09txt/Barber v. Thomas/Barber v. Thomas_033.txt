KENNEDY, J., dissenting

Fed. Reg. 50786 (1997) (explanation to interim rule assert
ing that the correct methodology “had been clearly stated
by statute since the implementation of the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984”). For example, at no point did BOP
consider, much less consciously reject, the interpretation
outlined here. Cf. Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 60–61
(1995) (deferring to BOP’s reasoned decision to reject one
interpretation in favor of another). An agency need not
consider all possible alternatives. But deference is not
owed to an agency view, however consistently held, that
from the start has been premised on legal error. See
Mead, supra, at 228; Skidmore, supra, at 140.

The straightforward interpretation urged here accords
with the purpose of the statute, which is to give prisoners
incentive for good behavior and dignity from its promised
reward. Prisoners can add 54 days to each year. And
when they do so, they have something tangible. In place
of that simple calculation, of clear meaning, of a calendar
that can be marked, the Court insists on something differ
ent. It advocates an interpretation that uses different
definitions for the same phrase in the same sentence;
denies prisoners the benefit of the rule of lenity; and caps
off its decision with an appendix that contains an alge
braic formula to hang on a cell wall.
To a prisoner, time behind bars is not some theoreti
cal or mathematical concept. It is something real, even
terrifying. Survival itself may be at stake. See Dept.
