credit for that time served. The prisoner’s total good time
is 470 days (432 + 38 = 470). His total time served is 3180
days.
As a final matter, while we have described the foregoing
as the method to calculate credit for the portion of the last
year to more transparently track the relevant statutory
language, we note that the mathematical formula can be
used to calculate the amount of maximum available credit
for an entire sentence. Using the equations supplied
above, if we divide the total number of days in a sentence
by 1.148, we get the minimum number of days that a
defendant must serve in that sentence. If we then sub
tract the number of days served from the total number of
days in the sentence, we arrive at the maximum number
of good time credit days the prisoner can earn. The stat
ute, however, awards them on a yearly basis (but for the
“last year or portion” thereof).
