MICHAEL GARY BARBER, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.
J. E. THOMAS, WARDEN
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 7, 2010]


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Federal sentencing law permits federal prison authori
ties to award prisoners credit against prison time as a
reward for good behavior. 18 U. S. C. §3624(b). Petition
ers, two federal prisoners, challenge the method that the
Federal Bureau of Prisons uses for calculating this “good
time credit.” We conclude that the Bureau’s method re
flects the most natural reading of the statute, and we
reject petitioners’ legal challenge.
I

A

A federal sentencing statute provides: 

“[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of
more than 1 year . . . may receive credit toward the
service of the prisoner’s sentence, beyond the time
served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the
prisoner’s term of imprisonment, beginning at the end
of the first year of the term . . . . [C]redit for the last
year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment
shall be prorated and credited within the last six
weeks of the sentence.” §3624(b)(1).
