Opinion of the Court

need another 311 days behind bars before the second year
of his term of imprisonment is at an end”). And if it does
not, then the situation quickly becomes complicated.
What happens if, say, on the last day of the 10th “adminis
trative segmen[t]” (somewhere in the 8th calendar year), a
prisoner badly misbehaves and prison officials punish him
by taking away all of his previously earned credit? Cf. 28
CFR §541.13 (2009) (prescribing sanctions for prohibited
acts). Does the BOP retroactively adjust the duration of
all of his administrative segments to 365 days so that the
prisoner now finds himself in the middle of the 8th “ad
ministrative segmen[t]”? (Again we do not know if the
BOP would find such a system administrable, and we
doubt that this system would be more comprehensible to a
prisoner.) If so, does the prisoner have a second opportu
nity to earn credit for good behavior for the 9th “adminis
trative segmen[t]” that he had previously completed but
now must account for again? Cf. §3624(b)(1) (“Credit that
has not been earned may not later be granted”). Or, hav
ing previously awarded (and taken away) credit for that
segment, are prison authorities left without any incentive
to offer for good behavior?
Finally, the dissent, like petitioners, invokes the rule of
lenity to support its interpretation. But, the best efforts of
the dissent notwithstanding, we still see no “grievous
ambiguity or uncertainty” that would trigger the rule’s
application. We remain convinced that the BOP’s ap
proach reflects the most natural reading of the statutory
language and the most consistent with its purpose. What
ever the merits of the dissent’s policy arguments, the
statute does not require the BOP to accept them.
For all of these reasons, we conclude that the BOP’s
methodology is lawful. The Ninth Circuit’s judgment is
Affirmed.
