(while “Guideline sentences in many instances will ap
proximate existing [i.e., pre-Guidelines] practice,” the
Commission did “not conside[r] itself bound by existing
sentencing practice” (emphasis added)). Because the
Commission has expressed no view on the question before
us, we need not decide whether it would be entitled to
deference had it done so. If it turns out that the calcula
tion of good time credit based on prison time served rather
than the sentence imposed produces results that are more
severe than the Commission finds appropriate, the Com
mission remains free to adjust sentencing levels accord
ingly. See id., §1A2, at 1.2 (acknowledging that “the
guideline-writing process is evolutionary” and that the
Commission functions “as a permanent agency to monitor
sentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the
nation”).
Fourth, petitioners ask us to invoke the rule of lenity
and construe §3624 (2006 ed.) in their favor, that is, in a
way that will maximize the amount of available good time
credit. We may assume for present purposes that §3624(b)
can be construed as imposing a criminal penalty. See
Bifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (rule of
lenity applies to “interpretations of . . . the penalties”
imposed by “criminal prohibitions”); but see Sash v. Zenk,
428 F. 3d 132, 134 (CA2 2005) (Sotomayor, J.) (holding
that §3624(b) is not a criminal statute for the purposes of
the rule of lenity). Even so, the rule of lenity only applies
if, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose,
there remains a “grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the
statute,” Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139
(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that the
Court must simply “ ‘guess as to what Congress intended.’ ”
