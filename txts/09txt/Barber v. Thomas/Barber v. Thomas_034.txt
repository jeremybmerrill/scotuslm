BARBER v. THOMAS
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

port, p. 4 (June 2009) (citing a national survey estimating
that 60,500 state and federal prisoners had been sexually
abused during the preceding year). To this time, the
Court adds daysâ€”compounded to years. We should not
embrace this harsh result where Congress itself has not
done so in clear terms. I would reverse the judgment of
the Court of Appeals.
