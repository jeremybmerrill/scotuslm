BARBER v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13); United States v.
R. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305–306 (1992) (plurality opinion).
Having so considered the statute, we do not believe that
there remains a “grievous ambiguity or uncertainty” in the
statutory provision before us. Nor need we now simply
“guess” what the statute means.
Finally, we note that petitioners urge us not to defer to
the BOP’s implementation of §3624(b). In our view, the
BOP’s calculation system applies that statute as its lan
guage is most naturally read, and in accordance with what
that language makes clear is its basic purpose. No one
doubts that the BOP has the legal power to implement the
statute in accordance with its language and purposes;
hence we need not determine the extent to which Congress
has granted the BOP authority to interpret the statute
more broadly, or differently than it has done here. Cf.
Chevron, supra, at 844–845.

Acknowledging that petitioners’ arguments cannot carry
the day, the dissent has proposed a “third possibility,”
post, at 2 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), not raised by either
party nor, to our knowledge, used elsewhere in the Crimi
nal Code. The dissent reads the statutory phrase “term of
imprisonment” to refer to “the administrative period along
which progress toward eventual freedom is marked.” Post,
at 3. It derives from this reading the following method of
calculation as applied to our 10-year example. First, “[t]he
sentence is divided into 10 365-day segments.” Ibid. At
the end of the first segment, a prisoner may receive up to
54 days of credit for good behavior. These credits immedi
ately “go toward completion of the next year” so that the
prisoner need only serve “another 311 days behind bars
before the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an
end.” Ibid. This process repeats itself until the “10th
segment,” in which a prisoner receives an unspecified
