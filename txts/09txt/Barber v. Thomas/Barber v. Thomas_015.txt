BARBER v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

onment does not necessarily mean that the offender will
serve the entire 30 months in prison), the Commission
adjusted the average time served “by dividing by 0.85 good
time when the term exceeded 12 months.” Ibid. This
adjustment, the Commission explained, “made sentences
in the [t]able comparable with those in the guidelines.”
Ibid.
Pointing to this adjustment and a reference in later
editions of the Guidelines to a potential credit of “ap
proximately fifteen percent for good behavior,” see, e.g.,
USSG §1A3, p. s., at 3 (Nov. 2009), petitioners maintain
that the Commission set its Guideline ranges with the
expectation that well-behaved prisoners would receive
good time credit of up to 15% of the sentence imposed, not
15% of the time actually served. They add that, in setting
the Guidelines ranges in this way, the Commission exer
cised congressionally delegated power to interpret the
Sentencing Reform Act, see Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 371–
379 (approving Congress’ delegation of the power to prom
ulgate sentencing guidelines), and that as long as that
interpretation is reasonable, courts must defer to it. See
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun
cil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844 (1984).
Again, however, we can find no indication that the
Commission, in writing its Supplementary Report or in
the Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the
particular question here before us, that is whether good
time credit is to be based on time served or the sentence
imposed. The Guidelines Manual itself, a more authorita
tive account of the Commission’s interpretive views than
the Supplementary Report, says nothing directly on that
subject. Moreover, with respect to comparisons between
Guidelines sentences and pre-Guidelines practice, the
original 1987 Manual cautioned that the Guidelines did
not “simply cop[y] estimates of existing practice as re
vealed by the data,” but rather “departed from the data at
