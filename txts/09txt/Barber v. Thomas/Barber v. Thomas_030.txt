BARBER v. THOMAS
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

haves.
Finally, the Court speculates that BOP might find the
above approach difficult to administer. The Court identi
fies no basis for this claim, nor does one exist. The infor
mation used to calculate a prisoner’s term under the above
approach is the same as it is under the Court’s approach.
True, a prisoner may become eligible to be awarded credit
on different calendar days during the course of his term.
But under the Court’s approach, this also happens when
awarding credit in the final year. And, it goes without
saying, federal prisoners begin their incarceration on
different calendar days anyway, so that under any ap
proach, BOP will be forced to evaluate prisoners through
out the calendar year.

The Court’s reading of §3624(b)(1), therefore, is less
consistent with the text than the reading explained above.
But even if these interpretations were in equipoise, under
any fair application the rule of lenity should tip the bal
ance in petitioners’ favor. When a penal statute is suscep
tible of two interpretations, the one more favorable to the
defendant must be chosen unless “text, structure, and
history . . . establish that the [harsher] position is unam
biguously correct.” United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.
39, 54 (1994). Resolving ambiguity in favor of lenity en
sures that statutes provide “fair warning[,] . . . in language
that the common world will understand, of what the law
intends to do if a certain line is passed.” United States v.
Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (internal quotation marks
omitted). The rule thus applies “not only to interpreta
tions of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but
also to the penalties they impose.” Bifulco v. United
States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980).
The Court assumes without deciding that §3624(b) is
penal in nature. See ante, at 13. No assumption is neces
