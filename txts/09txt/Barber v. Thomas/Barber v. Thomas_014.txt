Opinion of the Court

lators that describe good time credit as providing sentence
reductions of 15%. See Brief for Petitioners 34–36 (citing,
e.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98–1159, p. 415 (1984); 131
Cong. Rec. 488 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Hamilton)). But
there is nothing in the context of these statements to
suggest that they amounted to anything other than rough
approximations or that they were made with the present
controversy in mind. See, e.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98–
1159, at 415 (noting simply that an increase in the amount
of maximum annual credit from 36 days to 54 days “in

Hamilton) (“Under [pre-Sentencing Reform Act] law, about
80% of all criminals are paroled after serving one third of
their time. Now sentences will be reduced only 15% for
good behavior”). And whatever interpretive force one
attaches to legislative history, the Court normally gives
little weight to statements, such as those of the individual
legislators, made after the bill in question has become law.
See, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 298 (1995).
Third, petitioners rely on a statement in the United
States Sentencing Commission’s Supplementary Report on
the Initial Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements
issued in 1987 (hereinafter Supplementary Report). In
that Report, the Commission summarized its analysis of
recent pre-Guidelines sentencing practice, which it had
used to help draft the Guidelines. The results of the
analysis were presented in a table that permits compari
son of the likely prison-time consequences of the new
Guidelines with prison time actually served under preGuidelines practice (specifically, by identifying the Guide
lines “offense level that is closest to the average time . . .
served by first-time offenders” convicted of a particular
crime, Supplementary Report 23). Because the Guidelines
“refer to sentences prior to the awarding of good time” (i.e.,
because a Guidelines sentence of, say, 30 months’ impris
