Opinion of the Court

For another thing, the BOP’s method better furthers the
statute’s basic purpose. The “good time” provision in
§3624 is part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98
Stat. 1987, 18 U. S. C. §3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. §§991–
998, a comprehensive law that reformed federal sentenc
ing practice and directed the newly created United States
Sentencing Commission “to devise guidelines to be used
for sentencing” in district courts, Mistretta v. United
States, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989). Under the previous
regime, the United States Parole Commission, “as a gen
eral rule, [could] conditionally release a prisoner any time
after he serve[d] one-third of the judicially fixed term.”
United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 47 (1978). If, for
example, a judge imposed a prison term of 15 years, the
Parole Commission might have released the prisoner after
only 5 years. And it routinely did so. See United States
Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §1A3, p. s., p.
1.2 (Oct. 1987) (USSG) (“[D]efendants often serv[ed] only
about one-third of the sentence handed down by the
court”). The result was “confusion and implicit deception.”
Ibid. With the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress sought to
achieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater
honesty by “mak[ing] all sentences basically determinate,”
Mistretta, supra, at 367. See USSG §1A3, p. s., at 1.2
(statutory objectives included “honesty in sentencing,”
“uniformity,” and “proportionality” (emphasis deleted)).
Thereafter, the sentence the judge imposed would be the
sentence the offender actually served, with a sole statutory
exception for good time credits. Mistretta, supra, at 367 (a
“prisoner is to be released at the completion of his sen
tence reduced only by any credit earned by good behavior
while in custody” (citing §3624(b)). The reason for this
exception is provided in §3624(b) itself: to provide an
incentive for prisoners to “compl[y] with institutional
disciplinary regulations.” The good time exception is
limited (to 54 days per year) and tailored to its purpose—
