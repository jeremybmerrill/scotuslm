BARBER v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

proach with the statute. Their system awards credit for
the sentence imposed, regardless of how much time is
actually served. Thus, a prisoner under petitioners’ sys
tem could receive 54 days of credit for Year 10 despite the
fact that he would be released after less than 81⁄2 years in
prison. The good time calculation for Year 10 would not be
made “at the end of” Year 10 (nor within the last six weeks
of a sentence ending during that year). Neither could the
BOP determine whether the prisoner had behaved in
exemplary fashion “during that year.” 18 U. S. C. §3624(b)
(emphasis added); see also White v. Scibana, 390 F. 3d
997, 1001 (CA7 2004) (“The Bureau cannot evaluate a
prisoner’s behavior and award credit for good conduct if
the prisoner is not still in prison”); cf. McGinnis v. Royster,
410 U. S. 263, 273 (1973) (“Where there is no evaluation
by state officials and little or no rehabilitative participa
tion for anyone to evaluate, there is a rational justification
for declining to give good-time credit”).
We cannot say that this language (“at the end of,” “dur
ing that year”) found its way into the statute by accident.
Under the previous good time provision, a prisoner was
“entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence
beginning with the day on which the sentence commences
to run.” 18 U. S. C. §4161 (1982 ed.) (repealed 1984). This
deduction, granted at the outset of a prisoner’s sentence,
was then made subject to forfeiture if the prisoner “com
mit[ted] any offense or violate[d] the rules of the institu
tion.” §4165 (repealed 1984). The present statute, §3624
(2006 ed.), in contrast, creates a system under which
“credit” is “earned” “at the end of” the year based on an
evaluation of behavior “during that year.” We agree with
the Government that “[t]he textual differences between
the two statutes reveal a purpose to move from a system of
prospective entitlement to a system of retrospective
award.” Brief for Respondent 33; see also White, supra, at
1002, n. 3.
