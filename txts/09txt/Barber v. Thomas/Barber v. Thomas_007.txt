BARBER v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

rest. The result is that if the prisoner serves 260 days, he
can earn an additional 38 days of credit for good behavior.
That is to say, of the 298 days remaining in his sentence,
the prisoner will have to serve 260 days in confinement,
after which point, his sentence will be fully accounted for
(given the additional 38 days’ credit earned), and he will
be released. In sum, a prisoner subject to a 10-year
(3,650-day) sentence who earns the maximum number of
days the statute permits will serve 3,180 days in confine
ment and receive 470 days of “good time” credit, about
15% of the prison time actually served.

In this case petitioners claim that the BOP’s calculation
method is unlawful. They say that §3624(b)(1) (2006 ed.)
requires a straightforward calculation based upon the
length of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing
judge imposes, not the length of time that the prisoner
actually serves. Thus, if a sentencing judge imposes a
prison term of 10 years (as in our example), then, in peti
tioners’ view, the statute permits a maximum good time
award of 540 days (10 years times 54 days), not the 470
days that the method described above would allow. And if
the judge imposes a prison term of 10 years and 6 months,
then the statute permits 567 days (540 days for the 10
years plus 27 days for the extra 6 months), not the 494
days that the method above would allow. According to
petitioners, the BOP’s method causes model prisoners to
lose seven days of good time credit per year of imprison
ment, and because their sentences are fairly long (one,
Michael Barber, was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months;
the other, Tahir Jihad-Black, was sentenced to 21 years
and 10 months), the difference in their cases amounts to
several months of additional prison time.
The District Court in each of these cases rejected the
prisoner’s challenge. Civ. No. 08–226 MO (D Ore., Oct. 27,
