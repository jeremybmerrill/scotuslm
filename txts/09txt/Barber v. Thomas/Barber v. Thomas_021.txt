BARBER v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court
Appendix to opinion of the Court

APPENDIX
A fuller example of the BOP’s method for calculat
ing “credit for the last year or portion of a year of
the term of imprisonment”
The defendant is sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.
As a prisoner he exhibits exemplary behavior and is
awarded the maximum credit of 54 days at the end of each
year served in prison. At the end of Year 8, the prisoner
has 2 years remaining in his sentence and has accumu
lated 432 days of good time credit. Because the difference
between the time remaining in his sentence and the
amount of accumulated credit (i.e., 730 - 432) is less than a
year (298 days), Year 9 is the last year he will spend in
prison. (Year 10 has been completely offset by 365 of the
432 days of accumulated credit.) Further, Year 9 will be a
partial year of 298 days (the other 67 days of the year
being offset by the remainder of the accumulated credit).
Here is where the elementary algebra comes in. We
know that x, the good time, plus y, the remaining time
served, must add up to 298. This gives us our first equa
tion: x + y = 298.
We also know that the ratio of good time earned in the
portion of the final year to the amount of time served in
that year must equal the ratio of a full year’s good time
credit to the amount of time served in a full year. The
latter ratio is 54/365 or .148. Thus, we know that
x/y = .148, or to put it another way, x = .148y. Because we
know the value of x in terms of y, we can make a substitu
tion in our first equation to get .148y + y = 298. We then
add the two y terms together (1.148y = 298), and we solve
for y, which gives us y = 260. Now we can plug that value
into our first equation to solve for x (the good time credit).
If we subtract 260 from 298, we find that x = 38.
The offender will have to serve 260 days in prison in
Year 9, and he will receive 38 days additional good time
