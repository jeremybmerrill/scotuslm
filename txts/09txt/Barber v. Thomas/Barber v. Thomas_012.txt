than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the pris
oner’s life.” Ibid. (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The
words “term of imprisonment” in this phrase almost cer
tainly refer to the sentence imposed, not to the time actu
ally served (otherwise prisoners sentenced to a year and a
day would become ineligible for credit as soon as they
earned it). And, as petitioners emphasize, we have recog
nized a “presumption that a given term is used to mean
the same thing throughout a statute,” Brown v. Gardner,
513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).
The problem for petitioners, however, is that this pre
sumption is not absolute. It yields readily to indications
that the same phrase used in different parts of the same
statute means different things, particularly where the
phrase is one that speakers can easily use in different
ways without risk of confusion. Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers,
Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932); General
Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595–
596 (2004). See, e.g., id., at 596–597 (“age” has different
meanings in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of
1967); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,
532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001) (same for “ ‘wages paid’ ” in the
Internal Revenue Code); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519
U. S. 337, 343–344 (1997) (same for “employee” in Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).
The phrase “term of imprisonment” is just such a
phrase. It can refer to the sentence that the judge im
poses, see, e.g., §3624(a) (“A prisoner shall be released” at
the end of “the prisoner’s term of imprisonment, less any
time credited” for good behavior), but it also can refer to
the time that the prisoner actually serves. Thus, §3624(d)
of the statute before us requires BOP to “furnish [a] pris
oner with . . . suitable clothing[,] . . . money, . . . and . . .
transportation” “[u]pon the release of [the] prisoner on the
expiration of the prisoner’s term of imprisonment.” (Em
phasis added.) The statute here means to assure that the
