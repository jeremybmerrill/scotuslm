Opinion of the Court

again put the 108 days’ credit to the side. By the end of
Year 8, the prisoner would have earned a total of 432 days
of good time credit (8 years times 54 days). At that time,
the good time calculator would note that the difference
between the time remaining in the sentence (2 years, or
730 days) and the amount of accumulated good time credit
(432 days) is less than 1 year (730 minus 432 equals 298
days, which is less than 365). The 432 days of good time
credit that the prisoner has earned by the end of Year 8
are sufficient to wipe out all of the last year of the 10-year
prison term and to shorten the prisoner’s 9th year of im
prisonment by 67 days.
Year 9 of the sentence will consequently become the
prisoner’s last year of imprisonment. Further, because the
prisoner has already earned 67 days of credit against that
year (432 days already earned minus 365 days applied to
Year 10 leaves 67 days to apply to Year 9), the prisoner
will have no more than 298 days left to serve in Year 9.
Now the good time calculator will have to work out just
how much good time the prisoner can earn, and credit
against, these remaining 298 days.
As we said, the statute provides that “good time” for this
“last year or portion” thereof shall be “prorated.” Thus,
the good time calculator must divide the 298 days into two
parts: (1) days that the prisoner will have to serve in
prison, and (2) credit for good behavior the prisoner will
earn during the days served in Year 9. In other words, the
number of days to be served in Year 9 plus the number of
good time credit days earned will be equal to the number
of days left in the sentence, namely, 298. And to keep the
award of credit in the last year proportional to awards in
other years, the ratio of these two parts of Year 9 (i.e., the
number of good time days divided by the number of days
served) must be 54/365, the same ratio that the BOP
applies to full years served. We can use some elementary
algebra, described in the Appendix, infra, to work out the
