BARBER v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance
with institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby
rewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good
behavior.
The BOP’s approach furthers the objective of §3624. It
ties the award of good time credits directly to good behav
ior during the preceding year of imprisonment. By con
trast, petitioners’ approach, insofar is it would award up to
54 days per year of time sentenced as opposed to time
served, allows a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion
of his sentence that he serves and the portion of his sen
tence that he offsets with earned good time credit. In
other words, petitioners argue that the BOP should award
good time credit not only for the days a prisoner spends in
prison and behaves appropriately, but also for days that
he will not spend in prison at all, such as Year 10 in our
example. By doing so, it loosens the statute’s connection
between good behavior and the award of good time and
transforms the nature of the exception to the basic sen
tence-imposed-is-sentence-served rule. And to that extent,
it is inconsistent with the statute’s basic purpose.

A

We are not convinced by petitioners’ several arguments
against the BOP’s methodology. First, petitioners point to
the statement in §3624(b) that a prisoner “may receive
credit . . . at the end of each year of the prisoner’s term of
imprisonment.” (Emphasis added.) The words “term of
imprisonment,” they say, must refer to the years of the
term that the sentencing judge imposed (10 years in our
example), not the (less-than-10) years of the term that the
prisoner actually served once good time credits were taken
into account. After all, the very first phrase of that provi
sion makes eligible for good time credits “a prisoner who is
serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year other
