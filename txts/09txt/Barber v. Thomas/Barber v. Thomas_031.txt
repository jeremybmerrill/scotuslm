KENNEDY, J., dissenting

sary: The statutory provision awarding good time credits
“in fact is one determinant of [a] prison term,” so that a
prisoner’s “effective sentence is altered once this determi
nant is changed.” Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 32
(1981). In Weaver, the Court considered whether an
amendment to Florida’s statutory formula for calculating
good time credits implicated the Ex Post Facto Clause.
The Court concluded that it did, as the new statute “sub
stantially alter[ed] the consequences attached to a crime
already completed, and therefore change[d] ‘the quantum
of punishment.’ ” Id., at 33 (quoting Dobbert v. Florida,
432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977)). For the same reason, the penal
effect of §3624(b)(1) is substantial enough to implicate the
rule of lenity. We should not disadvantage almost 200,000
federal prisoners unless Congress clearly warned them
they would face that harsh result.

The Government—although not the Court—argues that
we should embrace its interpretation out of deference to
BOP. BOP has been charged by the Attorney General
with responsibility for “[a]pproving inmate disciplinary
and good time regulations.” 28 CFR §0.96(s) (2009). BOP
has long followed the same credit-calculation method now
advocated by the Court. The Government argues that we
should defer to BOP’s choice as a permissible exercise of
its delegated responsibility.
This argument fails on multiple levels. There is no
indication that BOP has exercised the sort of interpretive
authority that would merit deference under Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837 (1984). The statute does not create a legis
lative gap for BOP to fill. To the contrary, the procedures
that govern the timing of credit awards are spelled out in
great detail. Cf. Lopez v. Davis, 531 U. S. 230, 241–242
(2001) (where statute says that BOP “may” grant early
