GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS
Opinion of the Court

The Court of Appeals’ contrary conclusion does not find
support in the text of §20. The Court of Appeals’ only
effort to grapple with that text misses the point because it
focuses on whether Granite Rock’s claim to enforce the
CBA’s no-strike provisions could be characterized as “aris
ing under” the agreement. See 546 F. 3d, at 1177, n. 4.
Even assuming that claim can be characterized as “arising
under” the CBA, it is not the issue here. The issue is
whether the formation-date defense that Local raised in
response to Granite Rock’s no-strike suit can be character
ized as “arising under” the CBA. It cannot for the reasons
we have explained, namely, the CBA provision requiring
arbitration of disputes “arising under” the CBA is not
fairly read to include a dispute about when the CBA came
into existence. The Court of Appeals erred in failing to
address this question and holding instead that the arbitra
tion clause is “susceptible of an interpretation” that covers
Local’s formation-date defense to Granite Rock’s suit
“[b]ecause Granite Rock is suing ‘under’ the alleged new
CBA” and “[a]rbitration clauses are to be construed very
broadly.” Ibid.; see also id., at 1178.

Local’s remaining argument in support of the Court of
Appeals’ judgment is similarly unavailing. Local reiter
ates the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that Granite Rock
“implicitly” consented to arbitration when it sued to en
force the CBA’s no-strike and arbitrable grievance provi
sions. See Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 17–18. We do
not agree that by seeking an injunction against the strike
so the parties could arbitrate the labor grievance that gave
rise to it, Granite Rock also consented to arbitrate the
ratification (formation) date dispute we address above.
See 564 F. 3d, at 1178. It is of course true that when
Granite Rock sought that injunction it viewed the CBA
(and all of its provisions) as enforceable. But Granite
