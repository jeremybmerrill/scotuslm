GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS
Opinion of the Court

(holding that federal courts may enjoin a strike where a
CBA contemplates arbitration of the dispute that occa
sions the strike). The unions conceded that LMRA §301(a)
gave the District Court jurisdiction over the suit but op
posed Granite Rock’s complaint, asserting that the CBA
was not validly ratified on July 2 (or at any other time
relevant to the July 2004 strike) and, thus, its no-strike
clause did not provide a basis for Granite Rock’s claims
challenging the strike.
The District Court initially denied Granite Rock’s re
quest to enforce the CBA’s no-strike provision because
Granite Rock was unable to produce evidence that the
CBA was ratified on July 2. App. 203–213. Shortly after
the District Court ruled, however, a Local member testi
fied that Netto had put the new CBA to a ratification vote
on July 2, and that the voting Local members unani
mously approved the agreement. Based on this statement
and supporting testimony from 12 other employees, Gran
ite Rock moved for a new trial on its injunction and dam
ages claims.
On August 22, while that motion was pending, Local
conducted a second successful “ratification” vote on the
CBA, and on September 13, the day the District Court was
scheduled to hear Granite Rock’s motion, the unions called
off their strike. Although their return to work mooted
Granite Rock’s request for an injunction, the District
Court proceeded with the hearing and granted Granite
Rock a new trial on its damages claims. The parties pro
ceeded with discovery and Granite Rock amended its
complaint, which already alleged federal2 claims for
breach of the CBA against both Local and IBT, to add
federal inducement of breach and interference with con

2 This Court has recognized a federal common-law claim for breach of
a CBA under LMRA §301(a). See, e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills
of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 456 (1957).
