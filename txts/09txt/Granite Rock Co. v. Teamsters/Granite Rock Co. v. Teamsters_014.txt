Opinion of the Court

Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 445−446); 546 F. 3d, at 1177, and
n. 4 (explaining that it would treat the parties’ arbitration

Local contends that our precedents, particularly those

phasis added).7 Applying this principle, our precedents
hold that courts should order arbitration of a dispute only
where the court is satisfied that neither the formation of
the parties’ arbitration agreement nor (absent a valid
provision specifically committing such disputes to an
arbitrator) its enforceability or applicability to the dispute
is in issue. Ibid. Where a party contests either or both
matters, “the court” must resolve the disagreement. Ibid.
Local nonetheless interprets some of our opinions to
depart from this framework and to require arbitration of
