Opinion of the Court

from the contract in which it appears and enforce it ac
cording to its terms unless the party resisting arbitration
specifically challenges the enforceability of the arbitration
clause itself, see id., at 443−445 (citing 9 U. S. C. §2;
Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 4−5 (1984); Prima
Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395,
402−404 (1967)), or claims that the agreement to arbitrate
was “[n]ever concluded,” 546 U. S., at 444, n. 1; see also
Rent-A-Center, ante, at 6−7, and n. 2.
Our cases invoking the federal “policy favoring arbitra
tion” of commercial and labor disputes apply the same
framework. They recognize that, except where “the par
ties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,” AT&T
Technologies, 475 U. S., at 649, it is “the court’s duty to
interpret the agreement and to determine whether the
parties intended to arbitrate grievances concerning” a
particular matter, id., at 651. They then discharge this
duty by: (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability only
where a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agree
ment is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at
hand; and (2) adhering to the presumption and ordering
arbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted.
See id., at 651–652; Prima Paint Corp., supra, at 396–398;
Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U. S. 368, 374–377
(1974); Drake Bakeries Inc. v. Bakery Workers, 370 U. S.
254, 256–257 (1962); Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co.,
370 U. S. 238, 241–242 (1962); Steelworkers v. Warrior &
Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 576 (1960).8

8 That

our labor arbitration precedents apply this rule is hardly sur
prising. As noted above, see n. 6, supra, the rule is the foundation for
the arbitrability framework this Court announced in the Steelworkers
Trilogy. Local’s assertion that Warrior & Gulf suggests otherwise is
misplaced. Although Warrior & Gulf contains language that might in
isolation be misconstrued as establishing a presumption that labor
disputes are arbitrable whenever they are not expressly excluded from
an arbitration clause, 363 U. S., at 578–582, the opinion elsewhere
