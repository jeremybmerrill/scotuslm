Syllabus
e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 451. The
company says the remedy it seeks is necessary because other poten
tial avenues for deterrence and redress, such as state-law tort claims,
unfair labor practices claims before the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), and federal common-law breach-of-contract claims,
are either unavailable or insufficient. But Granite Rock has not yet
exhausted all of these avenues for relief, so this case does not provide
an opportunity to judge their efficacy. Accordingly, it would be pre
mature to recognize the cause of action Granite Rock seeks, even as
suming §301(a) authorizes this Court to do so. That is particularly
true here because the complained-of course of conduct has already
prompted judgments favorable to Granite Rock from the jury below
and from the NLRB in separate proceedings concerning the union’s
attempts to delay the new CBA’s ratification. Those proceedings, and
others to be conducted on remand, buttress the conclusion that Gran
ite Rock’s assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief
are questionable, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in declin
ing to recognize the new federal tort Granite Rock requests. Pp. 20–
25.
