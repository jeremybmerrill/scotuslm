Opinion of the Court

have we held that courts may use policy considerations as
a substitute for party agreement.
See, e.g., id., at
648−651; Volt, supra, at 478. We have applied the pre
sumption favoring arbitration, in FAA and in labor cases,
only where it reflects, and derives its legitimacy from, a
judicial conclusion that arbitration of a particular dispute
is what the parties intended because their express agree
ment to arbitrate was validly formed and (absent a provi
sion clearly and validly committing such issues to an
arbitrator) is legally enforceable and best construed to
encompass the dispute. See First Options, supra, at 944–
945 (citing Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 626); Howsam, 537
U. S., at 83–84; AT&T Technologies, supra, at 650 (citing
Warrior & Gulf, supra, at 582–583); Drake Bakeries, su
pra, at 259–260. This simple framework compels reversal
of the Court of Appeals’ judgment because it requires
judicial resolution of two questions central to Local’s
arbitration demand: when the CBA was formed, and
whether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local
wishes to arbitrate.
B
We begin by addressing the grounds on which the Court
of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision to decide
the parties’ ratification-date dispute, which the parties
characterize as a formation dispute because a union vote
ratifying the CBA’s terms was necessary to form the con
tract. See App. 351.9 For purposes of determining arbi
——————
9 The parties’ dispute about the CBA’s ratification date presents a
formation question in the sense above, and is therefore not on all fours
with, for example, the formation disputes we referenced in Buckeye
Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 444, n.1 (2006), which
concerned whether, not when, an agreement to arbitrate was “con
cluded.” That said, the manner in which the CBA’s ratification date
relates to Local’s arbitration demand makes the ratification-date
dispute in this case one that requires judicial resolution. See infra, at
14−19.
