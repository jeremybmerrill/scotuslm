GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

argument earlier, I do not see it as one we can ignore. The
question presented in this case presupposes that “it is
disputed whether any binding contract exists.” Brief for
Petitioner i. Because it is instead undisputed that the
parties executed a binding contract in December 2004 that
was effective as of May 2004, we can scarcely pretend that
the parties have a formation dispute. Consideration of
this fact is “a ‘predicate to an intelligent resolution’ of the
question presented, and therefore ‘fairly included
therein.’ ” Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (quot
ing Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258, n. 5 (1980); this
Court’s Rule 14.1(a)). Indeed, by declining to consider the
plain terms of the parties’ agreement, the majority offers
little more than “an opinion advising what the law would
be upon a hypothetical state of facts.” Aetna Life Ins. Co.
v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 241 (1937). In view of the
CBA’s effective date, I would hold that the parties agreed
to arbitrate the no-strike dispute, including Local 287’s
ratification-date defense, and I would affirm the judgment
below on this alternative ground. Cf. Dandridge v. Wil
liams, 397 U. S. 471, 475, n. 6 (1970) (“The prevailing
party may, of course, assert in a reviewing court any
ground in support of [the] judgment, whether or not that
ground was relied upon or even considered by the trial
court”).
