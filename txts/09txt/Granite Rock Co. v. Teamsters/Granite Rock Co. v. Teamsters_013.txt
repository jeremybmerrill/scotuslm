GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS
Opinion of the Court

ratification date was an issue for the court to decide. The
Court of Appeals agreed, holding that the District Court’s
refusal to send that dispute to arbitration violated two
principles of arbitrability set forth in our precedents. See
546 F. 3d, at 1177−1178. The first principle is that where,
as here, parties concede that they have agreed to arbitrate
some matters pursuant to an arbitration clause, the “law’s
permissive policies in respect to arbitration” counsel that
“ ‘ any doubts concerning the scope of arbitral issues should
be resolved in favor of arbitration.’ ” First Options, supra,
at 945 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler ChryslerPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 626 (1985)); see 546 F. 3d,
at 1177−1178 (citing this principle and the “national policy
favoring arbitration” in concluding that arbitration clauses
“are to be construed very broadly” (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted)). The second principle the
Court of Appeals invoked is that this presumption of
arbitrability applies even to disputes about the enforce
ability of the entire contract containing the arbitration
clause, because at least in cases governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq.,6 courts must
treat the arbitration clause as severable from the contract
in which it appears, and thus apply the clause to all dis
putes within its scope “ ‘[u]nless the [validity] challenge is
to the arbitration clause itself’ ” or the party “disputes the
——————
6 We, like the Court of Appeals, discuss precedents applying the FAA
because they employ the same rules of arbitrability that govern labor
cases. See, e.g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 650. Indeed, the rule
that arbitration is strictly a matter of consent—and thus that courts
must typically decide any questions concerning the formation or scope
of an arbitration agreement before ordering parties to comply with it—
is the cornerstone of the framework the Court announced in the Steel
workers Trilogy for deciding arbitrability disputes in LMRA cases. See
Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U. S. 564, 567−568 (1960);
Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582 (1960);
Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593, 597
(1960).
