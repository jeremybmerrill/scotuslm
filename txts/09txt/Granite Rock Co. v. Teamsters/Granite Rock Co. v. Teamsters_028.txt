Opinion of the Court

Local and IBT on the grounds that IBT did not disaffiliate
from the AFL–CIO until July 25, 2005).
These proceedings, and the proceedings that remain to
be conducted on remand, buttress our conclusion that
Granite Rock’s case for a new federal common-law cause of
action is based on assumptions about the adequacy of
other avenues of relief that are at least questionable be
cause they have not been fully tested in this case and thus
their efficacy is simply not before us to evaluate. Notably,
Granite Rock (like IBT and the Court of Appeals) assumes
that federal common law provides the only possible basis
for the type of tort claim it wishes to pursue. See Brief for
Respondent IBT 33–34; Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. But
Granite Rock did not litigate below, and thus does not
present us with occasion to address, whether state law
might provide a remedy. See, e.g., Steelworkers v. Raw
son, 495 U. S. 362, 369−371 (1990); Textron Lycoming
Reciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. Automobile
Workers, 523 U. S. 653, 656, 658 (1998). Nor did Granite
Rock fully explore the breach-of-contract and administra
tive causes of action it suggests are insufficient to remedy
IBT’s conduct. For example, far from establishing that an
agency or alter ego claim against IBT would be unsuccess
ful, the record in this case suggests it might be easier to
prove than usual if, as the NLRB’s decision observes, IBT
and Local were affiliated in 2004 in a way relevant to
Granite Rock’s claims. See In re Teamsters Local 287,
supra, at 340, n. 6. Similarly, neither party has estab
lished that the Board itself could not issue additional
relief against IBT. IBT’s amici argue that the “overlap
between Granite Rock’s §301 claim against the IBT and
the NLRB General Counsel’s unfair labor practice com
plaint against Local 287 brings into play the National
Labor Relations Act rule that an international union
commits an unfair labor practice by causing its affiliated
local unions to ‘impose extraneous non-bargaining unit
