Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

specified “classes of disputes” not implicated here. Id., at
A–176 to A–179.
Granite Rock claims that Local 287 breached the CBA’s
no-strike clause by engaging in a work stoppage in July
2004. Local 287 contests this claim. Specifically, it con
tends that it had no duty to abide by the no-strike clause
in July because it did not vote to ratify the CBA until
August. As I see it, the parties’ disagreement as to
whether the no-strike clause proscribed the July work
stoppage is plainly a “disput[e] arising under” the CBA
and is therefore subject to arbitration as Local 287 de
mands. Indeed, the parties’ no-strike dispute is indistin
guishable from myriad other disputes that an employer
and union might have concerning the interpretation and
application of the substantive provisions of a collective
bargaining agreement. These are precisely the sorts of
controversies that labor arbitrators are called upon to
resolve every day.
The majority seems to agree that the CBA’s arbitration
provision generally encompasses disputes between Gran
ite Rock and Local 287 regarding the parties’ compliance
with the terms of the CBA, including the no-strike clause.
The majority contends, however, that Local 287’s “forma
tion-date defense” raises a preliminary question of con
tract formation that must be resolved by a court rather
than an arbitrator. Ante, at 15. The majority’s reasoning
appears to be the following: If Local 287 did not ratify the
CBA until August, then there is “no valid basis” for apply
ing the CBA’s arbitration provision to events that occurred
in July. Ibid.
The majority’s position is flatly inconsistent with the
language of the CBA. The parties expressly chose to make
the agreement effective from May 1, 2004. As a result,
“the date on which [the] agreement was ratified” does not,
as the majority contends, determine whether the parties’
dispute about the permissibility of the July work stoppage
