GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that ‘[a]n
order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be
denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that
the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpreta
tion that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be
resolved in favor of coverage.’ ” AT&T Technologies, Inc. v.
Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 650 (1986) (quot
ing Warrior, 363 U. S., at 582–583); see also John Wiley &
Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S. 543, 550, n. 4 (1964)
(“[W]hen a contract is scrutinized for evidence of an inten
tion to arbitrate a particular kind of dispute, national
labor policy requires, within reason, that an interpretation
that covers the asserted dispute . . . be favored” (emphasis
deleted; internal quotation marks omitted)).1
The application of these established precepts to the facts
of this case strikes me as equally straightforward: It is
undisputed that Granite Rock and Local 287 executed a
CBA in December 2004. The parties made the CBA retro
actively “effect[ive] from May 1, 2004,” the day after the
expiration of their prior collective-bargaining agreement.
App. to Pet. for Cert. A–190. Among other things, the
CBA prohibited strikes and lockouts. Id., at A–181. The
CBA authorized either party, in accordance with certain
grievance procedures, to “refe[r] to arbitration” “[a]ll dis
putes arising under this agreement,” except for three

1 When the question is “ ‘who (primarily) should decide arbitrability’ ”
(as opposed to “ ‘whether a particular merits-related dispute is arbitra
ble’ ”), “the law reverses the presumption.” First Options of Chicago,
Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944–945 (1995). In other words, “[u]nless
the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,” it is presumed
that courts, not arbitrators, are responsible for resolving antecedent
questions concerning the scope of an arbitration agreement. AT&T
Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649
(1986). As the majority correctly observes, ante, at 7, n. 5, this case
does not implicate the reversed presumption because both parties
accept that a court, not an arbitrator, should resolve their current
disagreement about whether their underlying dispute is arbitrable.
