ing Paperworkers Local 620, 309 N. L. R. B. 44, 44 (1992)).
The fact that at least one Court of Appeals has recognized
the viability of such a claim, see Kobell v. United Paper
workers Int’l Union, 965 F. 2d 1401, 1407−1409 (CA6
1992), further persuades us that Granite Rock’s argu

under §301(a).

We reverse the Court of Appeals’ judgment on the arbi
trability of the parties’ formation-date dispute, affirm its
judgment dismissing Granite Rock’s claims against IBT to
the extent those claims depend on the creation of a new
federal common-law tort cause of action under §301(a),
and remand the case for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
