GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS
Opinion of the Court

in any event, Granite Rock had “implicitly” consented to
arbitrate the ratification-date dispute “by suing under the
contract.” Id., at 1178 (internal quotation marks omitted).
We granted certiorari. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).
II
It is well settled in both commercial and labor cases that
whether parties have agreed to “submi[t] a particular
dispute to arbitration” is typically an “ ‘ issue for judicial
determination.’ ” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,
537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002) (quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc.
v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986));
see John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S. 543,
546–547 (1964). It is similarly well settled that where the
dispute at issue concerns contract formation, the dispute
is generally for courts to decide. See, e.g., First Options of
Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995) (“When
deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain
matter . . . courts generally . . . should apply ordinary . . .
principles that govern the formation of contracts”); AT&T
Technologies, supra, at 648−649 (explaining the settled
rule in labor cases that “ ‘arbitration is a matter of con
tract’ ” and “arbitrators derive their authority to resolve
disputes only because the parties have agreed in advance
to submit such grievances to arbitration”); Buckeye Check
Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 444, n. 1 (2006)
(distinguishing treatment of the generally nonarbitral
question whether an arbitration agreement was “ever
concluded” from the question whether a contract containing an arbitration clause was illegal when formed,
which question we held to be arbitrable in certain
circumstances).
These principles would neatly dispose of this case if the
formation dispute here were typical. But it is not. It is
based on when (not whether) the CBA that contains the
parties’ arbitration clause was ratified and thereby
