GRANITE ROCK COMPANY, PETITIONER v.

INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD 

OF TEAMSTERS ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case involves an employer’s claims against a local
union and the union’s international parent for economic
damages arising out of a 2004 strike. The claims turn in
part on whether a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA)
containing a no-strike provision was validly formed during
the strike period. The employer contends that it was,
while the unions contend that it was not. Because the
CBA contains an arbitration clause, we first address
whether the parties’ dispute over the CBA’s ratification
date was a matter for the District Court or an arbitrator to
resolve. We conclude that it was a matter for judicial
resolution. Next, we address whether the Court of Ap
peals erred in declining the employer’s request to recog
nize a new federal cause of action under §301(a) of the
Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat.
156, 29 U. S. C. §185(a), for the international union’s
alleged tortious interference with the CBA. The Court of
Appeals did not err in declining this request.
