GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS
Opinion of the Court

section 301 is . . . a grant of jurisdiction only to enforce
contracts.” Brazinski v. Amoco Petroleum Additives Co., 6
F. 3d 1176, 1180 (CA7 1993). We see no reason for a
different result here because it would be premature to
recognize the federal common law tort Granite Rock re
quests in this case even assuming that §301(a) authorizes
us to do so.
In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that the
question before us is a narrow one. It is not whether the
conduct Granite Rock challenges is remediable, but
whether we should augment the claims already available
to Granite Rock by creating a new federal common-law
cause of action under §301(a). That we decline to do so
does not mean that we approve of IBT’s alleged actions.
Granite Rock describes a course of conduct that does
indeed seem to strike at the heart of the collective
bargaining process federal labor laws were designed to
protect. As the record in this case demonstrates, however,
a new federal tort claim is not the only possible remedy for
this conduct. Granite Rock’s allegations have prompted
favorable judgments not only from a federal jury, but also
from the NLRB. In proceedings that predated those in
which the District Court entered judgment for Granite
Rock on the CBA’s formation date,17 the NLRB concluded
that a “complete agreement” was reached on July 2, and
that Local and IBT violated federal labor laws by attempt
ing to delay the CBA’s ratification pending execution of a
separate agreement favorable to IBT. See In re Teamsters
Local 287, 347 N. L. R. B. 339, 340–341, and n. 1 (2006)

——————
17 Although the Board and federal jury reached different conclusions
with respect to the CBA’s ratification date, the discrepancy has little
practical significance because the Board’s remedial order against Local
and IBT gives “retroactive effect to the terms of the [CBA of] July 2,
2004, as if ratified on that date.” In re Teamsters Local 287, 347
N. L. R. B. 339, 340 (2006).
