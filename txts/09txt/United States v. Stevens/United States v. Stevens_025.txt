UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ROBERT J. 

STEVENS 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[April 20, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting.
The Court strikes down in its entirety a valuable stat
ute, 18 U. S. C. §48, that was enacted not to suppress
speech, but to prevent horrific acts of animal cruelty—in

§48(b). See Brief for Appellant in No. 05–2497 (CA3), pp. 72–79. He
added that, if the evidence in this case was held to be sufficient to take
his videos outside the scope of the exception, then “this case presents
. . . a situation” in which “a constitutional violation occurs.” Id., at 71.

is not a crush video or an appeal to some prurient sexual interest
constitutes a restriction of protected speech, and an unwarranted
violation of the First Amendment’s free speech guarantee”); Brief for
