Opinion of the Court 


B

As we explained two Terms ago, “[t]he first step in
overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute;
it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too
far without first knowing what the statute covers.” United
States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 293 (2008). Because §48
is a federal statute, there is no need to defer to a state
court’s authority to interpret its own law.
We read §48 to create a criminal prohibition of alarming
breadth. To begin with, the text of the statute’s ban on a
“depiction of animal cruelty” nowhere requires that the
depicted conduct be cruel. That text applies to “any . . .
depiction” in which “a living animal is intentionally
maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed.”
§48(c)(1). “[M]aimed, mutilated, [and] tortured” convey
cruelty, but “wounded” or “killed” do not suggest any such
limitation.
The Government contends that the terms in the defini
tion should be read to require the additional element of
“accompanying acts of cruelty.” Reply Brief 6; see also Tr.
of Oral Arg. 17–19. (The dissent hinges on the same
——————
the validity of the statute as applied to Stevens, our consideration of his
facial overbreadth claim is premature. Post, at 1, and n. 1, 2–3 (opinion
of ALITO, J.). Whether or not that conclusion follows, here no as-applied
claim has been preserved. Neither court below construed Stevens’s
briefs as adequately developing a separate attack on a defined subset of
the statute’s applications (say, dogfighting videos). See 533 F. 3d 218,
231, n. 13 (CA3 2008) (en banc) (“Stevens brings a facial challenge to
the statute”); App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, 74a. Neither did the Govern
ment, see Brief for United States in No. 05–2497 (CA3), p. 28 (opposing
“the appellant’s facial challenge”); accord, Brief for United States 4.
The sentence in Stevens’s appellate brief mentioning his unrelated
sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge hardly developed a First Amend
ment as-applied claim. See post, at 1, n. 1. Stevens’s constitutional
argument is a general one. And unlike the challengers in Washington
State Grange, Stevens does not “rest on factual assumptions . . . that
can be evaluated only in the context of an as-applied challenge.” 552
U. S., at 444.
