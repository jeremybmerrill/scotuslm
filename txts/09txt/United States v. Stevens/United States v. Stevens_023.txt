Opinion of the Court

ing Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U. S.
383, 397 (1988); omission in original), for doing so would
constitute a “serious invasion of the legislative domain,”
United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 479,
n. 26 (1995), and sharply diminish Congress’s “incentive to

First Amendment but that remain subject to the criminal
sanctions of §48.
Nor does the Government seriously contest that the
presumptively impermissible applications of §48 (properly

“growing” and “lucrative” the markets for crush videos and
dogfighting depictions might be, see Brief for United
States 43, 46 (internal quotation marks omitted), they are
dwarfed by the market for other depictions, such as hunt
ing magazines and videos, that we have determined to be
within the scope of §48. See supra, at 13–14. We there
fore need not and do not decide whether a statute limited
to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal
cruelty would be constitutional. We hold only that §48 is
