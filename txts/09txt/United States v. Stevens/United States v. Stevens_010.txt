UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
Opinion of the Court

(1969) (per curiam), and speech integral to criminal con
duct, Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490,
498 (1949)—are “well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have
never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.”
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571–572
(1942).

1904, 43 Harvard Classics 66, 79 (C. Eliot ed. 1910) (“No
man shall exercise any Tirranny or Crueltie towards any
bruite Creature which are usuallie kept for man’s use”).
But we are unaware of any similar tradition excluding
depictions of animal cruelty from “the freedom of speech”
codified in the First Amendment, and the Government
points us to none.
The Government contends that “historical evidence”
about the reach of the First Amendment is not “a neces

n. 8, and that categories of speech may be exempted from
