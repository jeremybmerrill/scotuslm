ALITO, J., dissenting

a party to whom the law may constitutionally be applied
to challenge the statute on the ground that it violates the
First Amendment rights of others. See, e.g., Board of
Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 483
(1989) (“Ordinarily, the principal advantage of the over
breadth doctrine for a litigant is that it enables him to
benefit from the statute’s unlawful application to someone
else”); see also Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S.
447, 462, n. 20 (1978) (describing the doctrine as one
“under which a person may challenge a statute that in
fringes protected speech even if the statute constitution
ally might be applied to him”).
The “strong medicine” of overbreadth invalidation need
not and generally should not be administered when the
statute under attack is unconstitutional as applied to the
challenger before the court. As we said in Fox, supra, at
484–485, “[i]t is not the usual judicial practice, . . . nor do
we consider it generally desirable, to proceed to an over
breadth issue unnecessarily—that is, before it is deter
mined that the statute would be valid as applied.” Accord,
New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 487
U. S. 1, 11 (1988); see also Broadrick, supra, at 613;
United Reporting Publishing Corp., supra, at 45 (STEVENS,
J., dissenting).
I see no reason to depart here from the generally pre
ferred procedure of considering the question of over
breadth only as a last resort.2 Because the Court has
addressed the overbreadth question, however, I will ex
plain why I do not think that the record supports the
conclusion that §48, when properly interpreted, is overly
broad.

2 For the reasons set forth below, this is not a case in which the chal
lenged statute is unconstitutional in all or almost all of its applications.
