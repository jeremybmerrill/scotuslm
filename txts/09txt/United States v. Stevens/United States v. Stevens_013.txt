Opinion of the Court

and our subsequent decisions have shared this under
standing. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S. 103, 110 (1990)
(describing Ferber as finding “persuasive” the argument
that the advertising and sale of child pornography was “an
integral part” of its unlawful production (internal quota
tion marks omitted)); Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,
535 U. S. 234, 249–250 (2002) (noting that distribution
and sale “were intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of
children,” giving the speech at issue “a proximate link to
the crime from which it came” (internal quotation marks
omitted)).
Our decisions in Ferber and other cases cannot be taken
as establishing a freewheeling authority to declare new
categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amend
ment. Maybe there are some categories of speech that
have been historically unprotected, but have not yet been
specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.
But if so, there is no evidence that “depictions of animal
cruelty” is among them. We need not foreclose the future
recognition of such additional categories to reject the
Government’s highly manipulable balancing test as a
means of identifying them.

Because we decline to carve out from the First Amend
ment any novel exception for §48, we review Stevens’s
First Amendment challenge under our existing doctrine.
A
Stevens challenged §48 on its face, arguing that any
conviction secured under the statute would be unconstitu
tional. The court below decided the case on that basis, 533
F. 3d, at 231, n. 13, and we granted the Solicitor General’s
petition for certiorari to determine “whether 18 U. S. C. 48
is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the
First Amendment,” Pet. for Cert. i.
