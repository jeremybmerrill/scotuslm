Opinion of the Court

adequate reading of the exceptions clause that results in
the statute’s banning only the depictions the Government
would like to ban.
The Government explains that the language of §48(b)
was largely drawn from our opinion in Miller v. California,
413 U. S. 15 (1973), which excepted from its definition of
obscenity any material with “serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value,” id., at 24. See Reply Brief 8,
9, and n. 5. According to the Government, this incorpora
tion of the Miller standard into §48 is therefore surely
enough to answer any First Amendment objection. Reply
Brief 8–9.
In Miller we held that “serious” value shields depictions
of sex from regulation as obscenity. 413 U. S., at 24–25.
Limiting Miller’s exception to “serious” value ensured that
“ ‘[a] quotation from Voltaire in the flyleaf of a book
[would] not constitutionally redeem an otherwise obscene
publication.’ ” Id., at 25, n. 7 (quoting Kois v. Wisconsin,
408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972) (per curiam)). We did not, how
ever, determine that serious value could be used as a
general precondition to protecting other types of speech in
the first place. Most of what we say to one another lacks
“religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,
historical, or artistic value” (let alone serious value), but it
is still sheltered from government regulation. Even
“ ‘[w]holly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection
of free speech as fully as do Keats’ poems or Donne’s ser
mons.’ ” Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 25 (1971) (quot
ing Winters v. New York, 333 U. S. 507, 528 (1948) (Frank
furter, J., dissenting); alteration in original).
Thus, the protection of the First Amendment presump
tively extends to many forms of speech that do not qualify
for the serious-value exception of §48(b), but nonetheless
fall within the broad reach of §48(c).
