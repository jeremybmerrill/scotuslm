ALITO, J., dissenting

videos and depictions of deadly animal fights. See ante, at
10, 19. Instead, the Court tacitly assumes for the sake of
argument that §48 is valid as applied to these depictions,
but the Court concludes that §48 reaches too much pro
tected speech to survive. The Court relies primarily on
depictions of hunters killing or wounding game and depic
tions of animals being slaughtered for food. I address the
Court’s examples below.
A
I turn first to depictions of hunting. As the Court notes,
photographs and videos of hunters shooting game are
common. See ante, at 13–14. But hunting is legal in all
50 States, and §48 applies only to a depiction of conduct
that is illegal in the jurisdiction in which the depiction is
created, sold, or possessed. §§48(a), (c). Therefore, in all
50 States, the creation, sale, or possession for sale of the
vast majority of hunting depictions indisputably falls
outside §48’s reach.
Straining to find overbreadth, the Court suggests that
§48 prohibits the sale or possession in the District of Co
lumbia of any depiction of hunting because the District—
undoubtedly because of its urban character—does not
permit hunting within its boundaries. Ante, at 13. The
Court also suggests that, because some States prohibit a
particular type of hunting (e.g., hunting with a crossbow
or “canned” hunting) or the hunting of a particular animal
(e.g., the “sharp-tailed grouse”), §48 makes it illegal for
persons in such States to sell or possess for sale a depic
tion of hunting that was perfectly legal in the State in
which the hunting took place. See ante, at 12–14.
The Court’s interpretation is seriously flawed. “When a
federal court is dealing with a federal statute challenged
as overbroad, it should, of course, construe the statute to
avoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to
such a limiting construction.” Ferber, 458 U. S., at 769,
