UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
Opinion of the Court

D
Not to worry, the Government says: The Executive
Branch construes §48 to reach only “extreme” cruelty,
Brief for United States 8, and it “neither has brought nor
will bring a prosecution for anything less,” Reply Brief 6–
7. The Government hits this theme hard, invoking its
prosecutorial discretion several times. See id., at 6–7, 10,
and n. 6, 19, 22. But the First Amendment protects
against the Government; it does not leave us at the mercy
of noblesse oblige. We would not uphold an unconstitu
tional statute merely because the Government promised to
use it responsibly. Cf. Whitman v. American Trucking
Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 473 (2001).
This prosecution is itself evidence of the danger in put
ting faith in government representations of prosecutorial
restraint. When this legislation was enacted, the Execu
tive Branch announced that it would interpret §48 as
covering only depictions “of wanton cruelty to animals
designed to appeal to a prurient interest in sex.” See
Statement by President William J. Clinton upon Signing
H. R. 1887, 34 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2557 (Dec. 9,
1999). No one suggests that the videos in this case fit that
description. The Government’s assurance that it will
apply §48 far more restrictively than its language provides
is pertinent only as an implicit acknowledgment of the
potential constitutional problems with a more natural
reading.
Nor can we rely upon the canon of construction that
“ambiguous statutory language [should] be construed to
avoid serious constitutional doubts.” FCC v. Fox Televi
sion Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at
12). “[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction on a
statute only if it is ‘readily susceptible’ to such a construc
tion.” Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S.
844, 884 (1997). We “ ‘will not rewrite a . . . law to conform
it to constitutional requirements,’ ” id., at 884–885 (quot
