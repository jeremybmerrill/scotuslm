UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
Opinion of the Court

District Court denied the motion. It held that the depic
tions subject to §48, like obscenity or child pornography,
are categorically unprotected by the First Amendment.
2:04–cr–00051–ANB (WD Pa., Nov. 10, 2004), App. to Pet.
for Cert. 65a–71a. It went on to hold that §48 is not sub
stantially overbroad, because the exceptions clause suffi
ciently narrows the statute to constitutional applications.
Id., at 71a–75a. The jury convicted Stevens on all counts,
and the District Court sentenced him to three concurrent
sentences of 37 months’ imprisonment, followed by three
years of supervised release. App. 37.
The en banc Third Circuit, over a three-judge dissent,
declared §48 facially unconstitutional and vacated Ste
vens’s conviction. 533 F. 3d 218. The Court of Appeals
first held that §48 regulates speech that is protected by
the First Amendment. The Court declined to recognize a
new category of unprotected speech for depictions of ani
mal cruelty, id., at 224, and n. 6, and rejected the Gov
ernment’s analogy between animal cruelty depictions and
child pornography, id., at 224–232.
The Court of Appeals then held that §48 could not sur
vive strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation of pro
tected speech. Id., at 232. It found that the statute lacked
a compelling government interest and was neither nar
rowly tailored to preventing animal cruelty nor the least
restrictive means of doing so. Id., at 232–235. It therefore
held §48 facially invalid.
In an extended footnote, the Third Circuit noted that
§48 “might also be unconstitutionally overbroad,” because
it “potentially covers a great deal of constitutionally pro
tected speech” and “sweeps [too] widely” to be limited only
by prosecutorial discretion. Id., at 235, n. 16. But the
Court of Appeals declined to rest its analysis on this
ground.
We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).
