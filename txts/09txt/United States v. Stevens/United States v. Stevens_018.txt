UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
Opinion of the Court

Association et al. as Amici Curiae 9–10. The demand for
hunting depictions exceeds the estimated demand for
crush videos or animal fighting depictions by several
orders of magnitude. Compare ibid. and Brief for National
Rifle Association of America, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 12
(hereinafter NRA Brief) (estimating that hunting maga
zines alone account for $135 million in annual retail sales)
with Brief for United States 43–44, 46 (suggesting $1
million in crush video sales per year, and noting that
Stevens earned $57,000 from his videos). Nonetheless,
because the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its
laws to the rest of the country, §48(a) extends to any
magazine or video depicting lawful hunting, so long as
that depiction is sold within the Nation’s Capital.
Those seeking to comply with the law thus face a bewil
dering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate juris
dictions. Some States permit hunting with crossbows, Ga.
Code Ann. §27–3–4(1) (2007); Va. Code Ann. §29.1–
519(A)(6) (Lexis 2008 Cum. Supp.), while others forbid it,
Ore. Admin. Reg. 635–065–0725 (2009), or restrict it only
to the disabled, N. Y. Envir. Conserv. Law Ann. §11–
0901(16) (West 2005). Missouri allows the “canned” hunt
ing of ungulates held in captivity, Mo. Code Regs. Ann.,
tit. 3, 10–9.560(1), but Montana restricts such hunting to
certain bird species, Mont. Admin. Rule 12.6.1202(1)
(2007). The sharp-tailed grouse may be hunted in Idaho,
but not in Washington. Compare Idaho Admin. Code
§13.01.09.606 (2009) with Wash. Admin. Code §232–28–
342 (2009).
The disagreements among the States—and the “com
monwealth[s], territor[ies], or possession[s] of the United
States,” 18 U. S. C. §48(c)(2)—extend well beyond hunting.
State agricultural regulations permit different methods of
livestock slaughter in different places or as applied to differ
ent animals. Compare, e.g., Fla. Stat. §828.23(5) (2007)
(excluding poultry from humane slaughter requirements)
