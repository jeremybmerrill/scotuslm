ALITO, J., dissenting

“The abused dogs used in fights endure physical tor
ture and emotional manipulation throughout their
lives to predispose them to violence; common tactics
include feeding the animals hot peppers and gunpow
der, prodding them with sticks, and electrocution.
Dogs are conditioned never to give up a fight, even if
they will be gravely hurt or killed. As a result, dog
fights inflict horrific injuries on the participating
animals, including lacerations, ripped ears, puncture
wounds and broken bones. Losing dogs are routinely
refused treatment, beaten further as ‘punishment’ for
the loss, and executed by drowning, hanging, or incin
eration.” Id., at 5–6 (footnotes omitted).
For these dogs, unlike the animals killed in crush vid
eos, the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes. As
with crush videos, moreover, the statutory ban on com
merce in dogfighting videos is also supported by compel
ling governmental interests in effectively enforcing the
Nation’s criminal laws and preventing criminals from
profiting from their illegal activities. See Ferber, supra, at
757–758; Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 119.
In sum, §48 may validly be applied to at least two broad
real-world categories of expression covered by the statute:
crush videos and dogfighting videos. Thus, the statute has
a substantial core of constitutionally permissible applica
tions. Moreover, for the reasons set forth above, the re
cord does not show that §48, properly interpreted, bans a
substantial amount of protected speech in absolute terms.
A fortiori, respondent has not met his burden of demon
strating that any impermissible applications of the statute
are “substantial” in relation to its “plainly legitimate
sweep.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 292. Accordingly, I would
reject respondent’s claim that §48 is facially unconstitu
tional under the overbreadth doctrine.
