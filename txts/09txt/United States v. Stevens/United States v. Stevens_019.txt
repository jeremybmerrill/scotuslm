Opinion of the Court

with Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. §19501(b) (West 2001)
(including some poultry). California has recently banned
cutting or “docking” the tails of dairy cattle, which other
States permit. 2009 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 344 (S. B. 135)
(West). Even cockfighting, long considered immoral in
much of America, see Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501
U. S. 560, 575 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment),
is legal in Puerto Rico, see 15 Laws P. R. Ann. §301 (Supp.
2008); Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of
P. R., 478 U. S. 328, 342 (1986), and was legal in Louisi
ana until 2008, see La. Stat. Ann. §14:102.23 (West) (effec

these practices, if sold or possessed for commercial gain
within a State that happens to forbid the practice, falls
within the prohibition of §48(a).

The only thing standing between defendants who sell
such depictions and five years in federal prison—other
than the mercy of a prosecutor—is the statute’s exceptions
clause. Subsection (b) exempts from prohibition “any
depiction that has serious religious, political, scientific,
educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.” The
Government argues that this clause substantially narrows
the statute’s reach: News reports about animal cruelty
have “journalistic” value; pictures of bullfights in Spain
have “historical” value; and instructional hunting videos
have “educational” value. Reply Brief 6. Thus, the Gov
ernment argues, §48 reaches only crush videos, depictions
of animal fighting (other than Spanish bullfighting, see
Brief for United States 47–48), and perhaps other depic
tions of “extreme acts of animal cruelty.” Id., at 41.
The Government’s attempt to narrow the statutory ban,
however, requires an unrealistically broad reading of the
exceptions clause. As the Government reads the clause,
any material with “redeeming societal value,” id., at 9, 16,
