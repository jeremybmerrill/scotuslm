UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
ALITO, J., dissenting

Appeals—incorrectly, in my view—declined to decide
whether §48 is unconstitutional as applied to respondent’s
videos and instead reached out to hold that the statute is
facially invalid. Today’s decision does not endorse the
Court of Appeals’ reasoning, but it nevertheless strikes
down §48 using what has been aptly termed the “strong
medicine” of the overbreadth doctrine, United States v.
Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 293 (2008) (internal quotation
marks omitted), a potion that generally should be admin
istered only as “a last resort.” Los Angeles Police Dept. v.
United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 39 (1999)
(internal quotation marks omitted).
Instead of applying the doctrine of overbreadth, I would
vacate the decision below and instruct the Court of Ap
peals on remand to decide whether the videos that respon
dent sold are constitutionally protected. If the question of
overbreadth is to be decided, however, I do not think the
present record supports the Court’s conclusion that §48
bans a substantial quantity of protected speech.

A party seeking to challenge the constitutionality of a
statute generally must show that the statute violates the
party’s own rights. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 767
(1982). The First Amendment overbreadth doctrine carves
out a narrow exception to that general rule. See id., at
768; Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 611–612
(1973). Because an overly broad law may deter constitu
tionally protected speech, the overbreadth doctrine allows
——————
Respondent 55 (“Stevens’ speech does not fit within any existing
category of unprotected, prosecutable speech”); id., at 57 (“[T]he record
as a whole demonstrates that Stevens’ speech cannot constitutionally
be punished”). Contrary to the Court, ante, at 10–11, n. 3 (citing 533
F. 3d 218, 231, n. 13 (CA3 2008) (en banc)), I see no suggestion in the
opinion of the Court of Appeals that respondent did not preserve an as
applied challenge.
