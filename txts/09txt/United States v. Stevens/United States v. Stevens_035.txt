ALITO, J., dissenting

“[A] kitten, secured to the ground, watches and
shrieks in pain as a woman thrusts her high-heeled
shoe into its body, slams her heel into the kitten’s eye
socket and mouth loudly fracturing its skull, and
stomps repeatedly on the animal’s head. The kitten
hemorrhages blood, screams blindly in pain, and is ul
timately left dead in a moist pile of blood-soaked hair
and bone.” Brief for Humane Society of United States
as Amicus Curiae 2 (hereinafter Humane Society
Brief).
It is undisputed that the conduct depicted in crush
videos may constitutionally be prohibited. All 50 States
and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes prohib

§48, the underlying conduct depicted in crush videos was
nearly impossible to prosecute. These videos, which “ often
appeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish,” id., at
2, were made in secret, generally without a live audience,
and “the faces of the women inflicting the torture in the
material often were not shown, nor could the location of
the place where the cruelty was being inflicted or the date
of the activity be ascertained from the depiction.” Id., at 3.
Thus, law enforcement authorities often were not able to
identify the parties responsible for the torture. See Pun

Prisoner Health Care Co-Payment Act of 1999: Hearing
before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Commit
tee on the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1 (1999)
(hereinafter Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty). In
the rare instances in which it was possible to identify and
find the perpetrators, they “often were able to successfully
assert as a defense that the State could not prove its
jurisdiction over the place where the act occurred or that
the actions depicted took place within the time specified in
