UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
ALITO, J., dissenting

II
The overbreadth doctrine “strike[s] a balance between
competing social costs.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 292.
Specifically, the doctrine seeks to balance the “harmful
effects” of “invalidating a law that in some of its applica
tions is perfectly constitutional” against the possibility
that “the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law [will]
dete[r] people from engaging in constitutionally protected
speech.” Ibid. “In order to maintain an appropriate bal
ance, we have vigorously enforced the requirement that a
statute’s overbreadth be substantial, not only in an abso
lute sense, but also relative to the statute’s plainly legiti
mate sweep.” Ibid.
In determining whether a statute’s overbreadth is sub
stantial, we consider a statute’s application to real-world
conduct, not fanciful hypotheticals. See, e.g., id., at 301–
302; see also Ferber, supra, at 773; Houston v. Hill, 482
U. S. 451, 466–467 (1987). Accordingly, we have repeat
edly emphasized that an overbreadth claimant bears the
burden of demonstrating, “from the text of [the law] and
from actual fact,” that substantial overbreadth exists.

York State Club Assn., supra, at 14; emphasis added;
internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).
Similarly, “there must be a realistic danger that the stat
ute itself will significantly compromise recognized First
Amendment protections of parties not before the Court for
it to be facially challenged on overbreadth grounds.”

Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 801 (1984) (emphasis added).
III
In holding that §48 violates the overbreadth rule, the
Court declines to decide whether, as the Government
maintains, §48 is constitutional as applied to two broad
categories of depictions that exist in the real world: crush
