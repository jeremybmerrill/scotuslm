ALITO, J., dissenting

that the only way of preventing these crimes was to target
the sale of the videos. Under these circumstances, I can
not believe that the First Amendment commands Con
gress to step aside and allow the underlying crimes to
continue.
The most relevant of our prior decisions is Ferber, 458
U. S. 747, which concerned child pornography. The Court
there held that child pornography is not protected speech,
and I believe that Ferber’s reasoning dictates a similar
conclusion here.
In Ferber, an important factor—I would say the most
important factor—was that child pornography involves the
commission of a crime that inflicts severe personal injury
to the “children who are made to engage in sexual conduct
for commercial purposes.’ ” Id., at 753 (internal quotation

the production of child pornography as child “abuse,”
“molestation,” or “exploitation.” See, e.g., id., at 749 (“In
recent years, the exploitive use of children in the produc

often involved in the production of child sexual perform

of the work, not its content, was the target of the statute.”
See also 535 U.S., at 250 (Ferber involved “speech that
itself is the record of sexual abuse”).
Second, Ferber emphasized the fact that these underly

put it, “the distribution network for child pornography
must be closed if the production of material which requires
the sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively
controlled.” 458 U. S., at 759. The Court added:
“[T]here is no serious contention that the legislature
