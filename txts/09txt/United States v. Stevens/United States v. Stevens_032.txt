UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
ALITO, J., dissenting

contribution to the exchange of ideas. Accordingly, I
would hold that hunting depictions fall comfortably within
the exception set out in §48(b).
I do not have the slightest doubt that Congress, in en
acting §48, had no intention of restricting the creation,
sale, or possession of depictions of hunting. Proponents of
the law made this point clearly. See H. R. Rep. No. 106–
397, p. 8 (1999) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (“[D]epictions of
ordinary hunting and fishing activities do not fall within
the scope of the statute”); 145 Cong. Rec. 25894 (Oct. 19,
1999) (Rep. McCollum) (“[T]he sale of depictions of legal
activities, such as hunting and fishing, would not be illegal
under this bill”); id., at 25895 (Rep. Smith) (“[L]et us be
clear as to what this legislation will not do. It will in no
way prohibit hunting, fishing, or wildlife videos”). Indeed,
even opponents acknowledged that §48 was not intended
to reach ordinary hunting depictions. See ibid. (Rep.
Scott); id., at 25897 (Rep. Paul).
For these reasons, I am convinced that §48 has no appli
cation to depictions of hunting. But even if §48 did imper
missibly reach the sale or possession of depictions of hunt
ing in a few unusual situations (for example, the sale in
Oregon of a depiction of hunting with a crossbow in Vir
ginia or the sale in Washington State of the hunting of a
sharp-tailed grouse in Idaho, see ante, at 14), those iso
lated applications would hardly show that §48 bans a
substantial amount of protected speech.
B
Although the Court’s overbreadth analysis rests primar
ily on the proposition that §48 substantially restricts the
sale and possession of hunting depictions, the Court cites
a few additional examples, including depictions of methods
of slaughter and the docking of the tails of dairy cows. See
ante, at 14–15.
Such examples do not show that the statute is substan
