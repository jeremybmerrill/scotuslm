tional,” or “historical” value. While there are certainly
those who find hunting objectionable, the predominant
view in this country has long been that hunting serves
many important values, and it is clear that Congress
shares that view. Since 1972, when Congress called upon
the President to designate a National Hunting and Fish
ing Day, see S. J. Res. 117, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972), 86
Stat. 133, Presidents have regularly issued proclamations
extolling the values served by hunting. See Presidential
Proclamation No. 8421, 74 Fed. Reg. 49305 (Pres. Obama
2009) (hunting and fishing are “ageless pursuits” that
promote “the conservation and restoration of numerous
species and their natural habitats”); Presidential Procla

(hunters and anglers “add to our heritage and keep our
wildlife populations healthy and strong,” and “are among
our foremost conservationists”); Presidential Proclamation
No. 7822, 69 Fed. Reg. 59539 (Pres. Bush 2004) (hunting
and fishing are “an important part of our Nation’s heri
tage,” and “America’s hunters and anglers represent the
great spirit of our country”); Presidential Proclamation No.
4682, 44 Fed. Reg. 53149 (Pres. Carter 1979) (hunting
promotes conservation and an appreciation of “healthy
recreation, peaceful solitude and closeness to nature”);
Presidential Proclamation No. 4318, 39 Fed. Reg. 35315
(Pres. Ford 1974) (hunting furthers “appreciation and
respect for nature” and preservation of the environment).
Thus, it is widely thought that hunting has “scientific”
value in that it promotes conservation, “historical” value
in that it provides a link to past times when hunting
played a critical role in daily life, and “educational” value
in that it furthers the understanding and appreciation of
nature and our country’s past and instills valuable charac
ter traits. And if hunting itself is widely thought to serve
these values, then it takes but a small additional step to
conclude that depictions of hunting make a non-trivial
