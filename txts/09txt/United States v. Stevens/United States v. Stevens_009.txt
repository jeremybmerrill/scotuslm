Opinion of the Court 


II 

The Government’s primary submission is that §48 nec
essarily complies with the Constitution because the
banned depictions of animal cruelty, as a class, are
categorically unprotected by the First Amendment. We
disagree.
The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall
make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” “[A]s a
general matter, the First Amendment means that gov
ernment has no power to restrict expression because of its
message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”
Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564,
573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 48
explicitly regulates expression based on content: The
statute restricts “visual [and] auditory depiction[s],” such
as photographs, videos, or sound recordings, depending on
whether they depict conduct in which a living animal is
intentionally harmed. As such, §48 is “ ‘presumptively
invalid,’ and the Government bears the burden to rebut
that presumption.” United States v. Playboy Entertain
ment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 817 (2000) (quoting
R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992); citation
omitted).
“From 1791 to the present,” however, the First Amend
ment has “permitted restrictions upon the content of
speech in a few limited areas,” and has never “include[d] a
freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.” Id., at
382–383. These “historic and traditional categories long
familiar to the bar,” Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of
N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991)
(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment)—including obscen
ity, Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 483 (1957), defa
mation, Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 254–255
(1952), fraud, Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citi
zens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976),
incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 447–449
