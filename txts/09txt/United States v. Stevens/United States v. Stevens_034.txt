UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
ALITO, J., dissenting

and I take the Court’s point to be that it would be imper
missible to ban the creation, sale, or possession in Puerto
Rico of a depiction of a cockfight that was legally staged in
Puerto Rico.5 But assuming for the sake of argument that
this is correct, this veritable sliver of unconstitutionality
would not be enough to justify striking down §48 in toto.
In sum, we have a duty to interpret §48 so as to avoid
serious constitutional concerns, and §48 may reasonably
be construed not to reach almost all, if not all, of the depic
tions that the Court finds constitutionally protected.
Thus, §48 does not appear to have a large number of un
constitutional applications. Invalidation for overbreadth
is appropriate only if the challenged statute suffers from
substantial overbreadth—judged not just in absolute
terms, but in relation to the statute’s “plainly legitimate
sweep.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 292. As I explain in the
following Part, §48 has a substantial core of constitution
ally permissible applications.

As the Court of Appeals recognized, “the primary con
duct that Congress sought to address through its passage
[of §48] was the creation, sale, or possession of ‘crush
videos.’ ” 533 F. 3d 218, 222 (CA3 2008) (en banc). A
sample crush video, which has been lodged with the Clerk,
records the following event:

5 Since

the Court has taken pains not to decide whether §48 would be
unconstitutional as applied to graphic dogfight videos, including those
depicting fights occurring in countries where dogfighting is legal, I take
it that the Court does not intend for its passing reference to cockfights
to mean either that all depictions of cockfights, whether legal or illegal
under local law, are protected by the First Amendment or that it is
impermissible to ban the sale or possession in the States of a depiction
of a legal cockfight in Puerto Rico.
