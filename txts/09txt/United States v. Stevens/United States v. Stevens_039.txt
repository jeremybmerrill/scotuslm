ALITO, J., dissenting

tions of animal torture with the intention of realizing a
commercial profit. The evidence presented to Congress
posed a stark choice: Either ban the commercial exploita
tion of crush videos or tolerate a continuation of the crimi
nal acts that they record. Faced with this evidence, Con
gress reasonably chose to target the lucrative crush video
market.
Finally, the harm caused by the underlying crimes
vastly outweighs any minimal value that the depictions
might conceivably be thought to possess. Section 48
reaches only the actual recording of acts of animal torture;
the statute does not apply to verbal descriptions or to
simulations. And, unlike the child pornography statute in
Ferber or its federal counterpart, 18 U. S. C. §2252, §48(b)
provides an exception for depictions having any “serious
religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,
historical, or artistic value.”
It must be acknowledged that §48 differs from a child
pornography law in an important respect: preventing the
abuse of children is certainly much more important than
preventing the torture of the animals used in crush videos.
It was largely for this reason that the Court of Appeals
concluded that Ferber did not support the constitutionality
of §48. 533 F. 3d, at 228 (“Preventing cruelty to animals,
although an exceedingly worthy goal, simply does not
implicate interests of the same magnitude as protecting
children from physical and psychological harm”). But
while protecting children is unquestionably more impor
tant than protecting animals, the Government also has a
compelling interest in preventing the torture depicted in
crush videos.
The animals used in crush videos are living creatures
that experience excruciating pain. Our society has long
banned such cruelty, which is illegal throughout the coun
try. In Ferber, the Court noted that “virtually all of the
States and the United States have passed legislation
