UNITED STATES v. STEVENS
ALITO, J., dissenting

proscribing the production of or otherwise combating ‘child
pornography,’ ” and the Court declined to “second-guess
[that] legislative judgment.”6 458 U. S., at 758. Here,
likewise, the Court of Appeals erred in second-guessing
the legislative judgment about the importance of prevent
ing cruelty to animals.
Section 48’s ban on trafficking in crush videos also helps
to enforce the criminal laws and to ensure that criminals
do not profit from their crimes. See 145 Cong. Rec. 25897
(Oct. 19, 1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (“The state has an interest
in enforcing its existing laws. Right now, the laws are not
only being violated, but people are making huge profits
from promoting the violations”); id., at 10685 (May 24,
1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (explaining that he introduced the
House version of the bill because “criminals should not
profit from [their] illegal acts”). We have already judged
that taking the profit out of crime is a compelling interest.

Ferber, I would hold that crush videos are not protected by
the First Amendment.

proof that a particular government interest is compelling. See Simon &
Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S.
105, 118 (1991) (State’s compelling interest “in ensuring that victims of
crime are compensated by those who harm them” evidenced by fact that
“[e]very State has a body of tort law serving exactly this interest”);
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 624–625 (1984) (citing
state laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations as
evidence of the compelling governmental interest in ensuring equal
access).
