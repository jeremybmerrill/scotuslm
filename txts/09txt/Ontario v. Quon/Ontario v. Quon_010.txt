ONTARIO v. QUON
Opinion of the Court

limits to ensure that officers were not paying hidden work­
related costs, . . . no constitutional violation occurred.”
445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1146.
The District Court held a jury trial to determine the
purpose of the audit. The jury concluded that Scharf
ordered the audit to determine the efficacy of the charac­
ter limits. The District Court accordingly held that peti­
tioners did not violate the Fourth Amendment. It entered
judgment in their favor.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir­
cuit reversed in part. 529 F. 3d 892 (2008). The panel
agreed with the District Court that Jeff Quon had a rea­
sonable expectation of privacy in his text messages but
disagreed with the District Court about whether the
search was reasonable. Even though the search was
conducted for “a legitimate work-related rationale,” the
Court of Appeals concluded, it “was not reasonable in
scope.” Id., at 908. The panel disagreed with the District
Court’s observation that “there were no less-intrusive
means” that Chief Scharf could have used “to verify the
efficacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding
on [respondents’] Fourth Amendment rights.” Id., at 908–
909. The opinion pointed to a “host of simple ways” that
the chief could have used instead of the audit, such as
warning Quon at the beginning of the month that his
future messages would be audited, or asking Quon himself
to redact the transcript of his messages. Id., at 909. The
Court of Appeals further concluded that Arch Wireless had
violated the SCA by turning over the transcript to the
City.
The Ninth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing en
banc. Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., 554 F. 3d 769
(2009). Judge Ikuta, joined by six other Circuit Judges,
dissented. Id., at 774–779. Judge Wardlaw concurred in
the denial of rehearing, defending the panel’s opinion
against the dissent. Id., at 769–774.
