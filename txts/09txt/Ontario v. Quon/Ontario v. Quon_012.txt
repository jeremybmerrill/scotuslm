ONTARIO v. QUON
Opinion of the Court

ity of the Court further agreed that “ ‘special needs, beyond
the normal need for law enforcement,’ ” make the warrant
and probable-cause requirement impracticable for gov­
ernment employers. Id., at 725 (plurality opinion) (quot­
ing New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 351 (1985)
(Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment); 480 U. S., at 732
(opinion of SCALIA, J.) (quoting same).
The O’Connor Court did disagree on the proper analyti­
cal framework for Fourth Amendment claims against
government employers. A four-Justice plurality concluded
that the correct analysis has two steps. First, because
“some government offices may be so open to fellow em­
ployees or the public that no expectation of privacy is
reasonable,” id., at 718, a court must consider “[t]he opera­
tional realities of the workplace” in order to determine
whether an employee’s Fourth Amendment rights are
implicated, id., at 717. On this view, “the question
whether an employee has a reasonable expectation of
privacy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.” Id., at
718. Next, where an employee has a legitimate privacy
expectation, an employer’s intrusion on that expectation
“for noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as
for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be
judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the
circumstances.” Id., at 725–726.
JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment, outlined a
different approach. His opinion would have dispensed
with an inquiry into “operational realities” and would
conclude “that the offices of government employees . . . are
covered by Fourth Amendment protections as a general
matter.” Id., at 731. But he would also have held “that
government searches to retrieve work-related materials or
to investigate violations of workplace rules—searches of
the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the
private-employer context—do not violate the Fourth
Amendment.” Id., at 732.
