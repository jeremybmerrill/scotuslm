Opinion of the Court

B
Raising claims under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C.
§1983; 18 U. S. C. §2701 et seq., popularly known as the
Stored Communications Act (SCA); and California law,
Quon filed suit against petitioners in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California. Arch
Wireless and an individual not relevant here were also
named as defendants. Quon was joined in his suit by
another plaintiff who is not a party before this Court and
by the other respondents, each of whom exchanged text

respondents’ Fourth Amendment rights and the SCA by
obtaining and reviewing the transcript of Jeff Quon’s
pager messages and that Arch Wireless had violated the
SCA by turning over the transcript to the City.
The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.

summary judgment on the SCA claim but denied petition­

ment claims. Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., 445
F. Supp. 2d 1116 (CD Cal. 2006). Relying on the plural­
ity opinion in O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 711
(1987), the District Court determined that Quon had a
reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his text
messages. Whether the audit of the text messages was
nonetheless reasonable, the District Court concluded,
turned on Chief Scharf’s intent: “[I]f the purpose for the
audit was to determine if Quon was using his pager to
‘play games’ and ‘waste time,’ then the audit was not
constitutionally reasonable”; but if the audit’s purpose
“was to determine the efficacy of the existing character
