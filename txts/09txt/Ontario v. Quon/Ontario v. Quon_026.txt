Opinion of SCALIA, J.

basis for bombarding lower courts with arguments about
employer policies, how they were communicated, and
whether they were authorized, as well as the latest trends
in employees’ use of electronic media. In short, in saying
why it is not saying more, the Court says much more than
it should.
The Court’s inadvertent boosting of the O’Connor plural
ity’s standard is all the more ironic because, in fleshing
out its fears that applying that test to new technologies
will be too hard, the Court underscores the unworkability
of that standard. Any rule that requires evaluating
whether a given gadget is a “necessary instrumen[t] for
self-expression, even self-identification,” on top of assess
ing the degree to which “the law’s treatment of [workplace
norms has] evolve[d],” ante, at 11, is (to put it mildly)
unlikely to yield objective answers.
I concur in the Court’s judgment.
