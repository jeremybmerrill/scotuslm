ONTARIO v. QUON
Opinion of the Court

Arch Wireless from turning over the transcripts, it does
not follow that petitioners’ actions were unreasonable.
Respondents point to no authority for the proposition that
the existence of statutory protection renders a search per
se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. And the
precedents counsel otherwise. See Virginia v. Moore, 553
U. S. 164, 168 (2008) (search incident to an arrest that
was illegal under state law was reasonable); California v.
Greenwood, 486 U. S. 35, 43 (1988) (rejecting argument
that if state law forbade police search of individual’s gar­

Furthermore, respondents do not maintain that any OPD
employee either violated the law him- or herself or knew
or should have known that Arch Wireless, by turning over

SCA by turning over the transcripts.
Because the search was motivated by a legitimate work­
related purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope,
the search was reasonable under the approach of the
O’Connor plurality. 480 U. S., at 726. For these same
reasons—that the employer had a legitimate reason for
the search, and that the search was not excessively intru­
sive in light of that justification—the Court also concludes
that the search would be “regarded as reasonable and
normal in the private-employer context” and would satisfy
the approach of JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence. Id., at 732.
The search was reasonable, and the Court of Appeals
erred by holding to the contrary. Petitioners did not vio­
late Quon’s Fourth Amendment rights.

Finally, the Court must consider whether the search
violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Jerilyn Quon,
Florio, and Trujillo, the respondents who sent text mes­
