The Fourth Amendment states: “The right of the people
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated . . . .” It is well settled that the Fourth Amend­
ment’s protection extends beyond the sphere of criminal
investigations. Camara v. Municipal Court of City and
County of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 530 (1967). “The
Amendment guarantees the privacy, dignity, and security
of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by
officers of the Government,” without regard to whether the
government actor is investigating crime or performing
another function. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’
Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 613–614 (1989). The Fourth Amend­
ment applies as well when the Government acts in its
capacity as an employer. Treasury Employees v. Von
Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 665 (1989).
The Court discussed this principle in O’Connor. There a
physician employed by a state hospital alleged that hospi­
tal officials investigating workplace misconduct had vio­
lated his Fourth Amendment rights by searching his office
and seizing personal items from his desk and filing cabi­
net. All Members of the Court agreed with the general
principle that “[i]ndividuals do not lose Fourth Amend­
ment rights merely because they work for the government
instead of a private employer.” 480 U. S., at 717 (plurality
