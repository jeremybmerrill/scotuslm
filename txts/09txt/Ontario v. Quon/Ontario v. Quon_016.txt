ONTARIO v. QUON
Opinion of the Court

might have implications for future cases that cannot be
predicted. It is preferable to dispose of this case on nar­
rower grounds. For present purposes we assume several
propositions arguendo: First, Quon had a reasonable
expectation of privacy in the text messages sent on the
pager provided to him by the City; second, petitioners’
review of the transcript constituted a search within the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment; and third, the princi­
ples applicable to a government employer’s search of an
employee’s physical office apply with at least the same
force when the employer intrudes on the employee’s pri­
vacy in the electronic sphere.
B
Even if Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in
his text messages, petitioners did not necessarily violate
the Fourth Amendment by obtaining and reviewing the
transcripts. Although as a general matter, warrantless
searches “are per se unreasonable under the Fourth
Amendment,” there are “a few specifically established and
well-delineated exceptions” to that general rule. Katz,
supra, at 357. The Court has held that the “ ‘special
needs’ ” of the workplace justify one such exception.
O’Connor, 480 U. S., at 725 (plurality opinion); id., at 732
(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Von Raab, 489 U. S.,
at 666–667.
Under the approach of the O’Connor plurality, when
conducted for a “noninvestigatory, work-related purpos[e]”
or for the “investigatio[n] of work-related misconduct,” a
government employer’s warrantless search is reasonable if
it is “ ‘justified at its inception’ ” and if “ ‘the measures
adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the
search and not excessively intrusive in light of’ ” the cir­
cumstances giving rise to the search. 480 U. S., at 725–
726. The search here satisfied the standard of the
O’Connor plurality and was reasonable under that ap­
