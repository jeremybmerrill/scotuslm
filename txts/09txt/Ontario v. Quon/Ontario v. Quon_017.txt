Opinion of the Court

proach.
The search was justified at its inception because there
were “reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search
[was] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related pur­
pose.” Id., at 726. As a jury found, Chief Scharf ordered
the search in order to determine whether the character
limit on the City’s contract with Arch Wireless was suffi­
cient to meet the City’s needs. This was, as the Ninth
Circuit noted, a “legitimate work-related rationale.” 529
F. 3d, at 908. The City and OPD had a legitimate interest
in ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay
out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or on
the other hand that the City was not paying for extensive
personal communications.
As for the scope of the search, reviewing the transcripts
was reasonable because it was an efficient and expedient
way to determine whether Quon’s overages were the result
of work-related messaging or personal use. The review
was also not “ ‘excessively intrusive.’ ” O’Connor, supra, at
726 (plurality opinion). Although Quon had gone over his
monthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested
transcripts for only the months of August and September
2002. While it may have been reasonable as well for OPD
to review transcripts of all the months in which Quon
exceeded his allowance, it was certainly reasonable for
OPD to review messages for just two months in order to
obtain a large enough sample to decide whether the char­
acter limits were efficacious. And it is worth noting that
during his internal affairs investigation, McMahon re­
dacted all messages Quon sent while off duty, a measure
which reduced the intrusiveness of any further review of
the transcripts.
Furthermore, and again on the assumption that Quon
had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of
his messages, the extent of an expectation is relevant to
assessing whether the search was too intrusive. See Von
