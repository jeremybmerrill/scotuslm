PETITIONERS v. JEFF QUON ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 17, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.
Although I join the Court’s opinion in full, I write sepa
rately to highlight that the Court has sensibly declined to
resolve whether the plurality opinion in O’Connor v. Or
tega, 480 U. S. 709 (1987), provides the correct approach to
determining an employee’s reasonable expectation of
privacy. See ante, at 9. Justice Blackmun, writing for the
four dissenting Justices in O’Connor, agreed with JUSTICE
SCALIA that an employee enjoys a reasonable expectation
of privacy in his office. 480 U. S., at 737. But he advo
cated a third approach to the reasonable expectation of
privacy inquiry, separate from those proposed by the
O’Connor plurality and by JUSTICE SCALIA, see ante, at 8.
Recognizing that it is particularly important to safeguard
“a public employee’s expectation of privacy in the work
place” in light of the “reality of work in modern time,” 480
U. S., at 739, which lacks “tidy distinctions” between
workplace and private activities, ibid., Justice Blackmun
argued that “the precise extent of an employee’s expecta
tion of privacy often turns on the nature of the search,” id.,
at 738. And he emphasized that courts should determine
this expectation in light of the specific facts of each par
ticular search, rather than by announcing a categorical
standard. See id., at 741.
For the reasons stated at page 13 of the Court’s opinion,
