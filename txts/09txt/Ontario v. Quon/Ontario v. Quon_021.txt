Opinion of the Court

sages to Jeff Quon. Petitioners and respondents disagree
whether a sender of a text message can have a reasonable
expectation of privacy in a message he knowingly sends to
someone’s employer-provided pager. It is not necessary to
resolve this question in order to dispose of the case, how­
ever. Respondents argue that because “the search was
unreasonable as to Sergeant Quon, it was also unreason­
able as to his correspondents.” Brief for Respondents 60
(some capitalization omitted; boldface deleted). They
make no corollary argument that the search, if reasonable
as to Quon, could nonetheless be unreasonable as to
Quon’s correspondents. See id., at 65–66. In light of this
litigating position and the Court’s conclusion that the
search was reasonable as to Jeff Quon, it necessarily
follows that these other respondents cannot prevail.

Because the search was reasonable, petitioners did not
violate respondents’ Fourth Amendment rights, and the
court below erred by concluding otherwise. The judgment
of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings consis­
tent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
