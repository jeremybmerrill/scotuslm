Opinion of the Court

Later, in the Von Raab decision, the Court explained
that “operational realities” could diminish an employee’s
privacy expectations, and that this diminution could be
taken into consideration when assessing the reasonable­
ness of a workplace search. 489 U. S., at 671. In the two
decades since O’Connor, however, the threshold test for
determining the scope of an employee’s Fourth Amend­
ment rights has not been clarified further. Here, though
they disagree on whether Quon had a reasonable expecta­
tion of privacy, both petitioners and respondents start
from the premise that the O’Connor plurality controls.
See Brief for Petitioners 22–28; Brief for Respondents 25–
32. It is not necessary to resolve whether that premise is
correct. The case can be decided by determining that the
search was reasonable even assuming Quon had a reason­
able expectation of privacy.
The two O’Connor ap­
proaches—the plurality’s and JUSTICE SCALIA’s—therefore
lead to the same result here.

Before turning to the reasonableness of the search, it is
instructive to note the parties’ disagreement over whether
Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The record
does establish that OPD, at the outset, made it clear that
pager messages were not considered private. The City’s
Computer Policy stated that “[u]sers should have no ex­
pectation of privacy or confidentiality when using” City
computers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a. Chief Scharf’s
memo and Duke’s statements made clear that this official
policy extended to text messaging. The disagreement, at
least as respondents see the case, is over whether Duke’s
later statements overrode the official policy. Respondents
contend that because Duke told Quon that an audit would
be unnecessary if Quon paid for the overage, Quon rea­
sonably could expect that the contents of his messages
