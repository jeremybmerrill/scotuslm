ONTARIO v. QUON
STEVENS, J., concurring

it is clear that respondent Jeff Quon, as a law enforcement
officer who served on a SWAT Team, should have under
stood that all of his work-related actions—including all of
his communications on his official pager—were likely to be
subject to public and legal scrutiny. He therefore had only
a limited expectation of privacy in relation to this particu
lar audit of his pager messages. Whether one applies the
reasoning from Justice O’Connor’s opinion, JUSTICE
SCALIA’s concurrence, or Justice Blackmun’s dissent* in
O’Connor, the result is the same: The judgment of the
Court of Appeals in this case must be reversed.

——————
* I do not contend that Justice Blackmun’s opinion is controlling un
der Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977), but neither is his
approach to evaluating a reasonable expectation of privacy foreclosed
by O’Connor. Indeed, his approach to that inquiry led to the conclusion,
shared by JUSTICE SCALIA but not adopted by the O’Connor plurality,
that an employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office.
See O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 718 (1987) (plurality opinion).
But Justice Blackmun would have applied the Fourth Amendment’s
warrant and probable-cause requirements to workplace investigatory
searches, id., at 732 (dissenting opinion), whereas a majority of the
Court rejected that view, see id., at 722, 725 (plurality opinion); id., at
732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). It was that analysis—
regarding the proper standard for evaluating a search when an em
ployee has a reasonable expectation of privacy—that produced the
opposite result in the case. This case does not implicate that debate
because it does not involve an investigatory search. The jury concluded
that the purpose of the audit was to determine whether the character
limits were sufficient for work-related messages. See ante, at 6.
