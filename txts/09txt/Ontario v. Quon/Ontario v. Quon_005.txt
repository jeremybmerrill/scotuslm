JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case involves the assertion by a government em­
ployer of the right, in circumstances to be described, to
read text messages sent and received on a pager the em­
ployer owned and issued to an employee. The employee
contends that the privacy of the messages is protected by
the ban on “unreasonable searches and seizures” found in
the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution,
made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Mapp v. Ohio, 367
U. S. 643 (1961). Though the case touches issues of farreaching significance, the Court concludes it can be re­
solved by settled principles determining when a search is
