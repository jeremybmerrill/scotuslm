ONTARIO v. QUON
Opinion of the Court

being a bill collector.’ ” Id., at 91. Scharf decided to de­
termine whether the existing character limit was too
low—that is, whether officers such as Quon were having to
pay fees for sending work-related messages—or if the
overages were for personal messages. Scharf told Duke to
request transcripts of text messages sent in August and
September by Quon and the other employee who had
exceeded the character allowance.
At Duke’s request, an administrative assistant em­
ployed by OPD contacted Arch Wireless. After verifying
that the City was the subscriber on the accounts, Arch
Wireless provided the desired transcripts. Duke reviewed
the transcripts and discovered that many of the messages
sent and received on Quon’s pager were not work related,
and some were sexually explicit. Duke reported his find­
ings to Scharf, who, along with Quon’s immediate supervi­
sor, reviewed the transcripts himself. After his review,
Scharf referred the matter to OPD’s internal affairs divi­
sion for an investigation into whether Quon was violating
OPD rules by pursuing personal matters while on duty.
The officer in charge of the internal affairs review was
Sergeant Patrick McMahon. Before conducting a review,
McMahon used Quon’s work schedule to redact the tran­
scripts in order to eliminate any messages Quon sent
while off duty. He then reviewed the content of the mes­
sages Quon sent during work hours. McMahon’s report
noted that Quon sent or received 456 messages during
work hours in the month of August 2002, of which no more
than 57 were work related; he sent as many as 80 mes­
sages during a single day at work; and on an average
workday, Quon sent or received 28 messages, of which
only 3 were related to police business. The report con­
cluded that Quon had violated OPD rules. Quon was
allegedly disciplined.
