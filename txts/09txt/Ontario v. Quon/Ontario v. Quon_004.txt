ONTARIO v. QUON
Syllabus
and it was not excessively intrusive in light of that justification, the
search would be “regarded as reasonable and normal in the private
employer context” and thereby satisfy the approach of JUSTICE
SCALIA’s concurrence, id., at 732. Conversely, the Ninth Circuit’s
“least intrusive” means approach was inconsistent with controlling
precedents. See, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S.
646, 663. Pp. 12–16.
(c) Whether the other respondents can have a reasonable expecta
tion of privacy in their text messages to Quon need not be resolved.
They argue that because the search was unreasonable as to Quon, it
was also unreasonable as to them, but they make no corollary argu
ment that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be
unreasonable as to them. Given this litigating position and the
Court’s conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Quon, these
other respondents cannot prevail. Pp. 16–17.

529 F. 3d 892, reversed and remanded.
