ONTARIO v. QUON
Opinion of the Court

geant and member of OPD’s Special Weapons and Tactics
(SWAT) Team. The City, OPD, and OPD’s Chief, Lloyd
Scharf, are petitioners here. As will be discussed, two
respondents share the last name Quon. In this opinion
“Quon” refers to Jeff Quon, for the relevant events mostly
revolve around him.
In October 2001, the City acquired 20 alphanumeric
pagers capable of sending and receiving text messages.
Arch Wireless Operating Company provided wireless
service for the pagers. Under the City’s service contract
with Arch Wireless, each pager was allotted a limited
number of characters sent or received each month. Usage
in excess of that amount would result in an additional fee.
The City issued pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team
members in order to help the SWAT Team mobilize and
respond to emergency situations.
Before acquiring the pagers, the City announced a
“Computer Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy” (Computer
Policy) that applied to all employees. Among other provi­

Internet use, with or without notice. Users should have no
expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these
resources.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a. In March 2000,
Quon signed a statement acknowledging that he had read
and understood the Computer Policy.
The Computer Policy did not apply, on its face, to text
messaging. Text messages share similarities with e-mails,
but the two differ in an important way. In this case, for
instance, an e-mail sent on a City computer was transmit­
ted through the City’s own data servers, but a text mes­
sage sent on one of the City’s pagers was transmitted
using wireless radio frequencies from an individual pager
to a receiving station owned by Arch Wireless. It was
routed through Arch Wireless’ computer network, where it
remained until the recipient’s pager or cellular telephone
