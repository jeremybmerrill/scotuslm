Opinion of SCALIA, J.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

CITY OF ONTARIO, CALIFORNIA, ET AL., 

PETITIONERS v. JEFF QUON ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 17, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I join the Court’s opinion except for Part III–A. I con
tinue to believe that the “operational realities” rubric for
determining the Fourth Amendment’s application to pub
lic employees invented by the plurality in O’Connor v.
Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 717 (1987), is standardless and
unsupported. Id., at 729–732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in
judgment). In this case, the proper threshold inquiry
should be not whether the Fourth Amendment applies to
messages on public employees’ employer-issued pagers,
but whether it applies in general to such messages on
employer-issued pagers. See id., at 731.
Here, however, there is no need to answer that thresh
old question. Even accepting at face value Quon’s and his
co-plaintiffs’ claims that the Fourth Amendment applies to
their messages, the city’s search was reasonable, and thus
did not violate the Amendment. See id., at 726 (plurality
opinion); id., at 732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).
Since it is unnecessary to decide whether the Fourth
Amendment applies, it is unnecessary to resolve which
approach in O’Connor controls: the plurality’s or mine.*
