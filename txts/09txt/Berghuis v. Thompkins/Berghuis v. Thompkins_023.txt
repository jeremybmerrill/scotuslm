Opinion of the Court

§2254(d). Courts can, however, deny writs of habeas
corpus under §2254 by engaging in de novo review when it
is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, because a
habeas petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas
corpus if his or her claim is rejected on de novo review, see
§2254(a).
It seems doubtful that failure to request the instruction
about the earlier acquittal or conviction was deficient
representation; but on the assumption that it was, on this
record Thompkins cannot show prejudice. The record
establishes that it was not reasonably likely that the
instruction would have made any difference in light of all
the other evidence of guilt. The surviving victim, Freder
ick France, identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the
identification was supported by a photograph taken from a
surveillance camera. Thompkins’s friend Omar Stephens
testified that Thompkins confessed to him during a phone
conversation, and the details of that confession were cor
roborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped the van
and abandoned it after the shooting. The jury, moreover,
was capable of assessing Purifoy’s credibility, as it was
instructed to do. The jury in Thompkins’s case could have
concluded that the earlier jury in Purifoy’s case made a
mistake, or alternatively, that Purifoy was not in fact
guilty of the crime for which he had been charged. There
was ample evidence in the record to support Thompkins’s
guilt under either theory, and his jury was instructed to
weigh all of the evidence in determining whether there
was guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Under our de novo
review of this record, Thompkins cannot show prejudice.
