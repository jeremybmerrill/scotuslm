SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

statement is made is strong evidence that the accused
did not validly waive his rights. In these circum­
stances the fact that the individual eventually made a
statement is consistent with the conclusion that the
compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced
him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a

This Court’s decisions subsequent to Miranda have
emphasized the prosecution’s “heavy burden” in proving
waiver. See, e.g., Tague v. Louisiana, 444 U. S. 469, 470–

obtained statements after advising Butler of his rights and
confirming that he understood them. When presented
with a written waiver-of-rights form, Butler told the
agents, “ ‘I will talk to you but I am not signing any form.’ ”

concluding that the statements were inadmissible, we
quoted at length portions of the Miranda opinion repro­

or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or
of the right to counsel” is not “inevitably . . . sufficient to
establish waiver,” emphasizing that “[t]he question is . . .
