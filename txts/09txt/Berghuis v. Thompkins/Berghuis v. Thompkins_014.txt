BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
Opinion of the Court

an accused’s unclear intent and face the consequence of
suppression “if they guess wrong.” Id., at 461. Suppres
sion of a voluntary confession in these circumstances
would place a significant burden on society’s interest in
prosecuting criminal activity. See id., at 459–461; Moran
v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 427 (1986). Treating an am
biguous or equivocal act, omission, or statement as an
invocation of Miranda rights “might add marginally to
Miranda’s goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in
custodial interrogation.” Burbine, 475 U. S., at 425. But
“as Miranda holds, full comprehension of the rights to
remain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to
dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation
process.” Id., at 427; see Davis, supra, at 460.
Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent
or that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he
made either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he
would have invoked his “ ‘right to cut off questioning.’ ”
Mosley, supra, at 103 (quoting Miranda, supra, at 474).
Here he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to re
main silent.
B
We next consider whether Thompkins waived his right
to remain silent. Even absent the accused’s invocation of
the right to remain silent, the accused’s statement during
a custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial unless the
prosecution can establish that the accused “in fact know
ingly and voluntarily waived [Miranda] rights” when
making the statement. Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. The
waiver inquiry “has two distinct dimensions”: waiver must
be “voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free
and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion,
or deception,” and “made with a full awareness of both the
nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences
of the decision to abandon it.” Burbine, supra, at 421.
