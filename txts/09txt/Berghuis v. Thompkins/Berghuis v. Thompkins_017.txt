Although Miranda imposes on the police a rule that is
both formalistic and practical when it prevents them from
interrogating suspects without first providing them with a
Miranda warning, see Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427, it does
not impose a formalistic waiver procedure that a suspect
must follow to relinquish those rights. As a general
proposition, the law can presume that an individual who,
with a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a
manner inconsistent with their exercise has made a delib
erate choice to relinquish the protection those rights af
ford. See, e.g., Butler, supra, at 372–376; Connelly, supra,
at 169–170 (“There is obviously no reason to require more
in the way of a ‘voluntariness’ inquiry in the Miranda
waiver context than in the [due process] confession con
text”). The Court’s cases have recognized that a waiver of
Miranda rights need only meet the standard of Johnson v.
Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938). See Butler, supra, at
374–375; Miranda, supra, at 475–476 (applying Zerbst
standard of intentional relinquishment of a known right).
As Butler recognized, 441 U. S., at 375–376, Miranda
rights can therefore be waived through means less formal
than a typical waiver on the record in a courtroom, cf. Fed.
Rule Crim. Proc. 11, given the practical constraints and
necessities of interrogation and the fact that Miranda’s
main protection lies in advising defendants of their rights,
see Davis, 512 U. S., at 460; Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427.
The record in this case shows that Thompkins waived
his right to remain silent. There is no basis in this case to
conclude that he did not understand his rights; and on
these facts it follows that he chose not to invoke or rely on
those rights when he did speak. First, there is no conten
tion that Thompkins did not understand his rights; and
from this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he
spoke. See id., at 421. There was more than enough
evidence in the record to conclude that Thompkins under
