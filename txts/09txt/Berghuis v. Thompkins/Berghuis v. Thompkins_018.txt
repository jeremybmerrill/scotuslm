BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
Opinion of the Court

stood his Miranda rights. Thompkins received a written
copy of the Miranda warnings; Detective Helgert deter
mined that Thompkins could read and understand Eng
lish; and Thompkins was given time to read the warnings.
Thompkins, furthermore, read aloud the fifth warning,
which stated that “you have the right to decide at any time
before or during questioning to use your right to remain
silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are
being questioned.” Brief for Petitioner 60 (capitalization
omitted). He was thus aware that his right to remain
silent would not dissipate after a certain amount of time
and that police would have to honor his right to be silent
and his right to counsel during the whole course of inter

asserted at any time. Helgert, moreover, read the warn

Second, Thompkins’s answer to Detective Helgert’s
question about whether Thompkins prayed to God for
forgiveness for shooting the victim is a “course of conduct
indicating waiver” of the right to remain silent. Butler,
supra, at 373. If Thompkins wanted to remain silent, he
could have said nothing in response to Helgert’s questions,
or he could have unambiguously invoked his Miranda
rights and ended the interrogation. The fact that Thomp

Miranda warning does not overcome the fact that he
engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver. Police
are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time.
Thompkins’s answer to Helgert’s question about praying
to God for forgiveness for shooting the victim was suffi

is confirmed by the fact that before then Thompkins
had given sporadic answers to questions throughout the
interrogation.
Third, there is no evidence that Thompkins’s statement
was coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Thompkins does
