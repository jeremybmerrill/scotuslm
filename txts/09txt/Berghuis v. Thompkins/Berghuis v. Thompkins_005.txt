MARY BERGHUIS, WARDEN, PETITIONER v. VAN 

CHESTER THOMPKINS 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[June 1, 2010]


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir
cuit, in a habeas corpus proceeding challenging a Michi
gan conviction for first-degree murder and certain other
offenses, ruled that there had been two separate constitu
tional errors in the trial that led to the jury’s guilty ver
dict. First, the Court of Appeals determined that a state
ment by the accused, relied on at trial by the prosecution,
had been elicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384
U. S. 436 (1966). Second, it found that failure to ask for
an instruction relating to testimony from an accomplice
was ineffective assistance by defense counsel. See Strick
land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Both of these
contentions had been rejected in Michigan courts and in
the habeas corpus proceedings before the United States
District Court. Certiorari was granted to review the deci
sion by the Court of Appeals on both points. The warden
of a Michigan correctional facility is the petitioner here,
and Van Chester Thompkins, who was convicted, is the
respondent.
