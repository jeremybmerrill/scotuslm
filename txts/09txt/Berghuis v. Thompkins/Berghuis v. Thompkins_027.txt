BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

explained as conveying to Thompkins that “this was his
opportunity to explain his side [of the story]” because
“[e]verybody else, including [his] co-[d]efendants, had
given their version,” and asking him “[w]ho is going to
speak up for you if you don’t speak up for yourself?” Id., at
10a, 21a. Yet, Helgert confirmed that the “only thing
[Thompkins said] relative to his involvement [in the shoot­
ing]” occurred near the end of the interview—i.e., in re­
sponse to the questions about God. Id., at 10a–11a (em­
phasis added). The only other responses Helgert could
remember Thompkins giving were that “ ‘[h]e didn’t want
a peppermint’ ” and “ ‘the chair that he was sitting in was
hard.’ ” Id., at 152a. Nevertheless, the Michigan court
concluded on this record that Thompkins had not invoked
his right to remain silent because “he continued to talk
with the officer, albeit sporadically,” and that he voluntar­
ily waived that right. App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.
Thompkins’ federal habeas petition is governed by
AEDPA, under which a federal court may not grant the
writ unless the state court’s adjudication of the merits of
the claim at issue “was contrary to, or involved an unrea­
sonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as
determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,”
or “was based on an unreasonable determination of the
facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court
proceeding.” §§2254(d)(1), (2).
The relevant clearly established federal law for purposes
of §2254(d)(1) begins with our landmark Miranda decision,
which “g[a]ve force to the Constitution’s protection against
compelled self-incrimination” by establishing “ ‘certain
procedural safeguards that require police to advise crimi­
nal suspects of their rights under the Fifth and Four­
teenth Amendments before commencing custodial interro­
gation,’ ” Florida v. Powell, 559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010)
(slip op., at 7–8) (quoting Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S.
195, 201 (1989)). Miranda prescribed the now-familiar
