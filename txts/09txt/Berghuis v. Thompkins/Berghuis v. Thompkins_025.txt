BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

law the Court reaches out to decide; and because the
Court’s answers to those questions do not result from a
faithful application of our prior decisions, I respectfully

We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which held that
Thompkins was entitled to habeas relief under both
Miranda and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668
(1984). 547 F. 3d 572 (2008). As to the Miranda claims,
Thompkins argues first that through his conduct during
the 3-hour custodial interrogation he effectively invoked
his right to remain silent, requiring police to cut off ques­

Mosley, 423 U. S. 96 (1975). Thompkins also contends his
statements were in any case inadmissible because the
prosecution failed to meet its heavy burden under
Miranda of proving that he knowingly and intelligently
waived his right to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit
agreed with Thompkins as to waiver and declined to reach
the question of invocation. 547 F. 3d, at 583–584, n. 4. In
my view, even if Thompkins cannot prevail on his invoca­
tion claim under AEDPA, he is entitled to relief as to
waiver. Because I would affirm the judgment of the Sixth
Circuit on that ground, I would not reach Thompkins’
claim that he received constitutionally ineffective assis­
tance of counsel.
The strength of Thompkins’ Miranda claims depends in
large part on the circumstances of the 3-hour interroga­

record evidence that Thompkins remained almost com­
pletely silent and unresponsive throughout that session.
One of the interrogating officers, Detective Helgert, testi­
