Opinion of the Court

kins’s trial.
After Purifoy’s trial had ended—but before Thompkins’s
trial began—Purifoy sent Thompkins some letters. The
letters expressed Purifoy’s disappointment that Thomp
kins’s family thought Purifoy was a “snitch” and a “rat.”
Id., at 179a–180a. In one letter Purifoy offered to send a
copy of his trial transcript to Thompkins as proof that
Purifoy did not place the blame on Thompkins for the
shooting. Id., at 180a. The letters also contained state

and Thompkins to say they dropped to the floor when the
shooting started. Id., at 187a–189a.
During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested

Thompkins shoot the victims:
“Did Eric Purifoy’s Jury make the right decision? I’m
not here to judge that. You are not bound by what his
Jury found. Take his testimony for what it was, [a]
twisted attempt to help not just an acquaintance but
his tight buddy.” Id., at 202a.
Defense counsel did not object. Defense counsel also did

consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy’s trial only to
assess Purifoy’s credibility, not to establish Thompkins’s
guilt.
The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts. He was
sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Thompkins’s appellate counsel. The trial court rejected
