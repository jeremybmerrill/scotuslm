BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Miranda safeguards. The underlying constitutional guar­
antee against self-incrimination reflects “many of our
fundamental values and most noble aspirations,” our
society’s “preference for an accusatorial rather than an
inquisitorial system of criminal justice”; a “fear that self­
incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane
treatment and abuses” and a resulting “distrust of self­
deprecatory statements”; and a realization that while the
privilege is “sometimes a shelter to the guilty, [it] is often
a protection to the innocent.” Withrow v. Williams, 507
U. S. 680, 692 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).
For these reasons, we have observed, a criminal law sys­

long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses than
a system relying on independent investigation.” Ibid.

against ‘the possibility of unreliable statements in every
instance of in-custody interrogation,’ ” Miranda’s prophy­

self.’ ” 507 U. S., at 692 (quoting Johnson v. New Jersey,
384 U. S. 719, 730 (1966); Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412
U. S. 218, 240 (1973)). Today’s decision bodes poorly for
the fundamental principles that Miranda protects.

Thompkins separately argues that his conduct during
the interrogation invoked his right to remain silent, re­
quiring police to terminate questioning. Like the Sixth
Circuit, I would not reach this question because Thomp­
kins is in any case entitled to relief as to waiver. But even
if Thompkins would not prevail on his invocation claim
under AEDPA’s deferential standard of review, I cannot
agree with the Court’s much broader ruling that a suspect
must clearly invoke his right to silence by speaking.
Taken together with the Court’s reformulation of the
prosecution’s burden of proof as to waiver, today’s novel
