SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ment that police “scrupulously hono[r]” a suspect’s right to
cut off questioning is a more faithful application of our
precedents than the Court’s awkward and needless exten­
sion of Davis.

Today’s decision turns Miranda upside down. Criminal
suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to
remain silent—which, counterintuitively, requires them to
speak. At the same time, suspects will be legally pre­
sumed to have waived their rights even if they have given
no clear expression of their intent to do so. Those results,
in my view, find no basis in Miranda or our subsequent
cases and are inconsistent with the fair-trial principles on
which those precedents are grounded. Today’s broad new
rules are all the more unfortunate because they are un­
necessary to the disposition of the case before us. I re­
spectfully dissent.
