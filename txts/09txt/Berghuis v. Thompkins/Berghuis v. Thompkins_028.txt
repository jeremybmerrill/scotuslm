SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

warnings that police must administer prior to questioning.
See 384 U. S., at 479; ante, at 8. Miranda and our subse­
quent cases also require police to “respect the accused’s
decision to exercise the rights outlined in the warnings.”
Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 420 (1986). “If [an]
individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or
during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent” or if
he “states that he wants an attorney,” the interrogation
“must cease.” 384 U. S., at 473–474.
Even when warnings have been administered and a
suspect has not affirmatively invoked his rights, state­
ments made in custodial interrogation may not be admit­
ted as part of the prosecution’s case in chief “unless and
until” the prosecution demonstrates that an individual
“knowingly and intelligently waive[d] [his] rights.” Id., at
479; accord, ante, at 10. “[A] heavy burden rests on the
government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly
and intelligently waived his privilege against self­
incrimination and his right to retained or appointed coun­
sel.” Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475. The government must
satisfy the “high standar[d] of proof for the waiver of
constitutional rights [set forth in] Johnson v. Zerbst, 304
U. S. 458 (1938).” Ibid.
The question whether a suspect has validly waived his
right is “entirely distinct” as a matter of law from whether
he invoked that right. Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98
(1984) (per curiam). The questions are related, however,
in terms of the practical effect on the exercise of a sus­
pect’s rights. A suspect may at any time revoke his prior
waiver of rights—or, closer to the facts of this case, guard
against the possibility of a future finding that he implicitly
waived his rights—by invoking the rights and thereby
requiring the police to cease questioning. Accord, ante, at
16.
