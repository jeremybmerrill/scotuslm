BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

culpatory responses relating to a different crime after
administering fresh Miranda warnings. The different
effects of invoking the rights are consistent with distinct
standards for invocation. To the extent Mosley contem­
plates a more flexible form of prophylaxis than Edwards—
and, in particular, does not categorically bar police from
reapproaching a suspect who has invoked his right to
remain silent—Davis’ concern about “ ‘wholly irrational
obstacles’ ” to police investigation applies with less force.
In addition, the suspect’s equivocal reference to a lawyer
in Davis occurred only after he had given express oral and
written waivers of his rights. Davis’ holding is explicitly
predicated on that fact. See 512 U. S., at 461 (“We there­
fore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the
Miranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue
questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests
an attorney”). The Court ignores this aspect of Davis, as
well as the decisions of numerous federal and state courts
declining to apply a clear-statement rule when a suspect
has not previously given an express waiver of rights.7
In my mind, a more appropriate standard for addressing
a suspect’s ambiguous invocation of the right to remain
silent is the constraint Mosley places on questioning a
suspect who has invoked that right: The suspect’s “ ‘right
to cut off questioning’ ” must be “ ‘scrupulously honored.’ ”
See 423 U. S., at 104. Such a standard is necessarily
precautionary and fact specific. The rule would acknowl­
