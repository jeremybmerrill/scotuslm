BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

that differentiating “clear” from “ambiguous” statements
is often a subjective inquiry. Even if some of the cited
decisions are themselves in tension with Davis’ admoni­
tion that a suspect need not “ ‘speak with the discrimina­
tion of an Oxford don’ ” to invoke his rights, 512 U. S., at
459 (quoting id., at 476 (opinion of Souter, J.)), they dem­
onstrate that today’s decision will significantly burden the
exercise of the right to silence. Notably, when a suspect
“understands his (expressed) wishes to have been ignored
. . . in contravention of the ‘rights’ just read to him by his
interrogator, he may well see further objection as futile
and confession (true or not) as the only way to end his
interrogation.” Id., at 472–473.

1, ¶¶96–98, 839 N. E. 2d 362, 373 (finding ambiguous “ ‘I don’t even like
talking about it man . . . I told you . . . what happened, man . . . I mean,
I don’t even want to, you know what I’m saying, discuss no more about
it, man’ ”); State v. Speed, 265 Kan. 26, 37–38, 961 P. 2d 13, 24 (1998)
(finding ambiguous “ ‘[a]nd since we’re not getting anywhere I just ask
you guys to go ahead and get this over with and go ahead and lock me
up and let me go and deal with Sedgwick County, I’m ready to go to
Sedgwick County, let’s go’ ”); State v. Markwardt, 2007 WI App 242, ¶1,
306 Wis. 2d 420, 424, 742 N. W. 2d 546, 548 (“ ‘Then put me in jail.
Just get me out of here. I don’t want to sit here anymore, alright? I’ve
been through enough today’ ” ambiguous because it could be construed
as part of “ ‘thrust-and-parry’ ” between suspect and interrogator); State
v. Deen, 42,403, pp. 2–4 (La. App. 4/27/07), 953 So. 2d 1057, 1058–1060
(“ ‘Okay, if you’re implying that I’ve done it, I wish to not say any more.
I’d like to be done with this. Cause that’s just ridiculous. I wish I’d . . .
don’t wish to answer any more questions’ ” ambiguous because condi­
tioned on officer’s implication that suspect committed specific assault).
Courts have also construed statements as expressing a desire to remain
silent only about a particular subject. See, e.g., People v. Silva, 45 Cal.
3d 604, 629–630, 754 P. 2d 1070, 1083–1084 (1988) (“ ‘I really don’t
want to talk about that’ ” only conveyed unwillingness to discuss certain
subjects). See generally Strauss, The Sounds of Silence: Reconsidering
the Invocation of the Right to Remain Silent under Miranda, 17 Wm. &
Mary Bill Rights J. 773, 788–802 (2009) (surveying cases).
