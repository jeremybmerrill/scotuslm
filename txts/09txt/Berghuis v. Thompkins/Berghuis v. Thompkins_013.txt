Opinion of the Court

“critical safeguard” when the accused invokes his or her
“ ‘right to cut off questioning’ ” (quoting Miranda, supra, at
474, 479)).
This argument is unpersuasive. In the context of invok
ing the Miranda right to counsel, the Court in Davis v.
United States, 512 U. S. 452, 459 (1994), held that a sus
pect must do so “unambiguously.” If an accused makes a
statement concerning the right to counsel “that is ambigu
ous or equivocal” or makes no statement, the police are not
required to end the interrogation, ibid., or ask questions to
clarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her
Miranda rights, 512 U. S., at 461–462.
The Court has not yet stated whether an invocation of
the right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal,
but there is no principled reason to adopt different stan
dards for determining when an accused has invoked the
Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to
counsel at issue in Davis. See, e.g., Solem v. Stumes, 465
U. S. 638, 648 (1984) (“[M]uch of the logic and language of
[Mosley],” which discussed the Miranda right to remain
silent, “could be applied to the invocation of the [Miranda
right to counsel]”). Both protect the privilege against
compulsory self-incrimination, Miranda, supra, at 467–
473, by requiring an interrogation to cease when either
right is invoked, Mosley, supra, at 103 (citing Miranda,
supra, at 474); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 719
(1979).
There is good reason to require an accused who wants to
invoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambigu
ously. A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of
Miranda rights results in an objective inquiry that
“avoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to
officers” on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis,
512 U. S., at 458–459. If an ambiguous act, omission, or
statement could require police to end the interrogation,
police would be required to make difficult decisions about
