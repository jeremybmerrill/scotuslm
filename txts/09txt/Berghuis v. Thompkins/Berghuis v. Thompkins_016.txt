BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
Opinion of the Court

“heavy burden” to show waiver, 384 U. S., at 475, in ac
cord with usual principles of determining waiver, which
can include waiver implied from all the circumstances.
See Butler, supra, at 373, 376. And in a later case, the
Court stated that this “heavy burden” is not more than the
burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of the
evidence. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).
The prosecution therefore does not need to show that a
waiver of Miranda rights was express. An “implicit
waiver” of the “right to remain silent” is sufficient to admit
a suspect’s statement into evidence. Butler, supra, at 376.
Butler made clear that a waiver of Miranda rights may be
implied through “the defendant’s silence, coupled with an
understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indi
cating waiver.” 441 U. S., at 373. The Court in Butler
therefore “retreated” from the “language and tenor of the
Miranda opinion,” which “suggested that the Court would
require that a waiver . . . be ‘specifically made.’ ” Con
necticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 531–532 (1987) (Bren
nan, J., concurring in judgment).
If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was
given and the accused made an uncoerced statement, this
showing, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate “a
valid waiver” of Miranda rights. Miranda, supra, at 475.
The prosecution must make the additional showing that
the accused understood these rights. See Colorado v.
Spring, 479 U. S. 564, 573–575 (1987); Barrett, supra, at
530; Burbine, supra, at 421–422. Cf. Tague v. Louisiana,
444 U. S. 469, 469, 471 (1980) (per curiam) (no evidence
that accused understood his Miranda rights); Carnley v.
Cochran, 369 U. S. 506, 516 (1962) (government could not
show that accused “understandingly” waived his right to
counsel in light of “silent record”). Where the prosecution
shows that a Miranda warning was given and that it was
understood by the accused, an accused’s uncoerced state
ment establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain
