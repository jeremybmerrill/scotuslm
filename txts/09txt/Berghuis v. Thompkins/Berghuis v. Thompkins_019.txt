Opinion of the Court

not claim that police threatened or injured him during the
interrogation or that he was in any way fearful. The
interrogation was conducted in a standard-sized room in
the middle of the afternoon. It is true that apparently he
was in a straight-backed chair for three hours, but there is
no authority for the proposition that an interrogation of
this length is inherently coercive. Indeed, even where
interrogations of greater duration were held to be im
proper, they were accompanied, as this one was not, by
other facts indicating coercion, such as an incapacitated
and sedated suspect, sleep and food deprivation, and
threats. Cf. Connelly, 479 U. S., at 163–164, n. 1. The fact
that Helgert’s question referred to Thompkins’s religious
beliefs also did not render Thompkins’s statement invol
untary. “[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not con
cerned ‘with moral and psychological pressures to confess
emanating from sources other than official coercion.’ ” Id.,
at 170 (quoting Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 305
(1985)). In these circumstances, Thompkins knowingly
and voluntarily made a statement to police, so he waived
his right to remain silent.
C
Thompkins next argues that, even if his answer to
Detective Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to
remain silent, the police were not allowed to question him
until they obtained a waiver first. Butler forecloses this
argument. The Butler Court held that courts can infer a
waiver of Miranda rights “from the actions and words of
the person interrogated.” 441 U. S., at 373. This principle
would be inconsistent with a rule that requires a waiver at
the outset. The Butler Court thus rejected the rule pro
posed by the Butler dissent, which would have “requir[ed]
the police to obtain an express waiver of [Miranda rights]
before proceeding with interrogation.” Id., at 379 (Bren
nan, J., dissenting). This holding also makes sense given
