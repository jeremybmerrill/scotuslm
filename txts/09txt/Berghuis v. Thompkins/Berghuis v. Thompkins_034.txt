SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

If, in the Court’s view, the Michigan court did not unrea­
sonably apply our Miranda precedents in denying Thomp­
kins relief, it should simply say so and reverse the Sixth
Circuit’s judgment on that ground. “It is a fundamental
rule of judicial restraint . . . that this Court will not reach
constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of
deciding them.” Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold
Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U. S. 138, 157
(1984). Consistent with that rule, we have frequently
declined to address questions beyond what is necessary to
resolve a case under AEDPA. See, e.g., Tyler v. Cain, 533
U. S. 656, 667–668 (2001) (declining to address question
where any statement by this Court would be “dictum” in
light of AEDPA’s statutory constraints on habeas review);
cf. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (noting that
Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), “made no new
law” because the “case was before us on habeas review”).
No necessity exists to justify the Court’s broad announce­
ment today.
The Court concludes that when Miranda warnings have
been given and understood, “an accused’s uncoerced
statement establishes an implied waiver of the right to
remain silent.” Ante, at 12–13. More broadly still, the
Court states that, “[a]s a general proposition, the law can
presume that an individual who, with a full understanding
of his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with
their exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish
the protection those rights afford.” Ante, at 13.
These principles flatly contradict our longstanding
views that “a valid waiver will not be presumed . . . simply
from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually
obtained,” Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475, and that “[t]he
courts must presume that a defendant did not waive his
rights,” Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. Indeed, we have in the
past summarily reversed a state-court decision that in­
verted Miranda’s antiwaiver presumption, characterizing
