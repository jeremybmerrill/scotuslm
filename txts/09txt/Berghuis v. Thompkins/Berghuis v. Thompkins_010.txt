BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
Opinion of the Court

the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for fail
ure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding the outcome
of Purifoy’s trial, reasoning that this did not prejudice
Thompkins. Id., at 236a.
Thompkins appealed this ruling, along with the trial
court’s refusal to suppress his pretrial statements under
Miranda. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the
Miranda claim, ruling that Thompkins had not invoked
his right to remain silent and had waived it. It also re
jected the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, finding
that Thompkins failed to show that evidence of Purifoy’s

corpus unless the state court’s adjudication of the merits
was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application
of, clearly established Federal law.”
28 U. S. C.
§2254(d)(1). The District Court reasoned that Thompkins
did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not
coerced into making statements during the interrogation.
It held further that the Michigan Court of Appeals was not
unreasonable in determining that Thompkins had waived
his right to remain silent.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
reversed, ruling for Thompkins on both his Miranda and
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. 547 F. 3d 572
(2008). The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court, in
rejecting Thompkins’s Miranda claim, unreasonably ap
