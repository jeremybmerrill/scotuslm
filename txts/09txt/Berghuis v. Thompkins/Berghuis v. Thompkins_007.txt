Opinion of the Court

talization omitted).
Helgert asked Thompkins to read the fifth warning out
loud. App. 8a. Thompkins complied. Helgert later said
this was to ensure that Thompkins could read, and Hel
gert concluded that Thompkins understood English. Id.,
at 9a. Helgert then read the other four Miranda warnings
out loud and asked Thompkins to sign the form to demon

want a peppermint” that was offered to him by the police
and that the chair he was “sitting in was hard.” Id., at
152a.

11a, 153a. Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert and
said “Yes,” as his eyes “well[ed] up with tears.” Id., at 11a.
Helgert asked, “Do you pray to God?” Thompkins said
“Yes.” Id., at 11a, 153a. Helgert asked, “Do you pray to
