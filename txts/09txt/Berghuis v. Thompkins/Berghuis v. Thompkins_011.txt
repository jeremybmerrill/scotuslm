Opinion of the Court

plied clearly established federal law and based its decision
on an unreasonable determination of the facts. See 28
U. S. C. §2254(d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged
that a waiver of the right to remain silent need not be
express, as it can be “ ‘inferred from the actions and words
of the person interrogated.’ ” 547 F. 3d, at 582 (quoting
North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979)). The
panel held, nevertheless, that the state court was unrea
sonable in finding an implied waiver in the circumstances
here. The Court of Appeals found that the state court
unreasonably determined the facts because “the evidence
demonstrates that Thompkins was silent for two hours
and forty-five minutes.” 547 F. 3d, at 586. According to
the Court of Appeals, Thompkins’s “persistent silence for
nearly three hours in response to questioning and re
peated invitations to tell his side of the story offered a
clear and unequivocal message to the officers: Thompkins
did not wish to waive his rights.” Id., at 588.
The Court of Appeals next determined that the state
court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law
by rejecting Thompkins’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel
claim based on counsel’s failure to ask for a limiting in
struction regarding Purifoy’s acquittal. The Court of
Appeals asserted that because Thompkins’s central strat
egy was to pin the blame on Purifoy, there was a reason
able probability that the result of Thompkins’s trial would
have been different if there had been a limiting instruction
regarding Purifoy’s acquittal.
We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).

contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,
