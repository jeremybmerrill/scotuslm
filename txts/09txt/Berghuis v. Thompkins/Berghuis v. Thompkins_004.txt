BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS
Syllabus
standard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show preju
dice under de novo review, a more favorable standard for him. De
novo review can be used in this case because a habeas petitioner will
not be entitled to relief if his or her claim is rejected on de novo re
view. See §2254(a). Assuming that failure to request a limiting in
struction here was deficient representation, Thompkins cannot show
prejudice, for the record shows that it was not reasonably likely that
such an instruction would have made any difference in light of other
evidence of guilt. The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the
shooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance cam
era photograph. A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to him,
and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that
Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the shooting. The
jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoy’s credibility, as it
was instructed to do. Pp. 17–19.

547 F. 3d 572, reversed and remanded.
KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,
C. J., and SCALIA, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., joined. SOTOMAYOR, J., filed
a dissenting opinion, in which STEVENS, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ.,
joined.
