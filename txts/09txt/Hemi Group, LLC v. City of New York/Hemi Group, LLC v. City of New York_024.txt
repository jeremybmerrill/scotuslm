HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK
BREYER, J., dissenting

II 

A

The majority asks whether New York City stated a valid
cause of action in alleging that it lost tobacco tax revenue
“by reason of” Hemi’s unlawful misrepresentations. The
facts just set forth make clear that we must answer that
question affirmatively. For one thing, no one denies that
Hemi’s misrepresentation was a “but-for” condition of New
York City’s loss. In the absence of the misrepresentation,
i.e., had Hemi told New York State the truth about its
New York City customers, New York City would have
written letters to the purchasers and obtained a signifi­
cant share of the tobacco taxes buyers owed.
For another thing, New York City’s losses are “reasona­
bly foreseeable” results of the misrepresentation. It is
foreseeable that, without the name/address/purchase
information, New York City would not be able to write
successful dunning letters, and it is foreseeable that, with
that information, it would be able to write successful
dunning letters. Indeed, that is a natural inference from,
among other things, the complaint’s assertion that Hemi
advertised that it did not “report” sales information to
“State taxing authorit[ies].” See, e.g., Smith v. Bolles, 132
U. S. 125, 130 (1889) (for causation purposes, “ ‘those
results are proximate which the wrong-doer from his
position must have contemplated as the probable conse­
quence of his fraud or breach of contract’ ” (quoting Crater
v. Binninger, 33 N. J. L. 513, 518 (Ct. Errors and Appeals
1869)); see also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.
