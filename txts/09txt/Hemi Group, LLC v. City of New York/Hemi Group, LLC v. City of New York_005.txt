HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK
Opinion of the Court

Appeals’ decision to the contrary.
I

A

This case arises from a motion to dismiss, and so we
accept as true the factual allegations in the City’s second
amended complaint. See Leatherman v. Tarrant County
Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S.
163, 164 (1993).
New York State authorizes the City of New York to
impose its own taxes on cigarettes. N. Y. Unconsol. Law
Ann. §9436(1) (West Supp. 2009). Under that authority,
the City has levied a $1.50 per pack tax on each standard
pack of cigarettes possessed within the City for sale or use.
N. Y. C. Admin. Code §11–1302(a) (2008); see also Record
A1016. When purchasers buy cigarettes from in-state
vendors, the seller is responsible for charging, collecting,
and remitting the tax. N. Y. Tax Law Ann. §471(2) (West
Supp. 2009). Out-of-state vendors, however, are not.

541 F. 3d 425, 432–433 (CA2 2008). Instead, the City is
responsible for recovering, directly from the customers,
use taxes on cigarettes sold outside New York. That can
be difficult, as those customers are often reluctant to pay
and tough to track down. One way the City can gather
information that would assist it in collecting the back
taxes is through the Jenkins Act, 63 Stat. 884, as amended
by 69 Stat. 627. That Act requires out-of-state cigarette
sellers to register and to file a report with state tobacco
tax administrators listing the name, address, and quantity
of cigarettes purchased by state residents. 15 U. S. C.
§§375–378.
New York State and the City have executed an agree­
ment under which both parties undertake to “cooperate
fully with each other and keep each other fully and
promptly informed with reference to any person or trans­
