BREYER, J., dissenting

355 (quoting McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 358
(1987)). Such an entitlement “has long been thought to be
a species of property.” 544 U. S., at 356 (citing 3 W. Black­
stone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 153–155
(1768)). And “fraud at common law included a scheme to
deprive a victim of his entitlement to money.” 544 U. S.,
at 356. We observed that tax evasion “inflict[s] an eco­
nomic injury no less than” the “embezzle[ment] [of] funds
from the . . . treasury.” Ibid. And we consequently held
that “Canada’s right to uncollected excise taxes on the
liquor petitioners imported into Canada” is “ ‘property’ ”
within the terms of the mail fraud statute. Id., at 355.
Hemi points in reply to our decision in Hawaii v. Stan
dard Oil Co. of Cal., 405 U. S. 251 (1972). But that case
involved not a loss of tax revenues, but “injury to the
general economy of a State”—insofar as it was threatened
by violations of antitrust law. Id., at 260. Hawaii’s inter­
est, both more general and derivative of harm to individ­
ual businesses, differs significantly from the particular tax
loss at issue in Pasquantino and directly at issue here.
We have previously made clear that the compensable
injury for RICO purposes is the harm caused by the predi­
cate acts. See generally Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U. S. 479, 495–496 (1985); cf. Cleveland v. United
States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000). I can find no convincing
reason in the context of this case to distinguish in the
circumstances present here between “property” as used in
the mail fraud statute and “property” as used in RICO.
Hence, I would postpone for another day the question
whether RICO covers instances where little more than the
liability of an individual taxpayer is at issue. And I would
find in the respondent’s favor here.
With respect, I dissent.
