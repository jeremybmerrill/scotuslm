reports with the State, not the City, and the City’s harm was directly
caused by the customers, not Hemi. The Court has never before
stretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and declines to
do so today. See, e.g., id., at 460–461. Pp. 5–9.
(b) The City attempts to avoid this conclusion by characterizing the
violation not merely as Hemi’s failure to file Jenkins Act reports with
the State, but as a more general systematic scheme to defraud the
City of tax revenue. But if the City could escape the proximate-cause
requirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme embraced
all those indirectly harmed by the alleged conduct, the Court’s RICO
proximate cause precedent would become a mere pleading rule. That
precedent makes clear that “the compensable injury flowing from a
[RICO] violation . . . ‘necessarily is the harm caused by [the] predi
cate acts.’ ” Anza, supra, at 457. Because the only fraudulent con
duct alleged here is a violation of the Jenkins Act, the City must, but
cannot, show that Hemi’s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports led
directly to its injuries.
The City also errs in relying on Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem
nity Co., 553 U. S. ___. There, the plaintiffs’ causation theory was
“straightforward”: The causal link in Bridge involved a direct and
easily identifiable connection between the fraud at issue and the
plaintiffs’ injury, id., at ___; the plaintiffs there “were the only parties
injured by petitioners’ misrepresentations,” id., at ___; and there
were “no independent factors that account[ed] for [the] injury,” id., at
___. The City’s theory in this case is anything but straightfor
ward: Multiple steps separate the alleged fraud from the asserted in
jury. And in contrast to Bridge, where there were “no independent
factors that account[ed] for [the plaintiffs’] injury,” id., at ___, here
there certainly were: The City’s theory of liability rests on the inde
pendent actions of third and even fourth parties. Pp. 10–14.
ROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court in part, in which
SCALIA, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., joined, and in which GINSBURG, J.,
joined in part. GINSBURG, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment. BREYER, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in
which STEVENS and KENNEDY, JJ., joined. SOTOMAYOR, J., took no part
in the consideration or decision of the case.
