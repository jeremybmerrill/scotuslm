HEMI GROUP, LLC AND KAI GACHUPIN, 

PETITIONERS v. CITY OF NEW YORK, 

NEW YORK

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[January 25, 2010] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
As the Court points out, this is a case “about the RICO
liability of a company for lost taxes it had no obligation to
collect, remit, or pay.” Ante, at 15. New York City (or
City) cannot, consistent with the Commerce Clause, com
pel Hemi Group, an out-of-state seller, to collect a City
sales or use tax. See Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504
U. S. 298, 301 (1992); National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. De
partment of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 753, 758 (1967).
Unable to impose its tax on Hemi Group, or to require
Hemi Group to collect its tax, New York City is attempting
to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Act (RICO),
18 U. S. C. §1964(c), in combination with the Jenkins Act,
15 U. S. C. §§375–378, to overcome that disability.
Hemi Group committed fraud only insofar as it violated
the Jenkins Act by failing to report the names and ad
dresses of New York purchasers to New York State. There
is no other grounding for the City’s charge that it was
defrauded by Hemi Group. “Absent the Jenkins Act,
[Hemi Group] would have owed no duty to disclose [its]
sales to anyone, and [its] failure to disclose could not
conceivably be deemed fraud of any kind.” City of New
York v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc., 541 F. 3d 425, 460 (CA2
