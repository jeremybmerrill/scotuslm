HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK
Opinion of GINSBURG, J.,

2008) (Winter, J., dissenting in part and concurring in
part).
Because “the alleged fraud is based on violations of . . .
the Jenkins Act, . . . the nature and consequences of the
fraud are [properly] determined solely by the scope of that
Act.” Id., at 459. But “conspicuously absent from the
City’s pleadings is any claim brought pursuant to the
Jenkins Act itself, rather than RICO, seeking enforcement
of the Jenkins Act.” Id., at 460. The City thus effectively
admits that its claim is outside the scope of the very stat
ute on which it builds its RICO suit.
I resist reading RICO to allow the City to end-run its
lack of authority to collect tobacco taxes from Hemi Group
or to reshape the “quite limited remedies” Congress has
provided for violations of the Jenkins Act, see ante, at 13,
n. 2. Without subscribing to the broader range of the
Court’s proximate cause analysis, I join the Court’s opin
ion to the extent it is consistent with the above-stated
view, and I concur in the Court’s judgment.
