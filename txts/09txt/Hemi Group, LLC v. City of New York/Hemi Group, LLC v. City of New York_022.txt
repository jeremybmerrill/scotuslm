HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK
BREYER, J., dissenting

seeks to help States collect tobacco taxes by requiring out­
of-state cigarette sellers, such as Hemi, to file reports with
state tobacco tax administrators identifying the names
and addresses of in-state customers and the amounts they
purchased. The violations consist of Hemi’s intentional
failure to do so.
As the majority points out, we must assume for present
purposes that an intentional failure to file Jenkins Act
reports counts as mail fraud (at least where the failure is
part of a scheme that includes use of the mails). Ante, at
4. Lower courts have sometimes so held. See United
States v. Melvin, 544 F. 2d 767, 773–777 (CA5 1977);
United States v. Brewer, 528 F. 2d 492, 497–498 (CA4
1975). The Court of Appeals here so held. City of New
York v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc., 541 F. 3d 425, 446 (CA2
2008). And no one has challenged that holding.
We must also assume that Hemi’s “intentiona[l] con­
ceal[ment]” of the name/address/purchase information,
Second Am. Compl. ¶¶103, 104, is the legal equivalent of
an affirmative representation that Hemi had no New York
City customers. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §551,
p. 119 (1976) (a person “who fails to disclose . . . a fact”
may be “subject to . . . liability” as if “he had represented
the nonexistence of the matter that he has failed to dis­
close”); cf. Stewart v. Wyoming Cattle Ranche Co., 128
U. S. 383, 388 (1888) (concealment or suppression of mate­
rial fact equivalent to a false representation). On these
assumptions, the question before us is whether New York
City’s loss of tax revenues constitutes an injury to its
“business or property by reason of” Hemi’s Jenkins Act
misrepresentations.

The case arises as a result of the District Court’s dis­
