tax. The City thus could not pursue those customers for
payment. The City thereby was injured in the amount of
the portion of back taxes that were never collected. See
Record A996.
But as we reiterated in Holmes, “[t]he general tendency
of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go be­
yond the first step.” 503 U. S., at 271–272 (quoting Asso
ciated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459
U. S. 519, 534 (1983), in turn quoting Southern Pacific Co.
v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U. S. 531, 533 (1918),
internal quotation marks omitted). Our cases confirm
that the “general tendency” applies with full force to
proximate cause inquiries under RICO. Holmes, supra, at
271–272; see also Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity
Co., 553 U. S. __, __ (2008) (slip op., at 18–19); Anza v.
Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 460–461 (2006).
Because the City’s theory of causation requires us to move
well beyond the first step, that theory cannot meet RICO’s
direct relationship requirement.
Our decision in Anza, supra, confirms that the City’s

its competitor, National Steel Supply. Ideal alleged that
National had defrauded New York State by failing to
charge and remit sales taxes, and that National was thus
able to undercut Ideal’s prices. The lower prices offered by
National, Ideal contended, allowed National to attract
customers at Ideal’s expense. Id., at 458.
Finding the link between the fraud alleged and injury
suffered to be “attenuated,” we rejected Ideal’s claim. Id.,
at 459. “The direct victim of this conduct,” we held, was
“the State of New York, not Ideal.” Id., at 458. “It was the
State that was being defrauded and the State that lost tax
revenue as a result.” Ibid. We recognized that Ideal had
asserted “its own harms when [National] failed to charge
customers for the applicable sales tax.” Ibid. But the
