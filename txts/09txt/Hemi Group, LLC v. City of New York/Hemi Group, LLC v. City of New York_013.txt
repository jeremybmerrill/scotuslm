HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK
Opinion of the Court

The concepts of direct relationship and foreseeability are
of course two of the “many shapes [proximate cause] took
at common law,” Holmes, supra, at 268. Our precedents
make clear that in the RICO context, the focus is on the
directness of the relationship between the conduct and the
harm. Indeed, Anza and Holmes never even mention the
concept of foreseeability.

The City offers a number of responses. It first chal­
lenges our characterization of the violation at issue. In
the City’s view, the violation is not merely Hemi’s failure
to file Jenkins Act information with the State, but a more
general “systematic scheme to defraud the City of tax
revenue.” Brief for Respondent 42. Having broadly de­
fined the violation, the City contends that it has been
directly harmed by reason of that systematic scheme.

But the City cannot escape the proximate cause re­
quirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme
embraced all those indirectly harmed by the alleged con­
duct. Otherwise our RICO proximate cause precedent
would become a mere pleading rule. In Anza, for example,
Ideal alleged that National’s scheme “was to give National
a competitive advantage over Ideal.” 547 U. S., at 454–
455. But that allegation did not prevent the Court from
concluding that National’s fraud directly harmed only the
State, not Ideal. As the Court explained, Ideal could not
“circumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by
claiming that the defendant’s aim was to increase market
share at a competitor’s expense.” Id., at 460.1

1 Even if we were willing to look to Hemi’s intent, as the dissent sug­
gests we should, the City would fare no better. Hemi’s aim was not to
defraud the City (or the State, for that matter) of tax revenue, but to
sell more cigarettes. Hemi itself neither owed taxes nor was obliged to
collect and remit them. This all suggests that Hemi’s alleged fraud was
