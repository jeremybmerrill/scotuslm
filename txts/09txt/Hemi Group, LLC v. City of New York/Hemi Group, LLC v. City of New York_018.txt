Opinion of the Court

Second Amended Compl. ¶¶ 118, 125. Because the City
defined the predicate act before the District Court as
Hemi’s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports, and ex­
pressly disavowed reliance on the alleged misrepresenta­
tions themselves as predicate acts, we decline to consider
Hemi’s alleged misstatements as predicate acts at this late
stage.

It bears remembering what this case is about. It is
about the RICO liability of a company for lost taxes it had
no obligation to collect, remit, or pay, which harmed a
party to whom it owed no duty. It is about imposing such
liability to substitute for or complement a governing body’s
uncertain ability or desire to collect taxes directly from
those who owe them. And it is about the fact that the
liability comes with treble damages and attorney’s fees
attached. This Court has interpreted RICO broadly,
consistent with its terms, but we have also held that its
reach is limited by the “requirement of a direct causal
connection” between the predicate wrong and the harm.
Anza, 547 U. S., at 460. The City’s injuries here were not
caused directly by the alleged fraud, and thus were not
caused “by reason of” it. The City, therefore, has no RICO
claim.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
