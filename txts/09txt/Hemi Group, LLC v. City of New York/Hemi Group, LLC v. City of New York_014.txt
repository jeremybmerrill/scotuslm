Opinion of the Court

Our precedent makes clear, moreover, that “the com­
pensable injury flowing from a [RICO] violation . . . ‘neces­
sarily is the harm caused by [the] predicate acts.’ ” Id., at
457 (quoting Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S.
479, 497 (1985)). In its RICO statement, the City alleged
that Hemi’s failure to file Jenkins Act reports constituted
the predicate act of mail and wire fraud. Record A980.
The City went on to allege that this predicate act “directly
caused” its harm, id., at A996, but that assertion is a legal
conclusion about proximate cause—indeed, the very legal
conclusion before us. The only fraudulent conduct alleged
here is a violation of the Jenkins Act. See 541 F. 3d, at
459 (Winter, J., dissenting). Thus, the City must show
that Hemi’s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the
State led directly to its injuries. This it cannot do.
The City also relies on Bridge, 553 U. S. ___. Bridge
reaffirmed the requirement that there must be “a suffi­
ciently direct relationship between the defendant’s wrong­
ful conduct and the plaintiff’s injury.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,
at 18). The case involved competing bidders at a county
tax-lien auction. Because the liens were profitable even at
the lowest possible bid, multiple bidders offered that low
bid. (The bidding took the form of the percentage tax
penalty the bidder would require the property owner to
pay, so the lowest possible bid was 0%.) To decide which
bidder would be awarded the lien, the county devised a
plan to allocate the liens “on a rotational basis.” Id., at
___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). But
as we noted in that case, this created a “perverse incen­
tive”: “Bidders who, in addition to bidding themselves,
sen[t] agents to bid on their behalf [would] obtain a dis­
proportionate share of liens.” Ibid. The county therefore
—————— 

aimed at Hemi’s competitors, not the City. But Anza teaches that the

competitors’ injuries in such a case are too attenuated to state a RICO

claim.
