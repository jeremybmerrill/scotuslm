BREYER, J., dissenting

light of the facts alleged, taking as true the facts pleaded
in the complaint (along with the “RICO statement” sub­
mitted pursuant to the District Court’s rule). Bridge v.
Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1
(2008) (slip op., at 1, n. 1). Those facts (as I interpret
them) include the following:
1. New York State (or State) and New York City (or City)
both impose tobacco taxes on New York cigarette buy­
ers. Second Am. Compl. ¶37.
2. Both City and State normally collect the taxes from
in-state cigarette sellers, who, in turn, charge retail
customers. Id., ¶¶4, 6.
3. Hemi, an out-of-state company, sells cigarettes over
the Internet to in-state buyers at prices that are lower
than in-state cigarette prices. The difference in price
is almost entirely attributable to the fact that Hemi’s
prices do not include any charge for New York taxes.
Hemi advertises its cigarettes as “tax free” and often
adds that it “does not report any sales activity to any
State taxing authority.” Id., ¶¶2, 6, 108b (internal
quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).
4. New York State normally receives Jenkins Act reports
from out-of-state sellers. It is contractually obliged to
pass the information on to New York City (and I as­
sume it normally does so). Id., ¶¶8–9, 11, 54–57.
5. When it receives Jenkins-Act-type information, New
York City writes letters to resident customers asking
them to pay the tobacco tax they owe. As a result,
New York City collects about 40% of the tax due. (By
doing so, in 2005 the City obtained $400,000 out of $1
million owed.) Id., ¶¶58–59.
6. Hemi has consistently and intentionally failed to file
Jenkins Act reports in order to prevent both State and
City from collecting the tobacco taxes that Hemi’s in­
state customers owe and which otherwise many of
those customers would pay. Id., ¶¶13, 24, 58.
