BREYER, J., dissenting

dants who would appear to fall within its intended scope.
Consider, for example, a group of defendants who use a
marketing firm (in RICO terms, an “enterprise”) to perpe­
trate a variation on a “pump and dump” scheme. See, e.g.,
United States v. Salmonese, 352 F. 3d 608, 612 (CA2
2003). They deliberately and repeatedly make egregiously
fraudulent misrepresentations to inflate the price of secu­
rities that, unbeknownst to investors, they own. After the
stock price rises, the defendants sell at an artificial profit.
When the fraud is revealed, the price crashes, to the inves­
tors’ detriment. Suppose the defendants have intention­
ally spoken directly only to intermediaries who simply
repeated the information to potential investors, and have
not had any contact with the investors themselves. Under
the majority’s reasoning, these defendants apparently did
not proximately cause the investors’ losses and are not
liable under RICO.

If there is causation, we must decide whether, for RICO
purposes, the City’s loss of tax revenue is “ ‘business or
property’ under 18 U. S. C. §1964(c).” Ante, at 5 (acknowl­
edging, but not reaching, this second issue). The question
has led to concern among the lower courts. Some fear that
an affirmative answer would turn RICO into a tax collec­
tion statute, permitting States to bring RICO actions and
recover treble damages for behavior that amounts to no
more than a failure to pay taxes due. See, e.g., Michigan,
Dept. of Treasury, Revenue Div. v. Fawaz, No. 86–1809,
1988 WL 44736, *2 (CA6 1988) (holding that tax revenue
is not RICO “property” lest district courts become “collec­
tion agencies for unpaid state taxes”); Illinois Dept. of
Revenue v. Phillips, 771 F. 2d 312, 316, 312 (CA7 1985)
(holding, “reluctantly,” that “a state’s Department of
Revenue may file suit in federal court for treble damages
under [RICO] against a retailer who files fraudulent state
