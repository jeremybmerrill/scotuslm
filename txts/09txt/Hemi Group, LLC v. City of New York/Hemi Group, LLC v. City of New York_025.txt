Further, Hemi misrepresented the relevant facts in
order to bring about New York City’s relevant loss. It
knew the loss would occur; it intended the loss to occur;
one might even say it desired the loss to occur. It is diffi­
cult to find common-law cases denying liability for a
wrongdoer’s intended consequences, particularly where
those consequences are also foreseeable. Cf. Bridge, su
pra, at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10) (“[S]uppose an enterprise
that wants to get rid of rival businesses mails representa­
tions about them to their customers and suppliers, but not
to the rivals themselves. If the rival businesses lose
money as a result of the misrepresentations, it would
certainly seem that they were injured in their business ‘by
reason of’ a pattern of mail fraud . . .”); N. M. ex rel. Caleb

was improbable”); 1 F. Harper & F. James, The Law
of Torts, §7.13, p. 584 (1956) (explaining that, ordinarily,
“all intended consequences” of an intentional act “are
proximate”).
In addition, New York City’s revenue loss falls squarely
within the bounds of the kinds of harms that the Jenkins
Act (essentially the predicate statute) seeks to prevent.
The statute is entitled “An Act To assist States in collect­
ing sales and use taxes on cigarettes.” 63 Stat. 884. I
have no reason to believe the Act intends any different
result with respect to collection of a city’s tobacco tax
assessed under the authority of state law. See N. Y. Un­
consol. Law Ann. §9436(1) (West Supp. 2009) (authorizing
cities with over one million inhabitants to impose their
