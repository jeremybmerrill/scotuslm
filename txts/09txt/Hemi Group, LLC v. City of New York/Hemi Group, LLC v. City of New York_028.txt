HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK
BREYER, J., dissenting

(or ‘directly traceable’) consequences and those indirect
consequences that are foreseeable.” Prosser and Keeton
§42, at 273 (emphasis added); see also id., §43, at 294, and
n. 17 (citing Nunan v. Bennett, 184 Ky. 591, 212 S. W.
570 (1919)). I do not read this Court’s opinions in
Holmes or Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451
(2006), to invoke anything other than this traditional
understanding.
Second, the majority correctly points out that Hemi
misrepresented the situation to the State, not to the
City—a circumstance which, the majority believes, signifi­
cantly separates misrepresentation from harm. Ante, at 8.
But how could that be so? New York State signed a con­
tract promising to relay relevant information to the City.
In respect to that relevant information, the State is a
conduit, indeed roughly analogous to a postal employee.
This Court has recognized specifically that “under the
common law a fraud may be established when the defen­
dant has made use of a third party to reach the target of
the fraud.” Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 129
(1987). The treatises say the same. See, e.g., Prosser and
Keeton §107, at 743–745; 26 C. J. S., Fraud §47, p. 1121
(1921) (collecting cases); see also Prosser, Misrepresenta­
tion and Third Parties, 19 Vand. L. Rev. 231, 240–241,
and nn. 56–59, 62–64 (1966) (collecting cases). This Court
has never suggested the contrary, namely, that a defen­
dant is not liable for (foreseeable) harm (intentionally)
caused to the target of a scheme to defraud simply because
the misrepresentation was transmitted via a third (or even
a fourth or fifth) party. Cf. Terry, Intent to Defraud, 25
Yale L. J. 87, 93 (1915) (“When a representation is com­
municated through one person to another in such circum­
stances that it can be deemed to be directed to the latter,
it makes no difference through how many persons or by
how circuitous a route it reaches the latter . . .”).
Third, the majority places great weight upon its view
