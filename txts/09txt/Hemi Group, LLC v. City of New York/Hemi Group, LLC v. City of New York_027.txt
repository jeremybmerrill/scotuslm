BREYER, J., dissenting

precludes finding causation (indeed two are not even
relevant to the causation issue). Nor can I find the two
prior cases controlling.
The three circumstances are the following: First, the
majority seems to argue that the intervening voluntary
acts of third parties, namely, the customers’ own inde­
pendent failures to pay the tax, cuts the causal chain.
Ante, at 8 (“[T]he City’s harm was directly caused by the
customers, not Hemi”); see Saugerties Bank v. Delaware &
Hudson Co., 236 N. Y. 425, 430, 141 N. E. 904, 905 (1923)
(third party’s forgery of a bill of lading an intervening
cause); Prosser and Keeton §44, at 313–314 (collecting
cases on intervening intentional or criminal acts). But an
intervening third-party act, even if criminal, does not cut a
causal chain where the intervening act is foreseeable and
the defendant’s conduct increases the risk of its occur­
rence. See Lillie v. Thompson, 332 U. S. 459, 462 (1947)
(per curiam); Horan v. Watertown, 217 Mass. 185, 186, 104
N. E. 464, 465 (1914); see also Restatement (Second) of
Torts §435A, at 454 (1963–1964) (intentional tortfeasor
liable for intended harm “except where the harm results
from an outside force the risk of which is not increased by
the defendant’s act”). Hemi’s act here did increase the
risk that New York City would not be paid; and not only
was the risk foreseeable, but Hemi’s advertising strongly
suggests that Hemi actually knew nonreporting would
likely bring about this very harm.
The majority claims that “directness,” rather than fore­
seeability, should be our guide in assessing proximate
cause, and that the lack of a “direct” relationship in this
case precludes a finding of proximate causation. Ante, at
9–10. But courts used this concept of directness in tort
law to expand liability (for direct consequences) beyond
what was foreseeable, not to eliminate liability for what
was foreseeable. Thus, under the “directness” theory of
proximate causation, there is liability for both “all ‘direct’
