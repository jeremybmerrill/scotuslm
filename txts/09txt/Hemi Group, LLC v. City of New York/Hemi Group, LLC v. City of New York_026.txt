HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK
BREYER, J., dissenting

own cigarette taxes). The Restatement (Second) of Torts
explains that where
“a statute requires information to be furnished . . . for
the protection of a particular class of persons, one who
makes a fraudulent misrepresentation . . . is subject to
liability to the persons for pecuniary loss . . . in a
transaction of the kind in which the statute is in­
tended to protect them.” §536, at 77 (1976).
See also §536, Appendix (citing supporting cases in the
Reporter’s Note).
Finally, we have acknowledged that “Congress modeled
§1964(c) on the civil-action provision of the federal anti­
trust laws,” and we have therefore looked to those laws as
an interpretive aid in RICO cases. Holmes v. Securities
Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 267, 268
(1992). I can find no antitrust analogy that suggests any
lack of causation here, nor has the majority referred to
any such analogical antitrust circumstance.
The upshot is that the harm is foreseeable; it is a conse­
quence that Hemi intended, indeed desired; and it falls
well within the set of risks that Congress sought to pre­
vent. Neither antitrust analogy nor any statutory policy of
which I am aware precludes a finding of “proximate
cause.” I recognize that some of our opinions may be read
to suggest that the words “by reason of” in RICO do not
perfectly track common-law notions of proximate cause.
See, e.g., Bridge, 553 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 14–16).
But where so much basic common law argues in favor of
such a finding, how can the Court avoid that conclusion
here?
B
The majority bases its contrary conclusion upon three
special circumstances and its reading of two of this Court’s
prior cases. In my view, none of the three circumstances
