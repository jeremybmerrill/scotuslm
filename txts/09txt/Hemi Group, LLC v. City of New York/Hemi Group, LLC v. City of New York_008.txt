Opinion of the Court

nue, was “business or property” under RICO. Id., at 444–
445. And that injury, the court concluded, came about “by
reason of” the predicate mail and wire frauds. Id., at 440–
444. The City thus had stated a viable RICO claim.
Judge Winter dissented on the ground that the alleged
RICO violation was not the proximate cause of the City’s
injury. Id., at 458–461.
Hemi filed a petition for certiorari, asking this Court to
determine whether the City had been “directly injured in
its ‘business or property’ ” by reason of the alleged mail
and wire frauds. Pet. for Cert. i. We granted that peti­

Though framed as a single question, Hemi’s petition for
certiorari raises two distinct issues: First, whether a loss
in tax revenue is “business or property” under 18 U. S. C.
§1964(c); and second, whether the City’s asserted injury
came about “by reason of” the allegedly fraudulent con­
duct, as required by §1964(c). We determine that the City
cannot satisfy the causation requirement—that any injury
the City suffered must be “by reason of” the alleged
frauds—and therefore do not decide whether the City’s
allegations of lost tax revenue constitute an injury to its
“business or property.”

In Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,
503 U. S. 258 (1992), we set forth the standard of causa­
tion that applies to civil RICO claims. In that case, we
addressed a RICO claim brought by Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (SIPC) against defendants whom
SIPC alleged had manipulated stock prices. Id., at 262–
263. SIPC had a duty to reimburse customers of certain
registered broker-dealers in the event the broker-dealers
were unable to meet their financial obligations. Id., at
