NURRE v. WHITEHEAD
ALITO, J., dissenting

II
When a public school administration speaks for itself
and takes public responsibility for its speech, it may say
what it wishes without violating the First Amendment’s
guarantee of freedom of speech. Pleasant Grove City v.
Summum, 555 U. S., ___ , ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4–5). But
when a public school purports to allow students to express
themselves, it must respect the students’ free speech
rights. School administrators may not behave like puppet
masters who create the illusion that students are engag­
ing in personal expression when in fact the school admini­
stration is pulling the strings.
Our cases use the term “limited public forum” to de­
scribe a situation in which a public school purports to
allow students to express their own views or sentiments.
See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515
U. S. 819, 829–830 (1995); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S.
263, 272–273 (1981); see also Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators’ Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45–48 (1983). In
such a forum, we have held, the State “must not discrimi­
nate against speech on the basis of viewpoint.” Good News
Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106 (2001);
see also Rosenberger, supra, at 829. Our cases also make
it perfectly clear that discrimination against religious, as
opposed to secular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.
Good News Club, supra, at 107; Rosenberger, supra, at
830, 831; Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 393–394 (1993). And our cases
categorically reject the proposition that speech may be
censored simply because some in the audience may find
that speech distasteful. See United States v. Playboy
Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 814–816 (2000);
R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992); Board of Ed.,
Island Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457
U. S. 853, 871–872 (1982) (plurality opinion); Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S.
