Opinion of the Court

corrected the error, after which the Court of Appeals
resubmitted the case and reversed the judgment of the
District Court. The Court of Appeals concluded that by
confirming Espinosa’s plan without first finding undue
hardship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy
Court at most committed a legal error that United might
have successfully appealed, but that any such legal error
was not a basis for setting aside the confirmation order as
void under Rule 60(b). 553 F. 3d 1193, 1198–1202 (2008).5
In addition, the Court of Appeals held that although
Espinosa’s failure to serve United with a summons and
complaint before seeking a discharge of his student loan
debt violated the Bankruptcy Rules, this defect in service
was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void
because United received actual notice of Espinosa’s plan
—————— 

to exclude “ ‘any debt . . . for a student loan’ ” from the discharge. 530 

F. 3d 895, 896 (CA9 2008). That provision appeared irreconcilable with
the confirmation order, which contemplated the discharge of the inter­
est on Espinosa’s student loan debt. Suggesting that the Bankruptcy
Court may have automatically generated the discharge order without
tailoring it to the terms of the confirmation order, the Court of Appeals
remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider amending the
discharge order to conform to the confirmation order. Id., at 899; see
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a) (authorizing a court to “correct a clerical
mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission”). On remand,
the Bankruptcy Court found that the text of its discharge order except­
ing Espinosa’s student loan debt from discharge “was inserted because
of a clerical mistake” and struck that language from the order. App. 48.
Although certain amici press the point, United has not challenged
the substance of the Bankruptcy Court’s amendment to the order or
asked us to consider whether such amendment was proper under Rule
60(a). See Brief for Petitioner 42; Reply Brief for Petitioner 20. Thus,
we express no view on those issues. See Kamen v. Kemper Financial
Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 97, n. 4 (1991) (noting that “we do not
ordinarily address issues raised only by amici”).
5 In so doing, the Court of Appeals disagreed with two other Courts of
Appeals. See In re Mersmann, 505 F. 3d 1033, 1047–1049 (CA10 2007)
(en banc); Whelton v. Educational Credit Management Corp., 432 F. 3d
150, 154 (CA2 2005).
