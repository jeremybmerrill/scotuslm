UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA
Opinion of the Court

tion in 2003 asking the Bankruptcy Court to enforce its
1997 discharge order by directing the Department and
United to cease all efforts to collect the unpaid interest on
his student loan debt.
United opposed that motion and filed a cross-motion
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) seeking to
set aside as void the Bankruptcy Court’s 1993 order con­
firming Espinosa’s plan. United made two arguments in
support of its motion. First, United claimed that the
provision of Espinosa’s plan authorizing the discharge of
his student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code,
which requires a court to find undue hardship before
discharging a student loan debt, §§523(a)(8), 1328(a), and
with the Bankruptcy Rules, which require the court to
make the undue hardship finding in an adversary proceed­
ing, see Rule 7001(6). Second, United argued that its due
process rights had been violated because Espinosa failed
to serve it with the summons and complaint the Bank­
ruptcy Rules require as a prerequisite to an adversarial
proceeding. See Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.
The Bankruptcy Court rejected both arguments, granted
Espinosa’s motion in relevant part, denied United’s cross­
motion, and ordered all claimants to cease and desist their
collection efforts. United sought review in the District
Court, which reversed. That court held that United was
denied due process because the confirmation order was
issued without service of the summons and complaint the
Bankruptcy Rules require.
Espinosa appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, which issued an initial per curiam opinion re­
manding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider
correcting an apparent clerical error in its discharge or­
der.4 530 F. 3d 895, 899 (2008). The Bankruptcy Court
