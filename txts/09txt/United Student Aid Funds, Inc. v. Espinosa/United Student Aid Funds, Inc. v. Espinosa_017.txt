UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA
Opinion of the Court

adequacy of the Bankruptcy Court’s procedures by failing
to raise a timely objection in that court.
Rule 60(b)(4) strikes a balance between the need for
finality of judgments and the importance of ensuring that
litigants have a full and fair opportunity to litigate a
dispute. Where, as here, a party is notified of a plan’s
contents and fails to object to confirmation of the plan
before the time for appeal expires, that party has been
afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate, and the
party’s failure to avail itself of that opportunity will not
justify Rule 60(b)(4) relief. We thus agree with the Court
of Appeals that the Bankruptcy Court’s confirmation order
is not void.
III
In issuing its judgment, however, the Court of Appeals
looked beyond the narrow question whether the Bank­
ruptcy Court’s order confirming Espinosa’s plan was void
under Rule 60(b)(4). It canvassed other bankruptcy court
decisions within the Circuit that presented a different
question—whether a bankruptcy court presented with a
debtor’s plan that proposes to discharge a student loan
debt, in the absence of an adversary proceeding to deter­
mine undue hardship, should confirm the plan despite its
failure to comply with the Code and Rules. The Court of
Appeals noted that some Bankruptcy Courts had declined
to confirm such plans “even when the creditor fail[ed] to
object to the plan.” 553 F. 3d, at 1205. The court disap­
proved that practice and overruled those cases, stating
that bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the
discharge of a student loan debt without a determination
of undue hardship in an adversary proceeding unless the
creditor timely raises a specific objection. Ibid. This, we
think, was a step too far.
As Espinosa concedes, Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 36, a Chapter
13 plan that proposes to discharge a student loan debt
