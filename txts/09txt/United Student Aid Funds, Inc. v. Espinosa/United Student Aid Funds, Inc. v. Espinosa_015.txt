UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA
Opinion of the Court

Hood, 541 U. S., at 447 (noting that “[b]ankruptcy courts
have exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor’s property”). Nor
does the provision impose requirements that, if violated,
would result in a denial of due process. Instead, §523(a)(8)
requires a court to make a certain finding before confirm­
ing the discharge of a student loan debt. It is true, as we
explained in Hood, that this requirement is “ ‘self­
executing.’ ” Id., at 450.11 But that means only that the
——————
operation of a vehicle while intoxicated). We express no view on the
conditions under which an order confirming the discharge of one of
these types of debt could be set aside as void.
11 The Government suggests that §523(a)(8)’s “self-executing” nature
derives in part from the text of §523(a), which states that “[a] discharge
under section 727 . . . or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an
individual debtor from any debt,” including the student loan debts
specified in paragraph (8) (emphasis added); see Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 18; see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 1–2. That is
not what we concluded in Hood and, in this case, would be irrelevant in
any event.
In Hood, we described as “ ‘self-executing’ ” paragraph (8)’s instruc­
tion that student loan debt not be discharged “unless” an undue hard­
ship determination is made. 541 U. S., at 450. The “does not dis­
charge” language in §523(a), which applies generally to every
enumerated paragraph in that section—and to which we never referred
in Hood—was not relevant to our analysis. That is evident from the
authority we cited to support our description of §523(a)(8)’s condition as
“ ‘self-executing.’ ” E.g., id., at 450 (citing S. Rep. No. 95–989, p. 79
(1978), which states that “[p]aragraph (8) . . . is intended to be self­
executing” insofar as “the lender or institution is not required to file a
complaint to determine the nondischargeability of any student loan”
(emphasis added)).
In any event, the “does not discharge” language in §523(a) is inappli­
cable to this case. Section 523(a) provides that “[a] discharge under
section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of [the Code] does not
discharge an individual debtor from” the debts described in §523(a)’s
enumerated paragraphs. But Espinosa did not seek a discharge under
“sections 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b).” He sought a dis­
charge under §1328(a), which provides that, upon completion of a
Chapter 13 plan, a bankruptcy court “shall grant the debtor a discharge
of all debts provided for by the plan . . . , except any debt . . . of the kind
specified in . . . paragraph . . . (5), (8), or (9) of section 523(a).” (Empha­
