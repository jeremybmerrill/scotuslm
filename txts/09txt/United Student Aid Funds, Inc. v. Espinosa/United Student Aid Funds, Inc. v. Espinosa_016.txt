Opinion of the Court

bankruptcy court must make an undue hardship finding
even if the creditor does not request one; it does not mean
that a bankruptcy court’s failure to make the finding
renders its subsequent confirmation order void for pur­
poses of Rule 60(b)(4).12
Given the Code’s clear and self-executing requirement
for an undue hardship determination, the Bankruptcy
Court’s failure to find undue hardship before confirming
Espinosa’s plan was a legal error. See Part III, infra. But
the order remains enforceable and binding on United
because United had notice of the error and failed to object
or timely appeal.
United’s response—that it had no obligation to object to
Espinosa’s plan until Espinosa served it with the sum­
mons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require, Brief
for Petitioner 33—is unavailing. Rule 60(b)(4) does not
provide a license for litigants to sleep on their rights.
United had actual notice of the filing of Espinosa’s plan,
its contents, and the Bankruptcy Court’s subsequent
confirmation of the plan. In addition, United filed a proof
of claim regarding Espinosa’s student loan debt, thereby
submitting itself to the Bankruptcy Court’s jurisdiction
with respect to that claim. See Langenkamp v. Culp, 498
U. S. 42, 44 (1990) (per curiam). United therefore forfeited
its arguments regarding the validity of service or the
——————
sis added). Section 1328(a) thus incorporates by reference paragraph
(8) of §523(a), including that paragraph’s self-executing requirement for
an undue hardship determination, but does not incorporate the “does
not discharge” text of §523(a) itself.
12 United relies on our decisions in United States ex rel. Wilson v.
Walker, 109 U. S. 258 (1883), and Vallely v. Northern Fire & Marine
Ins. Co., 254 U. S. 348 (1920), to argue otherwise. Those authorities
are not controlling because they predate Rule 60(b)(4)’s enactment and
because we interpreted the statutes at issue in those cases as stripping
courts of jurisdiction—either over the parties, id., at 354–356, or the
res, Wilson, supra, at 265–266—and United concedes that the statutory
limit in this case is not jurisdictional. See supra, at 9.
