Opinion of the Court

process violation, United and the Government, as amicus,
urge us to expand the universe of judgment defects that
support Rule 60(b)(4) relief. Specifically, they contend
that the Bankruptcy Court’s confirmation order is void
because the court lacked statutory authority to confirm
Espinosa’s plan absent a finding of undue hardship. In
support of this contention, they cite the text of §523(a)(8),
which provides that student loan debts guaranteed by
governmental units are not dischargeable “unless” a court
finds undue hardship. 11 U. S. C. §523(a)(8) (emphasis
added). They argue that this language imposes a “ ‘self­
executing’ limitation on the effect of a discharge order”
that renders the order legally unenforceable, and thus
void, if it is not satisfied. Brief for Petitioner 23–24; Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 18 (quoting Tennessee
Student Assistance Corporation v. Hood, 541 U. S. 440,
450 (2004)). In addition, United cites §1325(a)(1), which
instructs bankruptcy courts to confirm only those plans
that comply with “the . . . applicable provisions” of the
Code. Reading these provisions in tandem, United argues
that an order confirming a plan that purports to discharge
a student loan debt without an undue hardship finding is
“doubly beyond the court’s authority and therefore void.”
Brief for Petitioner 13.
We are not persuaded that a failure to find undue hard­
ship in accordance with §523(a)(8) is on par with the
jurisdictional and notice failings that define void judg­
ments that qualify for relief under Rule 60(b)(4). As
noted, §523(a)(8) does not limit the bankruptcy court’s
jurisdiction over student loan debts.10 Supra, at 9–10; see

10 Sections 1328(a) and 523(a)(8) provide that student loan debt is
dischargeable in a Chapter 13 proceeding if a court makes a finding of
undue hardship. In contrast, other provisions in Chapter 13 provide
that certain other debts are not dischargeable under any circumstances.
See, e.g., §§523(a)(1)(B), (C) (specified tax debts); §523(a)(5) (domestic
support obligations); §523(a)(9) (debts “caused by” the debtor’s unlawful
