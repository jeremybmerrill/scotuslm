UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA
Opinion of the Court

(2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).
2
Although United concedes that the Bankruptcy Court
had jurisdiction to enter the order confirming Espinosa’s
plan, United contends that the court’s judgment is void
under Rule 60(b)(4) because United did not receive ade­
quate notice of Espinosa’s proposed discharge of his stu­
dent loan interest. Specifically, United argues that the
Bankruptcy Court violated United’s due process rights by
confirming Espinosa’s plan despite Espinosa’s failure to
serve the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules
require for the commencement of an adversary proceeding.
We disagree.
Espinosa’s failure to serve United with a summons
and complaint deprived United of a right granted by a
procedural rule. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7004(b)(3).
United could have timely objected to this deprivation and
appealed from an adverse ruling on its objection. But this
deprivation did not amount to a violation of United’s
constitutional right to due process. Due process requires
notice “reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances,
to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action
and afford them an opportunity to present their objec­
tions.” Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339
U. S. 306, 314 (1950); see also Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S.
220, 225 (2006) (“[D]ue process does not require actual
notice . . .”). Here, United received actual notice of the
filing and contents of Espinosa’s plan. This more than
satisfied United’s due process rights. Accordingly, on
these facts, Espinosa’s failure to serve a summons and
complaint does not entitle United to relief under Rule
60(b)(4).
