Opinion of the Court

without a determination of undue hardship violates
§§1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8). Failure to comply with this
self-executing requirement should prevent confirmation of
the plan even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in
the proceeding at all. See Hood, 541 U. S., at 450.13 That
is because §1325(a) instructs a bankruptcy court to con­
firm a plan only if the court finds, inter alia, that the plan
complies with the “applicable provisions” of the Code.
§1325(a) (providing that a bankruptcy court “shall confirm
a plan” if the plan “complies with the provisions of” Chap­
ter 13 and with “other applicable provisions of this title”);
see Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U. S. 78, 87 (1991);
see also §105(a) (authorizing bankruptcy courts to issue
“any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or
appropriate to carry out” the Code’s provisions).14 Thus,
contrary to the Court of Appeals’ assertion, the Code
makes plain that bankruptcy courts have the authority—
indeed, the obligation—to direct a debtor to conform his

13 This is essential to preserve the distinction between Congress’
treatment of student loan debts in §523(a)(8) and debts listed elsewhere
in §523. Section 523(a)(8) renders student loan debt presumptively
nondischargeable “unless” a determination of undue hardship is made.
In contrast, the debts listed in §523(c), which include certain debts
obtained by fraud or “willful and malicious injury by the debtor,”
§523(a)(6), are presumptively dischargeable “unless” the creditor
requests a hearing to determine the debt’s dischargeability. The Court
of Appeals’ approach would subject student loan debt to the same rules
as the debts specified in §523(c), notwithstanding the evident differ­
ences in the statutory framework for discharging the two types of debt.
14 In other contexts, we have held that courts have the discretion, but
not the obligation, to raise on their own initiative certain nonjurisdic­
tional barriers to suit. See Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202, 209
(2006) (statute of limitations); Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 134
(1987) (habeas corpus petitioner’s exhaustion of state remedies).
Section 1325(a) does more than codify this principle; it requires bank­
ruptcy courts to address and correct a defect in a debtor’s proposed plan
even if no creditor raises the issue.
