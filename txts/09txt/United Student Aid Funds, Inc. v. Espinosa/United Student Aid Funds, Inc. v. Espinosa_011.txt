UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA
Opinion of the Court

A void judgment is a legal nullity. See Black’s Law
Dictionary 1822 (3d ed. 1933); see also id., at 1709 (9th ed.
2009). Although the term “void” describes a result, rather
than the conditions that render a judgment unenforceable,
it suffices to say that a void judgment is one so affected by
a fundamental infirmity that the infirmity may be raised
even after the judgment becomes final. See Restatement
(Second) of Judgments 22 (1980); see generally id., §12.
The list of such infirmities is exceedingly short; otherwise,
Rule 60(b)(4)’s exception to finality would swallow the
rule.
“A judgment is not void,” for example, “simply because it
is or may have been erroneous.” Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F. 3d
1, 6 (CA1 1995); 12 J. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Prac­
tice §60.44[1][a], pp. 60–150 to 60–151 (3d ed. 2007) (here­
inafter Moore’s). Similarly, a motion under Rule 60(b)(4)
is not a substitute for a timely appeal. Kocher v. Dow
Chemical Co., 132 F. 3d 1225, 1229 (CA8 1997); see
Moore’s §60.44[1][a], at 60–150. Instead, Rule 60(b)(4)
applies only in the rare instance where a judgment is
premised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or
on a violation of due process that deprives a party of notice
or the opportunity to be heard. See United States v. Boch
Oldsmobile, Inc., 909 F. 2d 657, 661 (CA1 1990); Moore’s
——————
fraud.” Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether a Rule 60(b)(4)
motion should be treated as a “complaint to revoke” a plan subject to
§1330’s time limit and substantive limitation to motions based on
fraud. Compare Whelton, 432 F. 3d, at 156, n. 2, with In re Fesq, 153
F. 3d 113, 119, and n. 8 (CA3 1998). We need not settle that question,
however, because the parties did not raise it in the courts below. And
even under a theory that would treat United’s Rule 60(b)(4) motion as a
“complaint to revoke” the plan, United’s failure to file its motion within
§1330(a)’s 180-day deadline and its failure to seek relief on the basis of
fraud did not deprive those courts—and does not deprive us—of author­
ity to consider the motion on the merits because those limitations are
not jurisdictional. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515–516
(2006); Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, ante, at 12–13.
