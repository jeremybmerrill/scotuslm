Opinion of the Court

§60.44[1][a]; 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal
Practice & Procedure §2862, p. 331 (2d ed. 1995 and Supp.
2009); cf. Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State
Bank, 308 U. S. 371, 376 (1940); Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S.
165, 171–172 (1938). The error United alleges falls in
neither category.

Federal courts considering Rule 60(b)(4) motions that
assert a judgment is void because of a jurisdictional defect
generally have reserved relief only for the exceptional case
in which the court that rendered judgment lacked even an
“arguable basis” for jurisdiction. Nemaizer v. Baker, 793
F. 2d 58, 65 (CA2 1986); see, e.g., Boch Oldsmobile, supra,
at 661–662 (“[T]otal want of jurisdiction must be distin­
guished from an error in the exercise of jurisdiction, and
. . . only rare instances of a clear usurpation of power will
render a judgment void” (brackets and internal quotation
marks omitted)).
This case presents no occasion to engage in such an
“arguable basis” inquiry or to define the precise circum­
stances in which a jurisdictional error will render a judg­
ment void because United does not argue that the Bank­
ruptcy Court’s error was jurisdictional. Reply Brief for
Petitioner 5, 11. Such an argument would fail in any
event. First, §523(a)(8)’s statutory requirement that a
bankruptcy court find undue hardship before discharging
a student loan debt is a precondition to obtaining a dis­
charge order, not a limitation on the bankruptcy court’s
jurisdiction. See, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.
500, 515–516 (2006). Second, the requirement that a
bankruptcy court make this finding in an adversary pro­
ceeding derives from the Bankruptcy Rules, see Rule Proc.
7001(6), which are “procedural rules adopted by the Court
for the orderly transaction of its business” that are “not
jurisdictional.” Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 454
