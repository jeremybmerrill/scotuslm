Opinion of the Court

60(b)(4) is not an appropriate prophylaxis. As we stated in
Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638 (1992),
“[d]ebtors and their attorneys face penalties under various
provisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcy
proceedings,” id., at 644; see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011.
The specter of such penalties should deter bad-faith at­
tempts to discharge student loan debt without the undue
hardship finding Congress required. And to the extent
existing sanctions prove inadequate to this task, Congress
may enact additional provisions to address the difficulties
United predicts will follow our decision.
