UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA
Opinion of the Court

violation of the Code and Rules. We granted certiorari to
resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to
whether an order that confirms the discharge of a student
loan debt in the absence of an undue hardship finding or
an adversary proceeding, or both, is a void judgment for
Rule 60(b)(4) purposes.
I
Between 1988 and 1989, respondent Francisco Espinosa
obtained four federally guaranteed student loans for a
total principal amount of $13,250. In 1992, Espinosa filed
a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13. That Chapter
permits individual debtors to develop a plan to repay all or
a portion of their debts over a period of time specified in
the plan. See Nobelman v. American Savings Bank, 508
U. S. 324, 327 (1993); see also §§301(a), 1321; Fed. Rule
Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b). A proposed bankruptcy plan be­
comes effective upon confirmation, see §§1324, 1325, and
will result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if
the debtor completes the payments the plan requires, see
§1328(a).
Espinosa’s plan listed his student loan debt as his only
specific indebtedness. App. 15–18. The plan proposed to
repay only the principal on that debt, stating that the
remainder—the accrued interest—would be discharged
once Espinosa repaid the principal. Id., at 26.
As the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require,
the clerk of the Bankruptcy Court mailed notice and a
copy of Espinosa’s plan to petitioner United Student Aid
Funds, Inc. (United), the creditor to whom Espinosa owed
the student loan debt.1 Id., at 34; see Rules 2002(b), (g)(2),
3015(d). In boldface type immediately below the caption,
