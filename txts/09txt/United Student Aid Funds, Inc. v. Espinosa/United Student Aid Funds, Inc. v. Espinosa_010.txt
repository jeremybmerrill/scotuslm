Opinion of the Court

seeking to determine the dischargeability of a student loan
debt to commence an adversary proceeding by serving a
summons and complaint on affected creditors. See supra,
at 4. We must decide whether the Bankruptcy Court’s
order confirming Espinosa’s plan is “void” under Federal
Rule Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) because the Bankruptcy
Court confirmed the plan without complying with these
requirements.8
A

The Bankruptcy Court’s order confirming Espinosa’s

proposed plan was a final judgment, see In re Optical 

Technologies, Inc., 425 F. 3d 1294, 1300 (CA11 2005), from

which United did not appeal. Ordinarily, “the finality of

Specifically, Rule 60(b)(4)—the provision under which
United brought this motion—authorizes the court to re­

void.” 9

express no view on the terms upon which other provisions of the Bank­
ruptcy Rules may entitle a debtor or creditor to postjudgment relief.
9 Subject to certain exceptions, Bankruptcy Rule 9024 makes Rule
60(b) applicable to Chapter 13 proceedings. One such exception pro­
vides that “a complaint to revoke an order confirming a plan may be
filed only within the time allowed by” 11 U. S. C. §1330. Fed.
Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9024. Section 1330(a) imposes a 180-day time limit
for a party to seek revocation of a confirmation order “procured by
