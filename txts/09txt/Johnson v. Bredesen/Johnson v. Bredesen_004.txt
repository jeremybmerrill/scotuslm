JOHNSON v. BREDESEN
THOMAS, J., concurring

delays JUSTICE STEVENS laments. There are, of course,
alternatives. As Blackstone observed, the principle that
“punishment should follow the crime as early as possible”
found expression in a “statute, 25 Geo. II. c. 37,” decreeing
that “in case of murder, the judge shall in his sentence
direct execution to be performed on the next day but one
after sentence passed.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
*397. I have no doubt that such a system would avoid the
diminishing justification problem JUSTICE STEVENS identi
fies, but I am equally confident that such a system would
find little support from this Court. See Knight, 528 U. S.,
at 990 n. 1 (THOMAS, J. concurring). I thus concur in the
denial of certiorari.
