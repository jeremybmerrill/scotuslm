MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER
Opinion of the Court

Instead, the decisive consideration is whether delaying
review until the entry of final judgment “would imperil a
substantial public interest” or “some particular value of a
high order.” Will, 546 U. S., at 352–353.
In making this determination, we do not engage in an
“individualized jurisdictional inquiry.” Coopers & Ly

the attorney-client privilege, we do not decide whether the
other Cohen requirements are met.
Mohawk does not dispute that “we have generally de
nied review of pretrial discovery orders.” Firestone, 449
U. S., at 377; see also 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Coo
per, Federal Practice and Procedure §3914.23, p. 123 (2d
ed. 1992) (hereinafter Wright & Miller) (“[T]he rule re
mains settled that most discovery rulings are not final”).
Mohawk contends, however, that rulings implicating the
attorney-client privilege differ in kind from run-of-the-mill
discovery orders because of the important institutional
interests at stake. According to Mohawk, the right to
