Opinion of THOMAS, J.

practically defeat the right to any review at all.” Cobble
dick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323, 324–325 (1940). Until
1949, this Court’s view of the appellate jurisdiction statute
reflected this principle and the statute’s text. See, e.g.,
Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945) (holding
that §128 of the Judicial Code (now 28 U. S. C. §1291)
limits review to decisions that “en[d] the litigation on the
merits and leav[e] nothing for the court to do but execute
the judgment”). Cohen changed all that when it an
nounced that a “small class” of collateral orders that do
not meet the statutory definition of finality nonetheless
may be immediately appealable if they satisfy certain
criteria that show they are “too important to be denied
review.” 337 U. S., at 546.
Cohen and the early decisions applying it allowed §1291
appeals of interlocutory orders concerning the posting of a
bond, see id., at 545–547, the attachment of a vessel in
admiralty, see Swift & Co. Packers v. Compania Colombi
ana Del Caribe, S. A., 339 U. S. 684, 688–689 (1950), and
the imposition of notice costs in a class action, see Eisen v.
Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 170–172 (1974). As
the Court’s opinion notes, later decisions sought to narrow
Cohen lest its exception to §1291 “ ‘ swallow’ ” the final
judgment rule. Ante, at 5 (quoting Digital Equipment,
supra, at 868); see generally Coopers & Lybrand v. Live
say, 437 U. S. 463, 467–468 (1978). The Court has ad
hered to that narrowing approach, principally by raising
the bar on what types of interests are “important enough”
to justify collateral order appeals. See, e.g., Will, supra, at
352–353 (explaining that an interlocutory order typically
will be “important” enough to justify Cohen review only
where “some particular value of a high order,” such as
“honoring the separation of powers, preserving the effi
ciency of government . . . , [or] respecting a State’s digni
tary interests,” is “marshaled in support of the interest in
avoiding trial” and the Court determines that denying
