MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

immediately appealable.” Ante, at 12 (quoting Swint,
supra, at 48). Because that designation is entitled to our
full respect, and because the privilege order here is not on
all fours with orders we previously have held to be appeal
able under the collateral order doctrine, see Cohen v.
Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949), I
would affirm the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment on the
ground that any “avenue for immediate appeal” beyond
the three avenues addressed in the Court’s opinion must
be left to the “rulemaking process.” Ante, at 13; see ante,
at 9–12 (discussing certification under 28 U. S. C.
§1292(b), petitions for mandamus, and appeals from con
tempt orders).
We need not, and in my view should not, further justify
our holding by applying the Cohen doctrine, which
prompted the rulemaking amendments in the first place.
In taking this path, the Court needlessly perpetuates a
judicial policy that we for many years have criticized and
struggled to limit. See, e.g., Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S.

(2003); Cunningham, supra, at 210; Digital Equipment
Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 884 (1994);
Swint, supra, at 48; Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U. S.
495, 498–501 (1989); Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486
U. S. 517, 527 (1988). The Court’s choice of analysis is the
more ironic because applying Cohen to the facts of this
case requires the Court to reach conclusions on, and thus
potentially prejudice, the very matters it says would bene
fit from “the collective experience of bench and bar” and
the “opportunity for full airing” that rulemaking provides.
Ante, at 13.
“Finality as a condition of review is an historic charac
teristic of federal appellate procedure” that was incorpo
rated in the first Judiciary Act and that Congress itself
has “departed from only when observance of it would
