We reach a similar conclusion here. In our estimation,
postjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the

communications fell within the privilege’s crime-fraud
exception. Most district court rulings on these matters
involve the routine application of settled legal principles.
They are unlikely to be reversed on appeal, particularly
