Syllabus
tablished appellate review mechanisms not only provide assurances
to clients and counsel about the security of their confidential commu
nications; they also go a long way toward addressing Mohawk’s con
cern that, absent collateral order appeals of adverse attorney-client
privilege rulings, some litigants may experience severe hardship.
The limited benefits of applying “the blunt, categorical instrument of
§1291 collateral order appeal” to privilege-related disclosure orders
simply cannot justify the likely institutional costs, Digital Equip
ment, supra, at 883, including unduly delaying the resolution of dis
trict court litigation and needlessly burdening the courts of appeals,
cf. Cunningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U. S. 198, 209. Pp. 6–12.
(c) The admonition that the class of collaterally appealable orders
must remain “narrow and selective in its membership,” Will, supra,
at 350, has acquired special force in recent years with the enactment
of legislation designating rulemaking, “not expansion by court deci
sion,” as the preferred means for determining whether and when pre
judgment orders should be immediately appealable, Swint, supra, at
48. Any further avenue for immediate appeal of adverse attorney
client privilege rulings should be furnished, if at all, through rule
making, with the opportunity for full airing it provides. Pp. 12–13.
