final judgment in the underlying action.” Swint, 514
U. S., at 42.
In applying Cohen’s collateral order doctrine, we have
stressed that it must “never be allowed to swallow the
general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to
be deferred until final judgment has been entered.” Digi
tal Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863,
868 (1994) (citation omitted); see also Will v. Hallock, 546
U. S. 345, 350 (2006) (“emphasizing [the doctrine’s] mod
est scope”). Our admonition reflects a healthy respect for
the virtues of the final-judgment rule. Permitting piece
meal, prejudgment appeals, we have recognized, under
mines “efficient judicial administration” and encroaches
upon the prerogatives of district court judges, who play a
“special role” in managing ongoing litigation. Firestone
Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368, 374 (1981);
see also Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424,
436 (1985) (“[T]he district judge can better exercise [his or
her] responsibility [to police the prejudgment tactics of
litigants] if the appellate courts do not repeatedly inter
vene to second-guess prejudgment rulings”).
The justification for immediate appeal must therefore be
sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of defer
ring appeal until litigation concludes. This requirement
finds expression in two of the three traditional Cohen
conditions. The second condition insists upon “important
questions separate from the merits.” Swint, 514 U. S., at
42 (emphasis added). More significantly, “the third Cohen
question, whether a right is ‘adequately vindicable’ or
‘effectively reviewable,’ simply cannot be answered with
out a judgment about the value of the interests that would
be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment
requirement.” Digital Equipment, 511 U. S., at 878–879.
That a ruling “may burden litigants in ways that are only
imperfectly reparable by appellate reversal of a final
district court judgment . . . has never sufficed.” Id., at 872.
