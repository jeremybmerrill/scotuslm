Opinion of the Court

While these discretionary review mechanisms do not
provide relief in every case, they serve as useful “safety

Another long-recognized option is for a party to defy a
disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions. Dis
trict courts have a range of sanctions from which to
choose, including “directing that the matters embraced in
the order or other designated facts be taken as established
for purposes of the action,” “prohibiting the disobedient
party from supporting or opposing designated claims or
defenses,” or “striking pleadings in whole or in part.” Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2)(i)–(iii). Such sanctions allow a
party to obtain postjudgment review without having to
reveal its privileged information. Alternatively, when the
circumstances warrant it, a district court may hold a
noncomplying party in contempt. The party can then
appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the con
tempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punish
ment. See, e.g., Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United
States, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n. 11 (1992); Firestone, 449 U. S., at
377; Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323, 328
(1940); see also Wright & Miller §3914.23, at 140–155.
These established mechanisms for appellate review not
only provide assurances to clients and counsel about the
security of their confidential communications; they also go
a long way toward addressing Mohawk’s concern that,
absent collateral order appeals of adverse attorney-client
privilege rulings, some litigants may experience severe
hardship. Mohawk is no doubt right that an order to
disclose privileged material may, in some situations, have

3 Mohawk itself petitioned the Eleventh Circuit for a writ of manda
mus. See supra, at 3–4. It has not asked us to review the Court of
Appeals’ denial of that relief.
