Indeed, the rulemaking process has important virtues.
It draws on the collective experience of bench and bar, see
28 U. S. C. §2073, and it facilitates the adoption of meas

of standard postjudgment appeals, §1292(b) appeals,
mandamus, and contempt appeals will continue to provide
adequate protection to litigants ordered to disclose mate
rials purportedly subject to the attorney-client privilege.
Any further avenue for immediate appeal of such rulings
should be furnished, if at all, through rulemaking, with
the opportunity for full airing it provides.

In sum, we conclude that the collateral order doctrine
does not extend to disclosure orders adverse to the attor
ney-client privilege. Effective appellate review can be had
by other means. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of
the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
It is so ordered.
