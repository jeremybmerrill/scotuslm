ASTRUE v. RATLIFF
Opinion of the Court

ered that Ree owed the Government a debt that predated
the District Court’s approval of the award. Accordingly,
the United States sought an administrative offset against
the fees award to satisfy part of that debt.
The Government’s authority to use administrative
offsets is statutory. See 31 U. S. C. §§3711(a), 3716(a)
(authorizing an agency whose debt collection attempts are
unsuccessful to “collect the claim by administrative off
set”).1 Congress has subjected to offset all “funds payable
by the United States,” §3701(a)(1), to an individual who
owes certain delinquent federal debts, see §3701(b),
unless, as relevant here, payment is exempted by statute,
see §3716(e)(2). No such exemption applies to attorney’s
fees awards under 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)(1)(A) (hereinafter
subsection (d)(1)(A)), which are otherwise subject to offset,
see 31 CFR §285.5(e)(1) (2009), and which, as of January
2005, are covered by the Treasury Offset Program (TOP)
operated by the Treasury Department’s Financial Man
agement Service (FMS). See Brief for Petitioner 4 (ex
plaining TOP’s extension to cover so-called “ ‘miscellane
ous’ ” payments that include attorney’s fees payments
the Treasury Department makes on behalf of federal
agencies).2

1 Section

3701 defines an administrative offset as “withholding funds
payable by the United States” to the debtor. §3701(a)(1). An agency
may effect such an offset by cooperating with another agency to with
hold such funds, or by notifying the Treasury Department of the debt so
Treasury may include it in Treasury’s centralized offset program. See
31 CFR §§285.5(d)(2), 901.3(b)(1), (c). Alternatively, the Treasury
Department may attempt an administrative offset after receiving notice
from a creditor agency that a legally enforceable nontax debt has
become more than 180 days delinquent. See 31 U. S. C. §3716(c)(6); 31
CFR §§285.5(d)(1), 901.3(b)(1).
2 Respondent Ratliff argues for the first time in her merits brief be
fore this Court that the 2005 amendments to the FMS regulations
exempt the EAJA fees award in this case from administrative offset
against Ree’s outstanding federal debt. See Brief for Respondent 8, 46
