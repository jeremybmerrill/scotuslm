(arguing that subsection (d)(1)(A)’s use of the word
“ ‘award’ ” “expressly incorporates a critical distinction”
between the right to an “ ‘award’ ” of fees and the right to
“ ‘receiv[e]’ ” the fees). We disagree.
The transitive verb “ ‘award’ ” has a settled meaning in
the litigation context: It means “[t]o give or assign by
sentence or judicial determination.” Black’s Law Diction
ary 125 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added); see also Web
ster’s Third New International Dictionary 152 (1993) (“to
give by judicial decree” (emphasis added)). The plain
meaning of the word “award” in subsection (d)(1)(A) is
thus that the court shall “give or assign by . . . judicial
determination” to the “prevailing party” (here, Ratliff’s
client Ree) attorney’s fees in the amount sought and sub

Ratliff’s contrary argument does not withstand scrutiny.
According to Ratliff, subsection (d)(1)(B), which uses “the
noun ‘award’ ” to mean a “ ‘decision,’ ” requires us to con

award (the decision granting fees), but only the attorney
who earned the fee (the payment asked or given for profes

marks and footnote omitted). This argument ignores the
settled definitions above, and even the definitions Ratliff
proffers, because each makes clear that the verb “award”
in subsection (d)(1)(A) means to “give by the decision of a
law court” or to “grant . . . by judicial decree,” not simply to
“give a decision” itself. Id., at 16, and n. 39 (emphasis
added; internal quotation marks omitted). We thus agree
with the Government that under the statutory language
here, the “judicial decision is the means by which the court
confers a right to payment upon the prevailing party; it is
not itself the thing that the court gives (or orders the
