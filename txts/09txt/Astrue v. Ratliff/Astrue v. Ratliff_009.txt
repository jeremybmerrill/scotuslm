ASTRUE v. RATLIFF
Opinion of the Court

defendant to give) to the party.” Reply Brief for Petitioner
4 (emphasis in original) (citing Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S.
755, 761 (1987) (explaining that “[i]n all civil litigation,
the judicial decree is not the end but the means”)). This
settled and natural construction of the operative statutory
language is reflected in our cases. See, e.g., Scarborough
v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 405 (2004) (“EAJA authorizes
the payment of fees to a prevailing party” (emphasis
added)).
Ratliff’s final textual argument—that subsection
(d)(1)(A)’s reference to “attorney’s fees” itself establishes
that the fees are payable to the prevailing party’s attor
ney, see Brief for Respondent 19−22—proves far too much.
The fact that the statute awards to the prevailing party
fees in which her attorney may have a beneficial interest
or a contractual right does not establish that the statute
“awards” the fees directly to the attorney. For the reasons
we have explained, the statute’s plain text does the oppo
site—it “awards” the fees to the litigant, and thus subjects
them to a federal administrative offset if the litigant has
outstanding federal debts.
III
In an effort to avoid the Act’s plain meaning, Ratliff
argues that other provisions of EAJA, combined with the
SSA and the Government’s practice of paying some EAJA
fees awards directly to attorneys in Social Security cases,
render §2412(d) at least ambiguous on the question pre
sented here, and that these other provisions resolve the
ambiguity in her favor. Again we disagree. Even accept
ing §2412(d) as ambiguous on the question presented, the
provisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter our
conclusion that EAJA fees are payable to litigants and are
thus subject to offset where a litigant has outstanding
federal debts.
To begin with, §2412(d)(1)’s provisions differentiate
