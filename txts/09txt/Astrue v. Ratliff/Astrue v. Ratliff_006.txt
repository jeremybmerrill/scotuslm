Opinion of the Court

In this case, the Government, relying on the TOP, noti
fied Ree that the Government would apply her §2412(d)
fees award to offset a portion of her outstanding federal
debt. Ratliff intervened to challenge the offset on the
grounds that §2412(d) fees belong to a litigant’s attorney
and thus may not be used to offset or otherwise satisfy a
litigant’s federal debts. The District Court held that
because §2412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the pre
vailing party, not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing
to challenge the Government’s proposed offset. See No.
CIV. 06–5070–RHB, 2007 WL 6894710, *1 (D SD, May 10,
2007).
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.
540 F. 3d 800 (2008). It held that under Circuit precedent,
“EAJA attorneys’ fees are awarded to prevailing parties’
attorneys.” Id., at 802. The Court of Appeals recognized
that its decision did not accord with a “literal interpreta
tion of the EAJA,” ibid., and exacerbated a split among the
Courts of Appeals, compare id., at 801–802, with, e.g.,
Reeves v. Astrue, 526 F. 3d 732, 733 (CA11 2008); Manning
v. Astrue, 510 F. 3d 1246, 1249–1251 (CA10 2007); FDL
Technologies, Inc. v. United States, 967 F. 2d 1578, 1580
(CA Fed. 1992); Panola Land Buying Assn. v. Clark, 844
F. 2d 1506, 1510–1511 (CA11 1988).3 We granted certio
rari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).
——————
(citing 31 CFR §285.5(e)(5)). We need not decide this question because
Ratliff did not raise the regulations as a bar to offset in her brief in
opposition to the Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, see this
Court’s Rule 15.2, or in the proceedings below.
3 The split exists in the Social Security context because the Social
Security Act (SSA), 49 Stat. 620, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §301 et seq.,
provides for payment of attorney’s fees awards directly to counsel, see
§406(b)(1)(A), and until 2006 the Government in many cases treated
fees awards under EAJA the same way, see Reply Brief for Petitioner
13−14.
