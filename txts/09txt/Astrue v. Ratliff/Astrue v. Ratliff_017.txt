SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

The EAJA’s admirable purpose will be undercut if law
yers fear that they will never actually receive attorney’s
fees to which a court has determined the prevailing party
is entitled. The point of an award of attorney’s fees, after
all, is to enable a prevailing litigant to pay her attorney.
See, e.g., Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 285 (1989)
(“We . . . take as our starting point the self-evident propo
sition that the ‘reasonable attorney’s fee’ provided by [42
U. S. C. §1988] should compensate” for “the work product
of an attorney”); Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435
(1983) (“Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results,
his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee”). We
have accordingly acknowledged that in litigants’ motions
for attorney’s fees, “the real parties in interest are their
attorneys.” Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U. S. 789, 798, n. 6
(2002). Subjecting EAJA fee awards to administrative
offset for a litigant’s debts will unquestionably make it
more difficult for persons of limited means to find attor
neys to represent them. See, e.g., Brief for National Or
ganization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives
et al. as Amici Curiae 25 (hereinafter NOSSCR Brief).
In its arguments before this Court, the Government
resists this self-evident conclusion, but each of the three
reasons it proffers is unpersuasive. First, the Government
suggests that because EAJA fee awards are limited to
those circumstances in which the Government’s position is
not “substantially justified,” 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)(1)(A), no
lawyer can rely on an EAJA fee award when deciding to
take a case, so the possibility of an offset eliminating the
award will play no additional role in the lawyer’s deci
sion.2 Reply Brief for Petitioner 16–17. But it is common

2 In its brief, the Government downplays the frequency with which fee
awards under the EAJA are made. At oral argument, respondent’s
counsel represented that EAJA fee awards are made in 42% of Social
Security cases in which the claimant prevails and in 70% of all vet
eran’s benefits cases filed. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42–43. The Government did
