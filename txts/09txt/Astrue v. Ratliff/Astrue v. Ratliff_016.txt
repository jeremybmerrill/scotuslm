ASTRUE v. RATLIFF
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

individuals, partnerships, corporations, and labor and
other organizations may be deterred from seeking review
of, or defending against, unreasonable governmental
action because of the expense involved in securing the
vindication of their rights in civil actions and in adminis
trative proceedings.” §202(a), 94 Stat. 2325, note following
5 U. S. C. §504, p. 684 (Congressional Findings). As we
have often recognized, “the specific purpose of the EAJA is
to eliminate for the average person the financial disincen
tive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.”
Commissioner v. Jean, 496 U. S. 154, 163 (1990); see also
Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 406 (2004) (by
“expressly authoriz[ing] attorney’s fee awards against the
Federal Government,” Congress sought “ ‘to eliminate the
barriers that prohibit small businesses and individuals
from securing vindication of their rights in civil actions
and administrative proceedings brought by or against the
Federal Government’ ” (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 96–1005, p.
9 (1979))); Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877, 883 (1989)
(the EAJA was designed to address the problem that
“ ‘[f]or many citizens, the costs of securing vindication of
their rights and the inability to recover attorney fees
preclude resort to the adjudicatory process’ ” (quoting
S. Rep. No. 96–253, p. 5 (1979))). EAJA fee awards, which
average only $3,000 to $4,000 per case, have proved to be
a remarkably efficient way of improving access to the
courts for the statute’s intended beneficiaries, including
thousands of recipients of Social Security and veteran’s
benefits each year.1 Brief for Respondent 4–5; see also
Jean, 496 U. S., at 164, nn. 12–13.

1 The EAJA makes fee awards available to challenge Government
action under a wide range of statutes, but, as respondent notes, the
vast majority of EAJA awards are made in these two contexts, with
Social Security cases representing the lion’s share. Brief for Respon
dent 4–5; Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants’
Representatives et al. as Amici Curiae 22–23.
