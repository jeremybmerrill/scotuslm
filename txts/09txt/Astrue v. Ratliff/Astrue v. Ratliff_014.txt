Opinion of the Court

most recent cases applying §1988(b)’s “prevailing party”
language recognize the practical reality that attorneys are
the beneficiaries and, almost always, the ultimate recipi
ents of the fees that the statute awards to “prevailing
part[ies].” See, e.g., Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U. S. 82, 86
(1990). But these cases emphasize the nonstatutory (con
tractual and other assignment-based) rights that typically
confer upon the attorney the entitlement to payment of
the fees award the statute confers on the prevailing liti
gant. As noted above, these kinds of arrangements would
be unnecessary if, as Ratliff contends, statutory fees lan
guage like that in §1988(b) and EAJA provides attorneys
with a statutory right to direct payment of awards. Hence
our conclusion that “the party, rather than the lawyer,”
id., at 87, is “entitle[d] to receive the fees” under §1988(b),
id., at 88, and that the statute “controls what the losing
defendant must pay, not what the prevailing plaintiff
must pay his lawyer,” id., at 90; see also Evans v. Jeff D.,
475 U. S. 717, 730−732, and n. 19 (1986) (explaining that
the “language of [§1988] . . . bestow[s] on the ‘prevailing
party’ (generally plaintiffs) a statutory eligibility for a
discretionary award of attorney’s fees” and does not “be
sto[w] fee awards upon attorneys” themselves (footnote
omitted)). These conclusions apply with equal force to the
functionally identical statutory language here.

We reverse the Court of Appeals’ judgment and remand
the case for further proceedings consistent with this

It is so ordered.
