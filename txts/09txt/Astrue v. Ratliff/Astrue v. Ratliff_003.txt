Syllabus
§406(b) and 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)], the . . . attorney [must] refun[d] to
the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.” See note following
§2412. Ratliff’s argument that this recognition that an attorney will
sometimes “receiv[e]” §2412(d) fees suggests that subsection (d)(1)(A)
should be construed to incorporate the same direct payments to at­
torneys that the SSA expressly authorizes gives more weight to “re­
cei[pt]” than the term can bear: The ensuing reference to the attor­
ney’s obligation to “refund” the smaller fee to the claimant
demonstrates that the award belongs to the claimant in the first
place. Moreover, Ratliff’s reading is irreconcilable with the textual
differences between the two Acts. The fact that the Government, un­
til 2006, frequently paid EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in
SSA cases in which the prevailing party had assigned the attorney
her rights in the award does not alter the Court’s interpretation of
the Act’s fees provision. That some such cases involved a prevailing
party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising, given that it
was not until 2005 that the TOP was modified to require offsets
against attorney’s fees awards. And as Ratliff admits, the Govern­
ment has since discontinued the direct payment practice except in
cases where the plaintiff does not owe a federal debt and has as­
signed her right to fees to the attorney. Finally, the Court’s conclu­
sion is buttressed by cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S. C.
§1988, which contains language virtually identical to §2412(d)(1)(A)’s.
