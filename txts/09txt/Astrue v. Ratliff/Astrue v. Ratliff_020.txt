ASTRUE v. RATLIFF
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

cost.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 20. The history of these
provisions indicates otherwise. For more than two dec
ades after the EAJA was enacted in 1980, the Commis
sioner of Social Security “consistently paid” EAJA fee
awards directly to the attorney, not the prevailing party.
Stephens ex rel. R. E. v. Astrue, 565 F. 3d 131, 135 (CA4
2009); see also Bryant v. Commissioner of Social Security,
578 F. 3d 443, 446 (CA6 2009); cf. ante, at 3, n. 3, 9–10.
“In fact, the Commissioner created a direct deposit system
for attorneys and issued [Internal Revenue Service] 1099
forms directly to the attorneys who received awards, not
ing the awards as taxable attorney income.” Stephens, 565
F. 3d, at 135. Not until 2005, when the Treasury Depart
ment extended the offset program to cover “miscellaneous”
federal payments, including “fees,” did the Commissioner
cease paying EAJA fee awards directly to attorneys and
adopt the position that the awards were appropriately
considered the property of the prevailing party. Id., at 136
(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Bryant, 578
F. 3d, at 446; ante, at 2, 10. Congress therefore had no
reason to include a specific exemption of EAJA fee awards
(in the Social Security context or otherwise) from the offset
program when it enacted the DCIA in 1996.
I am further reluctant to conclude that Congress would
want EAJA fee awards to be offset for a prevailing liti
gant’s unrelated debts because it is not likely to effectuate
the DCIA’s purpose of “maximiz[ing] collections of delin
quent debts owed to the Government by ensuring quick
action to enforce recovery of debts and the use of all ap
propriate collection tools.” §31001(b)(1), 110 Stat. 1321–
358. This purpose would be better served if claimants are
able to find attorneys to help them secure the benefits
they are rightfully owed in the first place, thereby making
available a source of funds to permit repayment of the
claimants’ Government debts at all. See NOSSCR Brief
