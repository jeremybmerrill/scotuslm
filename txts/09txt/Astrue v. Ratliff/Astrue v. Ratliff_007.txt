ASTRUE v. RATLIFF 

Opinion of the Court 


II 

Subsection (d)(1)(A) directs that courts “shall award to a
prevailing party . . . fees and other expenses . . . incurred
by that party.” (Emphasis added.) We have long held that
the term “prevailing party” in fee statutes is a “term of
art” that refers to the prevailing litigant. See, e.g., Buck
hannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of
Health and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001).
This treatment reflects the fact that statutes that award
attorney’s fees to a prevailing party are exceptions to the
“ ‘American Rule’ ” that each litigant “bear [his] own attor
ney’s fees.” Id., at 602 (citing Key Tronic Corp. v. United
States, 511 U. S. 809, 819 (1994)). Nothing in EAJA sup
ports a different reading. Cf. Arthur Andersen LLP v.
Carlisle, 556 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2009) (slip op., at 6, n. 4)
(where Congress employs “identical words and phrases
within the same statute,” they are presumed to carry “the
same meaning” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Indeed, other subsections within §2412(d) underscore that
the term “prevailing party” in subsection (d)(1)(A) carries
its usual and settled meaning—prevailing litigant. Those
other subsections clearly distinguish the party who re
ceives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who
performed the work that generated the fees. See, e.g.,
§2412(d)(1)(B) (hereinafter subsection (d)(1)(B)) (the “pre
vailing party” must apply for the fees award and “sho[w]”
that he “is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an
award” by, among other things, submitting “an itemized
statement from any attorney . . . representing or appearing
in behalf of the party” that details the attorney’s hourly
rate and time spent on the case (emphasis added)); see
also Part III, infra.
Ratliff nonetheless asserts that subsection (d)(1)(A)’s
use of the verb “award” renders §2412(d) fees payable
directly to a prevailing party’s attorney and thus protects
the fees from a Government offset against the prevailing
