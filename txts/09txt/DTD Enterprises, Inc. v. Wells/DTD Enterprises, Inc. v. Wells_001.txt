VICE, ET AL. v. JANICE H. WELLS, ON BEHALF OF

HERSELF AND ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPERIOR 

COURT OF NEW JERSEY, MIDDLESEX COUNTY

No. 08–1407. Decided October 13, 2009

The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
Statement of JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF
JUSTICE and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, respecting the
denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.
This case began with a contract action brought by DTD
Enterprises, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner), a commercial

refused to make payments due under a contract. Respon

tioner. The trial court certified the class and ordered
petitioner to bear all the costs of class notification, on the
sole ground (or so it appears) that petitioner could afford
to pay and respondent could not.
To the extent that New Jersey law allows a trial court to
impose the onerous costs of class notification on a defen
dant simply because of the relative wealth of the defen
dant and without any consideration of the underlying
merits of the suit, a serious due process question is raised.
Where a court has concluded that a plaintiff lacks the
means to pay for class certification, the defendant has
little hope of recovering its expenditures later if the suit
proves meritless; therefore, the court’s order requiring the
defendant to pay for the notification “finally destroy[s] a
property interest.” Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455
