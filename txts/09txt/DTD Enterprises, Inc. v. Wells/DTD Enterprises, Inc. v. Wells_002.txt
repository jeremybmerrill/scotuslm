DTD ENTERPRISES, INC. v. WELLS
Statement of KENNEDY, J.

a “ ‘hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.’ ” Boddie
v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371, 378 (1971). And there is
considerable force to the argument that a hearing in which
the trial court does not consider the underlying merits of
the class-action suit is not consistent with due process
because it is not sufficient, or appropriate, to protect the
property interest at stake.
I nonetheless agree with the Court’s denial of certiorari,
for two reasons. First, the petition is interlocutory; the
state appellate courts denied petitioner leave to appeal the
trial court’s action. Second, petitioner has filed for bank
ruptcy, and an automatic bankruptcy stay has issued
pursuant to 11 U. S. C. §362. Respondents contend that
the present action comes within the scope of the automatic
stay. If we were to grant the petition we would be re
quired to construe New Jersey law without the aid of a
reasoned state appellate court decision and to confront a
procedural obstacle unrelated to the question presented.
Under these circumstances, it is best to deny the peti
tion. It seems advisable, however, to note that the peti
tion for certiorari does implicate issues of constitutional
significance.
