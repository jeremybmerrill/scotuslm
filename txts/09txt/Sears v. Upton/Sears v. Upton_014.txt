SEARS v. UPTON
SCALIA, J., dissenting

Cert. 25B–26B.
The Court today concludes that there were two errors in
the application of that proper standard. First, it reasons
that the court erroneously “curtailed a more probing
prejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the
assumed reasonableness of counsel’s mitigation theory” at
trial. Ante, at 8. That argument is flawed on several
levels. To begin with, the state habeas court did not as
sume trial counsel’s mitigation theory was reasonable; it
found that it was. It said: “[A]lthough counsel failed to
investigate thoroughly, they did develop a reasonable
mitigation theory with evidence to support it.” App. to
Pet. for Cert. 30B. After interviews of roughly a dozen
potential mitigation witnesses, who, with the exception of
Sears’ father, gave positive accounts of Sears and his
family, see 7 Record 2025, 2051–2052; 8 id., at 2129,
2291–2344, Sears’ trial counsel developed a mitigation
theory that Sears came from a good family and had a solid
middle-class upbringing; that his offense was completely
out of character; that he cooperated with police; and that
sentencing Sears to death would devastate his family and
friends, see id., at 2124–2125; 19 id., at 4861–4862, 4916–
4917, 4954–4955; 20 id., at 5181. To support that ap
proach his attorneys called seven witnesses, including
Sears’ mother, four family friends, and his high school
guidance counselor. See Pet. for Cert. 6–7 (citing trial
transcript pages between 2375 and 2451). The state ha
beas court did not declare that this mitigation theory
“might be reasonable, in the abstract,” as the Court puts
it, ante, at 8. Rather, it concluded that counsel “put forth
a reasonable theory with supporting evidence.” App. to
Pet. for Cert. 30B.
The Court’s argument is also flawed because the habeas
court’s reasonableness finding did not cause it to “curtai[l]”
its prejudice inquiry, or lead to the conclusion that it could
“obviate the need to analyze” whether pursuing a different
