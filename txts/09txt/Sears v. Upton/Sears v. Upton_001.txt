Per Curiam

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
DEMARCUS ALI SEARS v. STEPHEN UPTON, 

WARDEN 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME 

COURT OF GEORGIA

No. 09–8854. Decided June 29, 2010 


PER CURIAM.
According to an expert who testified during state post
conviction relief, petitioner Demarcus A. Sears performs at
or below the bottom first percentile in several measures of
cognitive functioning and reasoning. The cause of this
abnormality appears to be significant frontal lobe brain
damage Sears suffered as a child, as well as drug and
alcohol abuse in his teens. But because—in the words of
the state trial court—his counsel conducted a penalty
phase investigation that was “on its face . . . constitution
ally inadequate,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B, evidence
relating to Sears’ cognitive impairments and childhood
difficulties was not brought to light at the time he was
sentenced to death.
After finding constitutionally deficient attorney per
formance under the framework we set forth in Strickland
v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the state postconvic
tion court found itself unable to assess whether counsel’s
inadequate investigation might have prejudiced Sears.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 29B–30B. Because Sears’ counsel
did present some mitigation evidence during Sears’ pen
alty phase—but not the significant mitigation evidence a
constitutionally adequate investigation would have uncov
ered—the state court determined it could not speculate as
to what the effect of additional evidence would have been.
Id., at 30B. Accordingly, it denied Sears postconviction
relief. Id., at 34B. Thereafter, the Supreme Court of
Georgia summarily denied review of his claims. Id., at 1A.
