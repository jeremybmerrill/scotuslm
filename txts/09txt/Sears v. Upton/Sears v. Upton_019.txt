SCALIA, J., dissenting

testimony of his less-than-trustworthy brother, Demetrius,
see, e.g., 1 Record 122, 133. And then there are the unfa
vorable parts of Dr. Dudley’s testimony: Sears is a “narcis
sis[t],” id., at 135, with a “grandiose” opinion of himself,
id., at 98–99; 2 id., at 246. Dr. Dudley’s affidavit portrays
Sears as arrogant and self-centered, id., at 246, 247, and
notes what he termed Sears’ “fantastical” boasting of his
first sexual experience with a woman at the age of six and
his other “innumerable sexual experiences,” 1 id., at 98–
99, 100; 2 id., at 246–247. It is hard to see how it could be
thought probable that Sears’ so-called “magical thinking,”
1 id., at 84, would have helped his plea for leniency, see
ante, at 6–7. It seems to me more likely the jury would
conclude that Sears’ “profoun[d] personality disorder,”
1 Record 104, made him exactly the kind of person who
would commit heinous crimes in the future.
And some of the evidence the Court recounts is so ut
terly unlikely to affect a jury’s determination that this
brutal murder deserved death that its recitation is just
plain hilarious. For example, the claim that Sears’ father
“was ‘verbally abusive,’ ” ante, at 3, resting on nothing
more than an art teacher’s recollection that Sears’ father
“severely criticized” him—“and meant it”!—at a conference
with the principal concerning his son’s poor academic
performance, 6 Record 1747; the claim that his father
“disciplined Sears with age-inappropriate military-style
drills,” ante, at 3–4, which consisted of positively VonSteubenesque acts such as dousing the kid with cold water
when he refused to get up for school, and making him run
extra laps after sports practices, 6 Record 1622; and the
claim that his mother’s “ ‘favorite word’ ”—actually three
words—to refer to her sons was scatological, ante, at 3
(quoting 2 Record 265).
While the Court takes pain to describe all the elements
of Sears’ new mitigation theory, down to the silliest, it
does not trouble to describe the brutal circumstances of
