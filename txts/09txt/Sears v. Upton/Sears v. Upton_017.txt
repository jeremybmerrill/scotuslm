SCALIA, J., dissenting

inquiry the Court purports to disavow, ante, at 12, but
nonetheless tendentiously undertakes, ante, at 3–6. The
reader might think the state habeas court’s conclusion
highly questionable from the Court’s account, which re
cites as solid all the evidence supporting Sears’ new miti
gation theory, see ante, at 3–7. It is far from solid. Some
is likely inadmissible as unreliable hearsay under Georgia
law, see Gissendaner v. State, 272 Ga. 704, 714, 532 S. E.
2d 677, 688–689 (2000); Gulley v. State, 271 Ga. 337, 347,
519 S. E. 2d 655, 664 (1999)—such as much of the evi
dence for the uncorroborated second-hand claim that
Sears “suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent
male cousin,” ante, at 3.3 Other evidence a competent
attorney would likely not have placed before the jury—
such as all the testimony about Sears’ childhood from his
brother Demetrius, an admitted drug dealer and drug
user, 6 Record 1682–1684, 1695, 1752, and a convicted
felon (for bank fraud, wire fraud, identity theft, and co
caine trafficking), id., at 1687. No juror would have been
impressed by such a character witness.
Some of the evidence is incredible, such as the psychia
trist’s assertion that Sears had “substantial deficits in
mental cognition and reasoning . . . as a result of serious

3 The

Court’s reliance on Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95, 97 (1979)
(per curiam), ante, at 6, n. 6, to suggest that this unreliable hearsay
would be admissible for sentencing purposes is entirely misplaced. In
Green, we held it violated constitutional due process to exclude testi
mony regarding a co-conspirator’s confession that he alone committed
the capital murder with which the defendant was charged. Our holding
depended on “th[e] unique circumstances” of the case: the testimony to
be used at sentencing was “highly relevant” and “substantial[ly]”
reliable as a statement against penal interest made to a close friend; it
was corroborated by “ample” evidence and was used by the State to
obtain a conviction in a separate trial against the co-conspirator. 442
U. S., at 97. Here there are no such circumstances. The testimony is
uncorroborated second-hand reporting from self-interested witnesses
that is unreliable and therefore likely inadmissible.
