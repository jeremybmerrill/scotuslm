SEARS v. UPTON
SCALIA, J., dissenting

head injuries he suffered as a child,” ante, at 4. The seri
ous head injuries consisted of Sears’ hitting his head at a
roller-skating rink sometime early in elementary school,
1 Record 76; 2 id., at 225, running into an end table as a
child, 6 id., at 1651, and getting hit with a golf club some
time later in elementary school, 1 id., at 79; 2 id., at 225.4
(The last of these major injuries might not have been
introduced anyway, since that would have provided the
prosecution an opportunity to refute both the extent of the
injury and the mercy-worthiness of Sears, by introducing
into evidence Sears’ boast that when he was 11 or 12 he
“beat the s*** out of” someone after he was hit on the head
with a golf club, 8 id., at 2195.) Likewise incredible was
the assertion that Demetrius “introduced Sears to a life of
crime,” ante, at 6. According to testimony on which the
Court relies, Demetrius would “never let [Sears] hang
around” with him and his drug-dealing friends. 6 Record

A jury also would have discredited the psychiatric tes
timony of Dr. Strickland that “[f]rom an etiological stand

trauma, substance abuse and traumatic experiences of the
type expected’ to lead to these significant [mental] im

the self-interested reporting of Sears himself and the

4 There is an unsubstantiated claim from Sears himself, 8 Record
2195, that when he was a teenager he was hit with a “hatchet” above
his right eye. Of course, that is the same place where he collided with
an end table, 6 id., at 1651, leaving the “lesion”—better known as a
scar—on his head that Dr. Strickland noted, ante, at 5–6, n. 5 (quoting
1 Record 78). There is no corroborating evidence for this event: no
medical records, 1 id., at 77, no other apparent scars, 2 id., at 245; 6 id.,
at 1651, and, tellingly, no family or friends to confirm what surely
would have been memorable had it happened.
