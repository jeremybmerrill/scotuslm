SEARS v. UPTON
SCALIA, J., dissenting

pared with those where little or no mitigation evidence is
presented and where a reasonable prediction of outcome
can be made.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis
added). That is absolutely correct. This case is not like
the prejudice cases on which the Court relies, where it
could readily be said that the overlooked mitigation theory
would have made a much deeper impression on the jury
than the utterly unsupported theory (or absence of any
theory) offered at trial. See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.
___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12); Rompilla v.
Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 378, 393 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith,
539 U. S. 510, 515, 537 (2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529
U. S. 362, 369 (2000). Sears’ trial counsel presented a
reasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi
cient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more
difficult—so difficult that Sears could not make the requi

particular case, the court said:
“Although here, the Petitioner can argue that a prior
appeal shows the difficulty one juror was having
reaching the same verdict as the others, it is just not
possible to know what effect a different mitigation
theory would have had on her, just as it is impossible
to know what effect it would have had on other ju
rors.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B.
Since the habeas court made no legal error en route to
its Strickland conclusion, the only basis for reversing the
judgment here would be disagreement with the conclusion
itself: that Sears had not established that his new mitiga
tion theory would probably have caused the jury to impose
a life sentence instead of death.
The Court makes no attempt to contradict that conclu
sion. Doing so would require a fact-intensive inquiry into
the 22-volume record to measure the persuasiveness of the
evidence supporting Sears’ new mitigation theory—an
