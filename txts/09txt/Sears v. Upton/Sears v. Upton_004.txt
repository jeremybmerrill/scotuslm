SEARS v. UPTON
Per Curiam

military-style drills, Exh. 3, 2 Record 263–264; Exh. 19, 6
Record 1622 (Affidavit of Frank Sears); Exh. 22, id., at
1651; Exh. 28, id., at 1694 (Affidavit of Kenneth Burns,
Sr.). Sears struggled in school, demonstrating substantial
behavior problems from a very young age. For example,
Sears repeated the second grade, Exh. 6, 3 Record 500–
501, and was referred to a local health center for evalua
tion at age nine, Exh. 7, id., at 503, 504, 508. By the time
Sears reached high school, he was “described as severely
learning disabled and as severely behaviorally handi
capped.” Exh. A to Exh. 1, 2 Record 174–176 (Affidavit of
Tony L. Strickland, M. S., Ph. D.).
Environmental factors aside, and more significantly,
evidence produced during the state postconviction relief
process also revealed that Sears suffered “significant
frontal lobe abnormalities.” Exh. 1, id., at 147. Two dif
ferent psychological experts testified that Sears had sub
stantial deficits in mental cognition and reasoning—i.e.,
“problems with planning, sequencing and impulse control,”
ibid.—as a result of several serious head injuries he suf
fered as a child, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. See 1
Record 37–40 (Testimony of Dr. Strickland); id., at 95–96
(Testimony of Dr. Dudley). Regardless of the cause of his
brain damage, his scores on at least two standardized
assessment tests placed him at or below the first percen
tile in several categories of cognitive function, “making
him among the most impaired individuals in the popula
tion in terms of ability to suppress competing impulses
and conform behavior only to relevant stimuli.” Exh. 1, 2
Record 148; see also 1 Record 37. The assessment also
revealed that Sears’ “ability to organize his choices, assign
them relative weight and select among them in a deliber
ate way is grossly impaired.” Exh. 1, 2 Record 149. From
an etiological standpoint, one expert explained that Sears’
“history is replete with multiple head trauma, substance
abuse and traumatic experiences of the type expected” to
