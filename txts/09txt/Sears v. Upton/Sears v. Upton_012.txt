SEARS v. UPTON 

Per Curiam


III 

A proper analysis of prejudice under Strickland would
have taken into account the newly uncovered evidence of
Sears’ “significant” mental and psychological impairments,
along with the mitigation evidence introduced during
Sears’ penalty phase trial, to assess whether there is a
reasonable probability that Sears would have received a
different sentence after a constitutionally sufficient miti
gation investigation. See Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at
11); Williams, supra, at 397–398; Strickland, supra, at
694. It is for the state court—and not for either this Court
or even JUSTICE SCALIA—to undertake this reweighing in
the first instance.
Accordingly, the petition for certiorari and the motion
for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The
judgment below is vacated, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO would deny the
petition for a writ of certiorari.
