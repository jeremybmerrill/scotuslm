SEARS v. UPTON
Per Curiam

Second, and more fundamentally, the court failed to
apply the proper prejudice inquiry. We have never limited
the prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in which
there was only “little or no mitigation evidence” presented,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B. True, we have considered cases
involving such circumstances,11 and we have explained
that there is no prejudice when the new mitigating evi
dence “would barely have altered the sentencing profile
presented” to the decisionmaker, Strickland, supra, at
700. But we also have found deficiency and prejudice in
other cases in which counsel presented what could be
described as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory
during the penalty phase. E.g., Williams, supra, at 398
(remorse and cooperation with police); Rompilla v. Beard,
545 U. S. 374, 378 (2005) (residual doubt). We did so most
recently in Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(per curiam) (slip op., at 3), where counsel at trial had
attempted to blame his client’s bad acts on his drunken
ness, and had failed to discover significant mitigation
evidence relating to his client’s heroic military service and
substantial mental health difficulties that came to light
only during postconviction relief, id., at ___ (slip op., at
11–12). Not only did we find prejudice in Porter, but—
bound by deference owed under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)—
we also concluded the state court had unreasonably ap
plied Strickland’s prejudice prong when it analyzed Por
ter’s claim. Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).
We certainly have never held that counsel’s effort to
present some mitigation evidence should foreclose an
inquiry into whether a facially deficient mitigation inves
tigation might have prejudiced the defendant. To the
contrary, we have consistently explained that the Strick
——————
distinct from the second, whether there was prejudice as a result.
