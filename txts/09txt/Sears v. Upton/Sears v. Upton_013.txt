SCALIA, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
DEMARCUS ALI SEARS v. STEPHEN UPTON, 

WARDEN 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME 

COURT OF GEORGIA

No. 09–8854. Decided June 29, 2010 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,

The Court concludes, ante, at 7–12, that the Superior
Court of Butts County, Georgia, made errors of law in
applying the prejudice inquiry for ineffective-assistance-of
counsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.
668 (1984). In my view there was no error of law, and the
Court today remands for the state court to do what it has
already done: find no reasonable likelihood that the miti
gation evidence the Court details in its opinion would have
persuaded a jury to change its mind about the death sen

The state habeas court responsibly executed the first
step in the Strickland analysis, finding that the investiga
tion of mitigation evidence by Sears’ trial counsel was
deficient performance. The issue here is the second step:
whether Sears was prejudiced by that deficiency. As the
Court acknowledges, ante, at 7, the state habeas court
correctly stated the prejudice standard under Strickland:
The defendant has the burden to establish “a reasonable
probability that, but for counsel’s deficient performance,
the result of the proceeding would have been different.”
App. to Pet. for Cert. 24B–25B (citing 466 U. S., at 688,
694). “When applied to the sentencing phase of death
penalty trials,” that means “a reasonable probability that,
absent [counsel’s] errors, the sentencer would have con
cluded that the balance of the aggravating and mitigating
circumstances did not warrant death.” App. to Pet. for
