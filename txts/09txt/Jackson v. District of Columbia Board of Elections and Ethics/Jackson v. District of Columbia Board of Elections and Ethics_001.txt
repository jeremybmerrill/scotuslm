HARRY R. JACKSON ET AL. v. DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA BOARD OF ELECTIONS 

AND ETHICS ET AL. 

ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
[March 2, 2010]

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, Circuit Justice.
Petitioners in this case are Washington D. C. voters who
would like to subject the District of Columbia’s Religious
Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act of
2009 to a public referendum before it goes into effect,
pursuant to procedures set forth in the D. C. Charter. See
D. C. Code §§1–204.101 to 1–204.107 (2001–2006). The
Act expands the definition of marriage in the District to
include same-sex couples. See D. C. Act 18–248; 57 D. C.
Reg. 27 (Jan. 1, 2010).
The D. C. Charter specifies that legislation enacted by
the D. C. Council may be blocked if a sufficient number of
voters request a referendum on the issue. D. C. Code §1–
204.102. The Council, however, purported in 1979 to
exempt from this provision any referendum that would
violate the D. C. Human Rights Act.
See §§1–
1001.16(b)(1)(C), 2–1402.73 (2001–2007). The D. C. Board
of Elections, D. C. Superior Court, and D. C. Court of
Appeals denied petitioners’ request for a referendum on
the grounds that the referendum would violate the Human
Rights Act.
Petitioners argue that this action was improper, because
D.C. Council legislation providing that a referendum is not
required cannot trump a provision of the D. C. Charter
specifying that a referendum is required. See Price v.
