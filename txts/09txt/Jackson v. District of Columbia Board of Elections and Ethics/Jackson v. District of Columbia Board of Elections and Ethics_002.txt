JACKSON v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BD. OF 

ELECTIONS AND ETHICS

Opinion in Chambers 


District of Columbia Bd. of Elections, 645 A. 2d 594, 599–
600 (D. C. 1994). They point out that if the Act does be
come law, they will permanently lose any right to pursue a
referendum under the Charter. See §1–204.102(b)(2)
(2001–2006). Petitioners ask the Court for a stay that
would prevent the Act from going into effect, as expected,
on March 3, 2010.
This argument has some force. Without addressing the
merits of petitioners’ underlying claim, however, I con
clude that a stay is not warranted. First, as “a matter of
judicial policy”—if not “judicial power”—“it has been the
practice of the Court to defer to the decisions of the courts
of the District of Columbia on matters of exclusively local
concern.” Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 687
(1980); see also Fisher v. United States, 328 U. S. 463, 476
(1946).
Second, the Act at issue was adopted by the Council and
placed before Congress for the 30-day period of review
required by the D. C. Charter, see §1–206.02(c)(1). A joint
resolution of disapproval by Congress would prevent the
Act from going into effect, but Congress has chosen not to
act. The challenged provision purporting to exempt cer
tain D. C. Council actions from the referendum process,
§1–1001.16(b)(1)(C), was itself subject to review by Con
gress before it went into effect. While these considerations
are of course not determinative of the legal issues, they do
weigh against granting petitioners’ request for a stay,
given that the concern is that action by the Council vio
lates an Act of Congress.
Finally, while petitioners’ challenge to the Act by way of
a referendum apparently will become moot when the Act
goes into effect, petitioners have also pursued a ballot
initiative, under related procedures in the D. C. Charter,
that would give D. C. voters a similar opportunity to re
peal the Act if they so choose. See §§1–204.101 to 1–
204.107; Jackson v. District of Columbia Bd. of Elections
