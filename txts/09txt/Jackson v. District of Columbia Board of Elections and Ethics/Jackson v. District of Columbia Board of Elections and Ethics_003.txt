Opinion in Chambers

and Ethics, Civ. A. No. 2009 CA 008613 B (D. C. Super.,
Jan. 14, 2010). Their separate petition for a ballot initia
tive is now awaiting consideration by the D. C. Court of
Appeals, which will need to address many of the same
legal questions that petitioners have raised here. Unlike
their petition for a referendum, however, the request for
an initiative will not become moot when the Act becomes
law. On the contrary, the D. C. Court of Appeals will have
the chance to consider the relevant legal questions on
their merits, and petitioners will have the right to chal
lenge any adverse decision through a petition for certiorari
in this Court at the appropriate time.
The foregoing considerations, taken together, lead me to
conclude that the Court is unlikely to grant certiorari in
this case. Accordingly, the request for a stay is denied.
It is so ordered.
