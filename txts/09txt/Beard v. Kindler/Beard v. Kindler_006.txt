BEARD v. KINDLER
Opinion of the Court

to the United States. Kindler v. Horn, 291 F. Supp. 2d
323, 334 (ED Pa. 2003).
In the meantime, in 1984, the Pennsylvania trial court
had dismissed Kindler’s postverdict motions because of his
original escape. Once back in the United States, Kindler
filed a motion to reinstate those challenges to his convic
tion and sentence. The trial court denied the reinstate
ment motion, holding that the trial court judge who had
dismissed the postverdict motions in 1984 had not abused
his discretion. In October 1991—more than seven years
after the jury’s death recommendation—the court formally
imposed the death sentence. Commonwealth v. Kindler,
No. 2747 etc. (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas, Feb. 28, 1992), App.

post-verdict motions.” Id., at 233, 639 A. 2d, at 3. The
court then determined that the trial court’s decision to
dismiss Kindler’s claims fell within its authority: The
“dismiss[al] [of] the post-verdict motions was a reasonable
response to Appellant’s ‘flouting’ of the authority of the
court.” Id., at 233–234, 639 A. 2d, at 3. Under Pennsyl
vania’s fugitive forfeiture law, the court concluded, Kin
dler’s case therefore came to it “without any allegations of
error (direct or collateral) preserved.” Id., at 234, 639
A. 2d, at 4.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court nonetheless con
ducted the “limited review” mandated for death sentences
under Pennsylvania law. Under that review, the court
was required to confirm that the evidence was sufficient to
support the conviction of first-degree murder and at least
