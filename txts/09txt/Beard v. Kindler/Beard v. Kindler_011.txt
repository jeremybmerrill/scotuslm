Opinion of the Court

certiorari—whether discretionary rules are automatically
inadequate—Kindler argues that the Pennsylvania courts
did not apply a discretionary rule at all, but instead ap
plied a new rule mandating dismissal. Such a mandatory
dismissal, Kindler contends, constituted a break from past
discretionary practice, and thus does not provide an ade
quate state ground to bar his federal claims. We leave it
to the Court of Appeals to address that argument, and any
others Kindler may have preserved, on remand.
For its part, the Commonwealth urges us not only to
reject a per se rule about discretionary rulings, but also to
undertake “[a] new effort to state a standard for inade
quacy.” Brief for Petitioners 25. Amici supporting the
Commonwealth join in that request. See Brief for Crimi
nal Justice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 6–10. We
decline that invitation as well. The procedural default at
issue here—escape from prison—is hardly a typical proce
dural default, making this case an unsuitable vehicle for
providing broad guidance on the adequate state ground
doctrine.
If our holding in this case is narrow, it is because the
question we granted certiorari to decide is narrow. An
swering that question is sufficient unto the day.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
