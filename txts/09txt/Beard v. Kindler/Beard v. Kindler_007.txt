Opinion of the Court

one aggravating factor, and that the sentence was not
excessive, disproportionate, or the product of passion or
prejudice. Id., at 234–235, 639 A. 2d, at 4. Satisfied that
Kindler’s conviction met these standards, the court af
firmed his conviction and sentence. We denied certiorari.
Kindler v. Pennsylvania, 513 U. S. 933 (1994).
On state habeas, the Court of Common Pleas rejected
Kindler’s claims. That court held that the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court had already ruled that Kindler’s escape
forfeited all claims challenging his conviction and sentence
that Kindler may once have been entitled to bring. Com
monwealth v. Kindler, No. 2747 etc. (July 23, 1997), App.
183, 187–188. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.

Kindler then sought federal habeas relief. The District
Court determined that the fugitive forfeiture rule did not

District Court then proceeded to address the merits,

357–358. The court rejected Kindler’s ineffective assis

The Third Circuit affirmed. That court began by recog
nizing that “[a] procedural rule that is consistently applied
in the vast majority of cases is adequate to bar federal
habeas review even if state courts are willing to occasion
ally overlook it and review the merits of a claim for relief
where the rule would otherwise apply.” Kindler v. Horn,
542 F. 3d 70, 79 (2008). The Court of Appeals then con
sidered the Pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule in place
at the time of Kindler’s first escape: “Pennsylvania courts
had discretion to hear an appeal filed by a fugitive who
