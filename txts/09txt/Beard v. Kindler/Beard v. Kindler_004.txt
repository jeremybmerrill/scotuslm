BEARD v. KINDLER
Opinion of the Court

and arrested Shaw and Bernstein. In a harbinger of
things to come, Kindler escaped. Commonwealth v. Kin
dler, 536 Pa. 228, 236, 639 A. 2d 1, 5, cert. denied, 513
U. S. 933 (1994).
Police later arrested Kindler and charged him with
burglary. He was released on bail. Bernstein agreed to
testify against Kindler, but Kindler had other plans. At
about 2:30 a.m. on July 25, 1982, Kindler and Shaw at
tacked Bernstein outside his apartment. Kindler beat
Bernstein with a baseball bat approximately 20 times, and
Shaw shocked Bernstein 5 times with an electric prod.
Bernstein at that point was still alive but unable to move,
and Kindler and Shaw dragged their victim to their
nearby car, loaded him in the trunk, and drove to the
Delaware River. At the river, Kindler tied a cinder block
around Bernstein’s neck and dumped him in the water. A
forensic examiner later determined that Bernstein died of
drowning and massive head injuries. 536 Pa., at 236–239,
639 A. 2d, at 5–6.
Kindler was brought to trial and convicted of capital
murder. The jury recommended a death sentence, and
Kindler filed postverdict motions. Id., at 230–231, 639
A. 2d, at 2.
But on September 19, 1984, before the trial court could
consider the motions or the jury’s death recommendation,
Kindler escaped. Ibid. In an organized effort to saw
through the external prison bars with smuggled tools,
Kindler broke out of the maximum-security wing of the
prison and headed for Canada. See Commonwealth v.
Kindler, 554 Pa. 513, 517–518, and n. 4, 722 A. 2d 143,
145, and n. 4 (1998).
Kindler remained a fugitive in Canada until April 26,
1985, when he was arrested in Quebec for separate bur
glary offenses. The United States sought Kindler’s return,
but an extradition treaty allowed Canada to refuse to
hand over anyone likely to face execution. See Kindler v.
