Opinion of the Court

Canada (Minister of Justice), [1991] 2 S. C. R. 779.
Kindler turned into something of a local celebrity. He
even appeared on Canadian television, explaining, among
other things, how he had escaped and why he chose Can
ada: “I knew there was no death penalty here.” CTV
National News: Joseph Kindler’s Fate Unresolved (Cana
dian television broadcast Sept. 22, 1985) (videos available
in Clerk of Court’s case file). Canadian authorities ulti
mately acquiesced to overtures from the United States and
agreed to extradite Kindler. Kindler, supra, at 231, 639
A. 2d, at 2.
But before Kindler could be transferred from Canadian
custody, he escaped again. On the night of October 23,
1986, Kindler broke through a skylight on the 13th floor of
the jail (his fellow inmates had hoisted him up to the
skylight 15 feet above the floor) and escaped to the roof,
where he stood 175 feet above ground. Armed with 13
stories’ worth of bedsheets tied together, Kindler safely
rappelled down the side of the jail. (A fellow escapee was
not as lucky—the sheets ripped on his way down, causing
him to fall 50 feet to his death.) Kindler, 554 Pa., at 517–
519, 722 A. 2d, at 145.
This time, Kindler remained on the lam for more than
two years, until he was featured on the popular television
show, “America’s Most Wanted.” Characterizing Kindler
as “an above average criminal” and “a chess player who
understands when to make his move,” the show asked
viewers for information to help capture him. America’s
Most Wanted, Sept. 4, 1988, Season 1, Episode 30, at
10:01. Several viewers recognized Kindler and notified
Canadian authorities, who arrested him in September
1988. 554 Pa., at 519, 722 A. 2d, at 145.
Kindler again fought extradition. On September 16,
1991, after three years of litigation, the Supreme Court of
Canada rejected Kindler’s efforts. See Kindler, 2 S. C. R.
779. That same day, Canadian officials extradited Kindler
