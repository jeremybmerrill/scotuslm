BEARD v. KINDLER
Opinion of the Court

deal fairly with a particular problem than to lead to a just
result.” United States v. McCoy, 517 F. 2d 41, 44 (CA7)
(Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 895 (1975); see also
Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L. J.
747, 760–761 (1982). The result would be particularly
unfortunate for criminal defendants, who would lose the
opportunity to argue that a procedural default should be
excused through the exercise of judicial discretion. See
Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S. 443, 463, n. 3 (1965)
(Harlan, J., dissenting) (“If, in order to insulate its deci
sions from reversal by this Court, a state court must strip
itself of the discretionary power to differentiate between
different sets of circumstances, the [adequate state
ground] rule operates in a most perverse way”).
It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that the federal system
often grants broad discretion to the trial judge when his
ringside perspective at the “ ‘main event’ ” offers him a
comparative advantage in decisionmaking. Wainwright v.
Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90 (1977); cf. United States v. Poynter,
495 F. 3d 349, 351–352 (CA6 2007). The States seem to
value discretionary rules as much as the Federal Govern
ment does. See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici
Curiae 16–17 (citing various state discretionary proce
dural rules). In light of the federalism and comity con
cerns that motivate the adequate state ground doctrine in
the habeas context, see Coleman, 501 U. S., at 730, it
would seem particularly strange to disregard state proce
dural rules that are substantially similar to those to which
we give full force in our own courts. Cf. Francis v. Hen
derson, 425 U. S. 536, 541–542 (1976). Even stranger to
do so with respect to rules in place in nearly every State,
and all at one fell swoop.
We take our holding in this case to be uncontroversial—
so uncontroversial, in fact, that both parties agreed to the
point before this Court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–31.
Rather than defending the question on which we granted
