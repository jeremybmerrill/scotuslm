BEARD v. KINDLER
Opinion of the Court

had been returned to custody before an appeal was initi
ated or dismissed. . . . Accordingly, the fugitive forfeiture
rule was not ‘firmly established’ and therefore was not an
independent and adequate procedural rule sufficient to
bar review of the merits of a habeas petition in federal
court.” Ibid. (citing Doctor v. Walters, 96 F. 3d 675, 684–
686 (CA3 1996)). The court thus determined that “the
state trial court still had discretion to reinstate his post
verdict motions. Accordingly, we conclude that, under
Doctor, Pennsylvania’s fugitive waiver law did not pre
clude the district court from reviewing the merits of the
claims raised in Kindler’s habeas petition.” 542 F. 3d, at
80. Turning to the merits, the Court of Appeals disagreed
with the District Court on the improper aggravating factor
claim, but held that Kindler was entitled to relief based on
his Mills and ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 542
F. 3d, at 80–87.
The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari, arguing
that the Court of Appeals’ determination that state discre
tionary rules are automatically inadequate conflicted with
the holdings of other Courts of Appeals and warranted
this Court’s review. Pet. for Cert. 6–11. Kindler coun
tered that the Commonwealth had mischaracterized the
Third Circuit’s holding. Relying on the court’s citation of
the Doctor opinion, Kindler argued that the Third Circuit
did not hold that discretionary state rules are automati
cally inadequate; rather the court determined that the
state courts applied “a new and different rule from that in
existence at the time of the alleged default.” Brief in
Opposition 3. It was that new rule, Kindler maintained,
that the Third Circuit found inadequate. Ibid.
We granted the Commonwealth’s petition for certiorari.
556 U. S. ___ (2009). That petition asks us to decide
whether discretionary procedural rulings are automati
cally inadequate to bar federal court review on habeas.
