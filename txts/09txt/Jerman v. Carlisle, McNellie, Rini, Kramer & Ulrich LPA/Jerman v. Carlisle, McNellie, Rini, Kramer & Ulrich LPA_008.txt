Opinion of the Court

Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U. S. C. §1640(c), ex
pressly excludes legal errors, the court observed that
Congress has amended the FDCPA several times since
1977 without excluding mistakes of law from §1692k(c).
538 F. 3d, at 476.3
We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict of authority
as to the scope of the FDCPA’s bona fide error defense,4
557 U. S. ___ (2009), and now reverse the judgment of the
Sixth Circuit.

3 Because the question was not raised on appeal, the Court of Appeals
did not address whether Carlisle’s inclusion of the “in writing” re
quirement violated §1692g. 538 F. 3d, at 472, n. 2. We likewise ex
press no view about whether inclusion of an “in writing” requirement in
a notice to a consumer violates §1692g, as that question was not pre
sented in the petition for certiorari. Compare Graziano, supra, at 112
(reading §1692g(a)(3) to require that “any dispute, to be effective, must
be in writing”), with Camacho, supra, at 1082 (under §1692g(a)(3),
“disputes need not be made in writing”).
4 Compare, e.g., 538 F. 3d, at 476 (case below), with Baker v. G. C.
Servs. Corp., 677 F. 2d 775, 779 (CA9 1982), and Hulshizer v. Global
Credit Servs., Inc., 728 F. 2d 1037, 1038 (CA8 1984) (per curiam).
The Courts of Appeals have also expressed different views about
whether 15 U. S. C. §1692k(c) applies to violations of the FDCPA
resulting from a misinterpretation of the requirements of state law.
Compare Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121 (CA10 2002) (con
cluding that §1692k(c) applies where a debt collector’s misinterpreta
tion of a Utah dishonored check statute resulted in a violation of
§1692f(1), which prohibits collection of any amount not “permitted by
law”), with Picht v. Jon R. Hawks, Ltd., 236 F. 3d 446, 451–452 (CA8
2001) (stating that §1692k(c) does not preclude FDCPA liability result
ing from a creditor’s mistaken legal interpretation of a Minnesota
garnishment statute). The parties disagree about whether §1692k(c)
applies when a violation results from a debt collector’s misinterpreta
tion of the legal requirements of state law or federal law other than the
FDCPA. Compare Brief for Petitioner 47–49, with Brief for Respon
dents 60–62. Because this case involves only an alleged misinterpreta
tion of the requirements of the FDCPA, we need not, and do not, reach
those other questions.
