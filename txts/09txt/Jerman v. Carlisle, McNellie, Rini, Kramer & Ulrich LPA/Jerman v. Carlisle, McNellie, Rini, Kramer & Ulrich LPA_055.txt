JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

KENNEDY, J., dissenting 


misconceives the practical realities of litigation. Filings
and motions are made under pressing time constraints;
arguments must be offered quickly in reply; and strategic
decisions must be taken in the face of incomplete informa
tion. Lawyers in practice would not consider this alterna
tive at all realistic, particularly where the defense is
needed most.
And even were there time to generate a formal request
to the FTC and wait an average of three or four months for
a response (assuming the FTC responds at all), the argu
ment assumes that an ambiguity in the statute is obvious,
not latent, that the problem is at once apparent, and that
a conscious decision to invoke FTC procedures can be
made. But the problem in many instances is that inter
pretive alternatives are not at once apparent. All this may
explain why, in the past decade, the FTC has issued only
four opinions in response to just seven requests. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 27–28, 30. The FTC advisory process does not
remedy the difficulties that the Court’s opinion will cause.
Even if an FTC opinion is obtained, moreover, the ethi
cal dilemma of counsel is not resolved. If the FTC adopts
a position unfavorable to the client, the attorney may still
believe the FTC is mistaken. Yet under today’s decision,
the attorney who in good faith continues to assert a rea
sonable position to the contrary does so at risk of personal
liability. This alters the ethical balance central to the
adversary system; and it is, again, a reason for the Court
to adopt a different, but still reasonable, interpretation to
avoid systemic disruption.
II
The Court does not assert that its interpretation is
clearly commanded by the text. Instead, its decision relies
on an amalgam of arguments that, taken together, are
said to establish the superiority of its preferred reading.
This does not withstand scrutiny.
