KENNEDY, J., dissenting

“willful violation.”

These considerations suffice to show that §1692k(c) is
most reasonably read to include mistakes of law. Even if
this were merely a permissible reading, however, it should
be adopted to avoid the adverse consequences that must
flow from the Court’s contrary decision. The Court’s read
ing leads to results Congress could not have intended.

The FDCPA is but one of many federal laws that Con
gress has enacted to protect consumers. A number of
these statutes authorize the filing of private suits against
those who use unfair or improper practices. See, e.g., 15
U. S. C. §1692k (FDCPA); §1640 (Truth in Lending Act);
§1681n (Fair Credit Reporting Act); 49 U. S. C. §32710
(Federal Odometer Disclosure Act); 11 U. S. C. §526(c)(2)
(Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection
Act of 2005). Several of these provisions permit a success
ful plaintiff to recover—in addition to actual damages—
statutory damages, attorney’s fees and costs, and in some
cases punitive damages. E.g., 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)
(statutory damages); §1640(a)(3) (attorney’s fees and
costs); §1681n(a)(1)(B) (statutory and punitive damages);
§1681n(a)(1)(B)(3) (costs and attorney’s fees); 49 U. S. C.
§32710(a) (“3 times the actual damages or $1,500, which
ever is greater”); §32710(b) (costs and attorney’s fees); 11
U. S. C. §526(c)(3)(A) (costs and attorney’s fees). Some
also explicitly permit class-action suits. E.g., 15 U. S. C.
§1640(a)(2)(B); §1692k(a)(2)(B).
A collateral effect of these statutes may be to create
incentives to file lawsuits even where no actual harm has
occurred. This happens when the plaintiff can recover
statutory damages for the violation and his or her attorney
will receive fees if the suit is successful, no matter how
slight the injury. A favorable verdict after trial is not
