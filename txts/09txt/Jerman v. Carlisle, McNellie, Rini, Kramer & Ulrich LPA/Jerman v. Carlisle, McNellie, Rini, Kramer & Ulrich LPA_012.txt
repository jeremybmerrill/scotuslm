[the FDCPA].” 15 U. S. C. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C). Given the
absence of similar language in §1692k(c), it is a fair infer
ence that Congress chose to permit injured consumers to
recover actual damages, costs, fees, and modest statutory
damages for “intentional” conduct, including violations
resulting from mistaken interpretation of the FDCPA,
while reserving the more onerous penalties of the FTC Act
for debt collectors whose intentional actions also reflected
“knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum
stances” that the conduct was prohibited. Cf. 29 U. S. C.
§260 (authorizing courts to reduce liquidated damages
under the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 if an employer
demonstrates that “the act or omission giving rise to such
action was in good faith and that he had reasonable
grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a
violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938”); 17
U. S. C. §1203(c)(5)(A) (provision of Digital Millennium
Copyright Act authorizing court to reduce damages where
“the violator was not aware and had no reason to believe
that its acts constituted a violation”).
Congress also did not confine liability under the FDCPA
to “willful” violations, a term more often understood in the
civil context to excuse mistakes of law. See, e.g., Trans
World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125–126
(1985) (civil damages for “willful violations” of Age Dis
crimination in Employment Act of 1967 require a showing
that the employer “knew or showed reckless disregard for
the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited” (inter
nal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Safeco Ins. Co. of Amer
ica v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 57 (2007) (although “ ‘willfully’ ”
is a “ ‘word of many meanings’ ” dependent on context, “we
have generally taken it [when used as a statutory condi
tion of civil liability] to cover not only knowing violations
of a standard, but reckless ones as well” (quoting Bryan v.
United States, 524 U. S. 184, 191 (1998)). For this reason,
the dissent missteps in relying on Thurston and McLaugh
