JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

BREYER, J., concurring


(6th ed. 2008).
The FTC, of course, may refuse to issue such an opinion.
See, e.g., 16 CFR §1.1 (providing that the Commission will
issue advisory opinions “where practicable” and only when
“[t]he matter involves a substantial or novel question of
fact or law and there is no clear Commission or court
precedent” or “is of significant public interest”). Appar
ently, within the past decade, the FTC has received only
seven requests and issued four opinions. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 27–28; see also Federal Trade Commission,Commission FDCPA Advisory Opinions, online at
http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fdcpajump.shtm (as visited
Apr. 19, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).
Yet, should the dilemma I have described above prove
serious, I would expect the FTC to receive more requests
and to respond to them, thereby reducing the scope of the
problem to the point where other available tools, e.g.,
damages caps and vicarious liability, will prove adequate.
See ante, at 23–27. On this understanding, I agree with
the Court and join its opinion.
