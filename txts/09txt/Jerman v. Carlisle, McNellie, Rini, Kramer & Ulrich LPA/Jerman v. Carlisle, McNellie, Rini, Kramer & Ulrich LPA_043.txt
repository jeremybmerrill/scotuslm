JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

KENNEDY, J., dissenting 


Court today endorses will entrench, not eliminate, some of
the most troubling aspects of our legal system. Convinced
that Congress did not intend this result, I submit this
respectful dissent.

The FDCPA addresses “abusive debt collection prac
tices,” §1692(e), by regulating interactions between com
mercial debt collectors and consumers. See ante, at 1–2.
The statute permits private suits against debt collectors
who violate its provisions. §1692k(a). An exception
to liability is provided by the so-called bona fide error

resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the
maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to
avoid any such error.” §1692k(c).
This language does not exclude mistakes of law and is

Black’s Law Dictionary 582 (8th ed. 2004) (defining “error”
as “a belief that what is false is true or that what is true is
false,” def. 1); ibid. (“[a] mistake of law or of fact in a
tribunal’s judgment, opinion, or order,” def. 2); ibid. (list

this view. The bona fide error exception in §1692k(c)
applies if “the violation was not intentional and resulted
from a bona fide error.” The term “violation” specifically
denotes a legal infraction. See id., at 1600 (“An infraction
or breach of the law; a transgression,” def. 1). The statu
