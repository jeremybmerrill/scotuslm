Opinion of the Court 


and “debt collector[s],” defined to include any person who
“regularly collects . . . debts owed or due or asserted to be
owed or due another.” §§1692a(5), (6). Among other
things, the Act prohibits debt collectors from making false
representations as to a debt’s character, amount, or legal
status, §1692e(2)(A); communicating with consumers at an
“unusual time or place” likely to be inconvenient to the
consumer, §1692c(a)(1); or using obscene or profane lan
guage or violence or the threat thereof, §§1692d(1), (2).
See generally §§1692b–1692j; Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.
291, 292–293 (1995).
The Act is enforced through administrative action and

§1692k(a). Successful plaintiffs are entitled to “actual
damage[s],” plus costs and “a reasonable attorney’s fee as
determined by the court.” Ibid. A court may also award
“additional damages,” subject to a statutory cap of $1,000
for individual actions, or, for class actions, “the lesser of
$500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt
collector.” §1692k(a)(2). In awarding additional damages,
