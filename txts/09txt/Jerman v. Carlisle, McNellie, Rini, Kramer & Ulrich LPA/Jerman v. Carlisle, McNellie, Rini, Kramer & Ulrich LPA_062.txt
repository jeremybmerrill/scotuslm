KENNEDY, J., dissenting

exclude “an error of legal judgment with respect to a per
son’s obligations under [the TILA].” See Truth in Lending
Simplification and Reform Act, §615 (c), 94 Stat. 181. This
amendment would have been unnecessary if Congress had
understood the pre-1980 language to exclude legal errors.
The natural inference is that the pre-amendment TILA
language—the same language later incorporated nearly
verbatim into §1692k(c)—was understood to cover those
errors.
The Court’s responses to this point are perplexing. The
Court first says that the 1980 amendment did not “obvi
ous[ly]” change the scope of the TILA’s bona fide error
defense, given the “uniform interpretation” that the de
fense had been given in the Courts of Appeals. Ante, at
17. The Court thus prefers to make an entire statutory
amendment surplusage rather than abandon its dubious
assumption that Congress meant to ratify a nascent Court
of Appeals consensus. Cf. Corley v. United States, 556
U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (“[O]ne of the most
basic interpretive canons [is] that [a] statute should be
construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so
that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or
insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted; second
alteration in original)). (Without any evidence, the Court
speculates that perhaps the amendment was intended to
codify existing judicial interpretations that excluded legal
errors. Ante, at 17–18. If those judicial interpretation
were truly as uniform as the Court suggests—and
the presumption against mistake-of-law defenses as
ironclad—there would have been no need for such a
recodification.)
The Court is hesitant as well to give the 1980 amend
ment weight because Congress “has not expressly included
mistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide error
defenses, worded in pertinent part identically to §1692k(c),
elsewhere in the U. S. Code.” Ante, at 18 (emphasis in
