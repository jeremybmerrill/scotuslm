Opinion of the Court

sponding amendment to the FDCPA, Carlisle reasons, is
evidence of Congress’ intent to give a more expansive
scope to the FDCPA defense. For several reasons, we
decline to give the 1980 TILA amendment such interpreta
tive weight. For one, it is not obvious that the amendment
changed the scope of TILA’s bona fide error defense in a
way material to our analysis, given the uniform interpre
tations of three Courts of Appeals holding that the TILA
defense does not extend to mistakes of law.12 (Contrary to

12 Although

again not necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the
legislative record suggests some Members of Congress understood the
amendment to “clarif[y]” the meaning of TILA’s bona fide error defense
“to make clear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,
provided they are not the result of erroneous legal judgments as to the
act’s requirements.” S. Rep. No. 96–73, pp. 7–8 (1979); see also Lock
hart, 153 A. L. R. Fed. 211–212, §2[a] (1999) (amendment “was in
tended merely to clarify what was then the prevailing view, that the
bona fide error defense applies to clerical errors, not including errors of
legal judgment”) (relying on S. Rep. No. 96–368, p. 32 (1979)).
The concurring and dissenting opinions perceive an inconsistency
between these references to clerical errors, as well as similar references
in the pre-FDCPA precedents interpreting TILA, n. 10, supra, and
reading the FDCPA’s bona fide error defense to include factual mis
takes. Post, at 2–4, and n. 2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 20
(KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The quoted legislative history sources,
however, while stating expressly that the TILA defense excludes legal
errors, do not discuss a distinction between clerical and factual errors.
Similarly, the cited cases interpreting TILA do not address a distinction
between factual and clerical errors; rather, the courts were presented
with claims that the defense applied to mistakes of law or other nonfac
tual errors that the courts found not to be bona fide. See Ives, 522
F. 2d, at 756–757; Haynes, 503 F. 2d, at 1166–1167; Palmer, 502 F. 2d,
at 861. While factual mistakes might, in some circumstances, consti
tute bona fide errors and give rise to violations that are “not inten
tional” within the meaning of §1692k(c), we need not and do not decide
today the precise distinction between clerical and factual errors, or
what kinds of factual mistakes qualify under the FDCPA’s bona fide
error defense. Cf. generally R. Hobbs, National Consumer Law Center,
Fair Debt Collection §7.2 (6th ed. 2008 and Supp. 2009) (surveying case
law on scope of §1692k(c)).
