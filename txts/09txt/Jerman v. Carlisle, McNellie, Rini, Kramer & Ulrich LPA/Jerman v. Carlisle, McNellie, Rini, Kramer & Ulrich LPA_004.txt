ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[April 21, 2010]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act)
imposes civil liability on “debt collector[s]” for certain
prohibited debt collection practices. Section 813(c) of the
Act, 15 U. S. C. §1692k(c), provides that a debt collector is
not liable in an action brought under the Act if she can
show “the violation was not intentional and resulted from
a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of
procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.”
This case presents the question whether the “bona fide
error” defense in §1692k(c) applies to a violation resulting
from a debt collector’s mistaken interpretation of the legal
requirements of the FDCPA. We conclude it does not.

The Act regulates interactions between consumer debtors
