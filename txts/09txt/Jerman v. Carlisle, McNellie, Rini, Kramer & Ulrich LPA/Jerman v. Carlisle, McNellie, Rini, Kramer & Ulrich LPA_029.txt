JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


professional conduct adopted by many States impose outer
bounds on an attorney’s pursuit of a client’s interests.
See, e.g., ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 3.1
(2009) (requiring nonfrivolous basis in law and fact for
claims asserted); 4.1 (truthfulness to third parties). In
some circumstances, lawyers may face personal liability
for conduct undertaken during representation of a client.
See, e.g., Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate
Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 191 (1994) (“Any
person or entity, including a lawyer, . . . who employs a
manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or
omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities
relies may be liable as a primary violator under [Securities
and Exchange Commission Rule] 10b–5”).
Moreover, a lawyer’s interest in avoiding FDCPA liabil
ity may not always be adverse to her client. Some courts
have held clients vicariously liable for their lawyers’ viola
tions of the FDCPA. See, e.g., Fox v. Citicorp Credit
Servs., Inc., 15 F. 3d 1507, 1516 (CA9 1994); see also First
Interstate Bank of Fort Collins, N. A. v. Soucie, 924 P. 2d
1200, 1202 (Colo. App. 1996).
The suggestion that our reading of §1692k(c) will create
unworkable consequences is also undermined by the exis
tence of numerous state consumer protection and debt
collection statutes that contain bona fide error defenses
that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal
errors.17 Several States have enacted debt collection
statutes that contain neither an exemption for attorney
debt collectors nor any bona fide error defense at all. See,
e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93, §49 (West 2008); Md. Com.
Law Code Ann. §14–203 (Lexis 2005); Ore. Rev. Stat.
