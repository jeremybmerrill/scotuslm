JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

KENNEDY, J., dissenting 


impose liability on a debt collector who relies in good faith
on the reasonable advice of counsel. If anything, we
should expect Congress to think that such behavior should
be encouraged, not discouraged.
The Court also suggests that reading §1692k(c) to in
clude legal errors would encourage litigation over a num
ber of issues: what subjective intent is necessary for liabil
ity; what procedures are necessary to avoid legal mistakes;
what standard applies to procedures adopted by attorney
debt collectors as compared to non-attorney debt collec
tors. Yet these questions are no different from ones al
ready raised by the statute. Whether the debt collector is
an attorney or not, his or her subjective intent must be
assessed before liability can be determined. Procedures to
avoid mistakes—whether legal or otherwise—must be
“reasonable,” which is always a context-specific inquiry.
The Court provides no reason to think that legal errors
raise concerns that differ in these respects from those
raised by non-legal errors.

There is a further and most serious reason to interpret
§1692k(c) to include good-faith legal mistakes. In Heintz
v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291 (1995), the Court held that at
torneys engaged in debt-collection litigation may be “debt
collectors” for purposes of the FDCPA. In reaching this
conclusion the Court confronted the allegation that its
interpretation would produce the anomalous result that
attorneys could be liable for bringing legal claims against
debtors if those claims ultimately proved unsuccessful.
Id., at 295. The Court rejected this argument. In doing so
it said that §1692k(c) provides debt collectors with a de
fense for their bona fide errors. Id., at 295.
Today the Court relies on Heintz to allay concerns about
the practical implications of its decision. Ante, at 25. Yet
the Court reads §1692k(c) to exclude mistakes of law,
