JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


defense to accommodate Carlisle’s expansive reading.9
Any remaining doubt about the proper interpretation of
§1692k(c) is dispelled by evidence of the meaning attached
to the language Congress copied into the FDCPA’s bona
fide error defense from a parallel provision in an existing
statute. TILA, 82 Stat. 146, was the first of several stat
utes collectively known as the Consumer Credit Protection
Act (CCPA) that now include the FDCPA. As enacted in
1968, §130(c) of TILA provided an affirmative defense that
was in pertinent part identical to the provision Congress
later enacted into the FDCPA: “A creditor may not be held
liable in any action brought under [TILA] if the creditor
shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation
was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error
notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasona
bly adapted to avoid any such error.” 82 Stat. 157 (codi
fied at 15 U. S. C. §1640(c)).
During the 9-year period between the enactment of
TILA and passage of the FDCPA, the three Federal Courts
of Appeals to consider the question interpreted TILA’s
bona fide error defense as referring to clerical errors; no
such court interpreted TILA to extend to violations result
ing from a mistaken legal interpretation of that Act.10 We

raises concerns about whether, in light of contemporary
administrative practice, the FTC safe harbor is a realistic way for debt
collectors and their lawyers to seek guidance on the numerous time
sensitive legal issues that arise in litigation. These practical concerns,
to which we return below, do not change our understanding of the
statutory text itself or the likely intent of the enacting Congress.

despite creditor’s reliance, in selecting language for credit contract
forms, on a pamphlet issued by the Federal Reserve Board); Haynes v.

. . . was judgmental with respect to legal requirements of the Act and
not clerical in nature”); Palmer v. Wilson, 502 F. 2d 860, 861 (CA9
