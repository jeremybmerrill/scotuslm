JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

KENNEDY, J., dissenting 


objective circumstances that such act is unfair or deceptive
and is prohibited by such rule.” No one contends that this
will encourage debt collectors to avoid learning the FTC’s
rules. Yet there is no doubt that §45(m)(1)(A) permits a
mistake-of-law defense.
All this assumes, of course, that obtaining an FTC advi
sory opinion will be a reasonably practical possibility. For
the reasons stated above, see Part I–B–2, supra, this is to
be doubted. Even the Court recognizes the limited role
that the FTC has played. Ante, at 25 (“[E]vidence of pre
sent administrative practice makes us reluctant to place
significant weight on §1692k(e) as a practical remedy”).
Fifth, the Court asserts that “[a]ny remaining doubt”
about its preferred interpretation is dispelled by the
FDCPA’s statutory history. The Court points to the fact
that §1692k(c) mirrors a bona fide error defense provision
in the earlier enacted Truth in Lending Act (TILA), argu
ing that Congress sought to incorporate into the FDCPA
the view of the Courts of Appeals that the TILA defense
applied only to clerical errors. Ante, at 14–15. As JUSTICE
SCALIA points out, the Court’s claims of judicial uniformity
are overstated. See ante, at 2–3 (opinion concurring in
part and concurring in judgment). They rest on three
Court of Appeals decisions, which are contradicted by
several District Court opinions and a State Supreme Court
opinion—hardly a consistent legal backdrop against which
to divine legislative intent. The Court also ignores the fact
that those three Courts of Appeals had construed the
TILA provision to apply only to clerical errors. See Ives v.
W. T. Grant Co., 522 F. 2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975); Haynes v.
Logan Furniture Mart, Inc., 503 F. 2d 1161, 1167 (CA7
1974); Palmer v. Wilson, 502 F. 2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974).
The Court therefore cannot explain why it reads §1692k(c)
more broadly to encompass factual mistakes as well.
It is of even greater significance that in 1980 Congress
amended the TILA’s bona fide error exception explicitly to
