JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 21, this reading does not
render the 1980 amendment surplusage. Congress may
simply have intended to codify existing judicial interpreta
tions to remove any potential for doubt in jurisdictions
where courts had not yet addressed the issue.) It is also
unclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPA’s
defense to be broader than the one in TILA, which pre
sents at least as significant a set of concerns about impos
ing liability for uncertain legal obligations. See, e.g., Ford
Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980)
(TILA is “ ‘highly technical’ ”). Our reluctance to give
controlling weight to the TILA amendment in construing
the FDCPA is reinforced by the fact that Congress has not
expressly included mistakes of law in any of the numerous
bona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identi
cally to §1692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code. Compare,
e.g., 12 U. S. C. §4010(c)(2) (bona fide error defense in
Expedited Funds Availability Act expressly excluding “an
error of legal judgment with respect to [obligations under
that Act]”) with 15 U. S. C. §§1693m(c), 1693h(c) (bona
fide error provisions in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act
that are silent as to errors of legal judgment).13 Although
——————
13 The Government observes that several federal agencies have con
strued similar bona fide error defenses in statutes they administer to
exclude errors of law. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28–
30. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for instance,
has promulgated regulations specifying that the bona fide error defense
in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U. S. C.
§2607(d)(3), does not apply to “[a]n error of legal judgment,” 24 CFR
§3500.15(b)(1)(ii) (2009). While administrative interpretations of other
statutes do not control our reading of the FDCPA, we find it telling that
no agency has adopted the view of the Court of Appeals. Of course,
nothing in our opinion today addresses the validity of such regulations
or the authority of agencies interpreting bona fide error provisions in
other statutes to adopt a different reading. See National Cable &
Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967,
982–983 (2005).
