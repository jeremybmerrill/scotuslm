JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


and §1692k(a)(3) authorizes courts to award attorney’s
fees to the defendant if a plaintiff’s suit “was brought in
bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.”
Lawyers also have recourse to the affirmative defense in
§1692k(c). Not every uncertainty presented in litigation
stems from interpretation of the requirements of the Act
itself; lawyers may invoke the bona fide error defense, for
instance, where a violation results from a qualifying fac
tual error. Jerman and the Government suggest that
lawyers can entirely avoid the risk of misinterpreting the
Act by obtaining an advisory opinion from the FTC under
§1692k(e). Carlisle fairly observes that the FTC has not
frequently issued such opinions, and that the average
processing time may present practical difficulties. Indeed,
the Government informed us at oral argument that the
FTC has issued only four opinions in the past decade (in
response to seven requests), and the FTC’s response time
——————
(per curiam); see generally Hobbs, Fair Debt Collection §6.8.6. In
Schlacher, for instance, the court affirmed a downward adjustment for
the “unnecessary use of multiple attorneys . . . in a straightforward,
short-lived [FDCPA] case.” 574 F. 3d, at 854–855. In Carroll, the court
found no abuse of discretion in a District Court’s award of a $500
attorney’s fee, rather than the lodestar amount, where the lawsuit had
recovered only $50 in damages for “at most a technical violation” of the
FDCPA. 53 F. 3d, at 629–631.
Lower courts have taken different views about when, and whether,
§1692k requires an award of attorney’s fees. Compare Tolentino v.
Friedman, 46 F. 3d 645 (CA7 1995) (award of fees to a successful
plaintiff “mandatory”), and Emanuel, supra, at 808–809 (same, even
where the plaintiff suffered no actual damages), with Graziano, 950 F.
2d, at 114, and n. 13 (attorney’s fees may be denied for plaintiff’s “bad
faith conduct”), and Johnson v. Eaton, 80 F. 3d 148, 150–152 (CA5
1996) (“attorney’s fees . . . are only available [under §1692k] where the
plaintiff has succeeded in establishing that the defendant is liable for
actual and/or additional damages”; this reading “will deter suits
brought only as a means of generating attorney’s fees”). We need not
resolve these issues today to express doubt that our reading
of §1692k(c) will impose unmanageable burdens on debt collecting
lawyers.
