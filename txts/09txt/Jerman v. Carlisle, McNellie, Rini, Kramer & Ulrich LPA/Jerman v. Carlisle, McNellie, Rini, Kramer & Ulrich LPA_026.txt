Opinion of the Court

We do not believe our holding today portends such grave
consequences. For one, the FDCPA contains several pro
visions that expressly guard against abusive lawsuits,
thereby mitigating the financial risk to creditors’ attor
neys. When an alleged violation is trivial, the “actual
damage[s]” sustained, §1692k(a)(1), will likely be de
minimis or even zero. The Act sets a cap on “additional”
damages, §1692k(a)(2), and vests courts with discretion to
adjust such damages where a violation is based on a good
faith error, §1692k(b). One amicus suggests that attor
ney’s fees may shape financial incentives even where
actual and statutory damages are modest. NARCA Brief
11. The statute does contemplate an award of costs and “a
reasonable attorney’s fee as determined by the court” in
the case of “any successful action to enforce the foregoing
liability.” §1692k(a)(3). But courts have discretion in
calculating reasonable attorney’s fees under this statute,16

perceives to be a “troubling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the
system to spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law into
lucrative litigation.” Post, at 5–6. The dissent’s concern is primarily
with Congress’ policy choice, embodied in statutory text, to authorize
private rights of action and recovery of attorney’s fees, costs, and in
some cases, both actual and statutory damages. As noted, in one of the
statutes the dissent cites, Congress explicitly barred reliance on a
mistake-of-law defense notwithstanding the “highly technical” nature of
the scheme. See 15 U. S. C. §1640(c) (TILA); Ford Motor Credit Co. v.
Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980). Similarly, the plain text of the
FDCPA authorizes a private plaintiff to recover not only “actual dam
age[s]” for harm suffered but also “such additional damages as the
court may allow,” §1692k(a).
16 The Courts of Appeals generally review a District Court’s calcula
tion of an attorney fee award under §1692k for abuse of discretion. See,
e.g., Carroll v. Wolpoff & Abramson, 53 F. 3d 626, 628–629 (CA4 1995);
Emanuel v. American Credit Exchange, 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989).
Many District Courts apply a lodestar method, permitting downward
adjustments in appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., Schlacher v. Law
Offices of Phillip J. Rotche & Assoc., P. C., 574 F. 3d 852 (CA7 2009)
(relying on Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983)); Ferland v.
Conrad Credit Corp., 244 F. 3d 1145, 1148–1151, and n. 4 (CA9 2001)
