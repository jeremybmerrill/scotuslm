JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


assumed valid unless she disputed it in writing.1 While
acknowledging a division of authority on the question, the
District Court held that Carlisle had violated §1692g by
requiring Jerman to dispute the debt in writing. 464
F. Supp. 2d 720, 722–725 (ND Ohio 2006).2 The court
ultimately granted summary judgment to Carlisle, how
ever, concluding that §1692k(c) shielded it from liability
because the violation was not intentional, resulted from a
bona fide error, and occurred despite the maintenance of
procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.
502 F. Supp. 2d 686, 695–697 (ND Ohio 2007). The Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 538 F. 3d 469
(2008). Acknowledging that the Courts of Appeals are
divided regarding the scope of the bona fide error defense,
and that the “majority view is that the defense is available
for clerical and factual errors only,” the Sixth Circuit
nonetheless held that §1692k(c) extends to “mistakes of
law.” Id., at 473–476 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The Court of Appeals found “nothing unusual” about
attorney debt collectors maintaining “procedures” within
the meaning of §1692k(c) to avoid mistakes of law. Id., at
476. Noting that a parallel bona fide error defense in the
——————
1 Section 1692g(a)(3) requires a debt collector, within five days of an
“initial communication” about the collection of a debt, to send the
consumer a written notice containing, inter alia, “a statement that
unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice,
disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be
assumed to be valid by the debt collector.”
2 The District Court distinguished, for instance, Graziano v. Harrison,
950 F. 2d 107, 112 (CA3 1991), which held a consumer’s dispute of a
debt under §1692g must be in writing to be effective. Noting that
district courts within the Sixth Circuit had reached different results,
and distinguishing one unpublished Sixth Circuit decision which
Carlisle suggested approved a form with an in-writing requirement, the
court adopted the reasoning from Camacho v. Bridgeport Financial,
Inc., 430 F. 3d 1078, 1080–1082 (CA9 2005), and held that the plain
language of §1692g does not impose an “in writing” requirement on
consumers. See 464 F. Supp. 2d, at 725.
