Opinion of the Court

have often observed that when “judicial interpretations
have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provi
sion, repetition of the same language in a new statute
indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its
. . . judicial interpretations as well.” Bragdon v. Abbott,
524 U. S. 624, 645 (1998); see also Rowe v. New Hamp
shire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S. 364, 370 (2008).
While the interpretations of three Federal Courts of Ap
peals may not have “settled” the meaning of TILA’s bona
fide error defense, there is no reason to suppose that

1974) (similar).
Carlisle contends the meaning of TILA’s defense was unsettled at the
time of the FDCPA’s enactment, relying first on several District Court
opinions extending the defense to good-faith legal errors. See, e.g.,
Welmaker v. W. T. Grant Co., 365 F. Supp. 531, 544 (ND Ga. 1972).
But even assuming Congress would have looked to district court, rather
than court of appeals, opinions in discerning the meaning of the statu
tory language, applicable Circuit precedent had cast some doubt on
those decisions by the time the FDCPA was enacted. See, e.g., Turner
v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 537 F. 2d 1296, 1298 (CA5 1976) (per
curiam) (referring to §1640(c) as the “so-called clerical error defense”).
Carlisle also relies on the holding in Thrift Funds of Baton Rouge, Inc.
v. Jones, 274 So. 2d 150 (La. 1973). But in that case, the Louisiana
Supreme Court concluded only that a lender’s mistaken interpretation
of state usury law did not “amoun[t] to an intentional violation of
[TILA’s] disclosure requirements.” Id., at 161. The Louisiana court
had no occasion to address the question analogous to the one we con
sider today: whether TILA’s bona fide error defense extended to viola
tions resulting from mistaken interpretation of TILA itself. See n. 4,
supra; see also Starks v. Orleans Motors, Inc., 372 F. Supp. 928, 931
(ED La.) (distinguishing Thrift Funds on this basis), aff’d, 500 F. 2d
1182 (CA5 1974). These precedents therefore do not convince us that
Congress would have ascribed a different meaning to the statutory
language it chose for the FDCPA. Compare post, at 2 (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment), with Herman &
MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 384–386, and n. 21 (1983)
(concluding that Congress had “ratified” the “well-established judicial
interpretation” of a statute by leaving it intact during a comprehensive
revision, notwithstanding “[t]wo early district court decisions,” not
subsequently followed, that had adopted a contrary view).
