ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[April 21, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I join the Court’s opinion except for its reliance upon two
legal fictions. A portion of the Court’s reasoning consists
of this: The language in the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act (FDCPA or Act) tracks language in the Truth in Lend
ing Act (TILA); and in the nine years between the enact
ment of TILA and the enactment of the FDCPA, three
Courts of Appeals had “interpreted TILA’s bona fide error
defense as referring to clerical errors.” Ante, at 14. Rely
ing on our statement in Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624,
645 (1998), that Congress’s repetition, in a new statute, of
statutory language with a “ ‘settled’ ” judicial interpreta
tion indicates “ ‘the intent to incorporate its . . . judicial
interpretations as well,’ ” the Court concludes that these
three Court of Appeals cases “suppor[t] an inference that
Congress understood the statutory formula it chose for the
FDCPA consistent with Federal Court of Appeals interpre
tations of TILA.” Ante, at 14–16.
Let me assume (though I do not believe it) that what
counts is what Congress “intended,” even if that intent
finds no expression in the enacted text. When a large
majority of the Circuits, over a lengthy period of time,
have uniformly reached a certain conclusion as to the
meaning of a particular statutory text, it may be reason
