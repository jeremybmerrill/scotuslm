JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of SCALIA, J. 


man then asked: “So it’s not simply a mathematical error
but any bona fide error without intent?” Id., at 21 (em
phasis added). To which the staff member responded:
“That’s correct.” Ibid. The repeated use of “any”—“any
violation” and “any bona fide error”—supports the natural
reading of the Committee Report’s statement regarding
“the act’s coverage” as including legal errors about the
scope of the Act, rather than just factual errors.
The Court ultimately dismisses the Senate Committee
Report on the ground that “the legislative record taken as
a whole does not lend strong support to Carlisle’s view.”
Ante, at 21. I think it more reasonable to give zero weight
to the other snippets of legislative history that the Court
relies upon, for the reason that the Senate Committee
Report on the very bill that became the FDCPA flatly
contradicts them. It is almost invariably the case that our
opinions benefit not at all from the make-weight use of
legislative history. But today’s opinion probably suffers
from it. Better to spare us the results of legislative-history
research, however painfully and exhaustively conducted it
might have been.
The Court’s textual analysis stands on its own, without
need of (or indeed any assistance from) the two fictions I
have discussed. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of
the Court.
