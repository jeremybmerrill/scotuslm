tions. Cf. Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848, 853, n. 9
(1984) (although the Federal Tort Claims Act waives
sovereign immunity, “the proper objective of a court at
tempting to construe [an exception to the Act] is to identify
those circumstances which are within the words and
reason of the exception—no less and no more” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). This is all the more true
where the other possible interpretations are more consis
tent with the purposes of the regulatory scheme. By its
terms, §1692k(c) encompasses—without limitation—all
violations that are “not intentional and resul[t] from a
bona fide error.” The Court provides no reason to read
this language narrowly.
The Court responds that “our precedents have made
clear for more than 175 years” that the presumption
against mistake-of-law defenses applies even to explicit
statutory exceptions. Ante, 6–7, n. 5. By this the Court
means that one case applied the presumption to an excep
tion more than 175 years ago. In Barlow, the Court de
clined to excuse an alleged mistake of law despite a statu
tory provision that excepted “false denomination[s] . . .
[that] happened by mistake or accident, and not from any
intention to defraud the revenue.” 7 Pet., at 406. In
construing this language, the Barlow Court noted that it
demonstrated congressional intent to exclude mistakes of
law:
“The very association of mistake and accident, in this
[connection], furnishes a strong ground to presume
that the legislature had the same classes of cases in
view . . . . Mistakes in the construction of the law,
seem as little intended to be excepted by the proviso,
as accidents in the construction of the law.” Id., at
411–412.
Unlike the provision at issue in Barlow, §1692k(c) gives no
indication that its broad reference to “bona fide error[s]”
