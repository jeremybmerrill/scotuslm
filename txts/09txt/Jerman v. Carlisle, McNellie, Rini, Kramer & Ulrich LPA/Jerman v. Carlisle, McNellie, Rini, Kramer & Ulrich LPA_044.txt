KENNEDY, J., dissenting

tory term “violation” thus stands in direct contrast to
other provisions of the FDCPA that describe conduct itself.
This applies both to specific terms, e.g., §1692e (“A debt
collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading
representation or means in connection with the collection
of any debt”), and to more general ones, e.g., §1692k(e)
(referring to “any act done or omitted in good faith”). By
linking the mens rea requirement (“not intentional”) with
the word “violation”—rather than with the conduct giving
rise to the violation—the Act by its terms indicates that
the bona fide error exception applies to legal errors as well
as to factual ones.
The Court’s precedents accord with this interpretation.
Federal statutes that link the term “violation” with a mens
rea requirement have been interpreted to excuse good
faith legal mistakes. See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Richland
Shoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 129, 133 (1988) (the phrase “aris
ing out of a willful violation” in the Fair Labor Standards
Act applies where an employer “either knew or showed
reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct
was prohibited by the statute”); Trans World Airlines, Inc.
v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125, 126 (1985) (damages
provision under the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, which applies “only in cases of willful violations,”
creates liability where an employer “knew or showed
reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct
was prohibited by the ADEA” (internal quotation marks
omitted)); cf. Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 428
(1985) (prohibition on use of food stamps “ ‘knowing [them]
to have been received . . . in violation of’ ” federal law
“undeniably requires a knowledge of illegality” (emphasis
deleted)). The FDCPA’s use of “violation” thus distin
guishes it from most of the authorities relied upon by the
Court to demonstrate that mistake-of-law defenses are
disfavored. See, e.g., ante, at 7–8 (citing Kolstad v. Ameri
can Dental Assn., 527 U. S. 526 (1999)).
