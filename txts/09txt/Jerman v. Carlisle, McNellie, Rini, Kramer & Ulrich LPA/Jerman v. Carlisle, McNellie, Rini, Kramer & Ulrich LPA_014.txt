Opinion of the Court

odds with precedents such as Bryan, supra, at 192, and
International Minerals, supra, at 559, 563, in which we
rejected a mistake-of-law defense when a statute imposed
liability for a “knowing violation” or on those who “know
ingly violat[e]” the law.7
The dissent posits that the word “intentional,” in the
civil context, requires a higher showing of mens rea than
“willful” and thus that it should be easier to avoid liability
for intentional, rather than willful, violations. Post, at 4.
Even if the dissent is correct that the phrase “intentional
violation,” standing alone in a civil liability statute, might
be read to excuse mistakes of law, the FDCPA juxtaposes
the term “not intentional” “violation” in §1692k(c) with the
more specific language of §45(m)(1)(A), which refers to
——————
7 Indeed,

in International Minerals, the Court faced, and evidently
rejected, the distinction the dissent would draw today between the term
“ ‘violation’ ” and a reference to “the conduct giving rise to the violation.”
Post, at 3. As noted, in International Minerals, the Court rejected a
mistake-of-law defense for a statute that applied to those who “know
ingly violat[e]” certain regulations. 402 U. S., at 559, 563. In so doing,
however, we expressly acknowledged the contrary view adopted by one
lower court opinion that knowledge of the regulations was necessary.
Id., at 562 (citing St. Johnsbury Trucking Co. v. United States, 220
F. 2d 393, 397 (CA1 1955) (Magruder, C. J., concurring)). The dissent
ing opinion in International Minerals quoted extensively portions of the
St. Johnsbury concurrence that reached its result by contrasting a
statute making it an offense “ ‘ “knowingly” to sell adulterated milk’ ”
with one that makes it an offense “ ‘knowingly [to] violat[e] a regula
tion.’ ” 402 U. S., at 566 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (quoting St. Johns
bury, supra, at 398).
Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419 (1985), is also inapposite. Cf.
post, at 3 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Concluding that a mistake-of-law
defense is available under a provision that specifies particular conduct
undertaken while “ ‘knowing’ ” that food stamp coupons had been “ ‘used
in any manner in violation of [law],’ ” 471 U. S., at 428, n. 12, says little
about the meaning of a “not intentional” “violation” in 15 U. S. C.
§1692k(c). Indeed, the statute in Liparota bears a closer resemblance to
the administrative penalty provision in §45(m)(1)(A). See supra, at
8–9.
