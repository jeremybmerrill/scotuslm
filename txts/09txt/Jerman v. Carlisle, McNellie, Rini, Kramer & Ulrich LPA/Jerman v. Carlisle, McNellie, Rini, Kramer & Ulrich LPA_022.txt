Opinion of the Court

Carlisle points out that Congress has amended the
FDCPA on several occasions without expressly restricting
the scope of §1692k(c), that does not suggest Congress
viewed the statute as having the expansive reading Car
lisle advances, particularly as not until recently had a
Court of Appeals interpreted the bona fide error defense to
include a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a mistake
of law. See Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121–1124,
and nn. 14–15 (CA10 2002).
Carlisle’s reliance on Heintz, 514 U. S. 291, is also un
availing. We held in that case that the FDCPA’s defini
tion of “debt collector” includes lawyers who regularly,
through litigation, attempt to collect consumer debts. Id.,
at 292. We addressed a concern raised by the petitioner
(as here, a lawyer collecting a debt on behalf of a client)
that our reading would automatically render liable “any
litigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim
against a debtor,” on the ground that §1692e(5) prohibits a
debt collector from making any “ ‘threat to take action that
cannot legally be taken.’ ” Id., at 295. We expressed skep
ticism that §1692e(5) itself demanded such a result. But
even assuming the correctness of petitioner’s reading of
§1692e(5), we suggested that the availability of the bona
fide error defense meant that the prospect of liability for
litigating lawyers was not “so absurd” as to warrant im
plying a categorical exemption unsupported by the statu
tory text. Ibid. We had no occasion in Heintz to address
the overall scope of the bona fide error defense. Our dis
cussion of §1692e(5) did not depend on the premise that a
misinterpretation of the requirements of the Act would fall
under the bona fide error defense. In the mine-run law
suit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful be
cause of factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error.
Lawyers can, of course, invoke §1692k(c) for violations
resulting from qualifying factual errors.
Carlisle’s remaining arguments do not change our view
