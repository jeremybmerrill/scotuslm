KENNEDY, J., dissenting

was meant to exclude legal mistakes.
Even if statutory exceptions should normally be con
strued to exclude mistakes of law, moreover, that guide
line would only apply absent intent to depart from the
general rule. There is no doubt that Congress may create
a mistake-of-law defense; the question is whether it has
done so here. See Ratzlaf, 510 U. S, at 149. As explained
above, see Part I–A, supra, Congress has made its choice
plain by using the word “violation” in §1692k(c) to indicate
that mistakes of law are to be included.
Second, the Court attempts to draw a contrast between
§1692k(c) and the administrative penalties in the Federal
Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), 38 Stat. 717, 15 U. S. C.
§41 et seq. Under the FTC Act, a debt collector may face
civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for acting with
“actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis
of objective circumstances that [an] act is” prohibited
under the FDCPA. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858
(2009) (amending 16 CFR §1.98(d) (2009)). The Court
reasons that the FTC provision is meant to provide rela
tively harsh penalties for intentional violations. By con
trast, the argument continues, the penalties in the FDCPA
itself must cover—and hence §1692k(c) must not excuse—
unintentional violations. Ante, at 8–9.
The argument rests on a mistaken premise—namely,
that §1692k(c) must immunize all legal errors or none.
This misreads the statute. As the text states, it applies
only to “bona fide” errors committed despite “the mainte
nance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid” these
mistakes. So under a sensible reading of the statute,
(1) intentional violations are punishable under the height
ened penalties of the FTC Act; (2) unintentional violations
are generally subject to punishment under the FDCPA;
and (3) a defendant may escape liability altogether by
proving that a violation was based on a bona fide error
and that reasonable error-prevention procedures were in
