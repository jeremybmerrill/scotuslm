Opinion of SCALIA, J.

Furniture Mart, Inc., 503 F. 2d 1161, 1167 (CA7 1974)
(“basically only clerical errors”); Palmer v. Wilson, 502
F. 2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974) (“[C]lerical errors . . . are the
only violations this section was designed to excuse”). Yet
the Court specifically interprets the identical language in
the FDCPA as providing a defense not only for clerical
errors, but also for factual errors. See ante, at 19, 24; see
also ante, at 20–21 (suggesting the same). If the Court
really finds the three Courts of Appeals’ interpretations of
TILA indicative of congressional intent in the FDCPA, it
should restrict its decision accordingly. As for me, I sup
port the Court’s inclusion of factual errors, because there
is nothing in the text of the FDCPA limiting the excusable
“not intentional” violations to those based on clerical
errors, and since there is a long tradition in the common
law and in our construction of federal statutes distinguish
ing errors of fact from errors of law.
The Court’s opinion also makes fulsome use of that
other legal fiction, legislative history, ranging from a
single Representative’s floor remarks on the House bill
that became the FDCPA, ante, at 16, n. 11, to a single
Representative’s remarks in a Senate Subcommittee
hearing on the House bill and three Senate bills, ibid., to
two 1979 Senate Committee Reports dealing not with the
FDCPA but with the 1980 amendments to TILA, ante, at
17, n. 12, to remarks in a Committee markup of the Sen
ate bill on the FDCPA, ante, at 21–22, n. 14, to a House
Report dealing with an earlier version of the FDCPA, ibid.
Is the conscientious attorney really expected to dig out
such mini-nuggets of “congressional intent” from floor
remarks, committee hearings, committee markups, and
committee reports covering many different bills over many
years? When the Court addresses such far-afield legisla
tive history merely “for the sake of completeness,” ante, at
20, it encourages and indeed prescribes such wasteful
over-lawyering.
