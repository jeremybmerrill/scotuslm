KENNEDY, J., dissenting

see §1692c(a)(1) (prohibiting debt collectors from commu
nicating with debtors at times “which should be known” to
be inconvenient); §1692e(8) (prohibiting the communica
tion of credit card information “which should be known to
be false”). That explains the statutory objective not to
disadvantage debt collectors who “refrain” from abusive
practices—that is to say, debt collectors who do not inten
tionally or unreasonably adopt them. It further explains
why Congress included a good-faith error exception,
which exempts violations that are not intentional or
unreasonable.
In referring to “abusive debt collection practices,” how
ever, surely Congress did not contemplate attorneys who
act based on reasonable, albeit ultimately mistaken, legal
interpretations. A debt collector does not gain a competi
tive advantage by making good-faith legal errors any more
than by making good-faith factual errors. This is ex
pressly so if the debt collector has implemented “proce
dures reasonably adapted to avoid” them. By reading
§1692k(c) to exclude good-faith mistakes of law, the Court
fails to align its interpretation with the statutory
objectives.
The Court urges, nevertheless, that there are policy
concerns on the other side. The Court frets about debt
collectors who “press the boundaries of the Act’s prohibi
tions” and about a potential “ ‘race to the bottom.’ ” Ante,
at 27–28 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 32). For instance, in
its view, interpreting §1692k(c) to encompass legal mis
takes might mean that “nonlawyer debt collectors could
obtain blanket immunity for mistaken interpretations of
the FDCPA simply by seeking the advice of legal counsel.”
Ante, at 27. It must be remembered, however, that
§1692k(c) may only be invoked where the debt collector’s
error is “bona fide” and where “reasonable procedures”
have been adopted to avoid errors. There is no valid or
persuasive reason to assume that Congress would want to
