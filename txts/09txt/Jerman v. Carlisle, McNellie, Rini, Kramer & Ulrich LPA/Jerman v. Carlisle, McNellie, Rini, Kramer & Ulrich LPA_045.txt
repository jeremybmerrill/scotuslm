JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

KENNEDY, J., dissenting 


The Court’s response is that there is something distinc
tive about the word “willful” that suggests an excuse for
mistakes of law. This may well be true for criminal stat
utes, in which the terms “ ‘knowing,’ ‘intentional’ [and]
‘willful’ ” have been distinguished in this regard. Ante, at
10 (citing Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47,
57 (2007)). But this distinction is specific to the criminal
context:
“It is different in the criminal law. When the term
‘willful’ or ‘willfully’ has been used in a criminal stat
ute, we have regularly read the modifier as limiting
liability to knowing violations. This reading of the
term, however, is tailored to the criminal law, where
it is characteristically used to require a criminal in
tent beyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt,
or an additional ‘bad purpose,’ or specific intent to vio
late a known legal duty created by highly technical
statutes.” Id., at 57–58, n. 9 (citations omitted).
For this reason, the Court’s citation to criminal cases,
which are themselves inconsistent, see Ratzlaf v. United
States, 510 U. S. 135 (1994), is unavailing. See ante, at
10–11, and n. 7.
In the civil context, by contrast, the word “willful” has
been used to impose a mens rea threshold for liability that
is lower, not higher, than an intentionality requirement.
See Safeco, supra, at 57 (“[W]here willfulness is a statu
tory condition of civil liability, we have generally taken it
to cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but
reckless ones as well”). Avoiding liability under a statute
aimed at intentional violations should therefore be easier,
not harder, than avoiding liability under a statute aimed
at willful violations. And certainly there is nothing in
Thurston or McLaughlin—both civil cases—suggesting
that they would have come out differently had the rele
vant statutes used “intentional violation” rather than
