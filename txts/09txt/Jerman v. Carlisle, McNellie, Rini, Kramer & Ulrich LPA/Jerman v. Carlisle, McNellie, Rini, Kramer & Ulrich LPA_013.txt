JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


lin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 133 (1988), as both
cases involved the statutory phrase “willful violation.”
Post, at 3.
The dissent reaches a contrary conclusion based on the
interaction of the words “violation” and “not intentional”
in §1692k(c). Post, at 2–3. But even in the criminal con
text, cf. n. 6, supra, reference to a “knowing” or “inten
tional” “violation” or cognate terms has not necessarily
implied a defense for legal errors. See Bryan v. United
States, 524 U. S. 184, 192 (1998) (“ ‘[T]he knowledge requi
site to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge
as distinguished from knowledge of the law’ ” (quoting
Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 342 U. S. 337,
345 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting)); United States v.
International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402 U. S. 558,
559, 563 (1971) (statute imposing criminal liability on
those who “ ‘knowingly violat[e]’ ” regulations governing
transportation of corrosive chemicals does not require
“proof of [the defendant’s] knowledge of the law”); Ellis v.
United States, 206 U. S. 246, 255, 257 (1907) (rejecting
argument that criminal penalty applicable to those who
“intentionally violate” a statute “requires knowledge of the
law”).
The dissent advances a novel interpretative rule under
which the combination of a “mens rea requirement” and
the word “ ‘violation’ ” (as opposed to language specifying
“the conduct giving rise to the violation”) creates a mis
take-of-law defense. Post, at 2–3. Such a rule would be
remarkable in its breadth, applicable to the many scores of
civil and criminal provisions throughout the U. S. Code
that employ such a combination of terms. The dissent’s
theory draws no distinction between “knowing,” “inten
tional,” or “willful” and would abandon the care we have
traditionally taken to construe such words in their par
ticular statutory context. See, e.g., Safeco, supra, at 57.
More fundamentally, the dissent’s categorical rule is at
