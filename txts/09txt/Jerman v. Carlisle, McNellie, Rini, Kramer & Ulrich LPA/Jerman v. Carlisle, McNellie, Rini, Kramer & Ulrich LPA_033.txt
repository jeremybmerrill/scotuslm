JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, 

KRAMER & ULRICH LPA 

Opinion of the Court 


ity discussed above. Heintz, 514 U. S., at 295. Absent
such a showing, arguments that the Act strikes an unde
sirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpre
tation are properly addressed to Congress. To the extent
Congress is persuaded that the policy concerns identified
by the dissent require a recalibration of the FDCPA’s
liability scheme, it is, of course, free to amend the statute
accordingly.22 Congress has wide latitude, for instance, to
revise §1692k to excuse some or all mistakes of law or
grant broader discretion to district courts to adjust a
plaintiff’s recovery. This Court may not, however, read
more into §1692k(c) than the statutory language naturally
supports. We therefore hold that the bona fide error de
fense in §1692k(c) does not apply to a violation of the
FDCPA resulting from a debt collector’s incorrect interpre
tation of the requirements of that statute.

For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

——————
22 The FDCPA has been amended some eight times since its enact
ment in 1977; the most recent amendment addressed a concern not
unrelated to the question we consider today, specifying that a pleading
in a civil action is not an “initial communication” triggering obligations
under §1692g requiring a written notice to the consumer. Financial
Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, §802(a), 120 Stat. 2006 (codified
at 15 U. S. C. §1692g(d)).
