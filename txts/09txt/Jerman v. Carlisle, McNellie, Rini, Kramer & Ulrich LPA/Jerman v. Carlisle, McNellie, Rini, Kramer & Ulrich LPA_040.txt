Opinion of SCALIA, J.

by the Act,” ante, at 21. The Court’s explanation seems to
me inadequate. No lawyer—indeed, no one speaking
accurately—would equate a mistake regarding the Act’s
coverage with a mistake regarding whether a particular
fact situation falls within the Act’s coverage. What the
Act covers (“the act’s coverage”) is one thing; whether a
particular case falls within the Act’s coverage is something
else.
Even if (contrary to my perception) the phrase could be
used to refer to both these things, by what principle does
the Court reject the more plausible meaning? The fact
that “attorneys were excluded from the Act’s definition of
‘debt collector’ until 1986,” ibid., does not, as the Court
contends, support its conclusion that errors of law are not
covered. Attorneys are not the only ones who would have
been able to claim a legal-error defense; non-attorneys
make legal mistakes too. They also sometimes receive and
rely upon erroneous legal advice from attorneys. Indeed,
if anyone could satisfy the defense’s requirement of main
taining “procedures reasonably adapted to avoid” a legal
error, it would be a non-attorney debt collector who fol
lows the procedure of directing all legal questions to his
attorney.
The Court also points to “equivocal” evidence from the
Senate Committee’s final markup session, ante, at 21–22,
n. 14, but it minimizes a decidedly unhelpful discussion of
the scope of the defense during the session. In response to
concern that the defense would be construed, like the
TILA defense, as “only protecting against a mathematical
error,” a staff member explained that, because of differ
ences in the nature of the statutes, the FDCPA defense
was broader than the TILA defense and “would apply to
any violation of the act which was unintentional.” See
