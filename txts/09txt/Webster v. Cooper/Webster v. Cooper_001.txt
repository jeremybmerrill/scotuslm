SCALIA, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
WINSTON WEBSTER v. LYNN COOPER, WARDEN
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 08–10314.

Decided November 30, 2009 


The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are
granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is re

Fifth Circuit for further consideration in light of Jimenez

2004, petitioner was resentenced, this time with a lawyer,
to the same term of incarceration.

§2244(d)(1)(A) started to run on May 15, 2003, 30 days
after the Louisiana trial court denied petitioner’s motion
for reconsideration of sentence. Accordingly, it concluded
that the statute had expired before petitioner filed his
federal habeas petition. The Fifth Circuit denied a certifi
cate of appealability.
Our recent decision in Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S.
___ (2009), held that the statute of limitations of
§2244(d)(1)(A) does not begin to run until the expiration of
