HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
BREYER, J., dissenting

where the PKK helps to coordinate a defendant’s activi
ties, ante, at 21, the simple fact of “coordination” alone
cannot readily remove protection that the First Amend
ment would otherwise grant. That amendment, after all,
also protects the freedom of association. See NAACP v.
Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U. S. 886, 911 (1982) (The
First Amendment’s protections “of speech, assembly,
association, and petition, ‘though not identical, are insepa
rable’ ” (quoting Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 530
(1945))); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353, 364 (1937)
(describing the “right of peaceable assembly” as “a right
cognate to those of free speech and free presses and . . .
equally fundamental”); see also Roberts v. United States
Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622 (1984). “Coordination” with a
political group, like membership, involves association.
“Coordination” with a group that engages in unlawful
activity also does not deprive the plaintiffs of the First
Amendment’s protection under any traditional “categori
cal” exception to its protection. The plaintiffs do not pro
pose to solicit a crime. They will not engage in fraud or
defamation or circulate obscenity. Cf. United States v.
Stevens, 559 U. S. ___ , ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5–6) (de
scribing “categories” of unprotected speech). And the First
Amendment protects advocacy even of unlawful action so
long as that advocacy is not “directed to inciting or produc
ing imminent lawless action and . . . likely to incite or
produce such action.” Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444,
447 (1969) (per curiam) (emphasis added). Here the plain
tiffs seek to advocate peaceful, lawful action to secure
political ends; and they seek to teach others how to do
the same. No one contends that the plaintiffs’ speech to
these organizations can be prohibited as incitement under
Brandenburg.
Moreover, the Court has previously held that a person
who associates with a group that uses unlawful means to
achieve its ends does not thereby necessarily forfeit the
