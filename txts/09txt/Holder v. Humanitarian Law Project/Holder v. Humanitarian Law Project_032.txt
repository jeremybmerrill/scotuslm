HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Opinion of the Court

Hamas is able to use its overt political and charitable
organizations as a financial and logistical support network
for its terrorist operations”).
Money is fungible, and “[w]hen foreign terrorist organi­
zations that have a dual structure raise funds, they high­
light the civilian and humanitarian ends to which such
moneys could be put.” McKune Affidavit, App. 134, ¶9.
But “there is reason to believe that foreign terrorist or­
ganizations do not maintain legitimate financial firewalls
between those funds raised for civil, nonviolent activities,
and those ultimately used to support violent, terrorist
operations.” Id., at 135, ¶12. Thus, “[f]unds raised osten­
sibly for charitable purposes have in the past been redi­
rected by some terrorist groups to fund the purchase of
arms and explosives.” Id., at 134, ¶10. See also Brief for
Anti-Defamation League as Amicus Curiae 19–29 (describ­
ing fundraising activities by the PKK, LTTE, and Hamas);
Regan v. Wald, 468 U. S. 222, 243 (1984) (upholding Presi­
dent’s decision to impose travel ban to Cuba “to curtail the
flow of hard currency to Cuba—currency that could then
be used in support of Cuban adventurism”). There is
evidence that the PKK and the LTTE, in particular, have
not “respected the line between humanitarian and violent
activities.” McKune Affidavit, App. 135, ¶13 (discussing
PKK); see id., at 134 (LTTE).
The dissent argues that there is “no natural stopping
place” for the proposition that aiding a foreign terrorist
organization’s lawful activity promotes the terrorist or­
ganization as a whole. Post, at 10. But Congress has
settled on just such a natural stopping place: The statute
reaches only material support coordinated with or under
the direction of a designated foreign terrorist organization.
Independent advocacy that might be viewed as promoting
the group’s legitimacy is not covered. See supra, at 18–
