ERIC H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[June 21, 2010]

JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICES GINSBURG and
SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.
Like the Court, and substantially for the reasons it
gives, I do not think this statute is unconstitutionally
vague. But I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion
that the Constitution permits the Government to prose
cute the plaintiffs criminally for engaging in coordinated
teaching and advocacy furthering the designated organiza
tions’ lawful political objectives. In my view, the Govern
ment has not met its burden of showing that an interpre
tation of the statute that would prohibit this speech- and
association-related activity serves the Government’s com
pelling interest in combating terrorism. And I would
interpret the statute as normally placing activity of this
kind outside its scope. See Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.
22, 62 (1932); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–347
(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).
