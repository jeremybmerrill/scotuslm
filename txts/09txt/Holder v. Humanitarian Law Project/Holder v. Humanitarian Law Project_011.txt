Opinion of the Court

support statute was unconstitutional on two grounds:
First, it violated their freedom of speech and freedom of
association under the First Amendment, because it crimi­
nalized their provision of material support to the PKK and
the LTTE, without requiring the Government to prove
that plaintiffs had a specific intent to further the unlawful
ends of those organizations. Id., at 1184. Second, plain­
tiffs argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.
Id., at 1184–1185.
Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which the
District Court granted in part. The District Court held
that plaintiffs had not established a probability of success
on their First Amendment speech and association claims.
See id., at 1196–1197. But the court held that plaintiffs
had established a probability of success on their claim
that, as applied to them, the statutory terms “personnel”
and “training” in the definition of “material support” were
impermissibly vague. See id., at 1204.
The Court of Appeals affirmed. 205 F. 3d 1130, 1138
(CA9 2000). The court rejected plaintiffs’ speech and
association claims, including their claim that §2339B
violated the First Amendment in barring them from con­
tributing money to the PKK and the LTTE. See id., at
1133–1136. But the Court of Appeals agreed with the
District Court that the terms “personnel” and “training”
were vague because it was “easy to imagine protected
expression that falls within the bounds” of those terms.
Id., at 1138; see id., at 1137.
With the preliminary injunction issue decided, the
action returned to the District Court, and the parties
moved for summary judgment on the merits. The District
Court entered a permanent injunction against applying to
plaintiffs the bans on “personnel” and “training” support.
See No. CV–98–1971 ABC (BQRx), 2001 WL 36105333
(CD Cal., Oct. 2, 2001). The Court of Appeals affirmed.
352 F. 3d 382 (CA9 2003).
