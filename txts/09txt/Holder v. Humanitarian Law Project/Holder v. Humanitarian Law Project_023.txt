Opinion of the Court

the PKK how to petition for humanitarian relief before the
United Nations involves advice derived from, as the stat­
ute puts it, “specialized knowledge.” §2339A(b)(3). In fact,
plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used the terms
“training” and “expert advice” throughout this litigation to
describe their own proposed activities, demonstrating that
these common terms readily and naturally cover plaintiffs’
conduct. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 10, 11; App. 56, 58,
59, 61, 62, 63, 80, 81, 98, 99, 106, 107, 117.
Plaintiffs respond by pointing to hypothetical situations
designed to test the limits of “training” and “expert advice
or assistance.” They argue that the statutory definitions
of these terms use words of degree—like “specific,” “gen­
eral,” and “specialized”—and that it is difficult to apply
those definitions in particular cases. See Brief for Plain­
tiffs 27 (debating whether teaching a course on geography
would constitute training); id., at 29. And they cite Gen
tile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030 (1991), in which we
found vague a state bar rule providing that a lawyer in a
criminal case, when speaking to the press, “may state
without elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . .
defense.” Id., at 1048 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Whatever force these arguments might have in the
abstract, they are beside the point here. Plaintiffs do not
propose to teach a course on geography, and cannot seek
refuge in imaginary cases that straddle the boundary
between “specific skills” and “general knowledge.” See
Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S., at 756. We emphasized this
point in Scales, holding that even if there might be theo­
retical doubts regarding the distinction between “active”
and “nominal” membership in an organization—also terms
of degree—the defendant’s vagueness challenge failed
because his “case present[ed] no such problem.” 367 U. S.,
at 223.
Gentile was different. There the asserted vagueness in
a state bar rule was directly implicated by the facts before
