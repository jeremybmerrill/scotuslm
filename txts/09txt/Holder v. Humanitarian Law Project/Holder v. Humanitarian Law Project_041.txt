Opinion of the Court

cause the statute does not penalize mere association with
a foreign terrorist organization. As the Ninth Circuit put
it: “The statute does not prohibit being a member of one of
the designated groups or vigorously promoting and sup­
porting the political goals of the group. . . . What [§2339B]
prohibits is the act of giving material support . . . .” 205
F. 3d, at 1133. Plaintiffs want to do the latter. Our deci­
sions scrutinizing penalties on simple association or as­
sembly are therefore inapposite. See, e.g., Robel, supra, at
262 (“It is precisely because th[e] statute sweeps indis­
criminately across all types of association with Commu­
nist-action groups, without regard to the quality and
degree of membership, that it runs afoul of the First
Amendment”); De Jonge, supra, at 362.
Plaintiffs also argue that the material-support statute
burdens their freedom of association because it prevents
them from providing support to designated foreign terror­
ist organizations, but not to other groups. See Brief for
Plaintiffs 56; Reply Brief for Plaintiffs 37–38. Any burden
on plaintiffs’ freedom of association in this regard is justi­
fied for the same reasons that we have denied plaintiffs’
free speech challenge. It would be strange if the Constitu­
tion permitted Congress to prohibit certain forms of
speech that constitute material support, but did not per­
mit Congress to prohibit that support only to particularly
dangerous and lawless foreign organizations. Congress is
not required to ban material support to every group or
none at all.
