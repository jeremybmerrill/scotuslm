HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Opinion of the Court

Meanwhile, in 2001, Congress amended the definition of
“material support or resources” to add the term “expert
advice or assistance.” Uniting and Strengthening America
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act),
§805(a)(2)(B), 115 Stat. 377. In 2003, plaintiffs filed a
second action challenging the constitutionality of that
term as applied to them. 309 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1192 (CD
Cal. 2004).
In that action, the Government argued that plaintiffs
lacked standing and that their preenforcement claims
were not ripe. Id., at 1194. The District Court held that
plaintiffs’ claims were justiciable because plaintiffs had
sufficiently demonstrated a “genuine threat of imminent
prosecution,” id., at 1195 (internal quotation marks omit­
ted), and because §2339B had the potential to chill plain­
tiffs’ protected expression, see id., at 1197–1198. On the
merits, the District Court held that the term “expert ad­
vice or assistance” was impermissibly vague. Id., at 1201.
The District Court rejected, however, plaintiffs’ First
Amendment claims that the new term was substantially
overbroad and criminalized associational speech. See id.,
at 1202, 1203.
The parties cross-appealed. While the cross-appeals
were pending, the Ninth Circuit granted en banc rehear­
ing of the panel’s 2003 decision in plaintiffs’ first action
(involving the terms “personnel” and “training”). See 382
F. 3d 1154, 1155 (2004). The en banc court heard reargu­
ment on December 14, 2004. See 380 F. Supp. 2d 1134,
1138 (CD Cal. 2005). Three days later, Congress again
amended §2339B and the definition of “material support
or resources.” Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Preven­
tion Act of 2004 (IRTPA), §6603, 118 Stat. 3762–3764.
In IRTPA, Congress clarified the mental state necessary
to violate §2339B, requiring knowledge of the foreign
group’s designation as a terrorist organization or the
