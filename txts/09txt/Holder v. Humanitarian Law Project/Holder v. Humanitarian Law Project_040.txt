HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Opinion of the Court

tional organizations and mechanisms to resolve disputes
during World War II. It would, under the dissent’s rea­
soning, have been contrary to our commitment to resolving
disputes through “ ‘deliberative forces,’ ” post, at 13 (quot­
ing Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)
(Brandeis, J., concurring)), for Congress to conclude that
assisting Japan on that front might facilitate its war effort
more generally. That view is not one the First Amend­

All this is not to say that any future applications of the
material-support statute to speech or advocacy will sur­
vive First Amendment scrutiny. It is also not to say that

tend the same prohibition on material support at issue
here to domestic organizations. We simply hold that, in
prohibiting the particular forms of support that plaintiffs
seek to provide to foreign terrorist groups, §2339B does
not violate the freedom of speech.

the LTTE, thereby running afoul of decisions like De
Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937), and cases in which
we have overturned sanctions for joining the Communist
Party, see, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of
State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967); United States v. Robel,
389 U. S. 258 (1967).
The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this claim be­
