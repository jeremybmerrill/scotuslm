serious doubt” as to the statute’s constitutionality. Cro
well, 285 U. S., at 62. And where that is so, we must
“ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly
possible by which the question may be avoided.” Ibid.; see
also Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346–348 (Brandeis, J.,
concurring); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 689 (2001);
United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78

I believe that a construction that would avoid the consti
tutional problem is “fairly possible.” In particular, I would
read the statute as criminalizing First-Amendment
protected pure speech and association only when the
defendant knows or intends that those activities will assist
the organization’s unlawful terrorist actions. Under this
reading, the Government would have to show, at a mini
mum, that such defendants provided support that they
knew was significantly likely to help the organization
pursue its unlawful terrorist aims.
A person acts with the requisite knowledge if he is
aware of (or willfully blinds himself to) a significant likeli
hood that his or her conduct will materially support the
organization’s terrorist ends. See Allen v. United States,
164 U. S. 492, 496 (1896); cf. ALI, Model Penal Code
§2.02(2)(b)(ii) (1962). See also United States v. Santos, 553
U. S. 507, 521 (2008) (plurality opinion); cf. Model Penal
Code §2.02(7) (willful blindness); S. Rep. No. 95–605, pt. 1,
pp. 59–60 (1977). A person also acts with the requisite
intent if it is his “conscious objective” (or purpose) to fur
ther those same terrorist ends. See United States v. Bai
ley, 444 U. S. 394, 408 (1980); Model Penal Code
§§2.02(2)(a) and 2.02(5) (“When acting knowingly suffices
to establish an element, such element also is established if
a person acts purposely”). On the other hand, for the
reasons I have set out, see supra, at 9–12, knowledge or
intent that this assistance (aimed at lawful activities)
