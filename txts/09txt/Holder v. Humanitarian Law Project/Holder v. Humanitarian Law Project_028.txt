HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Opinion of the Court

issue in this litigation is conduct, and therefore wrong to
argue that O’Brien provides the correct standard of re­
view.5 O’Brien does not provide the applicable standard
for reviewing a content-based regulation of speech, see
R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 385–386 (1992); Texas
v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403, 406–407 (1989), and
§2339B regulates speech on the basis of its content. Plain­
tiffs want to speak to the PKK and the LTTE, and whether
they may do so under §2339B depends on what they say.
If plaintiffs’ speech to those groups imparts a “specific
skill” or communicates advice derived from “specialized
knowledge”—for example, training on the use of interna­
tional law or advice on petitioning the United Nations—
then it is barred. See Brief for Government 33–34. On the
other hand, plaintiffs’ speech is not barred if it imparts
only general or unspecialized knowledge. See id., at 32.
The Government argues that §2339B should nonethe­
less receive intermediate scrutiny because it generally
functions as a regulation of conduct. That argument runs
headlong into a number of our precedents, most promi­
nently Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15 (1971). Cohen
also involved a generally applicable regulation of conduct,
barring breaches of the peace. See id., at 16. But when
Cohen was convicted for wearing a jacket bearing an
epithet, we did not apply O’Brien. See 403 U. S., at 16, 18.
Instead, we recognized that the generally applicable law

Government suggests in passing that, to the extent plaintiffs’
activities constitute speech, that speech is wholly unprotected by the
First Amendment. The Government briefly analogizes speech coordi­
nated with foreign terrorist organizations to speech effecting a crime,
like the words that constitute a conspiracy. Brief for Government 46;
Reply Brief for Government 31–32, and n. 8. See, e.g., Giboney v.
Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 498, 502 (1949). We do not
consider any such argument because the Government does not develop
it: The Government’s submission is that applying §2339B to plaintiffs
triggers intermediate First Amendment scrutiny—not that it triggers
no First Amendment scrutiny at all.
