HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Opinion of the Court

well. Thus, we do not consider the application of §2339B
to those activities here.
One last point. Plaintiffs seek preenforcement review of
a criminal statute. Before addressing the merits, we must
be sure that this is a justiciable case or controversy under
Article III. We conclude that it is: Plaintiffs face “a credi­
ble threat of prosecution” and “should not be required to
await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole
means of seeking relief.” Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442
U. S. 289, 298 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).
See also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S.
118, 128–129 (2007).
Plaintiffs claim that they provided support to the PKK
and the LTTE before the enactment of §2339B and that
they would provide similar support again if the statute’s
allegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted.
See 309
F. Supp. 2d, at 1197. The Government tells us that it has
charged about 150 persons with violating §2339B, and
that several of those prosecutions involved the enforce­
ment of the statutory terms at issue here. See Brief for
Government 5. The Government has not argued to this
Court that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what
they say they wish to do. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58. See
Babbitt, supra, at 302. See also Milavetz, Gallop & Milav
etz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2010)
(slip op., at 4, 19) (considering an as-applied preenforce­
ment challenge brought under the First Amendment).
Based on these considerations, we conclude that plaintiffs’
claims are suitable for judicial review (as one might hope
after 12 years of litigation).
III
Plaintiffs claim, as a threshold matter, that we should
affirm the Court of Appeals without reaching any issues of
constitutional law. They contend that we should interpret
the material-support statute, when applied to speech, to
