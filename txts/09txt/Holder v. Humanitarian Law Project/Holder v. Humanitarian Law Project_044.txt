HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
BREYER, J., dissenting

I
The statute before us forbids “knowingly provid[ing]” “a
foreign terrorist organization” with “material support or
resources,” defined to include, among other things, “train
ing,” “expert advice or assistance,” “personnel,” and “ser
vice.” 18 U. S. C. §§2339B(a)(1), (g)(4); §2339A(b)(1). The
Secretary of State has designated the Kurdistan Workers’
Party (PKK) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) as “foreign terrorist organizations”—a designation
authorized where the organization is “foreign,” threatens
the security of the United States or its nationals, and
engages in “terrorist activity,” defined to include “any” of
such activities as “highjacking” and “assassination,” or the
“use of . . . any . . . weapon or dangerous device . . . with
intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one
or more individuals.” 62 Fed. Reg. 52650 (1997); 8 U. S. C.
§1182(a)(3)(B)(iii); 18 U. S. C. §2339B(a)(1).
The plaintiffs, all United States citizens or associations,
now seek an injunction and declaration providing that,
without violating the statute, they can (1) “train members
of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and interna

political advocacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey”;
(3) “teach PKK members how to petition various represen
tative bodies such as the United Nations for relief”; and (4)
“engage in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils who live
in Sri Lanka.” Humanitarian Law Project v. Mukasey, 552
F. 3d 916, 921, n. 1 (CA9 2009); ante, at 9. All these ac
tivities are of a kind that the First Amendment ordinarily
protects.
In my view, the Government has not made the strong
showing necessary to justify under the First Amendment
the criminal prosecution of those who engage in these
activities. All the activities involve the communication
and advocacy of political ideas and lawful means of achiev
ing political ends. Even the subjects the plaintiffs wish to
