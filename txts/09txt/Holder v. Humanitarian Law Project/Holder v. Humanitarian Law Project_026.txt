Deciding whether activities described at such a level of

criminal liability,” and so “adjudication of the reach and
constitutionality of [the statute] must await a concrete fact
situation.” Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S. 1, 20 (1965).

Turkey and Sri Lanka, human rights, and international
law. They may advocate before the United Nations. As
the Government states: “The statute does not prohibit
independent advocacy or expression of any kind.” Brief for
Government 13. Section 2339B also “does not prevent
[plaintiffs] from becoming members of the PKK and LTTE
