BREYER, J., dissenting

formulates a new legal rule, the ordinary course is to

first instance”).
IV
In sum, these cases require us to consider how to apply
the First Amendment where national security interests
are at stake. When deciding such cases, courts are aware
and must respect the fact that the Constitution entrusts to
the Executive and Legislative Branches the power to
provide for the national defense, and that it grants par
ticular authority to the President in matters of foreign
affairs. Nonetheless, this Court has also made clear that
authority and expertise in these matters do not automati
cally trump the Court’s own obligation to secure the pro
tection that the Constitution grants to individuals. Cf.
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536 (2004) (“We have
long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank
check . . . when it comes to the rights of th[is] Nation’s
citizens”). In these cases, for the reasons I have stated, I
believe the Court has failed to examine the Government’s
justifications with sufficient care. It has failed to insist
upon specific evidence, rather than general assertion. It
has failed to require tailoring of means to fit compelling
ends. And ultimately it deprives the individuals before us
of the protection that the First Amendment demands.
That is why, with respect, I dissent.
