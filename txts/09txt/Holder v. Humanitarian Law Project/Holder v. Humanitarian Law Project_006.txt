HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Syllabus
ternational law to resolve disputes would provide that group with in
formation and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strat
egy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.
Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could
help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.
Plaintiffs’ proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of
Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot
prevail in this preenforcement challenge. The Court does not decide
whether any future applications of the material-support statute to
speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny. It simply
holds that §2339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied
to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide. Pp.
28–34.
(e) Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs’ First
Amendment freedom of association. Plaintiffs argue that the statute
criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the
LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Court’s precedents. The Ninth
Circuit correctly rejected this claim because §2339B does not penalize
mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist
groups material support. Any burden on plaintiffs’ freedom of asso
ciation caused by preventing them from supporting designated for
eign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the
same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge. Pp. 34–
35.
