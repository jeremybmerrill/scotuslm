HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Opinion of the Court

enacted §2339B in 1996, or when it clarified §2339B’s
knowledge requirement in 2004.
Finally, plaintiffs give the game away when they argue
that a specific intent requirement should apply only when
the material-support statute applies to speech. There is
no basis whatever in the text of §2339B to read the same
provisions in that statute as requiring intent in some
circumstances but not others. It is therefore clear that
plaintiffs are asking us not to interpret §2339B, but to
revise it. “Although this Court will often strain to con­
strue legislation so as to save it against constitutional
attack, it must not and will not carry this to the point of
perverting the purpose of a statute.” Scales v. United
States, 367 U. S. 203, 211 (1961).
Scales is the case on which plaintiffs most heavily rely,
but it is readily distinguishable. That case involved the
Smith Act, which prohibited membership in a group advo­
cating the violent overthrow of the government. The
Court held that a person could not be convicted under the
statute unless he had knowledge of the group’s illegal
advocacy and a specific intent to bring about violent over­
throw. Id., at 220–222, 229. This action is different:
Section 2339B does not criminalize mere membership in a
designated foreign terrorist organization. It instead pro­
hibits providing “material support” to such a group. See
infra, at 20–21, 35. Nothing about Scales suggests the
need for a specific intent requirement in such a case. The
Court in Scales, moreover, relied on both statutory text
and precedent that had interpreted closely related provi­
sions of the Smith Act to require specific intent. 367 U. S.,
at 209, 221–222. Plaintiffs point to nothing similar here.
We cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga­
tion through plaintiffs’ proposed interpretation of §2339B.3
