Opinion of the Court

plaintiffs claim that §2339B violates their freedom of
speech under the First Amendment. Third, plaintiffs
claim that §2339B violates their First Amendment free­
dom of association.
Plaintiffs do not challenge the above statutory terms in
all their applications. Rather, plaintiffs claim that §2339B
is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in
certain specified activities. See Brief for Plaintiffs 16–17,
n. 10. With respect to the HLP and Judge Fertig, those
activities are: (1) “train[ing] members of [the] PKK on how
to use humanitarian and international law to peacefully
resolve disputes”; (2) “engag[ing] in political advocacy on
behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey”; and (3) “teach[ing]
PKK members how to petition various representative
bodies such as the United Nations for relief.” 552 F. 3d, at
921, n. 1; see 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1136. With respect to the
other plaintiffs, those activities are: (1) “train[ing] mem­
bers of [the] LTTE to present claims for tsunami-related
aid to mediators and international bodies”; (2) “offer[ing]
their legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements
between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government”; and
(3) “engag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils
who live in Sri Lanka.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; see 380
F. Supp. 2d, at 1137.
Plaintiffs also state that “the LTTE was recently de­
feated militarily in Sri Lanka,” so “[m]uch of the support
the Tamil organizations and Dr. Jeyalingam sought to
provide is now moot.” Brief for Plaintiffs 11, n. 5. Plain­
tiffs thus seek only to support the LTTE “as a political
organization outside Sri Lanka advocating for the rights of
Tamils.” Ibid. Counsel for plaintiffs specifically stated at
oral argument that plaintiffs no longer seek to teach the
LTTE how to present claims for tsunami-related aid,
because the LTTE now “has no role in Sri Lanka.” Tr. of
Oral Arg. 63. For that reason, helping the LTTE negotiate
a peace agreement with Sri Lanka appears to be moot as
