HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Opinion of the Court

Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully
segregate support of their legitimate activities from sup­
port of terrorism is an empirical question. When it en­
acted §2339B in 1996, Congress made specific findings
regarding the serious threat posed by international terror­
ism. See AEDPA §§301(a)(1)–(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note
following 18 U. S. C. §2339B (Findings and Purpose). One
of those findings explicitly rejects plaintiffs’ contention
that their support would not further the terrorist activities
of the PKK and LTTE: “[F]oreign organizations that en­
gage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal
conduct that any contribution to such an organization
facilitates that conduct.” §301(a)(7) (emphasis added).
Plaintiffs argue that the reference to “any contribution”
in this finding meant only monetary support. There is no
reason to read the finding to be so limited, particularly
because Congress expressly prohibited so much more than
monetary support in §2339B. Congress’s use of the term
“contribution” is best read to reflect a determination that
any form of material support furnished “to” a foreign
terrorist organization should be barred, which is precisely
what the material-support statute does. Indeed, when
Congress enacted §2339B, Congress simultaneously re­
moved an exception that had existed in §2339A(a) (1994
ed.) for the provision of material support in the form of
“humanitarian assistance to persons not directly involved
in” terrorist activity. AEDPA §323, 110 Stat. 1255; 205
F. 3d, at 1136. That repeal demonstrates that Congress
considered and rejected the view that ostensibly peaceful
aid would have no harmful effects.
We are convinced that Congress was justified in reject­
ing that view. The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.
