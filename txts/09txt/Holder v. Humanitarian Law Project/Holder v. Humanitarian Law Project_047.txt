BREYER, J., dissenting

First Amendment’s protection for freedom of association.
See Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 229 (1961)
(“[Q]uasi-political parties or other groups that may em
brace both legal and illegal aims differ from a technical
conspiracy, which is defined by its criminal purpose”); see
also NAACP, supra, at 908 (“The right to associate does
not lose all constitutional protection merely because some
members of the group may have participated in conduct or
advocated doctrine that itself is not protected”). Rather,
the Court has pointed out in respect to associating with a
group advocating overthrow of the Government through
force and violence: “If the persons assembling have com
mitted crimes elsewhere . . . , they may be prosecuted for
their . . . violation of valid laws. But it is a different mat
ter when the State, instead of prosecuting them for such
offenses, seizes upon mere participation in a peaceable
assembly and a lawful public discussion as the basis for a
criminal charge.” De Jonge, supra, at 365 (striking down
conviction for attending and assisting at Communist Party
meeting because “[n]otwithstanding [the party’s] objec
tives, the defendant still enjoyed his personal right of free
speech and to take part in peaceable assembly having a
lawful purpose”).
Not even the “serious and deadly problem” of interna
tional terrorism can require automatic forfeiture of First
Amendment rights. §301(a)(1), 110 Stat. 1247, note fol
lowing 18 U. S. C. §2339B. Cf. §2339B(i) (instructing
courts not to “constru[e] or appl[y the statute] so as to
abridge the exercise of right guaranteed under the First
Amendment”). After all, this Court has recognized that
not “ ‘[e]ven the war power . . . remove[s] constitutional
United
limitations safeguarding essential liberties.’ ”
