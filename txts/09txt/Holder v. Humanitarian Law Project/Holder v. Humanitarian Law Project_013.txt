Opinion of the Court

group’s commission of terrorist acts. §2339B(a)(1). Con­
gress also added the term “service” to the definition of
“material support or resources,” §2339A(b)(1), and defined
“training” to mean “instruction or teaching designed to
impart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge,”
§2339A(b)(2). It also defined “expert advice or assistance”
to mean “advice or assistance derived from scientific,
technical or other specialized knowledge.” §2339A(b)(3).
Finally, IRTPA clarified the scope of the term “personnel”
by providing:
“No person may be prosecuted under [§2339B] in con­
nection with the term ‘personnel’ unless that person
has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or con­
spired to provide a foreign terrorist organization with
1 or more individuals (who may be or include himself)
to work under that terrorist organization’s direction
or control or to organize, manage, supervise, or other­
wise direct the operation of that organization. Indi­
viduals who act entirely independently of the foreign
terrorist organization to advance its goals or objec­
tives shall not be considered to be working under the
foreign terrorist organization’s direction and control.”
§2339B(h).
Shortly after Congress enacted IRTPA, the en banc
Court of Appeals issued an order in plaintiffs’ first action.
393 F. 3d 902, 903 (CA9 2004). The en banc court af­
firmed the rejection of plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims
for the reasons set out in the Ninth Circuit’s panel deci­
sion in 2000. See ibid. In light of IRTPA, however, the en
banc court vacated the panel’s 2003 judgment with respect
to vagueness, and remanded to the District Court for
further proceedings. Ibid. The Ninth Circuit panel as­
signed to the cross-appeals in plaintiffs’ second action
(relating to “expert advice or assistance”) also remanded in
light of IRTPA. See 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1139.
