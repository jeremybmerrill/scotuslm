Opinion of the Court

require proof that a defendant intended to further a for­
eign terrorist organization’s illegal activities. That inter­
pretation, they say, would end the litigation because plain­
tiffs’ proposed activities consist of speech, but plaintiffs do
not intend to further unlawful conduct by the PKK or the
LTTE.
We reject plaintiffs’ interpretation of §2339B because it
is inconsistent with the text of the statute. Section
2339B(a)(1) prohibits “knowingly” providing material
support. It then specifically describes the type of knowl­
edge that is required: “To violate this paragraph, a per­
son must have knowledge that the organization is a
designated terrorist organization . . ., that the organiza­
tion has engaged or engages in terrorist activity . . ., or
that the organization has engaged or engages in terror­
ism. . . .” Ibid. Congress plainly spoke to the necessary
mental state for a violation of §2339B, and it chose
knowledge about the organization’s connection to terror­
ism, not specific intent to further the organization’s
terrorist activities.
Plaintiffs’ interpretation is also untenable in light of the
sections immediately surrounding §2339B, both of which
do refer to intent to further terrorist activity.
See
§2339A(a) (establishing criminal penalties for one who
“provides material support or resources . . . knowing or
intending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in
carrying out, a violation of” statutes prohibiting violent
terrorist acts); §2339C(a)(1) (setting criminal penalties for
one who “unlawfully and willfully provides or collects
funds with the intention that such funds be used, or with
the knowledge that such funds are to be used, in full or in
part, in order to carry out” other unlawful acts). Congress
enacted §2339A in 1994 and §2339C in 2002.
See
§120005(a), 108 Stat. 2022 (§2339A); §202(a), 116 Stat.
724 (§2339C). Yet Congress did not import the intent
language of those provisions into §2339B, either when it
