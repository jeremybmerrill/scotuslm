HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
BREYER, J., dissenting

peculiar to war, as against others, the principle of the
right to free speech is always the same”). Thus, there is
no general First Amendment exception that applies here.
If the statute is constitutional in this context, it would
have to come with a strong justification attached.
It is not surprising that the majority, in determining the
constitutionality of criminally prohibiting the plaintiffs’
proposed activities, would apply, not the kind of interme
diate First Amendment standard that applies to conduct,
but “ ‘a more demanding standard.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting
Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403 (1989)). Indeed,
where, as here, a statute applies criminal penalties and at
least arguably does so on the basis of content-based dis
tinctions, I should think we would scrutinize the statute
and justifications “strictly”—to determine whether the
prohibition is justified by a “compelling” need that cannot
be “less restrictively” accommodated. See Houston v. Hill,
482 U. S. 451, 459 (1987) (criminal penalties); Ashcroft v.

(same); Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv.
Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 540 (1980) (strict scru

786 (1978) (same).
But, even if we assume for argument’s sake that “strict
scrutiny” does not apply, no one can deny that we must at
the very least “measure the validity of the means adopted
by Congress against both the goal it has sought to achieve
and the specific prohibitions of the First Amendment.”
Robel, supra, 268, n. 20 (describing constitutional task
where the Court is faced “with a clear conflict between a
federal statute enacted in the interests of national security
and an individual’s exercise of his First Amendment
rights”). And here I need go no further, for I doubt that
the statute, as the Government would interpret it, can
