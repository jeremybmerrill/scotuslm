HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
BREYER, J., dissenting

like. §2339A(b)(1). Those kinds of aid are inherently more
likely to help an organization’s terrorist activities, either
directly or because they are fungible in nature. Thus, to
show that an individual has provided support of those
kinds will normally prove sufficient for conviction (assum
ing the statute’s other requirements are met). But where
support consists of pure speech or association, I would
indulge in no such presumption. Rather, the Government
would have to prove that the defendant knew he was
providing support significantly likely to help the organiza
tion pursue its unlawful terrorist aims (or, alternatively,
that the defendant intended the support to be so used).
The statute’s history strongly supports this reading.
That history makes clear that Congress primarily sought
to end assistance that takes the form of fungible donations
of money or goods. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 104–383, at
38, 43–45, 81; supra, at 8–9. It shows that Congress,
when referring to “expert services and assistance” for
example, had in mind training that was sufficiently fungi
ble to further terrorism directly, such as an aviation ex
pert’s giving “advice” that “facilitat[es] an aircraft hijack
ing” or an accountant’s giving “advice” that will “facilitate
the concealment of funds used to support terrorist activi
ties.” Hearing on Administration’s Draft Anti-Terrorism
Act of 2001 before the House Committee on the Judiciary,
107th Cong., 1st Sess., 61 (2001).
And the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the
Judiciary, when reporting the relevant bill from Commit
tee, told the Senate:
“This bill also includes provisions making it a crime to
knowingly provide material support to the terrorist
functions of foreign groups designated by a Presiden
tial finding to be engaged in terrorist activities.” 142
