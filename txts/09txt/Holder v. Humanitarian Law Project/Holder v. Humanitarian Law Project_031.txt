Opinion of the Court

Lankan President, Security Minister, and Deputy Defense
Minister. Id., at 130–132; Brief for Government 6–7. “On
January 31, 1996, the LTTE exploded a truck bomb filled
with an estimated 1,000 pounds of explosives at the Cen­
tral Bank in Colombo, killing 100 people and injuring
more than 1,400. This bombing was the most deadly
terrorist incident in the world in 1996.” McKune Affida­

Stat. 1247.
Material support meant to “promot[e] peaceable, lawful

raise funds—all of which facilitate more terrorist attacks.
“Terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational
‘firewalls’ that would prevent or deter . . . sharing and
commingling of support and benefits.” McKune Affidavit,
App. 135, ¶11. “[I]nvestigators have revealed how terror­
ist groups systematically conceal their activities behind
charitable, social, and political fronts.” M. Levitt, Hamas:
Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad 2–
3 (2006). “Indeed, some designated foreign terrorist or­
ganizations use social and political components to recruit
personnel to carry out terrorist operations, and to provide
support to criminal terrorists and their families in aid of
such operations.” McKune Affidavit, App. 135, ¶11;
Levitt, supra, at 2 (“Muddying the waters between its
political activism, good works, and terrorist attacks,
