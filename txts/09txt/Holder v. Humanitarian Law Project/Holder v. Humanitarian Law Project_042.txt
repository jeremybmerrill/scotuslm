HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Opinion of the Court

ed. 1961). We hold that, in regulating the particular forms
of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terror­
ist organizations, Congress has pursued that objective
consistent with the limitations of the First and Fifth
Amendments.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part,
and the cases are remanded for further proceedings con­
sistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
