BREYER, J., dissenting

He then added:
“I am convinced we have crafted a narrow but effec
tive designation provision which meets these obliga
tions while safeguarding the freedom to associate,
which none of us would willingly give up.” Id., at
S3360.
Consistent with this view, the statute itself says:
“Nothing in this section shall be construed or applied
so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed un
der the First Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States.” §2339B(i).
In any event, the principle of constitutional avoidance
demands this interpretation. As Part II makes clear,
there is a “serious” doubt—indeed, a “grave” doubt—about
the constitutionality of the statute insofar as it is read to
criminalize the activities before us. Crowell, 285 U. S., at
62; see also Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346–348 (Brandeis,
J., concurring); Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S., at 401. We there
fore must “read the statute to eliminate” that constitu
tional “doub[t] so long as such a reading is not plainly
contrary to the intent of Congress.” X-Citement Video,
Inc., 513 U. S., at 78.
For this reason, the majority’s statutory claim that
Congress did not use the word “knowingly” as I would use
it, ante, at 12–13, and n. 3, is beside the point. Our conse
quent reading is consistent with the statute’s text; it is
consistent with Congress’ basic intent; it interprets but
does not significantly add to what the statute otherwise
contains. Cf. e.g., United States v. Thirty-seven Photo
graphs, 402 U. S. 363, 373–374 (1971) (constitutionally
compelled to add requirement that “forfeiture proceedings
be commenced within 14 days and completed within 60
days” despite absence of any statutory time limits); NLRB
v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 507 (1979)
