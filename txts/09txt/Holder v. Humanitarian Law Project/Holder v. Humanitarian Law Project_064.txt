HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
BREYER, J., dissenting

(constitutionally compelled to interpret “employer” as
implicitly excluding “church-operated schools” despite
silence and eight other different but explicit exceptions).
We should adopt it.
III
Having interpreted the statute to impose the mens rea
requirement just described, I would remand the cases so
that the lower courts could consider more specifically the
precise activities in which the plaintiffs still wish to en
gage and determine whether and to what extent a grant of
declaratory and injunctive relief were warranted. I do not
see why the majority does not also remand the cases for
consideration of the plaintiffs’ activities relating to “advo
cating” for the organizations’ peaceful causes. See ante, at
19–20, 32–33.
The majority does not remand, apparently because it
believes the plaintiffs lose automatically in that these
“advocacy” claims are too general. It adds that the plain
tiffs did not “suggest what exactly their ‘advocacy’ would
consist of.” Ante, at 33. But the majority is wrong about
the lack of specificity. The record contains complaints and
affidavits, which describe in detail the forms of advocacy
these groups have previously engaged in and in which
they would like to continue to engage. See App. 56–63,
78–87, 95–99, 110–123.
Moreover, the majority properly rejects the Govern
ment’s argument that the plaintiffs’ speech-related activi
ties amount to “conduct” and should be reviewed as such.
Government Brief 44–57. Hence, I should think the ma
jority would wish the lower courts to reconsider this aspect
of the cases, applying a proper standard of review. See,
e.g., Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U. S. 346, 357–
358 (2007); Johnson v. California 543 U. S. 499, 515
(2005); cf. Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip
