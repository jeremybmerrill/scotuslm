Opinion of the Court

was directed at Cohen because of what his speech commu­
nicated—he violated the breach of the peace statute be­
cause of the offensive content of his particular message.
We accordingly applied more rigorous scrutiny and re­
versed his conviction. See id., at 18–19, 26.
This suit falls into the same category. The law here
may be described as directed at conduct, as the law in
Cohen was directed at breaches of the peace, but as ap­
plied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under
the statute consists of communicating a message. As we
explained in Texas v. Johnson: “If the [Government’s]
regulation is not related to expression, then the less strin­
gent standard we announced in United States v. O’Brien
for regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls. If
it is, then we are outside of O’Brien’s test, and we must
[apply] a more demanding standard.” 491 U. S., at 403
(citation omitted).
B
The First Amendment issue before us is more refined
than either plaintiffs or the Government would have it. It
is not whether the Government may prohibit pure political
speech, or may prohibit material support in the form of
conduct. It is instead whether the Government may pro­
hibit what plaintiffs want to do—provide material support
to the PKK and LTTE in the form of speech.
Everyone agrees that the Government’s interest in
combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest
order. See Brief for Plaintiffs 51. Plaintiffs’ complaint is
that the ban on material support, applied to what they
wish to do, is not “necessary to further that interest.”
Ibid. The objective of combating terrorism does not justify
prohibiting their speech, plaintiffs argue, because their
support will advance only the legitimate activities of the
designated terrorist organizations, not their terrorism.
Id., at 51–52.
