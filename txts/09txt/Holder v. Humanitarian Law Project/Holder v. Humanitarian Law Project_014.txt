HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT
Opinion of the Court

The District Court consolidated the two actions on re­
mand. See ibid. The court also allowed plaintiffs to chal­
lenge the new term “service.” See id., at 1151, n. 24. The
parties moved for summary judgment, and the District
Court granted partial relief to plaintiffs on vagueness
grounds. See id., at 1156.
The Court of Appeals affirmed once more. 552 F. 3d
916, 933 (CA9 2009). The court first rejected plaintiffs’
claim that the material-support statute would violate due
process unless it were read to require a specific intent to
further the illegal ends of a foreign terrorist organization.
See id., at 926–927. The Ninth Circuit also held that the
statute was not overbroad in violation of the First
Amendment. See id., at 931–932. As for vagueness, the
Court of Appeals noted that plaintiffs had not raised a
“facial vagueness challenge.” Id., at 929, n. 6. The court
held that, as applied to plaintiffs, the terms “training,”
“expert advice or assistance” (when derived from “other
specialized knowledge”), and “service” were vague because
they “continue[d] to cover constitutionally protected advo­
cacy,” but the term “personnel” was not vague because it
“no longer criminalize[d] pure speech protected by the
First Amendment.” Id., at 929–931.
The Government petitioned for certiorari, and plaintiffs
filed a conditional cross-petition. We granted both peti­
tions. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).
II
Given the complicated 12-year history of this litigation,
we pause to clarify the questions before us. Plaintiffs
challenge §2339B’s prohibition on four types of material
support—“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “ser­
vice,” and “personnel.” They raise three constitutional
claims. First, plaintiffs claim that §2339B violates the
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these
four statutory terms are impermissibly vague. Second,
