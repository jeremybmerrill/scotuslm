Opinion of the Court

IV
We turn to the question whether the material-support
statute, as applied to plaintiffs, is impermissibly vague
under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
“A conviction fails to comport with due process if the stat­
ute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of
ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is
so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously
discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Williams,
553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). We consider whether a statute
is vague as applied to the particular facts at issue, for “[a]
plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly
proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as
applied to the conduct of others.” Hoffman Estates v.
Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495 (1982).
We have said that when a statute “interferes with the
right of free speech or of association, a more stringent
vagueness test should apply.” Id., at 499. “But ‘perfect
clarity and precise guidance have never been required
even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.’ ”
Williams, supra, at 304 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against
Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 794 (1989)).
The Court of Appeals did not adhere to these principles.
Instead, the lower court merged plaintiffs’ vagueness
challenge with their First Amendment claims, holding
that portions of the material-support statute were uncon­
——————
knows or intends that those activities will assist the organization’s
unlawful terrorist actions.” Post, at 17 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Accord­
ing to the dissent, this interpretation is “fairly possible” and adopting it
would avoid constitutional concerns. Ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted). The dissent’s interpretation of §2339B fails for essentially the
same reasons as plaintiffs’. Congress explained what “knowingly”
means in §2339B, and it did not choose the dissent’s interpretation of
that term. In fact, the dissent proposes a mental-state requirement
indistinguishable from the one Congress adopted in §§2339A and
2339C, even though Congress used markedly different language in
§2339B.
