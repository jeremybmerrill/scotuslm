knowledge”); §2339A(b)(3) (“ ‘expert advice or assistance’
means advice or assistance derived from scientific, techni­
cal or other specialized knowledge”); §2339B(h) (clarifying
the scope of “personnel”). And the knowledge requirement
of the statute further reduces any potential for vagueness,
as we have held with respect to other statutes containing a
similar requirement. See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703,
732 (2000); Posters ‘N’ Things, Ltd. v. United States, 511
U. S. 513, 523, 526 (1994); see also Hoffman Estates, 455
U. S., at 499.
Of course, the scope of the material-support statute may
not be clear in every application. But the dispositive point
here is that the statutory terms are clear in their applica­
tion to plaintiffs’ proposed conduct, which means that
plaintiffs’ vagueness challenge must fail. Even assuming
that a heightened standard applies because the material­
support statute potentially implicates speech, the statu­
tory terms are not vague as applied to plaintiffs. See
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 114–115 (1972)
(rejecting a vagueness challenge to a criminal law that
implicated First Amendment activities); Scales, 367 U. S.,
at 223 (same).
Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage
readily fall within the scope of the terms “training” and
“expert advice or assistance.” Plaintiffs want to “train
members of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and
international law to peacefully resolve disputes,” and
“teach PKK members how to petition various representa­
tive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.” 552
F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. A person of ordinary intelligence would
understand that instruction on resolving disputes through
international law falls within the statute’s definition of
“training” because it imparts a “specific skill,” not “general
knowledge.” §2339A(b)(2). Plaintiffs’ activities also fall
comfortably within the scope of “expert advice or assis­
tance”: A reasonable person would recognize that teaching
