SCALIA, J., dissenting

appearance of bad faith,” ante, at 15 (citing §1325(a)(7)),
but it offers no explanation of why that is so, and no au
thority supporting it.4
● Even if bad faith were a real worry, or if it were essen
tial to a debtor’s prospects that he invoke §362’s automatic
stay immediately, the debtor might ask the bankruptcy
court to excuse him from filing a statement of current
income, so that it determines his “currently monthly in
come” at a later date. See §101(10A)(A)(ii). The Court
dismisses this alternative, explaining that if the Code
requires a mechanical approach this solution would “im
properly undermine” it, and if the Code allows exceptions
for changed circumstances the solution is unnecessary.
Ante, at 16. The second premise is correct, but the first is
not. Congress does not pursue its purposes at all costs.
Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987)
(per curiam). Here it may have struck the very balance
the Court thinks critical by creating a fixed formula but
leaving leeway as to the time to which it applies.5

4 Neither of the two Court of Appeals cases the Court cites—In re
Myers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007), and Neufeld v. Freeman, 794
F. 2d 149, 153 (CA4 1986)—involved a debtor’s delaying his petition
until his circumstances would permit the court to confirm a repayment
plan.
5 The Court observes that not every debtor will benefit from this ex
ception, ante, at 16, and n. 6, since §521(i)(3) provides that a bank
ruptcy court may not grant a request (which may be made after the
deadline for filing the current-income schedule) for an extension of
more than 45 days to file such a schedule. But the statute appears to
assume that a court may excuse the filing of such a schedule altogether:
A debtor is required to file a schedule in the first instance “unless the
court orders otherwise,” §521(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).
And
§101(10A)(A)(ii)’s provision of a method for calculating current monthly
income “if the debtor does not file the schedule of current income
required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(ii)” makes little sense unless a court
can excuse the failure to do so, since an unexcused failure to do so
would be a basis for dismissing the case, see §521(i). Allowing courts to
excuse such schedules does not render superfluous §521(i)(3)’s authori
