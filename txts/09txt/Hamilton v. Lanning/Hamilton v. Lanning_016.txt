HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

gress’ decision to require courts to measure projected
disposable income “as of the effective date of the plan” is
more consistent with the view that Congress expected
courts to consider postfiling information about the debtor’s
financial circumstances.
See 545 F. 3d, at 1279
(“[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all
projected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured
creditors ‘as of the effective date of the plan’ suggests
consideration of the debtor’s actual financial circum­
stances as of the effective date of the plan”).
Third, the requirement that projected disposable income
“will be applied to make payments” is most naturally read
to contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors
in the calculated monthly amounts. §1325(b)(1)(B). But
when, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks
the means to do so, this language is rendered a hollow
command.
C
The arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical
approach are unpersuasive. Noting that the Code now
provides a detailed and precise definition of “disposable
income,” proponents of the mechanical approach maintain
that any departure from this method leaves that definition
“ ‘with no apparent purpose.’ ” In re Kagenveama, 541 F.
3d 868, 873 (CA9 2008). This argument overlooks the
important role that the statutory formula for calculating
“disposable income” plays under the forward-looking
approach. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case, a
court taking the forward-looking approach should begin by
calculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing
more is required. It is only in unusual cases that a court
may go further and take into account other known or
virtually certain information about the debtor’s future
