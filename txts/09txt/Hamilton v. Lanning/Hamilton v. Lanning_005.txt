JAN HAMILTON, CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE,

PETITIONER v. STEPHANIE KAY 

LANNING 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

[June 7, 2010]


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code provides bankruptcy
protection to “individual[s] with regular income” whose
debts fall within statutory limits. 11 U. S. C. §§101(30),
109(e). Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must
liquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors,
see §§704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to
keep their property, but they must agree to a court­
approved plan under which they pay creditors out of their
future income, see §§1306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a). A
bankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a
Chapter 13 debtor’s plan. §1322(a)(1); see also 28 U. S. C.
§586(a)(3).
Section 1325 of Title 11 specifies circumstances under
which a bankruptcy court “shall” and “may not” confirm a
plan. §1325(a),(b). If an unsecured creditor or the bank­
ruptcy trustee objects to confirmation, §1325(b)(1) requires
the debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to
pay all “projected disposable income” to be received by the
debtor over the duration of the plan.
