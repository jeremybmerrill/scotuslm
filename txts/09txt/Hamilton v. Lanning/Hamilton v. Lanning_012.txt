HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

By contrast, we need look no further than the Bank­
ruptcy Code to see that when Congress wishes to mandate
simple multiplication, it does so unambiguously—most
commonly by using the term “multiplied.” See, e.g., 11
U. S. C. §1325(b)(3) (“current monthly income, when mul­
tiplied by 12”); §§704(b)(2), 707(b)(6), (7)(A) (same);
§707(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(iv) (“multiplied by 60”). Accord, 2
U. S. C. §58(b)(1)(B) (“multiplied by the number of months
in such year”); 5 U. S. C. §8415(a) (“multiplied by such
individual’s total service”); 42 U. S. C. §403(f)(3) (“multi­
plied by the number of months in such year”).
Third, pre-BAPCPA case law points in favor of the
“forward-looking” approach. Prior to BAPCPA, the gen­
eral rule was that courts would multiply a debtor’s current
monthly income by the number of months in the commit­
ment period as the first step in determining projected
disposable income. See, e.g., In re Killough, 900 F. 2d 61,
62–63 (CA5 1990) (per curiam); In re Anderson, 21 F. 3d
355, 357 (CA9 1994); In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128, 1132
(CA4 1995). See 2 Lundin §164.1, at 164–1 (2000 ed.)
(“Most courts focus on the debtor’s current income and
extend current income (and expenditures) over the life of
the plan to calculate projected disposable income”). But
courts also had discretion to account for known or virtu­
ally certain changes in the debtor’s income. See Heath,
182 B. R., at 559–561; Richardson, 283 B. R., at 799; In re
James, 260 B. R. 498, 514–515 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Idaho 2001);
In re Jobe, 197 B. R. 823, 826–827 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex.
1996); In re Crompton, 73 B. R. 800, 808 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED
Pa. 1987); see also In re Schyma, 68 B. R. 52, 63 (Bkrtcy.
Ct. Minn. 1985) (“[T]he prospect of dividends . . . is not so
certain as to require Debtors or the Court to consider them
as regular or disposable income”); In re Krull, 54 B. R. 375,
378 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Colo. 1985) (“Since there are no changes
in income which can be clearly foreseen, the Court must
simply multiply the debtor’s current disposable income by
