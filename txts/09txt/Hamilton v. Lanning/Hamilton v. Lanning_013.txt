Opinion of the Court

36 in order to determine his ‘projected’ income”).4 This
judicial discretion was well documented in contemporary
bankruptcy treatises.
See 8 Collier on Bankruptcy
¶1325.08[4][a], p. 1325–50 (15th ed. rev. 2004) (hereinaf­
ter Collier) (“As a practical matter, unless there are
changes which can be clearly foreseen, the court must
simply multiply the debtor’s known monthly income by 36
and determine whether the amount to be paid under the
plan equals or exceeds that amount” (emphasis added)); 3
W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice §75.10, p. 64
(1991) (“It has been held that the court should focus upon
present monthly income and expenditures and, absent
extraordinary circumstances, project these current
amounts over the life of the plan to determine projected
disposable income” (emphasis added)); 2 Lundin §164.1, at
164–28 to 164–31 (2000 ed.) (describing how reported
decisions treated anticipated changes in income, particu­
larly where such changes were “too speculative to be pro­
jected”); see also In re Greer, 388 B. R. 889, 892 (Bkrtcy.

4 When pre-BAPCPA courts declined to make adjustments based on
possible changes in a debtor’s future income or expenses, they did so
because the changes were not sufficiently foreseeable, not because they
concluded that they lacked discretion to depart from a strictly mechani­
cal approach. In In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128 (1995), for example, the
Fourth Circuit refused to make such an adjustment because it deemed
disbursements from an individual retirement account during the plan
period to be “speculative” and “hypothetical.” Id., at 1132. There is no
reason to assume that the result would have been the same if future
disbursements had been more assured. That was certainly true of In re
Killough, 900 F. 2d 61 (1990), in which the Fifth Circuit declined to
require inclusion of overtime pay in projected disposable income be­
cause it “was not definite enough.” Id., at 65; see also id., at 66
(“[T]here may be instances where income obtained through working
overtime can and should appropriately be included in a debtor’s pro­
jected disposable income”). See also Education Assistance Corp. v.
Zellner, 827 F. 2d 1222, 1226 (CA8 1987) (affirming bankruptcy court’s
exclusion of future tax returns and salary increases from debtor’s
projected disposable income because they were “speculative”).
