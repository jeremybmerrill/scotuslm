HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

Ct. CD Ill. 2008) (“ ‘As a practical matter, unless there are
changes which can be clearly foreseen, the court must
simply multiply the debtor’s current monthly income by
thirty-six’ ” (quoting 5 Collier ¶1325.08[4][a] (15th ed. rev.
1995))); James, supra, at 514 (same) (quoting 8 Collier
¶1325.08[4][a] (15th ed. rev. 2000)); Crompton, supra, at
808 (same) (citing 5 Collier ¶1325.08[4][a], [b], at 1325–47
to 1325–48 (15th ed. 1986)).
Accord, 8 Collier
¶1325.08[4][b], at 1325–60 (15th ed. rev. 2007) (“As with
the income side of the budget, the court must simply use
the debtor’s current expenses, unless a change in them is
virtually certain” (emphasis added)). Indeed, petitioner
concedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to
BAPCPA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.
Pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice is telling because we
“ ‘will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bank­
ruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress
intended such a departure.’ ” Travelers Casualty & Surety
Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443,
454 (2007); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526,
539 (2004); Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998);
see also Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); Kelly
v. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 47 (1986). Congress did not
amend the term “projected disposable income” in 2005,
and pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely
acknowledged and well-documented view that courts may
take into account known or virtually certain changes to
debtors’ income or expenses when projecting disposable
income. In light of this historical practice, we would ex­
pect that, had Congress intended for “projected” to carry a
specialized—and indeed, unusual—meaning in Chapter
13, Congress would have said so expressly. Cf., e.g., 26
U. S. C. §279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly defining “projected
earnings” as reflecting a 3-year historical average).
