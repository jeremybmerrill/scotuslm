SCALIA, J., dissenting

once for all based on historical data, and another (the
enumerated expenses) that at least arguably depends on
estimations of the debtor’s future circumstances. The
statute thus requires the court to predict the difference
between two figures, each of which depends on the dura
tion of the commitment period, and one of which also turns
partly on facts besides historical data. In light of all this,
it seems to me not at all unusual to describe this process
as projection, not merely multiplication.

The Court’s remaining arguments about the statute’s
meaning are easily dispatched. A “mechanical” reading of
projected disposable income, it contends, renders superflu

That phrase defines the period for which a debtor’s dis
posable income must be calculated (i.e., the period over
which the projection extends), and thus the amount the
debtor must ultimately pay his unsecured creditors.
Similarly insubstantial is the Court’s claim regarding
the requirement that the plan provide that the debtor’s
projected disposable income “will be applied to make
payments”
toward
unsecured
creditors’
claims,
§1325(b)(1)(B). The Court says this requirement makes no
sense unless the debtor is actually able to pay an amount
equal to his projected disposable income. Ante, at 12. But
it makes no sense only if one assumes that the debtor is
entitled to confirmation in the first place; and that as
sumption is wrong. The requirement that the debtor pay
at least his projected disposable income is a prerequisite to
confirmation. The “will be applied” proviso does not re
quire a debtor to pay what he cannot; it simply withholds
Chapter 13 relief when he cannot pay.
The Court also argues that §1325(b)(1)’s directive to
determine projected disposable income “as of the effective
