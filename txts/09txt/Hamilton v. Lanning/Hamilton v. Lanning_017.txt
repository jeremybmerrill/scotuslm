Opinion of the Court

income or expenses.5
Petitioner faults the Tenth Circuit for referring to a
rebuttable “presumption” that the figure produced by the
mechanical approach accurately represents a debtor’s
“projected disposable income.” See 545 F. 3d, at 1278–
1279. Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference
to any such presumption but that related Code provisions
expressly create other rebuttable presumptions.
See
§707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i). He thus suggests that the
Tenth Circuit improperly supplemented the text of the
Code.
The Tenth Circuit’s analysis, however, simply heeds the
ordinary meaning of the term “projected.” As noted, a
person making a projection uses past occurrences as a
starting point, and that is precisely what the Tenth Cir­
cuit prescribed. See, e.g., Nowlin, supra, at 260, 263.
Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is
consistent with §1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to “projected
disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section
1325(b)(2)).”
This cross-reference, petitioner argues,
shows that Congress intended for the term “projected
disposable income” to incorporate, presumably in all con­
texts, the defined term “disposable income.” It is evident
that §1129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term “disposable income,” see §1325(b)(2), but that fact offers
no insight into the meaning of the word “projected”
in §§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see
how that word acquires a specialized meaning as a
result of this cross-reference—particularly where both
§§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected dis­
posable income “to be received” during the relevant period.
See supra, at 11.
——————
5 For the same reason, the phrase “[f]or purposes of this subsection”
in §1325(b)(2) is not rendered superfluous by the forward-looking
approach.
