SCALIA, J., dissenting

● A debtor unable to pursue any of these avenues to
Chapter 13 might still seek relief under Chapter 7. The
Court declares this cold comfort, noting that some debt
ors—including Lanning—will have incomes too high to
qualify for Chapter 7. Ante, at 17–18. Some such debtors,
however, may be able to show “special circumstances,”
§707(b)(2)(B), and still take advantage of Chapter 7. Aside
from noting the absence of authority on the issue, the
Court’s answer is unsatisfyingly circular: It notes that the
special-circumstances exception is available only if the
debtor has “no reasonable alternative,” §707(b)(2)(B)(i),
which will not be true after today given the Court’s hold
ing that bankruptcy courts can consider changes in a
debtor’s income. As for those who cannot establish special
circumstances, it is hard to understand why there is cause
for concern. Congress has evidently concluded that such
debtors do not need the last-ditch relief of liquidation, and
that they are not suitable candidates for repaying their
debts (at least in part) under Chapter 13’s protective
umbrella. We have neither reason nor warrant to second
guess either determination.

Underlying the Court’s interpretation is an understand
able urge: Sometimes the best reading of a text yields
results that one thinks must be a mistake, and bending
that reading just a little bit will allow all the pieces to fit
together. But taking liberties with text in light of outcome
makes sense only if we assume that we know better than
Congress which outcomes are mistaken. And by refusing
to hold that Congress meant what it said, but see Con
necticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253–254
(1992), we deprive it of the ability to say what it means in
the future.
It may be that no interpretation of
§1325(b)(1)(B) is entirely satisfying. But it is in the hard
cases, even more than the easy ones, that we should faith
