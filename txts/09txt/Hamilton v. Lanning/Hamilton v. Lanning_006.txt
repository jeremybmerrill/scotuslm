HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

We granted certiorari to decide how a bankruptcy court
should calculate a debtor’s “projected disposable income.”
Some lower courts have taken what the parties term the
“mechanical approach,” while most have adopted what has
been called the “forward-looking approach.” We hold that
the “forward-looking approach” is correct.
I
As previously noted, §1325 provides that if a trustee or
an unsecured creditor objects to a Chapter 13 debtor’s
plan, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless
it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or
“provides that all of the debtor’s projected disposable
income to be received” over the duration of the plan “will
be applied to make payments” in accordance with the
terms of the plan. 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(1); see also
§1325(b)(1) (2000 ed.). Before the enactment of the Bank­
ruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of
2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code)
loosely defined “disposable income” as “income which is
received by the debtor and which is not reasonably neces­
sary to be expended” for the “maintenance or support of
the debtor,” for qualifying charitable contributions, or for
business expenditures. §1325(b)(2)(A), (B).
The Code did not define the term “projected disposable
income,” and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a
mechanical approach in calculating projected disposable
income. That is, they first multiplied monthly income by
the number of months in the plan and then determined
what portion of the result was “excess” or “disposable.”
See 2 K. Lundin, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy §164.1, p. 164–1,
and n. 4 (3d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Lundin (2000 ed.))
(citing cases).
In exceptional cases, however, bankruptcy courts took
into account foreseeable changes in a debtor’s income or
expenses.
