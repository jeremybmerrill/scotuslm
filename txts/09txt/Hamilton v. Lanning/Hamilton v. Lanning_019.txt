Opinion of the Court

possibly make the payments that the mechanical approach
prescribes.
In order to avoid or at least to mitigate the harsh results
that the mechanical approach may produce for debtors,
petitioner advances several possible escape strategies. He
proposes no comparable strategies for creditors harmed by
the mechanical approach, and in any event none of the
maneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.

Petitioner first suggests that a debtor may delay filing a
petition so as to place any extraordinary income outside
the 6-month look-back period. We see at least two prob­
lems with this proposal.
First, delay is often not a viable option for a debtor
sliding into bankruptcy.
“Potential Chapter 13 debtors typically find a law­
yer’s office when they are one step from financial
Armageddon: There is a foreclosure sale of the
debtor’s home the next day; the debtor’s only car
was mysteriously repossessed in the dark of last
night; a garnishment has reduced the debtor’s
take-home pay below the ordinary requirements
of food and rent.
Instantaneous relief is expected, if not necessary.” K. Lundin & W. Brown,
Chapter 13 Bankruptcy §3.1[2] (4th ed. rev.2009),

See also id., §38.1 (“Debtor’s counsel often has little discre­
tion when to file the Chapter 13 case”).
Second, even when a debtor is able to delay filing a
petition, such delay could be risky if it gives the appear­
ance of bad faith. See 11 U. S. C. §1325(a)(7) (requiring,
as a condition of confirmation, that “the action of the
debtor in filing the petition was in good faith”); see also,
