HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

fies as examples of “special circumstances” a “serious
medical condition or a call or order to active duty in the
Armed Forces,” ibid., and petitioner directs us to no au­
thority for the proposition that a prepetition decline in
income would qualify as a “special circumstance.” In any
event, the “special circumstances” exception is available
only to the extent that “there is no reasonable alternative,”
ibid., a proposition we reject with our interpretation of
§1325(b)(1) today.8
In sum, each of the strategies that petitioner identifies
for mitigating the anomalous effects of the mechanical
approach is flawed. There is no reason to think that Con­
gress meant for any of these strategies to operate as a
safety valve for the mechanical approach.
IV
We find petitioner’s remaining arguments unpersuasive.
Consistent with the text of §1325 and pre-BAPCPA prac­
tice, we hold that when a bankruptcy court calculates a
debtor’s projected disposable income, the court may ac­
count for changes in the debtor’s income or expenses that
are known or virtually certain at the time of confirmation.
We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.
It is so ordered.

8 Petitioner also suggests that some Chapter 13 debtors may be able
to plead “special circumstances” on the expense side of the calculation
by virtue of BAPCPA’s incorporation of the Chapter 7 means test into
Chapter 13. See §707(b)(2)(B)(i), (ii). This is no help to debtors like
respondent, whose income has changed but whose expenses are con­
stant.
