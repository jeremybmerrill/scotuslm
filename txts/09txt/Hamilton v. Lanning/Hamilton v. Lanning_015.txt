Opinion of the Court

B
The mechanical approach also clashes repeatedly with
the terms of 11 U. S. C. §1325.
First, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s reference to projected disposable
income “to be received in the applicable commitment
period” strongly favors the forward-looking approach.
There is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive
far less than $756 per month in disposable income during
the plan period, so petitioner’s projection does not accu­
rately reflect “income to be received” during that period.
See In re Nowlin, 576 F. 3d 258, 263 (CA5 2009). The
mechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of
the statute when a debtor’s current disposable income is
substantially higher than the income that the debtor
predictably will receive during the plan period. See
Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998) (“[W]e are
hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional
enactment which renders superfluous another portion of
that same law” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Second, §1325(b)(1) directs courts to determine projected
disposable income “as of the effective date of the plan,”
which is the date on which the plan is confirmed and
becomes binding, see §1327(a). Had Congress intended for
projected disposable income to be nothing more than a
multiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no rea­
son why Congress would not have required courts to de­
termine that value as of the filing date of the plan. See
Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring that a plan be
filed within 14 days of the filing of a petition), online at

rials as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of
Court’s case file). In the very next section of the Code, for
example, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence
payments “not later than 30 days after the date of the
filing of the plan.” §1326(a)(1) (emphasis added). Con­
