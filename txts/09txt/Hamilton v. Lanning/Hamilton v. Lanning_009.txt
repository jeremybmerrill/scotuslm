Opinion of the Court

this mechanical approach, petitioner calculated that credi­
tors would be paid in full if respondent made monthly
payments of $756 for a period of 60 months. Id., at 108.
There is no dispute that respondent’s actual income was
insufficient to make payments in that amount. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 3–4.
B
The Bankruptcy Court endorsed respondent’s proposed
monthly payment of $144 but required a 60-month plan
period. No. 06–41037 etc., 2007 WL 1451999, *8 (Bkrtcy.
Ct. Kan. 2007). The court agreed with the majority view
that the word “projected” in §1325(b)(1)(B) requires courts
“to consider at confirmation the debtor’s actual income as
it was reported on Schedule I.” Id., at *5 (emphasis
added). This conclusion was warranted by the text of
§1325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was
necessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bank­
ruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating fi­
nances in the six months before filing. Ibid.
Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy
Appellate Panel, which affirmed. 380 B. R. 17, 19 (2007).
The Panel noted that, although Congress redefined “dis­
posable income” in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre­
existing term “projected disposable income.” Id., at 24.
Thus, the Panel concluded, there was no reason to believe
that Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice
under which bankruptcy courts determined projected
disposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but
considered other evidence when there was reason to be­
lieve that the schedules did not reflect a debtor’s actual
ability to pay. Ibid.
The Tenth Circuit affirmed. 545 F. 3d 1269, 1270
(2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in calcu­
lating “projected disposable income,” should begin with the
“presumption” that the figure yielded by the mechanical
