Opinion of the Court

past sales are “not necessarily the number of sales” that
will be made in the future). On the night of an election,
experts do not “project” the percentage of the votes that a
candidate will receive by simply assuming that the candi­
date will get the same percentage as he or she won in the
first few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not
project that a team’s winning percentage at the end of a
new season will be the same as the team’s winning per­
centage last year or the team’s winning percentage at the
end of the first month of competition. While a projection
takes past events into account, adjustments are often
made based on other factors that may affect the final
outcome. See In re Kibbe, 361 B. R. 302, 312, n. 9 (Bkrtcy.
App. Panel CA1 2007) (contrasting “multiplied,” which
“requires only mathematical acumen,” with “projected,”
which requires “mathematic acumen adjusted by delibera­
tion and discretion”).
Second, the word “projected” appears in many federal
statutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple
multiplication. For example, the Agricultural Adjustment
Act of 1938 defined “projected national yield,” “projected
county yield,” and “projected farm yield” as entailing
historical averages “adjusted for abnormal weather condi­
tions,” “trends in yields,” and “any significant changes in
production practices.” 7 U. S. C. §1301(b)(8)(B), (13)(J),
(K).3

also, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1364(a), (c)(2) (requiring the triennial im­
migration-impact report to include information “projected for the
succeeding five-year period, based on reasonable estimates substanti­
ated by the best available evidence”); 10 U. S. C. A. §2433a(a)(2)(B)
(2010 Cum. Supp.) (“projected cost of completing the [defense acquisi­
tion] program based on reasonable modification of [current] require­
ments”); 15 U. S. C. §719c(c)(2) (2006 ed.) (“projected natural gas supply
and demand”); 25 U. S. C. §2009(c)(1), (2) (requiring the Director of the
Office of Indian Education Programs to submit an annual report
containing certain projections and “a description of the methods and
formulas used to calculate the amounts projected”).
