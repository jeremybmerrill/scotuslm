HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

Petitioner also notes that §707 allows courts to take
“special circumstances” into consideration, but that
§1325(b)(3) incorporates §707 only with respect to calcu­
lating expenses. See In re Wilson, 397 B. R. 299, 314–315
(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a “special
circumstances” exception should not be inferred with
respect to the debtor’s income. We decline to infer from
§1325’s incorporation of §707 that Congress intended to
eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that courts previ­
ously exercised when projecting disposable income to
account for known or virtually certain changes. Accord,
In re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 613, and n. 15 (Bkrtcy. Ct.
NJ 2008).

In cases in which a debtor’s disposable income during
the 6-month look-back period is either substantially lower
or higher than the debtor’s disposable income during the
plan period, the mechanical approach would produce
senseless results that we do not think Congress intended.
In cases in which the debtor’s disposable income is higher
during the plan period, the mechanical approach would
deny creditors payments that the debtor could easily
make. And where, as in the present case, the debtor’s
disposable income during the plan period is substantially
lower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection
of Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter’s main
eligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is
an “individual whose income is sufficiently stable and
regular” to allow her “to make payments under a plan,”
§101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in
§109(e). But if the mechanical approach were used, she
could not file a confirmable plan. Under §1325(a)(6), a
plan cannot be confirmed unless “the debtor will be able to
make all payments under the plan and comply with the
plan.” And as petitioner concedes, respondent could not
