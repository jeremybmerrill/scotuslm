HAMILTON v. LANNING
SCALIA, J., dissenting

payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.”
§1325(b)(1)(B). The Code does not define “projected dis
posable income,” but it does define “disposable income.”
The next paragraph of §1325(b) provides that “[f]or pur
poses of this subsection, the term ‘disposable income’
means current monthly income received by the debtor,”
excluding certain payments received for child support,
“less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” on
three categories of expenses. §1325(b)(2). The Code in
turn defines “current monthly income” as “the average
monthly income from all sources that the debtor re
ceives . . . derived during the 6-month period ending on”
one of two dates.1 §101(10A)(A). Whichever date applies,
a debtor’s “current monthly income,” and thus the income
component of his “disposable income,” is a sum certain, a
rate fixed once for all based on historical figures.
This definition of “disposable income” applies to the use
of that term in the longer phrase “projected disposable
income” in §1325(b)(1)(B), since the definition says that it
applies to subsection (b). Cf. §1129(a)(15)(B) (referring to
“the projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined
in section 1325(b)(2))”). The puzzle is what to make of the
word “projected.”
In the Court’s view, this modifier makes all the differ
ence. Projections, it explains, ordinarily account for later
developments, not just past data. Ante, at 6–7. Thus, the
Court concludes, in determining “projected disposable
income” a bankruptcy court may depart from §1325(b)(2)’s
——————

the debtor files a schedule of current income, as ordinarily re
quired by §521(a)(1)(B)(ii), then the 6-month period ends on the last
day of the month preceding the date the case is commenced,
§101(10A)(A)(i)—that is, when the petition is filed, §§301(a), 302(a),
303(b). If the debtor does not file such a schedule on time—which the
bankruptcy court apparently may excuse him from doing,
§521(a)(1)(B)(ii)—the 6-month period ends on the date the bankruptcy
court determines the debtor’s current income. §101(10A)(A)(ii).
