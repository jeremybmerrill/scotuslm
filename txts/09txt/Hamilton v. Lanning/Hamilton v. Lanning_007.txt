Opinion of the Court

(Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA9 1995); In re Richardson, 283
B. R. 783, 799 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 2002); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.
Accord, 1 Lundin §35.10, at 35–14 (2000 ed.) (“The debtor
should take some care to project estimated future income
on Schedule I to include anticipated increases or decreases
[in income] so that the schedule will be consistent with
any evidence of income the debtor would offer at a con­
tested confirmation hearing”).
BAPCPA left the term “projected disposable income”
undefined but specified in some detail how “disposable
income” is to be calculated. “Disposable income” is now
defined as “current monthly income received by the
debtor” less “amounts reasonably necessary to be ex­
pended” for the debtor’s maintenance and support, for
qualifying charitable contributions, and for business ex­
penditures. §1325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) (2006 ed.). “Current
monthly income,” in turn, is calculated by averaging the
debtor’s monthly income during what the parties refer to
as the 6-month look-back period, which generally consists
of the six full months preceding the filing of the bank­

“amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” in
§1325(b)(2) is also newly defined. For a debtor whose
income is below the median for his or her State, the
phrase includes the full amount needed for “maintenance
or support,” see §1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but for a debtor with
income that exceeds the state median, only certain speci­
fied expenses are included,2 see §§707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).

1 However,

if a debtor does not file the required schedule (Schedule I),
the bankruptcy court may select a different 6-month period. See
§101(10A)(A)(ii).
2 The formula for above-median-income debtors is known as the
“means test” and is reflected in a schedule (Form 22C) that a Chapter
13 debtor must file. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 22C
(2009); In re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 606, n. 1, 608–609 (Bkrtcy. Ct.
NJ 2008).
