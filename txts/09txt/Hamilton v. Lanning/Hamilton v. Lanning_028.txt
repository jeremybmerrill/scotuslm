HAMILTON v. LANNING
SCALIA, J., dissenting

same thing. But if forced to choose between (A) assuming
Congress enacted text that serves no purpose at all, (B)
ascribing an unheard-of meaning to the word “projected”
(loaded with made-to-order restrictions) simply to avoid
undesirable results, or (C) assuming Congress employed
synonyms to express a single idea, the last is obviously the
least evil.
In any event, we are not put to that choice here. While
under my reading a court must determine the income half
of the “projected disposable income” equation by multiply
ing a fixed number, that is not necessarily true of the
expenses excludable under §1325(b)(2)(A) and (B). Unlike
the debtor’s current monthly income, none of the three
types of expenses—payments for the support of the debtor
and his dependents, charitable contributions, and ex
penses to keep an existing business above water—is ex
plicitly defined in terms of historical figures (at least for
debtors with incomes below the state median). The first of
those cannot possibly (in many cases) be determined based
on the same 6-month period from which current monthly
income is derived,3 and the texts of the other two are
consistent with determining expenses based on expecta
tions. See §1325(b)(2)(A)(ii) (charitable expenses to quali
fied entities limited to “15 percent of gross income of the
debtor for the year in which the contributions are made”);
§1325(b)(2)(B) (“expenditures necessary for the continua
tion, preservation, and operation” of a business in which
the debtor is engaged).
In short, a debtor’s projected disposable income consists
of two parts: one (current monthly income) that is fixed
——————
3 For a debtor whose income is below the state median, excludable
expenses include domestic-support obligations “that first becom[e]
payable after the date the petition is filed,” §1325(b)(2)(A)(i)—that is,
after the six-month window relevant to the debtor’s current monthly
income has closed (unless the debtor does not file a current-income
schedule), see §101(10A)(A)(i).
