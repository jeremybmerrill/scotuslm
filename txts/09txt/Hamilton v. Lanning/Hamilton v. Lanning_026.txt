HAMILTON v. LANNING
SCALIA, J., dissenting

rewriting the statute.
B
The only reasonable reading that avoids deleting words
Congress enacted, or adding others it did not, is this:
Setting aside expenses excludable under §1325(b)(2)(A)
and (B), which are not at issue here, a court must calcu
late the debtor’s “projected disposable income” by multi
plying his current monthly income by the number of
months in the “applicable commitment period.” The word
“projected” in this context, I agree, most sensibly refers to
a calculation, prediction, or estimation of future events,
see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12–13 (col
lecting dictionary definitions); see also Webster’s New
International Dictionary 1978 (2d ed. 1957). But one
assuredly can calculate, predict, or estimate future figures
based on the past. And here Congress has commanded
that a specific historical figure shall be the basis for the
projection.
The Court rejects this reading as unrealistic. A projec
tion, the Court explains, may be based in part on past
data, but “adjustments are often made based on other
factors that may affect the final outcome.” Ante, at 7.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No
gambler would bet the farm using “project[ions]” that are
based only on a football team’s play before its star quar
terback was injured. And no pundit would keep his post if
he “projected” election results relying only on prior cycles,
ignoring recent polls. So too, the Court appears to reason,
it makes no sense to say a court “project[s]” a debtor’s
“disposable income” when it considers only what he earned
in a specific 6-month period in the past. Ante, at 6–7.
Such analogies do not establish that carrying current
monthly income forward to determine a debtor’s future
ability to pay is not a “projection.” They show only that
relying exclusively on past data for the projection may be a
