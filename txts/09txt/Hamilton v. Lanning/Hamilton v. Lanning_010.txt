HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

approach is correct, but the Court concluded that this
figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change
in the debtor’s circumstances. Id., at 1278–1279.
This petition followed, and we granted certiorari. 558
U. S. ___ (2009).

A

The parties differ sharply in their interpretation of
§1325’s reference to “projected disposable income.” Peti­
tioner, advocating the mechanical approach, contends that
“projected disposable income” means past average monthly
disposable income multiplied by the number of months in
a debtor’s plan. Respondent, who favors the forward­
looking approach, agrees that the method outlined by
petitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she
argues that in exceptional cases, where significant
changes in a debtor’s financial circumstances are known or
virtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to
make an appropriate adjustment. Respondent has the
stronger argument.
First, respondent’s argument is supported by the ordi­
nary meaning of the term “projected.” “When terms used
in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary
meaning.” Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179,
187 (1995). Here, the term “projected” is not defined, and
in ordinary usage future occurrences are not “projected”
based on the assumption that the past will necessarily
repeat itself. For example, projections concerning a com­
pany’s future sales or the future cash flow from a license
take into account anticipated events that may change past
trends. See, e.g., Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights,
Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 316 (2007) (describing adjustments to
“projected sales” in light of falling demand); Innovair
Aviation, Ltd. v. United States, 83 Fed. Cl. 498, 502, 504–
506 (2008) (calculating projected cash flow and noting that
