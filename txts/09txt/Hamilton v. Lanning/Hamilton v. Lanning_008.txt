HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

II 

A

Respondent had $36,793.36 in unsecured debt when she
filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October
2006. In the six months before her filing, she received a
one-time buyout from her former employer, and this pay­
ment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to
$11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84,
107. As a result of these payments, respondent’s current
monthly income, as averaged from April through October
2006, was $5,343.70—a figure that exceeds the median
income for a family of one in Kansas. See id., at 78. Re­
spondent’s monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to
§707(b)(2), were $4,228.71. Id., at 83. She reported a
monthly “disposable income” of $1,114.98 on Form 22C.
Ibid.
On the form used for reporting monthly income (Sched­
ule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per
month—which is below the state median. Id., at 66; see
also id., at 78. On the form used for reporting monthly
expenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly ex­
penses of $1,772.97. Id., at 68. Subtracting the Schedule
J figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly
disposable income of $149.03.
Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to
pay $144 per month for 36 months. See id., at 93. Peti­
tioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirma­
tion of the plan because the amount respondent proposed
to pay was less than the full amount of the claims against
her, see §1325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner’s view,
respondent was not committing all of her “projected dis­
posable income” to the repayment of creditors, see
§1325(b)(1)(B). According to petitioner, the proper way to
calculate projected disposable income was simply to mul­
tiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the
number of months in the commitment period. Employing
