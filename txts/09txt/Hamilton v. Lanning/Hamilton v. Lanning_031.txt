SCALIA, J., dissenting

(1990), but renders it suspect.
II
Unable to assemble a compelling case based on what the
statute says, the Court falls back on the “senseless re
sults” it would produce—results the Court “do[es] not
think Congress intended.” Ante, at 14. Even if it were
true that a “mechanical” reading resulted in undesirable
outcomes, that would make no difference. Lewis v. Chi
cago, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11). For even
assuming (though I do not believe it) that we could know
which results Congress thought it was achieving (or avoid
ing) apart from the only congressional expression of its
thoughts, the text, those results would be entirely irrele
vant to what the statute means.
In any event, the effects the Court fears are neither as
inevitable nor as “senseless” as the Court portrays. The
Court’s first concern is that if actual or anticipated
changes in the debtor’s earnings are ignored, then a debtor
whose income increases after the critical 6-month window
will not be required to pay all he can afford. Ante, at 14.
But as Lanning points out, Brief for Respondent 22–23,
Chapter 13 authorizes the Bankruptcy Court, at the re
quest of unsecured creditors, to modify the plan “[a]t any
time after confirmation” to “increase . . . the amount of
payments” on a class of claims or “reduce the time for such
payments.” §1329(a)(1)–(2) (2006 ed.). The Court offers
no explanation of why modification would not be available
in such instances, and sufficient to resolve the concern.
The Court also cringes at the prospect that a debtor
whose income suddenly declines after the 6-month window
or who, as in this case, receives a one-off windfall during
that window, will be barred from Chapter 13 relief be
cause he will be unable to devote his “disposable income”
(which turns on his prior earnings) to paying his unse
cured creditors going forward. Ante, at 14–15. At least for
