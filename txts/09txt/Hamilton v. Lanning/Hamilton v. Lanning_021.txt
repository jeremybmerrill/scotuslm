Opinion of the Court

the look-back period, see supra, at 16, and n. 6, and should
give debtors pause.7 Cf. In re Glenn, 288 B. R. 516, 520
(Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 2002) (noting that courts should
consider, among other factors, “whether this is the first or

Petitioner argues that respondent might have been able
to obtain relief by filing under Chapter 7 or by converting
her Chapter 13 petition to one under Chapter 7. The
availability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who
have above-median incomes is limited. In respondent’s
case, a presumption of abuse would attach under
§707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, “multiplied
by 60,” exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and
(II). See also §707(b)(1) (allowing a court to dismiss a
petition filed by a debtor “whose debts are primarily con­
sumer debts . . . if it finds that the granting of relief would
be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter”); App. 86–88
(“Notice to Individual Consumer Debtor under §342(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code”) (“If your income is greater than the
median income for your state of residence and family size,
in some cases, creditors have the right to file a motion
requesting that the court dismiss your case under §707(b)
of the Code”). Nevertheless, petitioner argues, respondent
might have been able to overcome this presumption by
claiming that her case involves “special circumstances”
within the meaning of §707(b)(2)(B)(i). Section 707 identi­

may become ineligible if “at any time in the preceding 180 days” “the
case was dismissed by the court for willful failure of the debtor to abide
by orders of the court, or to appear before the court in proper prosecu­
tion of the case,” or “the debtor requested and obtained the voluntary
dismissal of the case following the filing of a request for relief from the
automatic stay provided by section 362 of this title.” §109(g).
