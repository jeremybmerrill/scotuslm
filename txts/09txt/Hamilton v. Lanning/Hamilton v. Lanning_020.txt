HAMILTON v. LANNING
Opinion of the Court

e.g., In re Myers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007) (citing
“ ‘the timing of the petition’ ” as a factor to be considered in
assessing a debtor’s compliance with the good-faith re­
quirement). Accord, Neufeld v. Freeman, 794 F. 2d 149,
153 (CA4 1986) (a debtor’s prepetition conduct may inform
the court’s good-faith inquiry).

Petitioner next argues that a debtor with unusually
high income during the 6 months prior to the filing of a
petition, could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of
current income (Schedule I) and then ask the bankruptcy
court to exercise its authority under §101(10A)(A)(ii) to
select a 6-month period that is more representative of the
debtor’s future disposable income. We see little merit in
this convoluted strategy. If the Code required the use of
the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would
improperly undermine what the Code demands. And if, as
we believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence
to the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is
not needed. In any event, even if this strategy were al­
lowed, it would not help all debtors whose disposable
income during the plan period is sharply lower than their
previous disposable income.6

Petitioner suggests that a debtor can dismiss the peti­
tion and refile at a later, more favorable date. But peti­
tioner offers only the tepid assurance that courts “gener­
ally” do not find this practice to be abusive. Brief for
Petitioner 53. This questionable stratagem plainly cir­
cumvents the statutory limits on a court’s ability to shift
——————
6 Under

11 U. S. C. §521(i)(3), a debtor seeking additional time to file
a schedule of income must submit the request within 45 days after
filing the petition, and the court may not grant an extension of more
than 45 days.
