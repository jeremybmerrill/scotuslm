HAMILTON v. LANNING
SCALIA, J., dissenting

date of the plan” makes no sense if mere multiplication of
existing numbers is required. Ante, at 11–12. As I have
explained, however, “projected disposable income” may in
some cases require more than multiplication (as to ex
penses), and the estimations involved may vary from the
date of the plan’s filing until the date it takes effect.
Moreover, the provision also applies to the alternative
avenue to confirmation in §1325(b)(1)(A), which requires
that “the value of the property to be distributed under the
plan” to an unsecured creditor equals or exceeds the credi
tor’s claim. As to that requirement, the effective-date
requirement makes perfect sense.
Text aside, the Court also observes that Circuit practice
prior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, aligns
with the atextual approach the Court adopts today. Ante,
at 8–10. That is unsurprising, since the prior version of
the relevant provisions was completely consistent with
that approach. The Court is correct that BAPCPA “did not
amend the term ‘projected disposable income,’ ” ante, at 10.
But it did amend the definition of that term. Before 2005,
§1325(b)(2) defined “disposable income” simply as “income
which is received by the debtor and which is not reasona
bly necessary to be expended” on the same basic types of
expenses excluded by the current statute. §1325(b)(2)
(2000 ed.). Nothing in that terse definition compelled a
court to rely exclusively on past data, let alone a specific 6
month period. But in BAPCPA—the same Act in which
Congress defined “current monthly income” in
§101(10A)(A)—Congress redefined “disposable income” in
§1325(b)(2) to incorporate that backward-looking defini
tion. See Pub. L. 109–8, §102(b), (h), 119 Stat. 32–34.
Given these significant changes, the fact that the Court’s
approach conforms with pre-BAPCPA practice not only
does not recommend it, see e.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of
Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 563–564
