NORIEGA v. PASTRANA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

POW status entitled him to the Conventions’ protection
until his “ final release and repatriation,” but dismissed
his §2255 petition on the ground that his extradition
challenge was not directed to “any defect in [his] sen
tence,” and thus was not cognizable under §2255. Id., at
*1 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Noriega then filed the same claims under 28 U. S. C.
§2241, and the District Court ultimately3 stayed his ex
tradition pending appeal on the ground that his challenge
rested on “credible arguments . . ., particularly with re
gard to the interpretation of certain provisions of the
Geneva Convention[s],” on which “no other federal court
has ruled.” No. 07−CV−22816−PCH, 2008 WL 331394, *3
(SD Fla., Jan. 31, 2008).
On appeal, Noriega argued that his extradition to
France would violate several provisions of the Third Con
vention and that the District Court erred in concluding
otherwise. In response, the Government asserted that the
court lacked jurisdiction over Noriega’s claims because
§5(a) of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA)
establishes that “[t]he Geneva Conventions are not self
executing” or judicially enforceable in habeas corpus ac
tions. Brief for United States in No. 08–11021–F (CA11),
p. 13 (hereinafter Brief for United States).4 MCA §5(a)
provides:

3 The

District Court dismissed Noriega’s initial §2241 petition be
cause the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the
petition’s extradition challenge in Noriega’s criminal case as opposed to
a separate action challenging his certificate of extraditability. See
United States v. Noriega, No. 88−0079−CR, 2007 WL 2947981, *1 (SD
Fla., Sept. 7, 2007) (dismissing the petition without prejudice but
reiterating the merits concerns with Noriega’s Geneva Convention
claims that the court articulated in dicta in dismissing his §2255
petition).
4 The Government also challenged Noriega’s claims as meritless and
outside the scope of habeas review under Circuit precedent.
