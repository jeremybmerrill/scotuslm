THOMAS, J., dissenting

corpus under our precedents permits Noriega to argue
that the manner in which MCA §5(a) affects §2241 pro
ceedings implicates the Suspension Clause. Only we can
determine whether the Eleventh Circuit correctly rejected
that argument.
The Suspension Clause provides that “[t]he Privilege of
the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless
when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety
may require it.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 2. Because the
Clause addresses only the suspension—not the content or
existence—of the “Privilege of the Writ,” ibid., we have
long recognized the “obligation” the first Congress “must
have felt” to “provid[e] efficient means by which this great
constitutional privilege should receive life and activity.”
Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 95 (1807). But we have
also steadfastly declined to adopt a date of reference by
which the writ’s constitutional content, if any, is to be
judged, see Boumediene, supra, ___ (slip op. at 15−17), and
thus have left open the question whether statutory efforts
to limit §2241 implicate the Suspension Clause, see, e.g.,
INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 300–301 (2001). This ques
tion, which has already divided the Court in other con
texts, see ibid.,8 is clearly presented here. Noriega asserts

St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 300–301 (2001) (declining to identify
a specific date of reference for judging the constitutional scope of the
writ, but concluding that the Court nonetheless should construe the
Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996
(IIRIRA) to allow §2241 jurisdiction over certain habeas petitions
because doing so would avoid the Suspension Clause question that
otherwise would arise), with id., at 335–341 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)
(emphasizing that, although IIRIRA displaces §2241 jurisdiction
unambiguously and thus renders the canon of constitutional avoidance
inapplicable, there is no constitutional question to avoid, because the
Suspension Clause is addressed only to suspension (i.e., temporary
withholding of the operation) of the writ on the terms authorized by the
habeas corpus statute, not to Congress’ power to alter the substance of
the habeas rights the statute confers) and id., at 340−341, n. 5 (“If, as
