THOMAS, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA v. GEORGE

PASTRANA, WARDEN

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 09–35. Decided January 25, 2010 


The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.

case.

Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12,

would violate the Convention.” Brief in Opposition i (some
