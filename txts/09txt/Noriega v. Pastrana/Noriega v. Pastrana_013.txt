THOMAS, J., dissenting

that would further clarify the extent to which detainees
can enforce Geneva Convention obligations against the
United States in federal courts, but progress on these
proposals has been complicated by uncertainty over the
statutory and constitutional questions in this case.11
As noted, addressing these questions now,12 if only the
statutory issues, would avoid years of litigation and uncer
tainty no matter what we conclude on the merits. A deci
sion upholding MCA §5(a) would obviate the need for
detainees, the Government, and federal courts to struggle

12 Because the D. C. Circuit’s majority opinion in Kiyemba I does not
address MCA §5(a), the provision’s validity is not squarely presented in
that case. See Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F. 3d 1022 (CADC 2009) (Ki­
yemba I), cert. granted, ante, p. ___ (2009). And granting review of the
D. C. Circuit’s decision in Al-Bihani, which does address MCA §5(a),
would not guarantee a decision on the statute’s validity. See Al-Bihani
v. Obama, No. 09−5051, 2010 WL 10411 (CADC 2010). Al-Bihani
addresses MCA §5(a) in rejecting only one of many claims for habeas
corpus relief, so it is not clear that the Court would need to address the
statute’s validity in deciding the case. And even if the Court were to
address §5(a), the decision would come next Term, thus providing no
guidance to courts that must adjudicate pending habeas corpus actions
this spring and summer. In contrast, addressing MCA §5(a)’s validity
in this case would timely provide such guidance. Doing so could also
aid our disposition of Kiyemba I because answering the questions
presented here could clarify the constitutional scope of the writ of
habeas corpus in a manner that could affect the Kiyemba I petitioners’
argument about the inherent remedial power of habeas corpus courts.
