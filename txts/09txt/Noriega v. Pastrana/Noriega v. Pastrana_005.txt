THOMAS, J., dissenting

“No person may invoke the Geneva Conventions or
any protocols thereto in any habeas corpus or other
civil action or proceeding to which the United States,
or a current or former officer, employee, member of
the Armed Forces, or other agent of the United States
is a party as a source of rights in any court of the
United States or its States or territories. 120 Stat.
2631, note following 28 U. S. C. §2241.”5
Emphasizing that a non-self-executing treaty “ ‘addresses
itself to the political, not the judicial department,’ ” the
Government observed that “no court of appeals has held
that the provisions of the Geneva Conventions are judi
cially enforceable in any context.” Brief for United States
13 (quoting Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 516 (2008)).
The Government then argued that “confirmation of this
[view] can be found in the enactment of [MCA §5(a)],
which “codifie[d] the principle that the Geneva Conven
tions [a]re not judicially enforceable by private parties,”
but did so in a narrow way that does not purport to strip
courts of habeas jurisdiction, and thus does “not implicate”
the Suspension Clause analysis in Boumediene. Brief for
United States 14, n. 6.6

5 Recent amendments to the Military Commissions Act of 2006, collec
tively titled the Military Commissions Act of 2009, see National De
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, see §§1801–1807, 123
Stat. 2574–2614, do not affect MCA §5(a). The 2009 amendments
principally update provisions relevant to the Guantanamo habeas
corpus cases pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia and clarify the due process protections available in those and
other noncitizen detainee cases to which the constitutional and treaty
issues in this case relate. See ibid.; see also J. Elsea, CRS Report for
Congress, Comparison of Rights in Military Commission Trials and
Trials in Federal Criminal Court, 2–4 (Nov. 19, 2009).
6 Although the Government distinguishes MCA §5(a) from the juris
diction-stripping provision the Court invalidated in Boumediene, it
stops short of asserting that §5(a) is constitutional. See Brief in Oppo
sition 8, n.
