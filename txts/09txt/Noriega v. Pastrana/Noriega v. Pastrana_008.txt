NORIEGA v. PASTRANA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

the law is to destroy the writ”).
II
As the Eleventh Circuit’s opinion makes clear, the
threshold question in this case is whether MCA §5(a) is
valid. Answering that question this Term would provide
courts and the political branches with much needed guid
ance on issues we left open in Boumediene. See Boumedi­
ene, 553 U. S, at ___, ___ (slip op. at 64−66, 68−70). Pro
viding that guidance in this case would allow us to say
what the law is without the unnecessary delay and other
complications that could burden a decision on these ques
tions in Guantanamo or other detainee litigation arising
out of the conflict with Al Qaeda.
Boumediene invalidated MCA §7’s attempt to strip
federal courts of habeas jurisdiction over claims by a
specified class of non-citizen detainees (“unlawful enemy
combatants”), but did not determine the “content of the
law that governs petitioners’ detention,” id., at ___ (slip
op. at 69), or the extent to which §2241’s substantive
provisions affect the constitutional “procedural protections
of habeas corpus,” id., at ___ (slip op. at 70). Section 2241
broadly confers jurisdiction over a habeas corpus action by
any person who claims to be held “in custody in violation
of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United
States.” See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 473 (2004).
MCA §5(a) eliminates the Geneva Conventions as a source
of rights upon which §2241 petitioners may rely in chal
lenging their detentions. Statutory amendments to an
existing law ordinarily involve nothing more than a valid
exercise of Congress’ Article I authority. See, e.g., Chew
Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 562–563 (1884).
Noriega asserts that the difference in this case is that the
statutory amendment narrows the scope of §2241. Assum
ing that is correct, the indeterminate interplay between
the constitutional and statutory guarantees of habeas
