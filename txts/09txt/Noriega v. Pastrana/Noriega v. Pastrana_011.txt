THOMAS, J., dissenting

Manual and the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the
Treatment of Prisoners of War.” Al Rabiah v. United
States, Civ. Action No. 02−828, Unclassified Mem. Op. (DC
Sept. 17, 2009), pp. 1–2, 43.
Several recent D. C. Circuit decisions, one of which is
now pending before us, similarly implicate the importance
of the Geneva Convention and MCA §5(a) questions in this
case. In Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F. 3d 1022 (2009) (Ki­
yemba I), cert. granted, ante, p. ___, the petitioners, Guan
tanamo detainees who prevailed on their habeas corpus
claims in federal court but cannot return to their home
country, rely on the Geneva Conventions in claiming a
right to be released in the territorial United States, see
Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–1234, pp. i, 34. Although the D. C.
Circuit did not address MCA §5(a) in rejecting this claim,
the Government contends before this Court that MCA
§5(a) bars petitioners’ reliance on the Conventions, see
Brief in Opposition in No. 08-1234, pp. 23–24, and Judge
Rogers’ opinion concurring in the D. C. Circuit’s judgment
relies upon the same repatriation language in Article 118
of the Third Convention that Noriega raises here, see 555
F. 3d, at 1033, n. 2. In Al-Bihani, supra, the D. C. Circuit
directly invokes MCA §5(a) in rejecting a Guantanamo
detainee’s claim that he was entitled to habeas corpus
relief because his detention violated, inter alia, the Third
Geneva Convention, see id., at *2–3; *6 (stating that MCA
§5(a), “a provision not altered by the MCA of 2009, explic
itly precludes detainees from claiming the Geneva Con
ventions—which include criteria to determine who is
entitled to P.O.W. status—as a source of rights”). Finally,
the D. C. Circuit’s decision in Kiyemba v. Obama, 561
F. 3d 509 (2009) (Kiyemba II), implicates the issues here
in holding, contrary to several recent district court deci
sions,9 that another MCA provision (MCA §7(a)(2), codified
