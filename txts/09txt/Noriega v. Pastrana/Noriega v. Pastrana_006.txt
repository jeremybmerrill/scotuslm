NORIEGA v. PASTRANA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

The Eleventh Circuit accepted the District Court’s des
ignation of Noriega as a POW, but agreed with the Gov
ernment’s interpretation of MCA §5(a):
“We affirm and hold that §5 of the Military Commis
sions Act of 2006 precludes Noriega from invoking
the Geneva Convention as a source of rights in a ha
beas proceeding and therefore deny Noriega’s habeas
petition.
.

“The issues present in Boumediene v. Bush concerning
the constitutionality of §7 of the MCA, are not pre
sented by §5 . . . . In Boumediene, the Supreme Court
found §7 of the MCA, which explicitly removed the ju
risdiction of courts to consider habeas actions by en
emy combatants, to be unconstitutional . . . . Section
5, in contrast, as discussed more fully, infra, at most
changes one substantive provision of law upon which
a party might rely in seeking habeas relief. We are
[thus] not presented with a situation in which poten
tial petitioners are effectively banned from seeking
habeas relief because any constitutional rights
or claims are made unavailable. 564 F. 3d 1290,
1292, 1294 (CA11 2009) (citations and parenthetical
omitted).”7
Noriega’s petition challenges both the Eleventh Circuit’s
interpretation of MCA §5(a) and the provision’s constitu
tionality. Noriega begins by asserting that the Court of
Appeals erred in holding “that [MCA §5(a)] absolutely and
unambiguously prohibits persons from raising any claim
based upon the four Geneva Conventions” in a habeas
——————
7 The Court of Appeals also concluded that, “assuming arguendo”
Noriega is correct that “§5 of the MCA does not preclude [his] claim,”
Noriega, 564 F. 3d, at 1297, the Third Geneva Convention does not bar
his extradition to France and the “United States has fully complied
with” the treaty, id., at 1298.
