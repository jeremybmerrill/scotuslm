THOMAS, J., dissenting

would receive in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, the
District Court designated Noriega a prisoner of war (POW)
entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions. See
United States v. Noriega, 808 F. Supp. 791 (SD Fla.,
1992).2 Noriega’s conviction and sentence were affirmed
in proceedings not relevant here. See United States v.
Noriega, 117 F. 3d 1206 (CA11 1997), cert. denied, 523
U. S. 1060 (1998).
In July 2007, two months before Noriega was scheduled
to be released on parole, he filed a habeas corpus petition
under 28 U. S. C. §2255. Relying on the District Court’s
POW designation, Noriega alleged that the United States
violated the Geneva Conventions when it acquiesced in
the French Government’s request to extradite him to
France so he could face criminal charges there upon his
release from U. S. custody. See United States v. Noriega,
No. 88−0079−CR, 2007 WL 2947572 (SD Fla., Aug. 24,
2007). The District Court agreed with Noriega that his

port of its “belie[f] [that the Third] Geneva [Convention] is self
executing and provides General Noriega with a right of action in a U. S.
court for violation of its provisions,” the District Court addressed
Noriega’s status under the treaty. United States v. Noriega, 808
F. Supp., at 794. The District Judge found that the hostilities in
Panama constituted an “ ‘armed conflict’ ” within the meaning of Article
2 of the Third Geneva Convention, that Noriega was a member of the
armed forces of a party to the conflict under Article 4 of the Third
Convention, and that the District Court was a “ ‘competent tribunal’ ” to
determine Noriega’s POW status under Article 5 of the Third Conven
tion. See id., at 793–796. Accordingly, the court concluded that,
notwithstanding various separation-of-powers and justiciability con
cerns, “Noriega is in fact a prisoner of war as defined by Geneva III,
and as such must be afforded the protections established by the treaty”
while in federal custody. Id., at 796. The court then identified Conven
tion rights that it believed would govern Noriega’s confinement, see id.,
at 799–803, and observed that “[w]hether or not those rights can be
fully provided in a maximum security penitentiary setting is open to
serious question,” id., at 803.
