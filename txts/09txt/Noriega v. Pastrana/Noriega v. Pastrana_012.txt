NORIEGA v. PASTRANA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

at 28 U. S. C. §2241(e)(2)), does not deprive federal habeas
corpus courts of jurisdiction to consider claims in which
certain classes of detainees challenge their conditions of
confinement under the Geneva Conventions. See 561
F. 3d, at 512–513.
The extent to which noncitizen detainees may rely on
the Geneva Conventions as a source of rights against the
United States has also been the subject of increasing
debate in the political branches. Recent Executive Branch
Orders and court filings cite the Conventions in articulat
ing the legal standards that govern detainee treatment.
See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 13491, §3, 74 Fed. Reg. 4894
(2009) (making “Common Article 3 standards” the “mini
mum baseline” for the treatment of any individual who, in
the course of “any armed conflict,” comes into the “custody
or under the effective control of an officer, employee, or
other agent of the United States” or is “detained within a
facility owned, operated, or controlled by a department or
agency of the United States”); Brief for United States in
Misc. No. 08–442 (TFH), p. 1 (Mar. 13, 2009) (apprising
the court of the Government’s decision to treat detainees
formerly designated as “unlawful enemy combatants”
under new standards that draw on the “laws of war,” as
those laws have “developed over time and have periodi
cally been codified in treaties such as the Geneva Conven
tions”).10 Congress, in turn, is considering new legislation

F. Supp. 2d 13, 18 (DC 2008) (Urbina, J.).
10 This standard presumably will control the Government’s position in
habeas corpus actions that arise in other circuits pursuant to the
President’s recent decision to prosecute or imprison (or both) certain
Guantanamo detainees in New York and Illinois. See Hearings Before
the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Testimony of Attorney General
