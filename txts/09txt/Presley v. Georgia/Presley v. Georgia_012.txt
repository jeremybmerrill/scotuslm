PRESLEY v. GEORGIA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

not declare, as the Court does, that Waller and PressEnterprise I “settl[e] the point” without “leav[ing] any
room for doubt.” Ante, at 6.
Besides departing from the standards that should gov
ern summary dispositions, today’s decision belittles the
efforts of our judicial colleagues who have struggled with
these issues in attempting to interpret and apply the same
opinions upon which the Court so confidently relies today.
See, e.g., Ayala v. Speckard, 131 F. 3d 62, 70–72 (CA2
1997) (en banc), cert. denied, 524 U. S. 958 (1998); 131
F. 3d, at 74–75 (Walker, J., concurring); id., at 77–80
(Parker, J., dissenting). The Court’s decision will also
surely surprise petitioner, who did not seek summary
reversal based on the allegedly incorrect application of
this Court’s well-established precedents by the Supreme
Court of Georgia, but instead asked us to “resolve this
split of authority” over whether “the opponent of closure
must suggest alternatives to closure” or whether “those
seeking to exclude the public must show that there is no
available less-intrusive alternative.” Pet. for Cert. 18.
