the public were invited to return afterward.” 290 Ga. App.
99, 100–101, 658 S. E. 2d 773, 775 (2008).
The Supreme Court of Georgia granted certiorari and
affirmed, with two justices dissenting. After finding “the
trial court certainly had an overriding interest in ensuring
that potential jurors heard no inherently prejudicial re
marks from observers during voir dire,” the Supreme
Court of Georgia rejected Presley’s argument that the trial
court was required to consider alternatives to closing the
courtroom. 285 Ga., at 272, 273, 674 S. E. 2d, at 911. It
noted that “the United States Supreme Court [has] not
provide[d] clear guidance regarding whether a court must,
sua sponte, advance its own alternatives to [closure],” and
the court ruled that “Presley was obliged to present the
court with any alternatives that he wished the court to
consider.” Id., at 273, 674 S. E. 2d, at 911, 912. When no
alternatives are offered, it concluded, “there is no abuse of
discretion in the court’s failure to sua sponte advance its
own alternatives.” Id., at 274, 674 S. E. 2d, at 912.
This Court’s rulings with respect to the public trial right
rest upon two different provisions of the Bill of Rights,
both applicable to the States via the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Sixth Amendment
directs, in relevant part, that “[i]n all criminal prosecu
tions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and
public trial . . . .” The Court in In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257,
273 (1948), made it clear that this right extends to the
States. The Sixth Amendment right, as the quoted lan
guage makes explicit, is the right of the accused.
The Court has further held that the public trial right
extends beyond the accused and can be invoked under the
First Amendment. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court
of Cal., Riverside Cty., 464 U. S. 501 (1984) (PressEnterprise I). This requirement, too, is binding on the
States. Ibid.
