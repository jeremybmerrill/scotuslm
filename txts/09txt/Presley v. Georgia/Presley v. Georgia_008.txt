PRESLEY v. GEORGIA
Per Curiam

We need not rule on this second claim of error, because
even assuming, arguendo, that the trial court had an
overriding interest in closing voir dire, it was still incum
bent upon it to consider all reasonable alternatives to
closure. It did not, and that is all this Court needs to
decide.
The Supreme Court of Georgiaâ€™s judgment is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
