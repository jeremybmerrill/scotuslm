PRESLEY v. GEORGIA
Per Curiam

despite our explicit statements to the contrary, that trial
courts need not consider alternatives to closure absent an
opposing party’s proffer of some alternatives. While the
Supreme Court of Georgia concluded this was an open
question under this Court’s precedents, the statement in
Waller that “the trial court must consider reasonable
alternatives to closing the proceeding” settles the point.
Ibid. If that statement leaves any room for doubt, the
Court was more explicit in Press-Enterprise I:
“Even with findings adequate to support closure, the
trial court’s orders denying access to voir dire testi
mony failed to consider whether alternatives were
available to protect the interests of the prospective ju
rors that the trial court’s orders sought to guard. Ab
sent consideration of alternatives to closure, the trial
court could not constitutionally close the voir dire.”
464 U. S., at 511.
The conclusion that trial courts are required to consider
alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by
the parties is clear not only from this Court’s precedents
but also from the premise that “[t]he process of juror
selection is itself a matter of importance, not simply to the
adversaries but to the criminal justice system.” Id., at
505. The public has a right to be present whether or not
any party has asserted the right. In Press-Enterprise I, for
instance, neither the defendant nor the prosecution re
quested an open courtroom during juror voir dire proceed
ings; in fact, both specifically argued in favor of keeping
the transcript of the proceedings confidential. Id., at 503–
504. The Court, nonetheless, found it was error to close
the courtroom. Id., at 513.
Trial courts are obligated to take every reasonable
measure to accommodate public attendance at criminal
trials. Nothing in the record shows that the trial court
could not have accommodated the public at Presley’s trial.
