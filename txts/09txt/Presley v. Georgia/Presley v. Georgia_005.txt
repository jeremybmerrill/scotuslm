in what circumstances the reach or protections of one
might be greater than the other. Still, there is no legiti
mate reason, at least in the context of juror selection
proceedings, to give one who asserts a First Amendment
privilege greater rights to insist on public proceedings
than the accused has. “Our cases have uniformly recog
nized the public-trial guarantee as one created for the

U. S. 368, 380 (1979). There could be no explanation for
barring the accused from raising a constitutional right
that is unmistakably for his or her benefit. That rationale
suffices to resolve the instant matter. The Supreme Court
of Georgia was correct in assuming that the Sixth Amend

prospective jurors.
While the accused does have a right to insist that the
voir dire of the jurors be public, there are exceptions to
this general rule. “[T]he right to an open trial may give
way in certain cases to other rights or interests, such as
the defendant’s right to a fair trial or the government’s
interest in inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information.”
Waller, 467 U. S., at 45. “Such circumstances will be rare,
however, and the balance of interests must be struck with
special care.” Ibid. Waller provided standards for courts
to apply before excluding the public from any stage of a
criminal trial:
“[T]he party seeking to close the hearing must ad

to protect that interest, the trial court must consider
reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and
it must make findings adequate to support the clo

In upholding exclusion of the public at juror voir dire in
the instant case, the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded,
