SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
ERIC PRESLEY v. GEORGIA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME

PER CURIAM.
After a jury trial in the Superior Court of DeKalb
County, Georgia, petitioner Eric Presley was convicted of a
cocaine trafficking offense. The conviction was affirmed
by the Supreme Court of Georgia. 285 Ga. 270, 674 S. E.

jurors were about to enter and instructed the man that he
was not allowed in the courtroom and had to leave that

at 910. The court then questioned the man and learned

instruction:
“ ‘Well, you still can’t sit out in the audience with the
jurors. You know, most of the afternoon actually
we’re going to be picking a jury. And we may have a
couple of pre-trial matters, so you’re welcome to come

noon. But, otherwise, you would have to leave the
