THOMAS, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
ERIC PRESLEY v. GEORGIA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME 

COURT OF GEORGIA

No. 09–5270. Decided January 19, 2010


JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,
dissenting.
Today the Court summarily disposes of two important
questions it left unanswered 25 years ago in Waller v.
Georgia, 467 U. S. 39 (1984), and Press-Enterprise Co. v.
Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty., 464 U. S. 501 (1984)
(Press-Enterprise I).
I respectfully dissent from the
Court’s summary disposition of these important questions.
First, the Court addresses “whether it is so well settled
that [a defendant’s] Sixth Amendment right” to a public
trial “extends to jury voir dire that this Court may proceed
by summary disposition.” Ante, at 4. The Court’s affirma
tive answer to this question relies exclusively on Waller
and Press-Enterprise I; but those cases cannot bear the
weight of this answer.
The Court correctly notes that Waller answers whether
a “defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial
applies to a suppression hearing” (not to jury voir dire),
467 U. S., at 43, and that Press-Enterprise I interprets the
public’s First Amendment right to attend jury voir dire,
464 U. S., at 509, n. 8, so neither Waller nor PressEnterprise I expressly answers the question here, see ante,
at 4. That acknowledgment should have eliminated any
basis for disposing of this case summarily; the Court
should reserve that procedural option for cases that our
precedents govern squarely and directly. See, e.g., United
States v. Haley, 358 U. S. 644 (1959) (per curiam) (summa
rily reversing a federal court’s judgment that refused to
follow, or even mention, one of our precedents upholding
