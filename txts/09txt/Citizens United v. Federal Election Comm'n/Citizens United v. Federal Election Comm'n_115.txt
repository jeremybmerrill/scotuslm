CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

Fund, http://www.cupvf.org/.40
So let us be clear: Neither Austin nor McConnell held or
implied that corporations may be silenced; the FEC is not
a “censor”; and in the years since these cases were decided,
corporations have continued to play a major role in the
national dialogue. Laws such as §203 target a class of
communications that is especially likely to corrupt the
political process, that is at least one degree removed from
the views of individual citizens, and that may not even
reflect the views of those who pay for it. Such laws burden
political speech, and that is always a serious matter,
demanding careful scrutiny. But the majority’s incessant
talk of a “ban” aims at a straw man.
Identity-Based Distinctions
The second pillar of the Court’s opinion is its assertion
that “the Government cannot restrict political speech
based on the speaker’s . . . identity.” Ante, at 30; accord,
ante, at 1, 24, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 49, 50. The case on
which it relies for this proposition is First Nat. Bank of
Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978). As I shall explain,
infra, at 52–55, the holding in that case was far narrower
than the Court implies. Like its paeans to unfettered
discourse, the Court’s denunciation of identity-based
distinctions may have rhetorical appeal but it obscures
reality.
“Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected
an absolutist interpretation” of the First Amendment.
