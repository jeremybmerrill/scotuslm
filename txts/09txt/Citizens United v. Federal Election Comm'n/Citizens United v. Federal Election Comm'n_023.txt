CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

Court not only entertained an as-applied challenge but
also sustained it. Three Justices noted that they would
continue to maintain the position that the record in
McConnell demonstrated the invalidity of the Act on its
face. 551 U. S., at 485–504 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The
controlling opinion in WRTL, which refrained from hold
ing the statute invalid except as applied to the facts then
before the Court, was a careful attempt to accept the
essential elements of the Court’s opinion in McConnell,
while vindicating the First Amendment arguments made
by the WRTL parties. 551 U. S., at 482 (opinion of
ROBERTS, C. J.).
As noted above, Citizens United’s narrower arguments
are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. In
the exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary
then for the Court to consider the facial validity of §441b.
Any other course of decision would prolong the substan
tial, nation-wide chilling effect caused by §441b’s prohibi
tions on corporate expenditures. Consideration of the
facial validity of §441b is further supported by the follow
ing reasons.
First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position
of the Government. As discussed above, see Part II–D,
supra, the Government suggests, as an alternative argu
ment, that an as-applied challenge might have merit.
This argument proceeds on the premise that the nonprofit
corporation involved here may have received only de
minimis donations from for-profit corporations and that
some nonprofit corporations may be exempted from the
operation of the statute. The Government also suggests
that an as-applied challenge to §441b’s ban on books may
be successful, although it would defend §441b’s ban as
applied to almost every other form of media including
pamphlets. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 65–66 (Sept. 9, 2009).
The Government thus, by its own position, contributes to
the uncertainty that §441b causes. When the Government
