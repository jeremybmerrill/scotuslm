corporated associations of individuals, to incorporated
associations of individuals—and the dissent offers no
evidence about the original meaning of the text to support
any such exclusion. We are therefore simply left with the
question whether the speech at issue in this case is
“speech” covered by the First Amendment. No one says
otherwise. A documentary film critical of a potential
Presidential candidate is core political speech, and its
nature as such does not change simply because it was
funded by a corporation. Nor does the character of that
funding produce any reduction whatever in the “inherent
worth of the speech” and “its capacity for informing the
public,” First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S.
765, 777 (1978). Indeed, to exclude or impede corporate
speech is to muzzle the principal agents of the modern free
economy. We should celebrate rather than condemn the
addition of this speech to the public debate.
