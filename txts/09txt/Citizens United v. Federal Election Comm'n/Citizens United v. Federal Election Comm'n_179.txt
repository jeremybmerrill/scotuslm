CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

describe “in which donors to certain causes were black­

Ante, at 54. The Court properly recognizes these events as
“cause for concern,” ibid., but fails to acknowledge their
constitutional significance. In my view, amici’s submis­

§§84606–84609 (West 2005).
Some opponents of Proposition 8 compiled this informa­

1 BCRA imposes similar disclosure requirements. See, e.g., 2 U. S. C.
§434(f)(2)(F) (“Every person who makes a disbursement for the direct
costs of producing and airing electioneering communications in an
aggregate amount in excess of $10,000 during any calendar year” must
disclose “the names and addresses of all contributors who contributed
an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to the person making the
disbursement”).
