CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

the cause of self-government today.
2. Shareholder Protection
There is yet another way in which laws such as §203 can
serve First Amendment values. Interwoven with Austin’s
concern to protect the integrity of the electoral process is a
concern to protect the rights of shareholders from a kind of
coerced speech: electioneering expenditures that do not
“reflec[t] [their] support.” 494 U. S., at 660–661. When
corporations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a
particular candidate for office, it is the shareholders, as the
residual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill.
Those shareholders who disagree with the corporation’s
electoral message may find their financial investments
being used to undermine their political convictions.
The PAC mechanism, by contrast, helps assure that
those who pay for an electioneering communication actu­
ally support its content and that managers do not use
general treasuries to advance personal agendas. Ibid. It
“ ‘allows corporate political participation without the temp­
tation to use corporate funds for political influence, quite
possibly at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders
or members.’ ” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 204 (quoting
Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 163). A rule that privileges the
use of PACs thus does more than facilitate the political
speech of like-minded shareholders; it also curbs the rent
seeking behavior of executives and respects the views of
dissenters. Austin’s acceptance of restrictions on general
treasury spending “simply allows people who have in­
vested in the business corporation for purely economic
reasons”—the vast majority of investors, one assumes—“to
avoid being taken advantage of, without sacrificing their
economic objectives.” Winkler, Beyond Bellotti, 32 Loyola
(LA) L. Rev. 133, 201 (1998).
The concern to protect dissenting shareholders and
union members has a long history in campaign finance
