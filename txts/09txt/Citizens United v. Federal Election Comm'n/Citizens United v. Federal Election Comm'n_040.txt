Opinion of the Court

does little to defend it. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–48 (Sept.
9, 2009). And with good reason, for the rationale cannot
support §441b.
If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Con
gress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of
citizens, for simply engaging in political speech. If the
antidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it
would permit Government to ban political speech simply
because the speaker is an association that has taken on
the corporate form. The Government contends that Austin
permits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all
forms of communication stemming from a corporation.
See Part II–E, supra; Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009);
see also id., at 26–31 (Mar. 24, 2009). If Austin were
correct, the Government could prohibit a corporation from
expressing political views in media beyond those pre
sented here, such as by printing books. The Government
responds “that the FEC has never applied this statute to a
book,” and if it did, “there would be quite [a] good as
applied challenge.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).
This troubling assertion of brooding governmental power
cannot be reconciled with the confidence and stability in
civic discourse that the First Amendment must secure.
Political speech is “indispensable to decisionmaking in a
democracy, and this is no less true because the speech
comes from a corporation rather than an individual.”
Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (footnote omitted); see ibid. (the
worth of speech “does not depend upon the identity of its
source, whether corporation, association, union, or indi
vidual”); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48–49 (“[T]he concept that
government may restrict the speech of some elements of
our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others
is wholly foreign to the First Amendment”); Automobile
Workers, 352 U. S., at 597 (Douglas, J., dissenting); CIO,
335 U. S., at 154–155 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).
This protection for speech is inconsistent with Austin’s
