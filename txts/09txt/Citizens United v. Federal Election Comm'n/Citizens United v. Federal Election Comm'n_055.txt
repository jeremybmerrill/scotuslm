CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

relying almost entirely on “the quid pro quo interest, the
corruption interest or the shareholder interest,” and not
Austin’s expressed antidistortion rationale. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 48 (Sept. 9, 2009); see id., at 45–46. When neither
party defends the reasoning of a precedent, the principle of
adhering to that precedent through stare decisis is dimin
ished. Austin abandoned First Amendment principles,
furthermore, by relying on language in some of our prece
dents that traces back to the Automobile Workers Court’s
flawed historical account of campaign finance laws, see
Brief for Campaign Finance Scholars as Amici Curiae;
Hayward, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421; R. Mutch, Campaigns,
Congress, and Courts 33–35, 153–157 (1988). See Austin,

contributions and expenditures of corporations and labor
unions is set forth in great detail in [Automobile Workers],
supra, at 570–584, and we need only summarize the de

Austin is undermined by experience since its an
nouncement. Political speech is so ingrained in our cul
ture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign
finance laws. See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 176–177
(“Given BCRA’s tighter restrictions on the raising and
spending of soft money, the incentives . . . to exploit [26
U. S. C. §527] organizations will only increase”). Our
Nation’s speech dynamic is changing, and informative
voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions
to exercise their First Amendment rights. Speakers have
become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites,
talking points, and scripted messages that dominate the
24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not
have monolithic views. On certain topics corporations
