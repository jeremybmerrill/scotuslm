CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

sented, arguing that the Court should have reached the
constitutional question and that the ban on independent
expenditures was unconstitutional:
“Under our Constitution it is We The People who
are sovereign. The people have the final say. The leg
islators are their spokesmen. The people determine
through their votes the destiny of the nation. It is
therefore important—vitally important—that all
channels of communications be open to them during
every election, that no point of view be restrained or
barred, and that the people have access to the views of
every group in the community.” Id., at 593 (opinion of
Douglas, J., joined by Warren, C. J., and Black, J.).
The dissent concluded that deeming a particular group
“too powerful” was not a “justificatio[n] for withholding
First Amendment rights from any group—labor or corpo
rate.” Id., at 597. The Court did not get another opportu
nity to consider the constitutional question in that case;
for after a remand, a jury found the defendants not guilty.
See Hayward, Revisiting the Fable of Reform, 45 Harv. J.
Legis. 421, 463 (2008).
Later, in Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 400–
401 (1972), the Court reversed a conviction for expendi
ture of union funds for political speech—again without
reaching the constitutional question. The Court would not
resolve that question for another four years.

In Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, the Court addressed various
challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971
(FECA) as amended in 1974. These amendments created
18 U. S. C. §608(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), see 88 Stat. 1265,
an independent expenditure ban separate from §610 that
applied to individuals as well as corporations and labor
unions, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, and n. 45.
