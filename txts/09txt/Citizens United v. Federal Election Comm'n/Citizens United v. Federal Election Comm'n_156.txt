Opinion of STEVENS, J.

of 99.97% independent expenditures ($3 million) and
0.03% direct contributions ($1,000)—as a “contribution.”
See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (“The basis for the
[recusal] motion was that the justice had received cam­
paign contributions in an extraordinary amount from”
Blankenship); id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (referencing
“Blankenship’s $3 million in contributions”); id., at ___
(slip op., at 14) (“Blankenship contributed some $3 million

id., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (“Blankenship’s campaign con­

against corruption.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 30; see also
Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 392, n. 5. It underscores
that “certain restrictions on corporate electoral involve­
ment” may likewise be needed to “hedge against circum­
vention of valid contribution limits.” McConnell, 540
U. S., at 205 (internal quotation marks and brackets
omitted); see also Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 456 (“[A]ll
Members of the Court agree that circumvention is a valid
theory of corruption”). It underscores that for-profit cor­
porations associated with electioneering communications
will often prefer to use nonprofit conduits with “mislead­
ing names,” such as And For The Sake Of The Kids, “to
