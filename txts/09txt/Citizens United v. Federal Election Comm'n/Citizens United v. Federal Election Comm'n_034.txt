Opinion of the Court

labor unions in §304 of the Labor Management Relations
Act 1947, 61 Stat. 159 (codified at 2 U. S. C. §251 (1946
ed., Supp. I)). In passing this Act Congress overrode the
veto of President Truman, who warned that the expendi
ture ban was a “dangerous intrusion on free speech.”
Message from the President of the United States, H. R.
Doc. No. 334, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1947).
For almost three decades thereafter, the Court did not
reach the question whether restrictions on corporate and
union expenditures are constitutional. See WRTL, 551
U. S., at 502 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The question was in
the background of United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106
(1948). There, a labor union endorsed a congressional
candidate in its weekly periodical. The Court stated that
“the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to [the
federal expenditure prohibition’s] constitutionality” if it
were construed to suppress that writing. Id., at 121. The
Court engaged in statutory interpretation and found the
statute did not cover the publication. Id., at 121–122, and
n. 20. Four Justices, however, said they would reach the
constitutional question and invalidate the Labor Man
agement Relations Act’s expenditure ban. Id., at 155
(Rutledge, J., joined by Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ.,
concurring in result). The concurrence explained that any
“ ‘undue influence’ ” generated by a speaker’s “large expen
ditures” was outweighed “by the loss for democratic proc
esses resulting from the restrictions upon free and full
public discussion.” Id., at 143.
In United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567
(1957), the Court again encountered the independent
expenditure ban, which had been recodified at 18 U. S. C.
§610 (1952 ed.). See 62 Stat. 723–724. After holding only
that a union television broadcast that endorsed candidates
was covered by the statute, the Court “[r]efus[ed] to an
ticipate constitutional questions” and remanded for the
trial to proceed. 352 U. S., at 591. Three Justices dis
