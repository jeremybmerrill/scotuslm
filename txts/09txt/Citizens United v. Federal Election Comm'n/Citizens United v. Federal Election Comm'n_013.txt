CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

days of a primary election. 2 U. S. C. §434(f)(3)(A)(i).
Citizens United, however, argues that Hillary was not
“publicly distributed,” because a single video-on-demand
transmission is sent only to a requesting cable converter
box and each separate transmission, in most instances,
will be seen by just one household—not 50,000 or more
persons. 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2); see §100.29(b)(3)(ii).
This argument ignores the regulation’s instruction on
how to determine whether a cable transmission “[c]an be
received by 50,000 or more persons.” §100.29(b)(3)(ii).
The regulation provides that the number of people who
can receive a cable transmission is determined by the
number of cable subscribers in the relevant area.
§§100.29(b)(7)(i)(G), (ii). Here, Citizens United wanted to
use a cable video-on-demand system that had 34.5 million
subscribers nationwide. App. 256a. Thus, Hillary could
have been received by 50,000 persons or more.
One amici brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the
condition that the communication “[c]an be received by
50,000 or more persons,” §100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require “a
plausible likelihood that the communication will be viewed
by 50,000 or more potential voters”—as opposed to requir
ing only that the communication is “technologically capa
ble” of being seen by that many people, Brief for Former
Officials of the American Civil Liberties Union as Amici
Curiae 5. Whether the population and demographic sta
tistics in a proposed viewing area consisted of 50,000
registered voters—but not “infants, pre-teens, or otherwise
electorally ineligible recipients”—would be a required
determination, subject to judicial challenge and review, in
any case where the issue was in doubt. Id., at 6.
In our view the statute cannot be saved by limiting the
reach of 2 U. S. C. §441b through this suggested interpre
tation. In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation,
this result would require a calculation as to the number of
people a particular communication is likely to reach, with
