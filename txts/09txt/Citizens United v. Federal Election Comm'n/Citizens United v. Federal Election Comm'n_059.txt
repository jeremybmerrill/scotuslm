CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

they would help citizens “ ‘make informed choices in the
political marketplace.’ ” 540 U. S., at 197 (quoting McCon
nell I, supra, at 237); see 540 U. S., at 231.
Although both provisions were facially upheld, the
Court acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be
available if a group could show a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ”
that disclosure of its contributors’ names “ ‘will subject

Government officials or private parties.’ ” Id., at 198

Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and
two 10-second ads to promote Hillary. Under FEC regula

It contends that the governmental interest in providing
information to the electorate does not justify requiring
disclaimers for any commercial advertisements, including
the ones at issue here. We disagree. The ads fall within
BCRA’s definition of an “electioneering communication”:
They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly
before a primary and contained pejorative references to
her candidacy. See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 276, nn. 2–4. The
disclaimers required by §311 “provid[e] the electorate with

the voters are fully informed” about the person or group
