CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

pointed out that, “[c]ontrary to the [majority’s] critical
assumptions,” the statutes upheld in Austin and McCon
nell do “not impose an absolute ban on all forms of corpo­
rate political spending.” Austin, 494 U. S., at 660; see also
McConnell, 540 U. S., at 203–204; Beaumont, 539 U. S., at
162–163. For starters, both statutes provide exemptions
for PACs, separate segregated funds established by a
corporation for political purposes.
See 2 U. S. C.
§441b(b)(2)(C); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §169.255 (West
2005). “The ability to form and administer separate seg­
regated funds,” we observed in McConnell, “has provided
corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient
opportunity to engage in express advocacy. That has been
this Court’s unanimous view.” 540 U. S., at 203.
Under BCRA, any corporation’s “stockholders and their
families and its executive or administrative personnel and
their families” can pool their resources to finance election­
eering communications. 2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(4)(A)(i). A
significant and growing number of corporations avail
themselves of this option;29 during the most recent election
cycle, corporate and union PACs raised nearly a billion
dollars.30 Administering a PAC entails some administra­
tive burden, but so does complying with the disclaimer,
disclosure, and reporting requirements that the Court
today upholds, see ante, at 51, and no one has suggested
that the burden is severe for a sophisticated for-profit
corporation. To the extent the majority is worried about

30 See Supp. Brief for Appellee 16 (citing FEC statistics placing this
figure at $840 million). The majority finds the PAC option inadequate
in part because “[a] PAC is a separate association from the corpora­
tion.” Ante, at 21. The formal “separateness” of PACs from their host
corporations—which administer and control the PACs but which cannot
funnel general treasury funds into them or force members to support
them—is, of course, the whole point of the PAC mechanism.
