CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

port for the corporation’s political ideas.” 494 U. S., at
660; see id., at 659 (citing MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257;
NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500–501).

The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of
precedent: a pre-Austin line that forbids restrictions on
political speech based on the speaker’s corporate identity
and a post-Austin line that permits them. No case before
Austin had held that Congress could prohibit independent
expenditures for political speech based on the speaker’s
corporate identity. Before Austin Congress had enacted
legislation for this purpose, and the Government urged the
same proposition before this Court. See MCFL, supra, at
257 (FEC posited that Congress intended to “curb the
political influence of ‘those who exercise control over large
aggregations of capital’ ” (quoting Automobile Workers,
supra, at 585)); California Medical Assn. v. Federal Elec
tion Comm’n, 453 U. S. 182, 201 (1981) (Congress believed
that “differing structures and purposes” of corporations
and unions “may require different forms of regulation in
order to protect the integrity of the electoral process”). In
neither of these cases did the Court adopt the proposition.
In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in
§441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale
on which Austin and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but
abandons reliance upon it. It argues instead that two
other compelling interests support Austin’s holding that
corporate expenditure restrictions are constitutional: an
anticorruption interest, see 494 U. S., at 678 (STEVENS, J.,
concurring), and a shareholder-protection interest, see id.,
at 674–675 (Brennan, J., concurring). We consider the
three points in turn.
