CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
ROBERTS, C. J., concurring

reasoning has become so discredited that the Court cannot
keep the precedent alive without jury-rigging new and
different justifications to shore up the original mistake.
See, e.g., Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(slip op., at 10); Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 13) (stare decisis does not control when
adherence to the prior decision requires “fundamentally
revising its theoretical basis”).

These considerations weigh against retaining our deci
sion in Austin. First, as the majority explains, that deci

trol/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290,
295 (1981). Austin, however, allowed the Government to
prohibit these same expenditures out of concern for “the
corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of
wealth” in the marketplace of ideas. 494 U. S., at 660.
Austin’s reasoning was—and remains—inconsistent with
Buckley’s explicit repudiation of any government interest
in “equalizing the relative ability of individuals and
groups to influence the outcome of elections.” 424 U. S., at
48–49.
Austin was also inconsistent with Bellotti’s clear rejec
