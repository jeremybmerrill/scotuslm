CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

that have “little or no correlation” with the beliefs held by
actual persons, id., at 660. In light of the corrupting
effects such spending might have on the political process,
ibid., we permitted the State of Michigan to limit corpo­
rate expenditures on candidate elections to corporations’
PACs, which rely on voluntary contributions and thus
“reflect actual public support for the political ideals es­
poused by corporations,” ibid. Notwithstanding our col­
leagues’ insinuations that Austin deprived the public of
general “ideas,” “facts,” and “knowledge,” ante, at 38–39,
the decision addressed only candidate-focused expendi­
tures and gave the State no license to regulate corporate
spending on other matters.
In the 20 years since Austin, we have reaffirmed its
holding and rationale a number of times, see, e.g., Beau
mont, 539 U. S., at 153–156, most importantly in McCon
nell, 540 U. S. 93, where we upheld the provision chal­
lenged here, §203 of BCRA.62 Congress crafted §203 in
response to a problem created by Buckley. The Buckley

62 According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, we are “erroneou[s]” in claiming
that McConnell and Beaumont “ ‘reaffirmed’ ” Austin. Ante, at 5. In
both cases, the Court explicitly relied on Austin and quoted from it at
length. See 540 U. S., at 204–205; 539 U. S., at 153–155, 158, 160, 163;
see also ante, at 15 (“The holding and validity of Austin were essential
to the reasoning of the McConnell majority opinion”); Brief for Appel­
lants National Rifle Association et al., O. T. 2003, No. 02–1675, p. 21
(“Beaumont reaffirmed . . . the Austin rationale for restricting expendi­
tures”). The McConnell Court did so in the teeth of vigorous protests by
Justices in today’s majority that Austin should be overruled. See ante,
at 15 (citing relevant passages); see also Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 163–
164 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Both Courts also heard
criticisms of Austin from parties or amici. See Brief for Appellants
Chamber of Commerce of the United States et al., O. T. 2003, No. 02–
1756, p. 35, n. 22; Reply Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees Senator
Mitch McConnell et al., O. T. 2003, No. 02–1674, pp. 13–14; Brief for
Pacific Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae in FEC v. Beaumont, O. T.
2002, No. 02–403, passim. If this does not qualify as reaffirmation of a
precedent, then I do not know what would.
