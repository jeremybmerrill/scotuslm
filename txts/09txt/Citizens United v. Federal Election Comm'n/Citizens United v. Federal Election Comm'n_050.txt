political debts from legislators who are aided by the con
tributions.” 459 U. S., at 207–208 (citing Automobile
Workers, 352 U. S., at 579); see 459 U. S., at 210, and n. 7;
NCPAC, supra, at 500–501 (NRWC suggested a govern
mental interest in restricting “the influence of political
war chests funneled through the corporate form”). NRWC,
however, has little relevance here. NRWC decided no
more than that a restriction on a corporation’s ability to
solicit funds for its segregated PAC, which made direct
contributions to candidates, did not violate the First
Amendment. 459 U. S., at 206. NRWC thus involved
contribution limits, see NCPAC, supra, at 495–496, which,
unlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an
accepted means to prevent quid pro quo corruption, see
McConnell, 540 U. S., at 136–138, and n. 40; MCFL, su
pra, at 259–260. Citizens United has not made direct
contributions to candidates, and it has not suggested that
the Court should reconsider whether contribution limits
should be subjected to rigorous First Amendment scrutiny.
When Buckley identified a sufficiently important gov
ernmental interest in preventing corruption or the ap

pro quo corruption. See McConnell, supra, at 296–298
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (citing Buckley, supra, at 26–28,
30, 46–48); NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 497 (“The hallmark of
corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for politi
cal favors”); id., at 498. The fact that speakers may have
influence over or access to elected officials does not mean
that these officials are corrupt:
“Favoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in
representative politics. It is in the nature of an
elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by
necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contribu
tors who support those policies. It is well understood
that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the
