SCALIA, J., concurring

Politics in the First Federal Congress, 15 J. Early Repub
lic 169 (1995). The New York Sons of Liberty sent a circu
lar to colonies farther south in 1766. P. Maier, From
Resistance to Revolution 79–80 (1972). And the Society
for the Relief and Instruction of Poor Germans circulated a

German-language Press and the American Revolution, in
The Press & the American Revolution 151, 161–162 (B.
Bailyn & J. Hench eds. 1980). The dissent offers no evi
dence—none whatever—that the First Amendment’s
unqualified text was originally understood to exclude such
associational speech from its protection.5

best the dissent can come up with is that “[p]ostratification
practice” supports its reading of the First Amendment. Post, at 40,
n. 56. For this proposition, the dissent cites Justice White’s statement
(in dissent) that “[t]he common law was generally interpreted as
prohibiting corporate political participation,” First Nat. Bank of Boston
v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 819 (1978). The sole authority Justice White
cited for this proposition, id., at 819, n. 14, was a law-review note that
made no such claim. To the contrary, it stated that the cases dealing
with the propriety of corporate political expenditures were “few.” Note,
Corporate Political Affairs Programs, 70 Yale L. J. 821, 852 (1961).
More specifically, the note cites only two holdings to that effect, one by
a Federal District Court, and one by the Supreme Court of Montana.
Id., at 852, n. 197. Of course even if the common law was “generally
interpreted” to prohibit corporate political expenditures as ultra vires,
that would have nothing to do with whether political expenditures that
were authorized by a corporation’s charter could constitutionally be
suppressed.
As additional “[p]ostratification practice,” the dissent notes that the
Court “did not recognize any First Amendment protections for corpora
tions until the middle part of the 20th century.” Post, at 40, n. 56. But
it did that in Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233 (1936), a
case involving freedom of the press—which the dissent acknowledges
did cover corporations from the outset. The relative recency of that
first case is unsurprising. All of our First Amendment jurisprudence
was slow to develop. We did not consider application of the First
Amendment to speech restrictions other than prior restraints until
1919, see Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919); we did not
invalidate a state law on First Amendment grounds until 1931, see
