CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

complex rules” on “71 distinct entities.” Brief for Seven
Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as Amici Curiae 11–12.
These entities are subject to separate rules for 33 different
types of political speech. Id., at 14–15, n. 10. The FEC
has adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of ex
planations and justifications for those regulations, and
1,771 advisory opinions since 1975. See id., at 6, n. 7. In
fact, after this Court in WRTL adopted an objective “ap
peal to vote” test for determining whether a communica
tion was the functional equivalent of express advocacy,
551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), the FEC
adopted a two-part, 11-factor balancing test to implement
WRTL’s ruling. See 11 CFR §114.15; Brief for Wyoming
Liberty Group et al. as Amici Curiae 17–27 (filed Jan. 15,
2009).
This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on
speech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective
speakers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory
opinion from the FEC before the speech takes place. Cf.
Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 712–713
(1931). As a practical matter, however, given the complex
ity of the regulations and the deference courts show to
administrative determinations, a speaker who wants to
avoid threats of criminal liability and the heavy costs of
defending against FEC enforcement must ask a govern
mental agency for prior permission to speak. See 2
U. S. C. §437f; 11 CFR §112.1. These onerous restrictions
thus function as the equivalent of prior restraint by giving
the FEC power analogous to licensing laws implemented
in 16th- and 17th-century England, laws and governmen
tal practices of the sort that the First Amendment was
drawn to prohibit. See Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist., 534
U. S. 316, 320 (2002); Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U. S.
444, 451–452 (1938); Near, supra, at 713–714. Because
the FEC’s “business is to censor, there inheres the danger
that [it] may well be less responsive than a court—part of
