CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

sion would dislodge settled rights and expectations or
require an extensive legislative response.’ ” Hubbard v.
United States, 514 U. S. 695, 714 (1995) (quoting Hilton v.
South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, 502 U. S. 197,
202 (1991)). Stare decisis protects not only personal rights
involving property or contract but also the ability of the
elected branches to shape their laws in an effective and
coherent fashion. Today’s decision takes away a power
that we have long permitted these branches to exercise.
State legislatures have relied on their authority to regu­

more than a century.20 The Federal Congress has relied
on this authority for a comparable stretch of time, and it
specifically relied on Austin throughout the years it spent
developing and debating BCRA. The total record it com­
piled was 100,000 pages long.21 Pulling out the rug be­
neath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of
§203 six years ago shows great disrespect for a coequal
branch.
By removing one of its central components, today’s
ruling makes a hash out of BCRA’s “delicate and intercon­
nected regulatory scheme.” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 172.
Consider just one example of the distortions that will
follow: Political parties are barred under BCRA from
soliciting or spending “soft money,” funds that are not
subject to the statute’s disclosure requirements or its
source and amount limitations. 2 U. S. C. §441i; McCon
nell, 540 U. S., at 122–126. Going forward, corporations
and unions will be free to spend as much general treasury
money as they wish on ads that support or attack specific
