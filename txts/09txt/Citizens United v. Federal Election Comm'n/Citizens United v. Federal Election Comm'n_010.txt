Opinion of the Court

lected program, but here the proposal was to make Hillary
available to viewers free of charge.
To implement the proposal, Citizens United was pre
pared to pay for the video-on-demand; and to promote the
film, it produced two 10-second ads and one 30-second ad
for Hillary. Each ad includes a short (and, in our view,

(FEC) regulations further define an electioneering com
