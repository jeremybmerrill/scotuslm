CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
ROBERTS, C. J., concurring

new arguments must stand or fall on their own; they are
not entitled to receive the special deference we accord to
precedent. They are, as grounds to support Austin, liter
ally unprecedented. Moreover, to the extent the Govern
ment relies on new arguments—and declines to defend
Austin on its own terms—we may reasonably infer that it
lacks confidence in that decision’s original justification.
Because continued adherence to Austin threatens to
subvert the “principled and intelligible” development of
our First Amendment jurisprudence, Vasquez, 474 U. S.,
at 265, I support the Court’s determination to overrule
that decision.

We have had two rounds of briefing in this case, two oral
arguments, and 54 amicus briefs to help us carry out our
obligation to decide the necessary constitutional questions
according to law. We have also had the benefit of a com
prehensive dissent that has helped ensure that the Court
has considered all the relevant issues. This careful con
sideration convinces me that Congress violates the First
Amendment when it decrees that some speakers may not
engage in political speech at election time, when it matters
most.
