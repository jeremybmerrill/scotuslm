Opinion of STEVENS, J.

First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no
law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.”
Apart perhaps from measures designed to protect the
press, that text might seem to permit no distinctions of
any kind. Yet in a variety of contexts, we have held that

automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings”).

U. S. 119, 129 (1977) (“In a prison context, an inmate does not retain
those First Amendment rights that are inconsistent with his status as a
prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections
system” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

members of the military are not excluded from the protection granted
by the First Amendment, the different character of the military com­
munity and of the military mission requires a different application of
those protections”).

or indirectly make contributions or independent expenditures in con­
nection with a U. S. election).

taking “any active part in political management or in political cam­
