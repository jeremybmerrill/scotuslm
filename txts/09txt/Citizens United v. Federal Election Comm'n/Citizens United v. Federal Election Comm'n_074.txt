CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
ROBERTS, C. J., concurring

Politics: Justice Marshall’s Jurisprudence on Law and
Politics, 52 Howard L. J. 655, 669 (2009) (Austin “has been
understood by most commentators to be an opinion driven
by equality considerations, albeit disguised in the lan

It should not be surprising, then, that Members of the
Court have relied on Austin’s expansive logic to justify

justifies prohibiting corporate speech because such speech
