Opinion of STEVENS, J.

528 U. S. 32, 47, n. 4 (1999) (STEVENS, J., dissenting),
particularly those that may reflect invidious discrimina­
tion or preferential treatment of a politically powerful
group. But it is simply incorrect to suggest that we have
prohibited all legislative distinctions based on identity or
content. Not even close.
The election context is distinctive in many ways, and the
Court, of course, is right that the First Amendment closely
guards political speech. But in this context, too, the au­
thority of legislatures to enact viewpoint-neutral regula­
tions based on content and identity is well settled. We
have, for example, allowed state-run broadcasters to ex­
clude independent candidates from televised debates.
Arkansas Ed. Television Comm’n v. Forbes, 523 U. S. 666
(1998).48 We have upheld statutes that prohibit the distri­
bution or display of campaign materials near a polling
place. Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992).49 Al­
though we have not reviewed them directly, we have never
cast doubt on laws that place special restrictions on cam­
paign spending by foreign nationals. See, e.g., 2 U. S. C.
§441e(a)(1). And we have consistently approved laws that
bar Government employees, but not others, from contrib­

48 I dissented in Forbes because the broadcaster’s decision to exclude
the respondent from its debate was done “on the basis of entirely
subjective, ad hoc judgments,” 523 U. S., at 690, that suggested anti­
competitive viewpoint discrimination, id., at 693–694, and lacked a
compelling justification. Needless to say, my concerns do not apply to
the instant case.
49 The law at issue in Burson was far from unusual. “[A]ll 50 States,”
the Court observed, “limit access to the areas in or around polling
places.” 504 U. S., at 206; see also Note, 91 Ky. L. J. 715, 729, n. 89,
747–769 (2003) (collecting statutes). I dissented in Burson because the
evidence adduced to justify Tennessee’s law was “exceptionally thin,”
504 U. S., at 219, and “the reason for [the] restriction [had] disap­
pear[ed]” over time, id., at 223. “In short,” I concluded, “Tennessee
ha[d] failed to point to any legitimate interest that would justify its
selective regulation of campaign-related expression.” Id., at 225. These
criticisms are inapplicable to the case before us.
