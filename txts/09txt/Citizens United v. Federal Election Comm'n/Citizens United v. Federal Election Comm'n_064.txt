Opinion of the Court

and design.
Some members of the public might consider Hillary to
be insightful and instructive; some might find it to be
neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the
Nation’s course; still others simply might suspend judg
ment on these points but decide to think more about issues
and candidates. Those choices and assessments, however,
are not for the Government to make. “The First Amend
ment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create
in the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free
to use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of
ideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the
Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct
it.” McConnell, supra, at 341 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).
The judgment of the District Court is reversed with
respect to the constitutionality of 2 U. S. C. §441b’s re
strictions on corporate independent expenditures. The
judgment is affirmed with respect to BCRA’s disclaimer
and disclosure requirements. The case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
