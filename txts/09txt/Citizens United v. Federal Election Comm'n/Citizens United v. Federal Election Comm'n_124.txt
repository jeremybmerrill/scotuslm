Opinion of STEVENS, J.

The Framers thus took it as a given that corporations
could be comprehensively regulated in the service of the
public welfare. Unlike our colleagues, they had little
trouble distinguishing corporations from human beings,
and when they constitutionalized the right to free speech
in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individ­
ual Americans that they had in mind.55 While individuals
might join together to exercise their speech rights, busi­
ness corporations, at least, were plainly not seen as facili­
tating such associational or expressive ends. Even “the
notion that business corporations could invoke the First
Amendment would probably have been quite a novelty,”
given that “at the time, the legitimacy of every corporate
activity was thought to rest entirely in a concession of the
sovereign.” Shelledy, Autonomy, Debate, and Corporate
Speech, 18 Hastings Const. L. Q. 541, 578 (1991); cf. Trus
tees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 636

55 In normal usage then, as now, the term “speech” referred to oral
communications by individuals. See, e.g., 2 S. Johnson, Dictionary of
the English Language 1853–1854 (4th ed. 1773) (reprinted 1978)
(listing as primary definition of “speech”: “The power of articulate
utterance; the power of expressing thoughts by vocal words”); 2 N.
Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (re­
printed 1970) (listing as primary definition of “speech”: “The faculty of
uttering articulate sounds or words, as in human beings; the faculty of
expressing thoughts by words or articulate sounds. Speech was given
to man by his Creator for the noblest purposes”). Indeed, it has been
“claimed that the notion of institutional speech . . . did not exist in post­
revolutionary America.” Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment
Speakers, 100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006); see also Bezanson,
Institutional Speech, 80 Iowa L. Rev. 735, 775 (1995) (“In the intellec­
tual heritage of the eighteenth century, the idea that free speech was
individual and personal was deeply rooted and clearly manifest in the
writings of Locke, Milton, and others on whom the framers of the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights drew”). Given that corporations
were conceived of as artificial entities and do not have the technical
capacity to “speak,” the burden of establishing that the Framers and
ratifiers understood “the freedom of speech” to encompass corporate
speech is, I believe, far heavier than the majority acknowledges.
