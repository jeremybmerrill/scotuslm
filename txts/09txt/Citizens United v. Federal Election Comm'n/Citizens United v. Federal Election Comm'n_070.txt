CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
ROBERTS, C. J., concurring

to the proper exercise of the judicial function. “Stare
decisis is the preferred course because it promotes the
evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of
legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and
contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the
judicial process.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827
(1991). For these reasons, we have long recognized that
departures from precedent are inappropriate in the ab
sence of a “special justification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467
U. S. 203, 212 (1984).
At the same time, stare decisis is neither an “inexorable
command,” Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 577 (2003),
nor “a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest deci
sion,” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940),
especially in constitutional cases, see United States v.
Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 101 (1978). If it were, segregation
would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitu
tional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary crimi
nal suspects without first obtaining warrants. See Plessy
v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), overruled by Brown v.
Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); Adkins v. Chil­
dren’s Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S. 525 (1923), overruled by
West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937);
Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), overruled
by Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967). As the
dissent properly notes, none of us has viewed stare decisis
in such absolute terms. Post, at 17; see also, e.g., Randall
v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 274–281 (2006) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting) (urging the Court to overrule its invalidation of
limits on independent expenditures on political speech in
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam)).
Stare decisis is instead a “principle of policy.” Helvering,
supra, at 119. When considering whether to reexamine a
prior erroneous holding, we must balance the importance
of having constitutional questions decided against the
importance of having them decided right. As Justice
