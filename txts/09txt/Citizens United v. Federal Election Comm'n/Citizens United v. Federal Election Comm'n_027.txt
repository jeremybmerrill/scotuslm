CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

J., concurring); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 97–98
(1940). For these reasons we find it necessary to recon
sider Austin.

The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall
make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” Laws
enacted to control or suppress speech may operate at
different points in the speech process. The following are
just a few examples of restrictions that have been at

§441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial
phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts
the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors
logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association
publishes a book urging the public to vote for the chal
