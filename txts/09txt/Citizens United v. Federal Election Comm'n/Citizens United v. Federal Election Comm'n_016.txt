Opinion of the Court 


C

Citizens United further contends that §441b should be
invalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on
demand, arguing that this delivery system has a lower
risk of distorting the political process than do television
ads. Cf. McConnell, supra, at 207. On what we might call
conventional television, advertising spots reach viewers
who have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unre
lated to the advertising. With video-on-demand, by con
trast, the viewer selects a program after taking “a series of
affirmative steps”: subscribing to cable; navigating
through various menus; and selecting the program. See
Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 867
(1997).
While some means of communication may be less effec
tive than others at influencing the public in different
contexts, any effort by the Judiciary to decide which
means of communications are to be preferred for the par
ticular type of message and speaker would raise questions
as to the courts’ own lawful authority. Substantial ques
tions would arise if courts were to begin saying what
means of speech should be preferred or disfavored. And in
all events, those differentiations might soon prove to be
irrelevant or outdated by technologies that are in rapid
flux. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512
U. S. 622, 639 (1994).
Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment. We
must decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional
lines based on the particular media or technology used to
disseminate political speech from a particular speaker. It
must be noted, moreover, that this undertaking would
require substantial litigation over an extended time, all to
interpret a law that beyond doubt discloses serious First
Amendment flaws. The interpretive process itself would
create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling
protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions
