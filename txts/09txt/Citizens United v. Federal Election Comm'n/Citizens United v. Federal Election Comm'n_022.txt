Opinion of the Court

validity of §441b.
When the statute now at issue came before the Court in
McConnell, both the majority and the dissenting opinions
considered the question of its facial validity. The holding
and validity of Austin were essential to the reasoning of
the McConnell majority opinion, which upheld BCRA’s
extension of §441b. See 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting Austin,
494 U. S., at 660). McConnell permitted federal felony
punishment for speech by all corporations, including
nonprofit ones, that speak on prohibited subjects shortly
before federal elections. See 540 U. S., at 203–209. Four
Members of the McConnell Court would have overruled
Austin, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had joined
the Court’s opinion in Austin but reconsidered that conclu
sion. See 540 U. S., at 256–262 (SCALIA, J., concurring in
part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in
part); id., at 273–275 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part,
concurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in
part, and dissenting in part); id., at 322–338 (opinion of
KENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and SCALIA, J.).
That inquiry into the facial validity of the statute was
facilitated by the extensive record, which was “over
100,000 pages” long, made in the three-judge District
Court.

F. Supp. 2d 176, 209 (DC 2003) (per curiam) (McConnell
I). It is not the case, then, that the Court today is prema
ture in interpreting §441b “ ‘on the basis of [a] factually
barebones recor[d].’ ” Washington State Grange v. Wash

(quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 609 (2004)).
The McConnell majority considered whether the statute
was facially invalid. An as-applied challenge was brought
in Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election
Comm’n, 546 U. S. 410, 411–412 (2006) (per curiam), and
the Court confirmed that the challenge could be main
tained. Then, in WRTL, the controlling opinion of the
