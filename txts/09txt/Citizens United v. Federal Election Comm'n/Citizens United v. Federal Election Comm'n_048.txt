Opinion of the Court

With regard to large direct contributions, Buckley rea
soned that they could be given “to secure a political quid
pro quo,” id., at 26, and that “the scope of such pernicious
practices can never be reliably ascertained,” id., at 27.
The practices Buckley noted would be covered by bribery
laws, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §201, if a quid pro quo arrange
ment were proved. See Buckley, supra, at 27, and n. 28
(citing Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F. 2d 821, 839–840, and nn.
36–38 (CADC 1975) (en banc) (per curiam)). The Court, in
consequence, has noted that restrictions on direct contri
butions are preventative, because few if any contributions
to candidates will involve quid pro quo arrangements.
MCFL, 479 U. S., at 260; NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500; Fed
eral Election Comm’n v. National Right to Work Comm.,
459 U. S. 197, 210 (1982) (NRWC). The Buckley Court,
nevertheless, sustained limits on direct contributions in
order to ensure against the reality or appearance of cor
ruption. That case did not extend this rationale to inde
pendent expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.
“The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an
expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only
undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate,
but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be
given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from
the candidate.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 47; see ibid. (inde
pendent expenditures have a “substantially diminished
potential for abuse”). Limits on independent expendi
tures, such as §441b, have a chilling effect extending well
beyond the Government’s interest in preventing quid pro
quo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not suffi
cient to displace the speech here in question. Indeed, 26
States do not restrict independent expenditures by for
profit corporations. The Government does not claim that
these expenditures have corrupted the political process in
those States. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 18, n. 3; Supp.
Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of
