CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

U. S. 652, should be and now is overruled. We return to
the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the
Government may not suppress political speech on the
basis of the speaker’s corporate identity. No sufficient
governmental interest justifies limits on the political
speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.
D
Austin is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing
the Government to limit corporate independent expendi
tures. As the Government appears to concede, overruling
Austin “effectively invalidate[s] not only BCRA Section
203, but also 2 U. S. C. 441b’s prohibition on the use of
corporate treasury funds for express advocacy.” Brief for
Appellee 33, n. 12. Section 441b’s restrictions on corporate
independent expenditures are therefore invalid and can
not be applied to Hillary.
Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule
the part of McConnell that upheld BCRA §203’s extension
of §441b’s restrictions on corporate independent expendi
tures. See 540 U. S., at 203–209. The McConnell Court
relied on the antidistortion interest recognized in Austin
to uphold a greater restriction on speech than the restric
tion upheld in Austin, see 540 U. S., at 205, and we have
found this interest unconvincing and insufficient. This
part of McConnell is now overruled.

disclosure provisions as applied to Hillary and the three
advertisements for the movie. Under BCRA §311, tele
vised electioneering communications funded by anyone
other than a candidate must include a disclaimer that
“ ‘_______ is responsible for the content of this advertis
ing.’ ” 2 U. S. C. §441d(d)(2). The required statement
