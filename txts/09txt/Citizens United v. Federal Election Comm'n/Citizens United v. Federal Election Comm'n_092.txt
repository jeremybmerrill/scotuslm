Opinion of STEVENS, J.

zens United expressly abandoned its facial challenge,
1:07–cv–2240–RCL–RWR, Docket Entry No. 52, pp. 1–2
(May 16, 2008), and the parties stipulated to the dismissal
of that claim, id., Nos. 53 (May 22, 2008), 54 (May 23,
2008), App. 6a. The District Court therefore resolved the
case on alternative grounds,3 and in its jurisdictional
statement to this Court, Citizens United properly advised
us that it was raising only “an as-applied challenge to the
constitutionality of . . . BCRA §203.” Juris. Statement 5.
The jurisdictional statement never so much as cited Aus
tin, the key case the majority today overrules. And not
one of the questions presented suggested that Citizens
United was surreptitiously raising the facial challenge to
§203 that it previously agreed to dismiss. In fact, not one
of those questions raised an issue based on Citizens
United’s corporate status. Juris. Statement (i). Moreover,
even in its merits briefing, when Citizens United injected
its request to overrule Austin, it never sought a declara­
tion that §203 was facially unconstitutional as to all corpo­
rations and unions; instead it argued only that the statute
could not be applied to it because it was “funded over­
whelmingly by individuals.” Brief for Appellant 29; see
also id., at 10, 12, 16, 28 (affirming “as applied” character

3 The

majority states that, in denying Citizens United’s motion for a
preliminary injunction, the District Court “addressed” the facial valid­
ity of BCRA §203. Ante, at 13. That is true, in the narrow sense that
the court observed the issue was foreclosed by McConnell v. FEC, 540
U. S. 93 (2003). See 530 F. Supp. 2d 274, 278 (DC 2008) (per curiam).
Yet as explained above, Citizens United subsequently dismissed its
facial challenge, so that by the time the District Court granted the
Federal Election Commission’s (FEC) motion for summary judgment,
App. 261a–262a, any question about statutory validity had dropped out
of the case. That latter ruling by the District Court was the “final
decision” from which Citizens United appealed to this Court under
BCRA §403(a)(3). As regards the lower court decision that has come
before us, the claim that §203 is facially unconstitutional was neither
pressed nor passed upon in any form.
