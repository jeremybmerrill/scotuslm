Opinion of the Court

ment has a compelling interest in preventing foreign
individuals or associations from influencing our Nation’s
political process. Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and
expenditure ban applied to “foreign national[s]”). Section
441b is not limited to corporations or associations that
were created in foreign countries or funded predominately
by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be
overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Gov

influence over our political process. See Broadrick, 413

Our precedent is to be respected unless the most con

U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (overruling Saucier v.
Katz, 533 U. S. 194 (2001)).
These considerations counsel in favor of rejecting Aus
tin, which itself contravened this Court’s earlier prece

tated to overrule decisions offensive to the First
Amendment.” WRTL, 551 U. S., at 500 (opinion of SCALIA,
J.). “[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a me
chanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.”
Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).
For the reasons above, it must be concluded that Austin
was not well reasoned. The Government defends Austin,
