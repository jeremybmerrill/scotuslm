CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

2. Legislative and Judicial Interpretation
A century of more recent history puts to rest any notion
that today’s ruling is faithful to our First Amendment
tradition. At the federal level, the express distinction
between corporate and individual political spending on
elections stretches back to 1907, when Congress passed
the Tillman Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864, banning all corpo­
rate contributions to candidates. The Senate Report on
the legislation observed that “[t]he evils of the use of
[corporate] money in connection with political elections are
so generally recognized that the committee deems it un­

of public officials.” S. Rep. No. 3056, 59th Cong., 1st Sess.,

“ ‘All contributions by corporations to any political
committee or for any political purpose should be for­

went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed

Cong. Rec. 96).
The Court has surveyed the history leading up to the
Tillman Act several times, see WRTL, 551 U. S., at 508–
510 (Souter, J., dissenting); McConnell, 540 U. S., at 115;
Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 570–575, and I will
refrain from doing so again. It is enough to say that the
Act was primarily driven by two pressing concerns: first,
the enormous power corporations had come to wield in
federal elections, with the accompanying threat of both
actual corruption and a public perception of corruption;
