been disclosing its donors for years and has identified no
instance of harassment or retaliation.
Shareholder objections raised through the procedures of
corporate democracy, see Bellotti, supra, at 794, and n. 34,
can be more effective today because modern technology
makes disclosures rapid and informative. A campaign
finance system that pairs corporate independent expendi

political speech advances the corporation’s interest in
making profits, and citizens can see whether elected offi
cials are “ ‘in the pocket’ of so-called moneyed interests.”

the application of BCRA’s disclaimer and disclosure re
