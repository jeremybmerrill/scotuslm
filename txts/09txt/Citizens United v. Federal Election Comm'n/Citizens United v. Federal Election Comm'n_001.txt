CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION

COMMISSION 

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
No. 08–205.

Argued March 24, 2009—Reargued September 9, 2009––
Decided January 21, 2010

As amended by §203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002
(BCRA), federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using
their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for
speech that is an “electioneering communication” or for speech that
expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate. 2 U. S. C.
§441b. An electioneering communication is “any broadcast, cable, or
satellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified candidate
for Federal office” and is made within 30 days of a primary election,
§434(f)(3)(A), and that is “publicly distributed,” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2),
which in “the case of a candidate for nomination for President . . .
means” that the communication “[c]an be received by 50,000 or more
persons in a State where a primary election . . . is being held within
30 days,” §100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions may establish a
political action committee (PAC) for express advocacy or electioneer
ing communications purposes. 2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(2). In McConnell
v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 203–209, this Court upheld
limits on electioneering communications in a facial challenge, relying
on the holding in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494
U. S. 652, that political speech may be banned based on the speaker’s
corporate identity.
In January 2008, appellant Citizens United, a nonprofit corpora
tion, released a documentary (hereinafter Hillary) critical of thenSenator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party’s Presidential
nomination. Anticipating that it would make Hillary available on
cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary
elections, Citizens United produced television ads to run on broadcast
