corporation.” J. Hurst, The Legitimacy of the Business
Corporation in the Law of the United States 1780–1970,
pp. 15–16 (1970) (reprint 2004). Corporations were cre­
ated, supervised, and conceptualized as quasi-public enti­
ties, “designed to serve a social function for the state.”
Handlin & Handlin, Origin of the American Business
Corporation, 5 J. Econ. Hist. 1, 22 (1945). It was “as­
sumed that [they] were legally privileged organizations
that had to be closely scrutinized by the legislature be­
cause their purposes had to be made consistent with pub­
lic welfare.” R. Seavoy, Origins of the American Business
Corporation, 1784–1855, p. 5 (1982).
The individualized charter mode of incorporation re­
flected the “cloud of disfavor under which corporations
labored” in the early years of this Nation. 1 W. Fletcher,
Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §2, p. 8 (rev. ed.
2006); see also Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee, 288 U. S. 517,
548–549 (1933) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (discussing fears
of the “evils” of business corporations); L. Friedman, A
History of American Law 194 (2d ed. 1985) (“The word
‘soulless’ constantly recurs in debates over corpora­
tions. . . . Corporations, it was feared, could concentrate
the worst urges of whole groups of men”). Thomas Jeffer­
son famously fretted that corporations would subvert the
Republic.54 General incorporation statutes, and wide­
spread acceptance of business corporations as socially
useful actors, did not emerge until the 1800’s. See Hans­
mann & Kraakman, The End of History for Corporate
Law, 89 Geo. L. J. 439, 440 (2001) (hereinafter Hansmann
& Kraakman) (“[A]ll general business corporation statutes
appear to date from well after 1800”).

shall . . . crush in [its] birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations
which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength
and bid defiance to the laws of our country”).
