Act in 1907 and subsequent legislation, see Pipefitters v.
United States, 407 U. S. 385, 414–415 (1972); Winkler, 92
Geo. L. J., at 887–900, and it has been endorsed in a long
line of our cases, see, e.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 204–
205; Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 152–154; MCFL, 479 U. S., at
258; NRWC, 459 U. S., at 207–208; Pipefitters, 407 U. S.,
at 414–416; see also n. 60, supra. Indeed, we have unani­

left open, ranging from new versions of §203 supported by additional
evidence of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance to any number of
tax incentive or public financing schemes, today’s decision does not
require that a legislature rely solely on these mechanisms to protect
shareholders. Legislatures remain free in their incorporation and tax
laws to condition the types of activity in which corporations may
engage, including electioneering activity, on specific disclosure re­
quirements or on prior express approval by shareholders or members.
