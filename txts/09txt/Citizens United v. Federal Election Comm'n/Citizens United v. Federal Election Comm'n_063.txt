When word concerning the plot of the movie Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington reached the circles of Government,
some officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its

to speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems
stranger than fiction for our Government to make this
political speech a crime. Yet this is the statute’s purpose
