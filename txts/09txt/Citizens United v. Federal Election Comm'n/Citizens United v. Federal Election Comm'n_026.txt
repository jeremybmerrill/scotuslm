Opinion of the Court

an independent branch of government—to the constitu
tionally protected interests in free expression.” Freedman
v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 57–58 (1965). When the FEC
issues advisory opinions that prohibit speech, “[m]any
persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden
(and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through
case-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from
protected speech—harming not only themselves but soci
ety as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited mar
ketplace of ideas.” Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 119
(2003) (citation omitted). Consequently, “the censor’s
determination may in practice be final.” Freedman, supra,
at 58.
This is precisely what WRTL sought to avoid. WRTL
said that First Amendment standards “must eschew ‘the
open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,’ which ‘invit[es]
complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevita
ble appeal.’ ” 551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)
(quoting Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &
Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 547 (1995); alteration in original).
Yet, the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select
what political speech is safe for public consumption by
applying ambiguous tests. If parties want to avoid litiga
tion and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they
must either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue
an advisory opinion approving of the political speech in
question. Government officials pore over each word of a
text to see if, in their judgment, it accords with the 11
factor test they have promulgated. This is an unprece
dented governmental intervention into the realm of
speech.
The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt
protected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the
earlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can
and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has
been demonstrated. See WRTL, supra, at 482–483 (ALITO,
