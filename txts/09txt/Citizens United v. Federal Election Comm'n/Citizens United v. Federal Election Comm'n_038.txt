Opinion of the Court

“In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is
constitutionally disqualified from dictating the sub

ling governmental interest in preventing “the corrosive
and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth
that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form
and that have little or no correlation to the public’s sup
