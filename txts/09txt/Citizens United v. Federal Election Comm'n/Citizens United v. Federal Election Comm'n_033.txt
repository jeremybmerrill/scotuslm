associations, like individuals, contribute to the ‘discussion,
debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas’

argument that political speech of corporations or other
associations should be treated differently under the First
Amendment simply because such associations are not

laws of some States and of the United States imposed a
ban on corporate direct contributions to candidates. See
B. Smith, Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance
Reform 23 (2001). Yet not until 1947 did Congress first
prohibit independent expenditures by corporations and
