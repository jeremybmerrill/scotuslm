CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of the Court

only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribu

comes the supporter favors. Democracy is premised
on responsiveness.” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 297
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).

process right to a fair trial before an unbiased judge. See
Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 46 (1975). Caperton’s
holding was limited to the rule that the judge must be
