Opinion of the Court

First, even if a party could somehow waive a facial
challenge while preserving an as-applied challenge, that
would not prevent the Court from reconsidering Austin or
addressing the facial validity of §441b in this case. “Our
practice ‘permit[s] review of an issue not pressed [below]
so long as it has been passed upon . . . .’ ” Lebron, 513
U. S., at 379 (quoting United States v. Williams, 504 U. S.
36, 41 (1992); first alteration in original). And here, the
District Court addressed Citizens United’s facial chal
lenge. See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 278 (“Citizens wants us to
enjoin the operation of BCRA §203 as a facially unconsti
tutional burden on the First Amendment right to freedom
of speech”). In rejecting the claim, it noted that it “would
have to overrule McConnell” for Citizens United to prevail
on its facial challenge and that “[o]nly the Supreme Court
may overrule its decisions.” Ibid. (citing Rodriguez de
Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477,
484 (1989)). The District Court did not provide much
analysis regarding the facial challenge because it could
not ignore the controlling Supreme Court decisions in
Austin or McConnell. Even so, the District Court did
“ ‘pas[s] upon’ ” the issue. Lebron, supra, at 379. Fur
thermore, the District Court’s later opinion, which granted
the FEC summary judgment, was “[b]ased on the reason
ing of [its] prior opinion,” which included the discussion of
the facial challenge. App. 261a (citing 530 F. Supp. 2d
274). After the District Court addressed the facial validity
of the statute, Citizens United raised its challenge to
Austin in this Court. See Brief for Appellant 30 (“Austin
was wrongly decided and should be overruled”); id., at 30–
32. In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider
Citizens United’s challenge to Austin and the facial valid
ity of §441b’s expenditure ban.
Second, throughout the litigation, Citizens United has
asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its First
Amendment right to free speech. All concede that this
