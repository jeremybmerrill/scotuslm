CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

lenge that dropped out of this case 20 months ago.
Narrower Grounds
It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have
manufactured a facial challenge, because the parties have
advanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would
facilitate electioneering by nonprofit advocacy corpora­
tions such as Citizens United, without toppling statutes
and precedents. Which is to say, the majority has trans­
gressed yet another “cardinal” principle of the judicial
process: “[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is neces­
sary not to decide more,” PDK Labs., Inc. v. Drug En
forcement Admin., 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (Rob­
erts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
Consider just three of the narrower grounds of decision
that the majority has bypassed. First, the Court could
have ruled, on statutory grounds, that a feature-length
film distributed through video-on-demand does not qualify
as an “electioneering communication” under §203 of
BCRA, 2 U. S. C. §441b. BCRA defines that term to en­
compass certain communications transmitted by “broad­
cast, cable, or satellite.” §434(f)(3)(A). When Congress
was developing BCRA, the video-on-demand medium was
still in its infancy, and legislators were focused on a very
different sort of programming: short advertisements run
on television or radio. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 207.
The sponsors of BCRA acknowledge that the FEC’s im­
plementing regulations do not clearly apply to video-on­
demand transmissions.
See Brief for Senator John
McCain et al. as Amici Curiae 17–19. In light of this
ambiguity, the distinctive characteristics of video-on­
demand, and “[t]he elementary rule . . . that every reason­
able construction must be resorted to, in order to save a
statute from unconstitutionality,” Hooper v. California,
155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895), the Court could have reasonably
