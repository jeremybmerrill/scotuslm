Opinion of the Court 


II 

Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is
entitled to “the effective assistance of competent counsel.”
McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771 (1970); Strick
land, 466 U. S., at 686. The Supreme Court of Kentucky
rejected Padilla’s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that
the advice he sought about the risk of deportation con
cerned only collateral matters, i.e., those matters not
within the sentencing authority of the state trial court.8
253 S. W. 3d, at 483–484 (citing Commonwealth v. Fuar
tado, 170 S. W. 3d 384 (2005)). In its view, “collateral
consequences are outside the scope of representation
required by the Sixth Amendment,” and, therefore, the
“failure of defense counsel to advise the defendant of
possible deportation consequences is not cognizable as a
claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.” 253 S. W. 3d,
at 483. The Kentucky high court is far from alone in this
view.9

8 There is some disagreement among the courts over how to distin
guish between direct and collateral consequences. See Roberts, Igno
rance is Effectively Bliss: Collateral Consequences, Silence, and Misin
formation in the Guilty-Plea Process, 95 Iowa L. Rev. 119, 124, n. 15
(2009). The disagreement over how to apply the direct/collateral
distinction has no bearing on the disposition of this case because, as
even JUSTICE ALITO agrees, counsel must, at the very least, advise a
noncitizen “defendant that a criminal conviction may have adverse
immigration consequences,” post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).
See also post, at 14 (“I do not mean to suggest that the Sixth Amend
ment does no more than require defense counsel to avoid misinforma
tion”). In his concurring opinion, JUSTICE ALITO has thus departed from
the strict rule applied by the Supreme Court of Kentucky and in the
two federal cases that he cites, post, at 2.

States v. Del Rosario, 902 F. 2d 55 (CADC 1990); United States v.
Yearwood, 863 F. 2d 6 (CA4 1988); Santos-Sanchez v. United States,
548 F. 3d 327 (CA5 2008); Broomes v. Ashcroft, 358 F. 3d 1251 (CA10
2004); United States v. Campbell, 778 F. 2d 764 (CA11 1985); Oyekoya
v. State, 558 So. 2d 990 (Ala. Ct. Crim. App. 1989); State v. Rosas, 183
