PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
Opinion of the Court

posited by JUSTICE ALITO), a criminal defense attorney
need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pend
ing criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigra
tion consequences.10 But when the deportation conse
quence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to
give correct advice is equally clear.
Accepting his allegations as true, Padilla has suffi
ciently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy the first
prong of Strickland. Whether Padilla is entitled to relief
on his claim will depend on whether he can satisfy Strick
land’s second prong, prejudice, a matter we leave to the
Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance.
IV
The Solicitor General has urged us to conclude that
Strickland applies to Padilla’s claim only to the extent
that he has alleged affirmative misadvice. In the United
States’ view, “counsel is not constitutionally required to
provide advice on matters that will not be decided in the
criminal case . . . ,” though counsel is required to provide
accurate advice if she chooses to discusses these matters.
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10.
Respondent and Padilla both find the Solicitor General’s
proposed rule unpersuasive, although it has support
among the lower courts. See, e.g., United States v. Couto,
311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); United States v. Kwan, 407
F. 3d 1005 (CA9 2005); Sparks v. Sowders, 852 F. 2d 882
(CA6 1988); United States v. Russell, 686 F. 2d 35 (CADC
1982); State v. Rojas-Martinez, 2005 UT 86, 125 P. 3d 930,
935; In re Resendiz, 25 Cal. 4th 230, 19 P. 3d 1171 (2001).
Kentucky describes these decisions isolating an affirma
tive misadvice claim as “result-driven, incestuous . . .

10 As

JUSTICE ALITO explains at length, deportation consequences are
often unclear. Lack of clarity in the law, however, does not obviate the
need for counsel to say something about the possibility of deportation,
even though it will affect the scope and nature of counsel’s advice.
