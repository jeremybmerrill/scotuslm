Opinion of the Court

is thus ill-suited to evaluating a Strickland claim concern
ing the specific risk of deportation. We conclude that
advice regarding deportation is not categorically removed
from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
Strickland applies to Padilla’s claim.
III
Under Strickland, we first determine whether counsel’s
representation “fell below an objective standard of reason
ableness.” 466 U. S., at 688. Then we ask whether “there
is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unpro
fessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have
been different.” Id., at 694. The first prong—constitu
tional deficiency—is necessarily linked to the practice and
expectations of the legal community: “The proper measure
of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness
under prevailing professional norms.” Id., at 688. We long
have recognized that “[p]revailing norms of practice as
reflected in American Bar Association standards and the
like . . . are guides to determining what is reasonable . . . .”
Ibid.; Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per
curiam) (slip op., at 3); Florida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175,
191, and n. 6 (2004); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524
(2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 396 (2000).
Although they are “only guides,” Strickland, 466 U. S., at
688, and not “inexorable commands,” Bobby, 558 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 5), these standards may be valuable meas
ures of the prevailing professional norms of effective rep
resentation, especially as these standards have been
adapted to deal with the intersection of modern criminal
prosecutions and immigration law.
The weight of prevailing professional norms supports
the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the
risk of deportation. National Legal Aid and Defender
