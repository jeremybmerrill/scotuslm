JOSE PADILLA, PETITIONER v. KENTUCKY
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

KENTUCKY

[March 31, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner Jose Padilla, a native of Honduras, has been
a lawful permanent resident of the United States for more
than 40 years. Padilla served this Nation with honor as a
member of the U. S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam
War. He now faces deportation after pleading guilty to the
transportation of a large amount of marijuana in his
tractor-trailer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.1
In this postconviction proceeding, Padilla claims that his
counsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence
prior to his entering the plea, but also told him that he
“ ‘did not have to worry about immigration status since he
had been in the country so long.’ ” 253 S. W. 3d 482, 483
(Ky. 2008). Padilla relied on his counsel’s erroneous ad
vice when he pleaded guilty to the drug charges that made
his deportation virtually mandatory. He alleges that he
would have insisted on going to trial if he had not received
incorrect advice from his attorney.
Assuming the truth of his allegations, the Supreme
——————
1 Padilla’s crime, like virtually every drug offense except for only the
most insignificant marijuana offenses, is a deportable offense under 8
U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(B)(i).
