PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

the considered and thus far unanimous view of the lower
federal courts charged with administering Strickland
clearly supports the conclusion that that Kentucky Su
preme Court’s position goes too far.
In concluding that affirmative misadvice regarding the
removal consequences of a criminal conviction may consti
tute ineffective assistance, I do not mean to suggest that
the Sixth Amendment does no more than require defense
counsel to avoid misinformation. When a criminal defense
attorney is aware that a client is an alien, the attorney
should advise the client that a criminal conviction may
have adverse consequences under the immigration laws
and that the client should consult an immigration special
ist if the client wants advice on that subject. By putting
the client on notice of the danger of removal, such advice
would significantly reduce the chance that the client
would plead guilty under a mistaken premise.
III
In sum, a criminal defense attorney should not be re
quired to provide advice on immigration law, a complex
specialty that generally lies outside the scope of a criminal
defense attorney’s expertise. On the other hand, any
competent criminal defense attorney should appreciate the
extraordinary importance that the risk of removal might
have in the client’s determination whether to enter a
guilty plea.
Accordingly, unreasonable and incorrect
information concerning the risk of removal can give rise to
an ineffectiveness claim. In addition, silence alone is not
enough to satisfy counsel’s duty to assist the client. In
stead, an alien defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to
counsel is satisfied if defense counsel advises the client
that a conviction may have immigration consequences,
that immigration law is a specialized field, that the attor
ney is not an immigration lawyer, and that the client
should consult an immigration specialist if the client
wants advice on that subject.
