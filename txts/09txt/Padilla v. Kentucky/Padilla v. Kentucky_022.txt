JOSE PADILLA, PETITIONER v. KENTUCKY
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

KENTUCKY

[March 31, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,
concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the judgment because a criminal defense
attorney fails to provide effective assistance within the
meaning of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668
(1984), if the attorney misleads a noncitizen client regard
ing the removal consequences of a conviction. In my view,
such an attorney must (1) refrain from unreasonably
providing incorrect advice and (2) advise the defendant
that a criminal conviction may have adverse immigration
consequences and that, if the alien wants advice on this
issue, the alien should consult an immigration attorney. I
do not agree with the Court that the attorney must at
tempt to explain what those consequences may be. As the
Court concedes, “[i]mmigration law can be complex”; “it is
a legal specialty of its own”; and “[s]ome members of the
bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in
either state or federal court or both, may not be well
versed in it.” Ante, at 11. The Court nevertheless holds
that a criminal defense attorney must provide advice in
this specialized area in those cases in which the law is
“succinct and straightforward”—but not, perhaps, in other
situations. Ante, at 11–12. This vague, halfway test will
lead to much confusion and needless litigation.
