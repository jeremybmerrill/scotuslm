ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

lower courts considering claims of ineffective assistance in
the plea context have [distinguished] between defense
counsel who remain silent and defense counsel who give
affirmative misadvice.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 8 (citing cases). At least three Courts of Appeals
have held that affirmative misadvice on immigration
matters can give rise to ineffective assistance of counsel,
at least in some circumstances.3 And several other Circuits have held that affirmative misadvice concerning

United States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); Downs-Morgan
v. United States, 765 F. 2d 1534, 1540–1541 (CA11 1985) (limiting
holding to the facts of the case); see also Santos-Sanchez v. United
States, 548 F. 3d 327, 333–334 (CA5 2008) (concluding that counsel’s
advice was not objectively unreasonable where counsel did not purport
to answer questions about immigration law, did not claim any expertise
in immigration law, and simply warned of “possible” deportation
consequence; use of the word “possible” was not an affirmative misrepresentation, even though it could indicate that deportation was not a
certain consequence).

(“[T]he erroneous parole-eligibility advice given to Mr. Hill was ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington”); Sparks v.
Sowders, 852 F. 2d 882, 885 (CA6 1988) (“[G]ross misadvice concerning
parole eligibility can amount to ineffective assistance of counsel”); id.,
at 886 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“When the maximum possible exposure is overstated, the defendant might well be influenced to accept a
plea agreement he would otherwise reject”); Strader v. Garrison, 611
F. 2d 61, 65 (CA4 1979) (“[T]hough parole eligibility dates are collateral
consequences of the entry of a guilty plea of which a defendant need not
be informed if he does not inquire, when he is grossly misinformed
about it by his lawyer, and relies upon that misinformation, he is
deprived of his constitutional right to counsel”).
