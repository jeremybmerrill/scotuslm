PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
SCALIA, J., dissenting

permanent, and legislatively irreparable, overkill.

The Sixth Amendment as originally understood and
ratified meant only that a defendant had a right to employ
counsel, or to use volunteered services of counsel. See,
United States v. Van Duzee, 140 U. S. 169, 173 (1891); W.
Beaney, Right to Counsel in American Courts 21, 28–29
(1955). We have held, however, that the Sixth Amend
ment requires the provision of counsel to indigent defen
dants at government expense, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372
U. S. 335, 344–345 (1963), and that the right to “the assis
tance of counsel” includes the right to effective assistance,
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686 (1984). Even
assuming the validity of these holdings, I reject the sig
nificant further extension that the Court, and to a lesser
extent the concurrence, would create. We have until today
at least retained the Sixth Amendment’s textual limita
tion to criminal prosecutions. “[W]e have held that ‘de
fence’ means defense at trial, not defense in relation to
other objectives that may be important to the accused.”
Rothgery v. Gillespie County, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)
(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4) (summarizing cases).
We have limited the Sixth Amendment to legal advice
directly related to defense against prosecution of the
charged offense—advice at trial, of course, but also advice
at postindictment interrogations and lineups, Massiah v.
United States, 377 U. S. 201, 205–206 (1964); United
States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 236–238 (1967), and in
general advice at all phases of the prosecution where the
defendant would be at a disadvantage when pitted alone
against the legally trained agents of the state, see Moran
v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 430 (1986). Not only have we
not required advice of counsel regarding consequences
collateral to prosecution, we have not even required coun
sel appointed to defend against one prosecution to be
