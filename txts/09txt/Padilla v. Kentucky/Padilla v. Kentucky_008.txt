Opinion of the Court

available to avoid deportation in narcotics convictions.
See United States v. O’Rourke, 213 F. 2d 759, 762 (CA8
1954). Except for “technical, inadvertent and insignificant
violations of the laws relating to narcotics,” ibid., it ap
pears that courts treated narcotics offenses as crimes
involving moral turpitude for purposes of the 1917 Act’s
broad JRAD provision. See ibid. (recognizing that until
1952 a JRAD in a narcotics case “was effective to prevent
deportation” (citing Dang Nam v. Bryan, 74 F. 2d 379,
380–381 (CA9 1934))).
In light of both the steady expansion of deportable
offenses and the significant ameliorative effect of a JRAD,
it is unsurprising that, in the wake of Strickland v. Wash
ington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the Second Circuit held that
the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of
counsel applies to a JRAD request or lack thereof, see
Janvier, 793 F. 2d 449. See also United States v. Castro,
26 F. 3d 557 (CA5 1994). In its view, seeking a JRAD was
“part of the sentencing” process, Janvier, 793 F. 2d, at 452,
even if deportation itself is a civil action. Under the Sec
ond Circuit’s reasoning, the impact of a conviction on a
noncitizen’s ability to remain in the country was a central
issue to be resolved during the sentencing process—not
merely a collateral matter outside the scope of counsel’s
duty to provide effective representation.
However, the JRAD procedure is no longer part of our
law. Congress first circumscribed the JRAD provision in
the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),5 and in
——————
Que Fong v. Nagle, 15 F. 2d 789, 790 (CA9 1926); thus, a narcotics
offense did not need also to be a crime of moral turpitude (or to satisfy
other requirements of the 1917 Act) to trigger deportation. See United
States ex rel. Grimaldi v. Ebey, 12 F. 2d 922, 923 (CA7 1926); Todaro v.
Munster, 62 F. 2d 963, 964 (CA10 1933).
5 The Act separately codified the moral turpitude offense provision
and the narcotics offense provision within 8 U. S. C. §1251(a) (1994 ed.)
under subsections (a)(4) and (a)(11), respectively. See 66 Stat. 201, 204,
