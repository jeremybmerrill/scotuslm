PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

on our defense bar the duty to say, ‘I do not know.’ ” 253
S. W. 3d 482, 485 (2008).
Second, incompetent advice distorts the defendant’s
decisionmaking process and seems to call the fairness and
integrity of the criminal proceeding itself into question.
See Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686 (“In giving meaning to
the requirement [of effective assistance of counsel], we
must take its purpose—to ensure a fair trial—as the

definitive information concerning the likely effects of the
plea, the defendant can fairly be said to assume the risk
that the conviction may carry indirect consequences of
which he or she is not aware. That is not the case when a
defendant bases the decision to plead guilty on counsel’s
express misrepresentation that the defendant will not be
removable. In the latter case, it seems hard to say that
the plea was entered with the advice of constitutionally

intelligent decision to forsake constitutional rights. See
ibid. (“The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffec
tiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct so under
mined the proper functioning of the adversarial process
that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just
result”).
Third, a rule prohibiting unreasonable misadvice re
garding exceptionally important collateral matters would
not deter or interfere with ongoing political and adminis

the difficult problem posed by defendants who plead
guilty without knowing of certain important collateral
consequences.
Finally, the conclusion that affirmative misadvice re
garding the removal consequences of a conviction can give
rise to ineffective assistance would, unlike the Court’s
approach, not require any upheaval in the law. As the
Solicitor General points out, “[t]he vast majority of the
