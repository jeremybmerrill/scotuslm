PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
Opinion of the Court

1990 Congress entirely eliminated it, 104 Stat. 5050. In
1996, Congress also eliminated the Attorney General’s
authority to grant discretionary relief from deportation,
110 Stat. 3009–596, an authority that had been exercised
to prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens
during the 5-year period prior to 1996, INS v. St. Cyr, 533
U. S. 289, 296 (2001). Under contemporary law, if a non
citizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996
effective date of these amendments, his removal is practi
cally inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited
remnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney
General to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of
particular classes of offenses.6 See 8 U. S. C. §1229b.
Subject to limited exceptions, this discretionary relief is
not available for an offense related to trafficking in a
controlled substance. See §1101(a)(43)(B); §1228.
These changes to our immigration law have dramati
cally raised the stakes of a noncitizen’s criminal convic
tion. The importance of accurate legal advice for nonciti
zens accused of crimes has never been more important.
These changes confirm our view that, as a matter of fed
eral law, deportation is an integral part—indeed, some
times the most important part 7—of the penalty that may
be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to
specified crimes.

206. The JRAD procedure, codified in 8 U. S. C. §1251(b) (1994 ed.),
applied only to the “provisions of subsection (a)(4),” the crimes-of-moral
turpitude provision. 66 Stat. 208; see United States v. O’Rourke, 213
F. 2d 759, 762 (CA8 1954) (recognizing that, under the 1952 Act,
narcotics offenses were no longer eligible for JRADs).
6 The changes to our immigration law have also involved a change in
nomenclature; the statutory text now uses the term “removal” rather
than “deportation.” See Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U. S. 348, 350,
n. 1 (2001).
