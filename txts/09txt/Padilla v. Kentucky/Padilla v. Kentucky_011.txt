PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
Opinion of the Court

We, however, have never applied a distinction between
direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of
constitutionally “reasonable professional assistance”
required under Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689. Whether
that distinction is appropriate is a question we need not
consider in this case because of the unique nature of
deportation.
We have long recognized that deportation is a particu
larly severe “penalty,” Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149
U. S. 698, 740 (1893); but it is not, in a strict sense, a
criminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil
in nature, see INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1038
(1984), deportation is nevertheless intimately related to
the criminal process. Our law has enmeshed criminal
convictions and the penalty of deportation for nearly a
century, see Part I, supra, at 2–7. And, importantly,
recent changes in our immigration law have made removal
nearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen
offenders. Thus, we find it “most difficult” to divorce the
penalty from the conviction in the deportation context.
United States v. Russell, 686 F. 2d 35, 38 (CADC 1982).
Moreover, we are quite confident that noncitizen defen
dants facing a risk of deportation for a particular offense
find it even more difficult. See St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 322
(“There can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien
defendants considering whether to enter into a plea
agreement are acutely aware of the immigration conse
quences of their convictions”).
Deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction is,
because of its close connection to the criminal process,
uniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collat
eral consequence. The collateral versus direct distinction
