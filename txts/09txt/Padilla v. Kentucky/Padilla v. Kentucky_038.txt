SCALIA, J., dissenting

present when the defendant is interrogated in connection
with another possible prosecution arising from the same
event. Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001).
There is no basis in text or in principle to extend the
constitutionally required advice regarding guilty pleas
beyond those matters germane to the criminal prosecution
at hand—to wit, the sentence that the plea will produce,
the higher sentence that conviction after trial might en
tail, and the chances of such a conviction. Such matters
fall within “the range of competence demanded of attor
neys in criminal cases,” McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S.
759, 771 (1970). See id., at 769–770 (describing the mat

contemplated guilty plea). We have never held, as the
logic of the Court’s opinion assumes, that once counsel is
appointed all professional responsibilities of counsel—even
those extending beyond defense against the prosecution—

n. 2; Moran, supra, at 430. Because the subject of the
misadvice here was not the prosecution for which Jose
Padilla was entitled to effective assistance of counsel, the
Sixth Amendment has no application.
Adding to counsel’s duties an obligation to advise about
a conviction’s collateral consequences has no logical stop

the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits,
ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable dis
charge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or
professional licenses. . . . All of those consequences are
‘serious,’ . . . .” Ante, at 2–3 (ALITO, J., concurring in
judgment).
But it seems to me that the concurrence suffers from the
