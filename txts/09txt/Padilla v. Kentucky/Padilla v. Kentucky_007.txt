PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
Opinion of the Court

shall not be deported.” Id., at 890.3 This procedure,
known as a judicial recommendation against deportation,
or JRAD, had the effect of binding the Executive to pre
vent deportation; the statute was “consistently . . . inter
preted as giving the sentencing judge conclusive authority
to decide whether a particular conviction should be disre
garded as a basis for deportation,” Janvier v. United
States, 793 F. 2d 449, 452 (CA2 1986). Thus, from 1917
forward, there was no such creature as an automatically
deportable offense. Even as the class of deportable of
fenses expanded, judges retained discretion to ameliorate
unjust results on a case-by-case basis.
Although narcotics offenses—such as the offense at
issue in this case—provided a distinct basis for deporta
tion as early as 1922,4 the JRAD procedure was generally

enacted, the statute provided:
“That the provision of this section respecting the deportation of aliens
convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude shall not apply to one
who has been pardoned, nor shall such deportation be made or directed
if the court, or judge thereof, sentencing such alien for such crime shall,
at the time of imposing judgment or passing sentence or within thirty
days thereafter, . . . make a recommendation to the Secretary of Labor
that such alien shall not be deported in pursuance of this Act.” 1917
Act, 39 Stat. 889–890.
This provision was codified in 8 U. S. C. §1251(b) (1994 ed.) (transferred
to §1227 (2006 ed. )). The judge’s nondeportation recommendation was
binding on the Secretary of Labor and, later, the Attorney General after
control of immigration removal matters was transferred from the
former to the latter. See Janvier v. United States, 793 F. 2d 449, 452
(CA2 1986).
4 Congress first identified narcotics offenses as a special category of
crimes triggering deportation in the 1922 Narcotic Drug Act. Act of
May 26, 1922, ch. 202, 42 Stat. 596. After the 1922 Act took effect,
there was some initial confusion over whether a narcotics offense also
had to be a crime of moral turpitude for an individual to be deportable.
See Weedin v. Moy Fat, 8 F. 2d 488, 489 (CA9 1925) (holding that an
individual who committed narcotics offense was not deportable because
offense did not involve moral turpitude). However, lower courts even
tually agreed that the narcotics offense provision was “special,” Chung
