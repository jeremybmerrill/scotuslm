SCALIA, J., dissenting

claim into the Sixth Amendment.
The Court’s holding prevents legislation that could solve
the problems addressed by today’s opinions in a more
precise and targeted fashion. If the subject had not been
constitutionalized, legislation could specify which catego
ries of misadvice about matters ancillary to the prosecu
tion invalidate plea agreements, what collateral conse
quences counsel must bring to a defendant’s attention, and
what warnings must be given.2 Moreover, legislation
could provide consequences for the misadvice, nonadvice,
or failure to warn, other than nullification of a criminal
conviction after the witnesses and evidence needed for
retrial have disappeared. Federal immigration law might
provide, for example, that the near-automatic removal
which follows from certain criminal convictions will not
apply where the conviction rested upon a guilty plea in
duced by counsel’s misadvice regarding removal conse
quences. Or legislation might put the government to a
choice in such circumstances: Either retry the defendant
or forgo the removal. But all that has been precluded in
favor of today’s sledge hammer.
In sum, the Sixth Amendment guarantees adequate
assistance of counsel in defending against a pending
criminal prosecution. We should limit both the constitu
tional obligation to provide advice and the consequences of
bad advice to that well defined area.

collateral consequences. Whatever the outcome, however, the effect of
misadvice regarding such consequences upon the validity of a guilty
plea should be analyzed under the Due Process Clause.
2 As the Court’s opinion notes, ante, at 16–17, n. 15, many States—
including Kentucky—already require that criminal defendants be
warned of potential removal consequences.
