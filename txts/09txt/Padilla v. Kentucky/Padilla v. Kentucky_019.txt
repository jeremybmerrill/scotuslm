PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
Opinion of the Court

guilty plea in a habeas proceeding because, ultimately,
the challenge may result in a less favorable outcome for
the defendant, whereas a collateral challenge to a convic
tion obtained after a jury trial has no similar downside
potential.
Finally, informed consideration of possible deportation
can only benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants
during the plea-bargaining process. By bringing deporta
tion consequences into this process, the defense and prose
cution may well be able to reach agreements that better
satisfy the interests of both parties. As in this case, a
criminal episode may provide the basis for multiple
charges, of which only a subset mandate deportation
following conviction. Counsel who possess the most rudi
mentary understanding of the deportation consequences of
a particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain
creatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction
and sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as
by avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically
triggers the removal consequence. At the same time, the
threat of deportation may provide the defendant with a
powerful incentive to plead guilty to an offense that does
not mandate that penalty in exchange for a dismissal of a
charge that does.
In sum, we have long recognized that the negotiation of
a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes
of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of

U. S., at 770–771. The severity of deportation—“the
equivalent of banishment or exile,” Delgadillo v. Carmi
chael, 332 U. S. 388, 390–391 (1947)—only underscores
how critical it is for counsel to inform her noncitizen client
that he faces a risk of deportation.15

in Kentucky courts provides notice of possible immigration conse
