PADILLA v. KENTUCKY
Opinion of the Court

Court of Kentucky denied Padilla postconviction relief
without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing. The court
held that the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of effective
assistance of counsel does not protect a criminal defendant
from erroneous advice about deportation because it is
merely a “collateral” consequence of his conviction. Id., at
485. In its view, neither counsel’s failure to advise peti
tioner about the possibility of removal, nor counsel’s incor
rect advice, could provide a basis for relief.
We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to decide
whether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla’s counsel had
an obligation to advise him that the offense to which he
was pleading guilty would result in his removal from this
country. We agree with Padilla that constitutionally
competent counsel would have advised him that his con
viction for drug distribution made him subject to auto
matic deportation. Whether he is entitled to relief de
pends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that
we do not address.

The landscape of federal immigration law has changed
dramatically over the last 90 years. While once there was
only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges
wielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deporta
tion, immigration reforms over time have expanded the
class of deportable offenses and limited the authority of
judges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation.
The “drastic measure” of deportation or removal, Fong
Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U. S. 6, 10 (1948), is now virtually
inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of
crimes.
The Nation’s first 100 years was “a period of unimpeded
immigration.” C. Gordon & H. Rosenfield, Immigration
Law and Procedure §1.(2)(a), p. 5 (1959). An early effort to
