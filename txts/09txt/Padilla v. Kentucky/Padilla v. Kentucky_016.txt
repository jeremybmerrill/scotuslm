Opinion of the Court

[,and] completely lacking in legal or rational bases.” Brief
for Respondent 31. We do not share that view, but we
agree that there is no relevant difference “between an act
of commission and an act of omission” in this context. Id.,
at 30; Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690 (“The court must then
determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the
identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of
professionally competent assistance”); see also State v.
Paredez, 2004–NMSC–036, 136 N. M. 533, 538–539.
A holding limited to affirmative misadvice would invite
two absurd results. First, it would give counsel an incen
tive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even
when answers are readily available. Silence under these
circumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the
critical obligation of counsel to advise the client of “the
advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.”
Libretti v. United States, 516 U. S. 29, 50–51 (1995).
When attorneys know that their clients face possible exile
from this country and separation from their families, they
should not be encouraged to say nothing at all.11 Second,
it would deny a class of clients least able to represent
themselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation
even when it is readily available. It is quintessentially the
duty of counsel to provide her client with available advice
about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so
“clearly satisfies the first prong of the Strickland analy
sis.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 62 (1985) (White, J.,
——————
11 As the Commonwealth conceded at oral argument, were a defen
dant’s lawyer to know that a particular offense would result in the
client’s deportation and that, upon deportation, the client and his
family might well be killed due to circumstances in the client’s home
country, any decent attorney would inform the client of the conse
quences of his plea. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38. We think the same result
should follow when the stakes are not life and death but merely “ban
ishment or exile,” Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U. S. 388, 390–391
(1947).
