BOBBY v. VAN HOOK
Per Curiam

unsworn statement. After weighing the aggravating and
mitigating circumstances, the trial court imposed the
death penalty. The Ohio courts affirmed on direct appeal,
id., at 265, 530 N. E. 2d, at 892; State v. Van Hook, No.
C–85–0565, 1987 WL 11202 (Ohio App., May 13, 1987)
(per curiam), and we denied certiorari, Van Hook v. Ohio,
489 U. S. 1100 (1989). Van Hook also sought state post
conviction relief, which the Ohio courts denied. State v.
Van Hook, No. C–910505, 1992 WL 308350 (Ohio App.,
Oct. 21, 1992) (per curiam), appeal denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d
1440, 608 N. E. 2d 1085, rehearing denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d
1470, 611 N. E. 2d 328 (1993); State v. Van Hook, 70 Ohio
St. 3d 1216, 639 N. E. 2d 1199 (1994).
Van Hook filed this federal habeas petition in 1995. The
District Court denied relief on all 17 of his claims. Van
Hook v. Anderson, No. C–1–94–269 (SD Ohio, Aug. 7,
2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 123a, 163a. A panel of the
Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that Van Hook’s confes
sion was unconstitutionally obtained under Edwards v.
Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981). See Van Hook v. Anderson,
444 F. 3d 830, 832 (2006). The en banc Sixth Circuit
vacated that ruling, holding the confession was proper,
and it remanded the case to the panel to consider Van
Hook’s other claims. See Van Hook v. Anderson, 488 F. 3d
411, 428 (2007). Van Hook petitioned for a writ of certio
rari, which we denied. Van Hook v. Hudson, 552 U. S.
1023 (2007).
On remand, the panel granted Van Hook habeas relief
again, but on different grounds, holding that his attorneys
were ineffective during the penalty phase because they did
not adequately investigate and present mitigating evi
dence, neglected to secure an independent mental-health
expert, and requested and relied on a presentence investi
gation report without objecting to damaging evidence it
contained. See Van Hook v. Anderson, 535 F. 3d 458, 461
(2008). The en banc Sixth Circuit again vacated the
