panel’s opinion, but rather than hearing the case a second
time it remanded for the panel to revise its opinion. See
Van Hook v. Anderson, 560 F. 3d 523, 524 (2009). In its
third opinion, the panel—relying on guidelines published
by the American Bar Association (ABA) in 2003—granted
relief to Van Hook on the sole ground that his lawyers
performed deficiently in investigating and presenting
mitigating evidence. See id., at 525. The State petitioned
for a writ of certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse.

Because Van Hook filed his federal habeas petition
before April 24, 1996, the provisions of the Antiterrorism
and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 do not apply. See

(1984) (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759,
771, n. 14 (1970)). That standard is necessarily a general
one. “No particular set of detailed rules for counsel’s
conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of
circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of
legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a
criminal defendant.” 466 U. S., at 688–689. Restatements
of professional standards, we have recognized, can be
useful as “guides” to what reasonableness entails, but only
to the extent they describe the professional norms prevail
ing when the representation took place. Id., at 688.
The Sixth Circuit ignored this limiting principle, relying
