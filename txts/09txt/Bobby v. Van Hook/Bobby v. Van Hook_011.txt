ALITO, J., concurring

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
DAVID BOBBY, WARDEN v. ROBERT J. VAN HOOK
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

No. 09–144.

Decided November 9, 2009 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring.
I join the Court’s per curiam opinion but emphasize my
understanding that the opinion in no way suggests that
the American Bar Association’s Guidelines for the Ap
pointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death
Penalty Cases (rev. ed. 2003) (2003 Guidelines or ABA
Guidelines) have special relevance in determining whether
an attorney’s performance meets the standard required by
the Sixth Amendment. The ABA is a venerable organiza
tion with a history of service to the bar, but it is, after all,
a private group with limited membership. The views of
the association’s members, not to mention the views of the
members of the advisory committee that formulated the
2003 Guidelines, do not necessarily reflect the views of the
American bar as a whole. It is the responsibility of the
courts to determine the nature of the work that a defense
attorney must do in a capital case in order to meet the
obligations imposed by the Constitution, and I see no
reason why the ABA Guidelines should be given a privi
leged position in making that determination.
