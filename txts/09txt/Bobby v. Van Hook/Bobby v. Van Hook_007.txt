Per Curiam

only “a little information about his traumatic childhood
experience,” 560 F. 3d, at 528, but that is a gross distor
tion. The trial court learned, for instance, that Van Hook
(whose parents were both “heavy drinkers”) started drink
ing as a toddler, began “barhopping” with his father at age
9, drank and used drugs regularly with his father from
age 11 forward, and continued abusing drugs and alcohol
into adulthood. App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a–312a, 323a–
326a, 328a–330a, 373a. The court also heard that Van
Hook grew up in a “ ‘combat zone’ ”: He watched his father
beat his mother weekly, saw him hold her at gun- and
knife-point, “observed” episodes of “sexual violence” while
sleeping in his parents’ bedroom, and was beaten himself
at least once. Id., at 321a, 338a–339a, 371a. It learned
that Van Hook, who had “fantasies about killing and war”
from an early age, was deeply upset when his drug and
alcohol abuse forced him out of the military, and at
tempted suicide five times (including a month before the
murder), id., at 351a–353a, 372a. And although the ex
perts agreed that Van Hook did not suffer from a “mental
disease or defect,” the trial court learned that Van Hook’s
borderline personality disorder and his consumption of
drugs and alcohol the day of the crime impaired “his abil
ity to refrain from the [crime],” id., at 303a, and that his
“explo[sion]” of “senseless and bizarre brutality” may have
resulted from what one expert termed a “homosexual
panic,” id., at 376a.
Despite all the mitigating evidence the defense did
present, Van Hook and the Court of Appeals fault his
counsel for failing to find more. What his counsel did
discover, the argument goes, gave them “reason to suspect
that much worse details existed,” and that suspicion
—————— 

2–3. Van Hook now concedes, however, that neither ground is a “basis

for issuing the writ,” Brief in Opposition 5; see also id., at 7, and

accordingly we do not address them.
