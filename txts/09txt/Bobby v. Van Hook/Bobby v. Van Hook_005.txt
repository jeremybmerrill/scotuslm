Per Curiam

Judging counsel’s conduct in the 1980’s on the basis of
these 2003 Guidelines—without even pausing to consider
whether they reflected the prevailing professional practice
at the time of the trial—was error.
To make matters worse, the Court of Appeals (following
Circuit precedent) treated the ABA’s 2003 Guidelines not
merely as evidence of what reasonably diligent attorneys
would do, but as inexorable commands with which all
capital defense counsel “ ‘must fully comply.’ ” 560 F. 3d, at
526 (quoting Dickerson v. Bagley, 453 F. 3d 690, 693 (CA6
2006)). Strickland stressed, however, that “American Bar
Association standards and the like” are “only guides” to
what reasonableness means, not its definition. 466 U. S.,
at 688. We have since regarded them as such.1 See Wig
gins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524 (2003). What we have
said of state requirements is a fortiori true of standards
set by private organizations: “[W]hile States are free to
impose whatever specific rules they see fit to ensure that
criminal defendants are well represented, we have held
that the Federal Constitution imposes one general re

under professional standards prevailing at the time. He is

cepting the legitimacy of a less categorical use of the Guidelines to
evaluate post-2003 representation. For that to be proper, the Guide
lines must reflect “[p]revailing norms of practice,” Strickland, 466 U. S.,
at 688, and “standard practice,” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524
(2003), and must not be so detailed that they would “interfere with the
constitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide
latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions,” Strickland,
supra, at 689. We express no views on whether the 2003 Guidelines
meet these criteria.
