HUI v. CASTANEDA 

Opinion of the Court 


I

Francisco Castaneda was detained by U. S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the San Diego Correc
tional Facility (SDCF) beginning in March 2006. Accord
ing to the complaint later filed in the District Court, when
Castaneda arrived at SDCF he had on his penis an irregu
lar, raised lesion that measured roughly two centimeters
square.1 Castaneda promptly brought his condition to the
attention of medical personnel working for the Division of
Immigration Health Services, reporting that the lesion
was growing in size and becoming more painful and that it
frequently bled and emitted a discharge. Petitioner Dr.
Esther Hui, a civilian PHS employee, was the physician
responsible for Castaneda’s medical care during his deten
tion at SDCF. Petitioner Commander Stephen Gonsalves,
a commissioned PHS officer, was a Health Services Ad
ministrator at SDCF during the relevant period.
Between March 2006 and January 2007, Castaneda
persistently sought treatment for his condition. As his
disease progressed, the lesion became increasingly painful
and interfered with his urination, defecation, and sleep.
In December 2006, Castaneda additionally reported a
lump in his groin. A PHS physician’s assistant and three
outside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda
needed a biopsy to ascertain whether he had cancer.
Petitioners denied requests for a biopsy and other recom
mended procedures as “elective.” App. 244, 249–251.
Instead, Castaneda was treated with ibuprofen and anti
biotics and was given an additional ration of boxer shorts.
After a fourth specialist recommended a biopsy in Janu
ary 2007, the procedure was finally authorized. Instead of
providing treatment, however, ICE released Castaneda
