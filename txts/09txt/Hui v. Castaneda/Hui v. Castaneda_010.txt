Opinion of the Court

. . . brought for a violation of the Constitution of the
United States.” §2679(b)(2)(A). The Westfall Act’s explicit
exception for Bivens claims is powerful evidence that
Congress did not understand the exclusivity provided by
§2679(b)(1)—or the substantially similar §233(a)—to
imply such an exception. Given Congress’ awareness of
pre-existing immunity provisions like §233 when it en
acted the Westfall Act, see United States v. Smith, 499
U. S. 160, 173 (1991), it is telling that Congress declined to
enact a similar exception to the immunity provided by
§233(a).

In advocating a contrary reading of §233(a), respondents
rely heavily on our opinion in Carlson, as did the Court of
Appeals. Carlson, however, is inapposite to the issue in
this case. There are two separate inquiries involved in
determining whether a Bivens action may proceed against
a federal agent: whether the agent is amenable to suit,
and whether a damages remedy is available for a particu
lar constitutional violation absent authorization by Con
gress. See United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669, 684
(1987) (“[T]he availability of a damages action under the
Constitution for particular injuries . . . is a question logi
cally distinct from immunity to such an action on the part
of particular defendants”). Even in circumstances in
which a Bivens remedy is generally available, an action
under Bivens will be defeated if the defendant is immune
from suit. See, e.g., 403 U. S., at 397–398 (remanding for
determination of respondents’ immunity after implying a
cause of action under the Fourth Amendment).
Because petitioners in Carlson invoked no official im
munity, the Court did not address that question. Instead,
it considered whether a remedy was available under the
Eighth Amendment for alleged violations of the Cruel and
Unusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a
