HUI v. CASTANEDA
Opinion of the Court

remedy under the FTCA may sue a PHS official directly.10
Accordingly, respondents contend, §233(a) cannot be read
to make the remedy under the FTCA truly exclusive.
Even if that reading of §233(f) were correct, it would not
benefit respondents because an FTCA remedy is unques

effect of §233(f). See Brief for Respondents 32 (citing United States v.
Smith, 499 U. S. 160, 166–167 (1991)). But because the Act does not
weaken any inference about the meaning of §233(a) that might be
drawn from §233(f), the changes effected by the Act are not relevant to
the instant inquiry.
