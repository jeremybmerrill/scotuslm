Opinion of the Court

the FTCA, including the Westfall Act’s exception for
claims “brought for a violation of the Constitution of the
United States,” §2679(b)(2)(A). Through this series of
cross-references, respondents would read that exception
for Bivens actions into §233(a).
Section 233(a) is not susceptible of this reading. As
petitioners observe, that provision refers only to “[t]he
remedy against the United States provided by sections
1346(b) and 2672.” §233(a) (emphasis added). Thus, only
those portions of chapter 171 that establish the FTCA
remedy are incorporated by §233(a)’s reference to §1346.
Section 2679(b) is not such a provision. Section 233(a)’s
reference to §26728—which is codified in chapter 171—also
belies respondents’ theory.
If §233(a)’s reference to
§1346(b) served to incorporate all the provisions of chapter
171, the separate reference to §2672 would be superfluous.
Respondents next argue that the Westfall Act’s Bivens
exception, §2679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a Bivens
action against PHS officers and employees.
That
§2679(b)(2)(A) by its terms applies only to the specific
immunity set forth in “[p]aragraph (1)” belies respondents’
claim. Moreover, if §233(a) forecloses a Bivens action
against PHS personnel, respondents’ reading of
§2679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied repeal of that more
specific provision. Although we noted in Smith that
§2679(b) applies to all federal employees, see 499 U. S., at
173, we had no occasion to consider whether the Bivens
——————
8 Section 2672 authorizes agency heads and their designees to “con
sider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim
for money damages against the United States for injury or loss of
property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrong
ful act or omission of any employee of the agency while acting within
the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the
United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in
accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission oc
curred.”
