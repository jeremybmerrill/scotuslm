HUI v. CASTANEDA
Opinion of the Court

neda v. United States, 538 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1288–1295
(2008). Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal.3
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the
District Court’s judgment that §233(a) does not preclude
respondents’ Bivens claims. Castaneda v. United States,
546 F. 3d 682 (2008).4 The court cited Carlson v. Green,
446 U. S. 14 (1980), for the proposition that a Bivens
remedy is unavailable only when an alternative remedy is
both expressly declared to be a substitute and can be
viewed as equally effective, or when special factors mili
tate against direct recovery. Looking to the statute’s text
and history, the court noted that §233(a) does not mention
the Constitution or recovery thereunder and found it
significant that §233 was enacted prior to this Court’s
decision in Bivens. Drawing further support for its view
from the statute’s legislative history and from subsequent
congressional enactments, the Court of Appeals concluded
that §233(a) does not expressly make the remedy under
the FTCA a substitute for relief under Bivens.
For essentially the reasons given in Carlson, 446 U. S.,
at 20–23, the Court of Appeals also determined that the
FTCA remedy is not equally effective as a Bivens remedy.
Unlike the remedy under the FTCA, the court reasoned, a
Bivens remedy is awarded against individual defendants
and may include punitive damages. Additionally, Bivens
cases may be tried before a jury, and liability is governed
by uniform federal rules rather than the law of the State
——————
3 Although it does not bear directly on the question presented in this
case, we note that while petitioners’ appeal was pending the Govern
ment filed a formal notice admitting liability with respect to respon
dents’ claims for medical negligence under the FTCA. App. 329.
4 The court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the interlocutory
appeal because district court orders denying absolute immunity consti
tute “final decisions” for purposes of 28 U. S. C. §1291. See 546 F. 3d,
at 687 (citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524–527 (1985)); see
also Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 238–239 (2007).
