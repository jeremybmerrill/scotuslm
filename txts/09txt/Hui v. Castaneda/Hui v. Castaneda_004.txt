ESTHER HUI, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. YANIRA 

CASTANEDA, AS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE

OF THE ESTATE OF FRANCISCO 

CASTANEDA, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[May 3, 2010]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether 42 U. S. C.
§233(a), as added, 84 Stat. 1870, precludes an action
under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403
U. S. 388 (1971), against U. S. Public Health Service
(PHS) personnel for constitutional violations arising out of
their official duties. When federal employees are sued for
damages for harms caused in the course of their employ
ment, the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C.
§§1346, 2671–2680, generally authorizes substitution of
the United States as the defendant. Section 233(a) makes
the FTCA remedy against the United States “exclusive of
any other civil action or proceeding” for any personal
injury caused by a PHS officer or employee performing a
medical or related function “while acting within the scope
of his office or employment.” Based on the plain language
of §233(a), we conclude that PHS officers and employees
are not personally subject to Bivens actions for harms
arising out of such conduct.
