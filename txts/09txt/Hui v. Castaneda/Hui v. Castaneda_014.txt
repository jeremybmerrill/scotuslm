Opinion of the Court

We agree with petitioners that there is no reason to
think that scope certification by the Attorney General is a
prerequisite to immunity under §233(a). To be sure, that
immunity is contingent upon the alleged misconduct
having occurred in the course of the PHS defendant’s
duties, but a defendant may make that proof pursuant to
the ordinary rules of evidence and procedure. As petition
ers observe, proof of scope is in most §233(a) cases estab
lished by a declaration affirming that the defendant was a
PHS official during the relevant time period. See Reply
Brief for Petitioner Hui 6–7, and n. 1. Thus, while scope
certification may provide a convenient mechanism for
establishing that the alleged misconduct occurred within
the scope of the employee’s duties, the procedure author

the United States. Finally, that the FTCA’s scope certifi

§233(a) confirms that Congress did not intend to make
that procedure the exclusive means for PHS personnel to
invoke the official immunity provided by §233(a).
Respondents’ argument based on §233(f) is similarly
unavailing. That subsection authorizes the Secretary of
Health and Human Services to “hold harmless or provide
liability insurance” for a PHS officer or employee for per
sonal injuries caused by conduct occurring “within the
scope of his office or employment . . . if such employee is
assigned to a foreign country . . . and if the circumstances
are such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third
persons against the United States described in section
2679(b).”
Noting that the FTCA precludes recovery
against the United States for “[a]ny claim arising in a
foreign country,” §2680(k), respondents urge that §233(f)’s
authorization of insurance or indemnification in those
circumstances anticipates that an injured party without a
