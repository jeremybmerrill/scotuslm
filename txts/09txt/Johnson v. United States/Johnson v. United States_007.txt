JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

not bound by a state court’s interpretation of a similar—or
even identical—state statute.
We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court’s
interpretation of state law, including its determination of
the elements of Fla. Stat. §784.03(2). See Johnson v.
Fankell, 520 U. S. 911, 916 (1997). The Florida Supreme
Court has held that the element of “actually and inten
tionally touching” under Florida’s battery law is satisfied
by any intentional physical contact, “no matter how
slight.” Hearns, 961 So. 2d, at 218. The most “nominal
contact,” such as a “ta[p] . . . on the shoulder without
consent,” id., at 219, establishes a violation. We apply
“th[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,”
Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324, n. 16 (1979), in
determining whether a felony conviction for battery under
Fla. Stat. §784.03(2) meets the definition of “violent fel
ony” in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i).

Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,”
and we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning.
Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144–145 (1995).
The adjective “physical” is clear in meaning but not of
much help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted
by and through concrete bodies—distinguishing physical
force from, for example, intellectual force or emotional
force. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; “force” has a
number of meanings. For present purposes we can ex
clude its specialized meaning in the field of physics: a
cause of the acceleration of mass. Webster’s New Interna
tional Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster’s
Second). In more general usage it means “[s]trength or
energy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of
strength or energy,” “[p]ower to affect strongly in physical
relations,” or “[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint
exerted upon a person.” Id., at 985. Black’s Law Diction
