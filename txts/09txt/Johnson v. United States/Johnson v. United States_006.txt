Opinion of the Court

if “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another person
constitutes the use of “physical force” within the meaning
of §924(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Court concluded that it
does, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under §924(e)(1)
to a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.
The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F. 3d 1318 (2008).
We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).

Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career
Criminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences
upon “violent career criminal[s],” Fla. Stat. §775.084(4)(d)
(2007), defined to mean persons who have three convic
tions for certain felonies, including any “forcible felony,”
§775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). “[F]orcible felony” is defined to in

the slightest unwanted physical touch, “the use . . . of
physical force” was not an element of the offense. Id., at
219.
Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted
physical touching constitutes “physical force” under 18
U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida
Supreme Court’s conclusion in Hearns that it does not
constitute “physical force.” That is not so. The meaning of
“physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal
law, not state law. And in answering that question we are
