Opinion of the Court

the Armed Career Criminal Act in precisely this manner.
See, e.g., United States v. Simms, 441 F. 3d 313, 316–317
(CA4 2006) (Maryland battery); cf. United States v.
Robledo-Leyva, 307 Fed. Appx. 859, 862 (CA5) (Florida
battery), cert. denied, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); United States
v. Luque-Barahona, 272 Fed. Appx. 521, 524–525 (CA7
2008) (same).
It may well be true, as the Government contends,
that in many cases state and local records from
battery convictions will be incomplete. But absence of
records will often frustrate application of the modified
categorical approach—not just to battery but to many
other crimes as well. See, e.g., Shepard, supra, at 22–23
(burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common
enough consequence with respect to the single crime of
battery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career
Criminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art
that is a comical misfit with the defined term “violent
felony.”

§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We decline to do so. The Government
did not keep this option alive because it disclaimed at
sentencing any reliance upon the residual clause. App.
44–45. Moreover, the parties briefed the §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)
issue to the Eleventh Circuit, which nonetheless reasoned
that if Johnson’s conviction under Fla. Stat. §784.03(2)
satisfied §924(e)(2)(B)(i), then it was a predicate “violent
felony” under §924(e)(1); but “if not, then not.” 528 F. 3d,
at 1320.
We reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit, set
aside Johnson’s sentence, and remand the case for further
