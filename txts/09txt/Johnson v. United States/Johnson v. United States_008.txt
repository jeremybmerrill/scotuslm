Opinion of the Court

ary 717 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black’s) defines “force”
as “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person
or thing.” And it defines “physical force” as “[f]orce con
sisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against
a robbery victim.” Ibid. All of these definitions suggest a
degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest
touching.
There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the
word “force”: its use in describing one of the elements of
the common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the
intentional application of unlawful force against the per
son of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive
Criminal Law §7.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003);
accord, Black’s 173. The common law held this element of
“force” to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touch
ing. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of
England 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); Lynch v.
Commonwealth, 131 Va. 762, 765, 109 S. E. 427, 428
(1921); see also 2 LaFave & Scott, supra, §7.15(a). The
question is whether the term “force” in 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in
the common-law definition of battery. The Government
asserts that it does. We disagree.
Although a common-law term of art should be given its
established common-law meaning, United States v. Turley,
352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957), we do not assume that a statu
tory word is used as a term of art where that meaning
does not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning,
Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961),
and we “do not force term-of-art definitions into contexts
where they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,”
Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 282 (2006) (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase “physical
force” as used in defining not the crime of battery, but
rather the statutory category of “violent felon[ies],”
§924(e)(2)(B). In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), we
