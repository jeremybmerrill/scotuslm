JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 08–6925. Argued October 6, 2009—Decided March 2, 2010
Petitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a
convicted felon. 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1). The Government sought sen
tencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which authorizes an
enhanced penalty for a person who violates §922(g) and who “has
three previous convictions” for “a violent felony,” §924(e)(1), defined
as, inter alia, an offense that “has as an element the use . . . of physi
cal force against the person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Among the
three prior felony convictions the Government proffered was John
son’s 2003 Florida conviction for simple battery, which ordinarily is a
first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(b), but was a felony
conviction for Johnson because he had previously been convicted of
another battery, Fla. Stat. §784.03(2). Under Florida law, a battery
occurs when a person either “[a]ctually and intentionally touches or
strikes another person against [his] will,” or “[i]ntentionally causes
bodily harm to another person.” §784.03(1)(a). Nothing in the record
permitted the District Court to conclude that Johnson’s 2003 convic
tion rested upon the “strik[ing]” or “[i]ntentionally caus[ing] bodily
harm” elements of the offense. Accordingly, his conviction was a
predicate conviction for a “violent felony” under the Armed Career
Criminal Act only if “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another
constitutes the use of “physical force” under §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Con
cluding it does, the District Court enhanced Johnson’s sentence un
der §924(e)(1), sentencing him to a term of 15 years and 5 months.
The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
Held: The Florida felony offense of battery by “[a]ctually and intention
ally touch[ing]” another person does not have “as an element the use
. . . of physical force against the person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i),
and thus does not constitute a “violent felony” under §924(e)(1).
