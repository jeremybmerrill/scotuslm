JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

sufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery.
See ante, at 4–5. The Court veers off course, however, by
concluding that the statutory language reaches only vio
lent force.
The term “force,” as the Court correctly notes, had a
well-established meaning at common law that included
even the “slightest offensive touching.” Ante, at 5. See
also Respublica v. De Longchamps, 1 Dall. 111, 114 (O. T.
Phila. 1784) (“[T]hough no great bodily pain is suffered by
a blow on the palm of the hand, or the skirt of the coat, yet
these are clearly within the legal d[e]finition of Assault
and Battery. . .”); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone).
This approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent
touching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be
even more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient
to inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap
in the face).
When Congress selects statutory language with a well
known common-law meaning, we generally presume that
Congress intended to adopt that meaning. See, e.g.,
United States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957) (“We
recognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a
common-law term of established meaning without other
wise defining it, the general practice is to give that term
its common-law meaning”); Morissette v. United States,
342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952); United States v. Carll, 105 U. S.
611, 612–613 (1882). And here, I see nothing to suggest
that Congress meant the phrase “use of physical force” in
ACCA to depart from that phrase’s meaning at common
law.
On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory
interpretation point to the same conclusion. “[W]here
Congress includes particular language in one section of a
statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it
is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally
