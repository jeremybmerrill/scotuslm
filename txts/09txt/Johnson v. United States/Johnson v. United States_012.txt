Opinion of the Court

The Government also asks us to draw a negative infer
ence from the presence of the “bodily injury” specification
added to the phrase “physical force” in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii).
That provision forbids the possession of firearms by a
person subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the
“use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force
against [an] intimate partner or child that would reasona
bly be expected to cause bodily injury.” Ibid. The absence
of such language in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government
contends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a
matter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that
“physical force” must rise to the level of bodily injury does
not suggest that without the qualification “physical force”
would consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for
example, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict
pain—a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is
not a case where Congress has “include[d] particular
language in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in
another section of the same Act,” Russello v. United States,
464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted;
emphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into
law in 1994—eight years after enactment of the language
in §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103–322, §110401,
108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99–570, §1402, 100
Stat. 3207–39 (1986).
IV
The Government contends that interpreting 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its
ability to enforce the firearm disability in §922(g)(9) for
persons who previously have been convicted of a “misde
meanor crime of domestic violence,” which is defined to
include certain misdemeanor offenses that have, “as an
element, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,”
§921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The prediction is unfounded. We have
interpreted the phrase “physical force” only in the context
