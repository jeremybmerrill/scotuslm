Opinion of the Court

. . . calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the
possibility of more closely related, active violence”).
It is significant, moreover, that the meaning of “physical
force” the Government would seek to import into this
definition of “violent felony” is a meaning derived from a
common-law misdemeanor. At common law, battery—all
battery, and not merely battery by the merest touching—
was a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216–
218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave & Scott, supra, §2.1(b), at
90; ALI, Model Penal Code §211.1, Comment, p. 175
(1980). As the dissent points out, post, at 5–6 (opinion of
ALITO, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and
felonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple
battery—whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury
variety—generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.1 See,
e.g., 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §16.1(b) (2d
ed. 2003 and Supp. 2009–2010); Cal. Penal Code Ann.
§§242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(b); Ill.
Comp. Stat., ch. 720, §5/12–3(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal
Code Ann. §22.01(b) (West Supp. 2008). It is unlikely that
Congress would select as a term of art defining “violent
felony” a phrase that the common law gave peculiar mean
ing only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course
“physical force” can be given its common-law misdemeanor
meaning by artful language, but here the only text that
can be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase “physical
force” itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily
——————
1 The dissent notes, post, at 5–6, that, around the time the Armed
Career Criminal Act became law, in “quite a few States” it was a felony
offense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims,
such as police officers. That would be relevant for determining whether
a conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a “felony” conviction. But it has no
bearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses—
making unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of
individuals—involves the use of “force” within the meaning of
§924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.
