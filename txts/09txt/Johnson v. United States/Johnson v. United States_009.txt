JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

interpreted the statutory definition of “crime of violence”
in 18 U. S. C. §16. That provision is very similar to
§924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense
which “has as an element the use . . . of physical force
against the person or property of another,” §16(a). We
stated:
“In construing both parts of §16, we cannot forget
that we ultimately are determining the meaning of
the term ‘crime of violence.’ The ordinary meaning of
this term, combined with §16’s emphasis on the use of
physical force against another person (or the risk of
having to use such force in committing a crime), sug
gests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .” 543
U. S., at 11.
Just so here. We think it clear that in the context of a
statutory definition of “violent felony,” the phrase “physi
cal force” means violent force—that is, force capable of
causing physical pain or injury to another person. See
Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easter
brook, J.).
Even by itself, the word “violent” in
§924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Web
ster’s Second 2846 (defining “violent” as “[m]oving, acting,
or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and
sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe;
vehement . . .”); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.
1989) (“[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical
force or strength”); Black’s 1706 (“[o]f, relating to, or char
acterized by strong physical force”). When the adjective
“violent” is attached to the noun “felony,” its connotation
of strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188
(defining “violent felony” as “[a] crime characterized by
extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and
assault and battery with a dangerous weapon”); see also
United States v. Doe, 960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992)
