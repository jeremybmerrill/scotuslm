JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

usage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and
extortion are “violent felon[ies],” §924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we
have held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted
burglary, James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007).
All of these offenses may be committed without violent
force,1 and it is therefore clear that the use of such force is
not a requirement under ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies
crimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies
because they often lead to violence. As we have put it,
these crimes create “significant risks of . . . confrontation
that might result in bodily injury,” id., at 199, and offen
sive touching creates just such a risk. For example, when
one bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely conse
quence. See United States v. Velazquez-Overa, 100 F. 3d
418, 422 (CA5 1996) (“If burglary, with its tendency to
cause alarm and to provoke physical confrontation, is
considered a violent crime under 18 U. S. C. §16(b), then
surely the same is true of the far greater intrusion that
occurs when a child is sexually molested”); United States
v. Wood, 52 F. 3d 272, 276 (CA9 1995) (same).

1 For the purposes of ACCA, burglary is defined as “an unlawful or
unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure,
with intent to commit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,
598 (1990). See also James, 550 U. S., at 197, 198, 202–203 (attempted
burglary under Florida law requires “overt conduct directed toward
unlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to
commit a felony therein” and that the “defendant fail in the perpetra
tion or be intercepted or prevented in the execution of the underlying
offense” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although we have not
defined extortion under ACCA, the Hobbs Act defines it as “the obtain
ing of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use
of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official
right.” 18 U. S. C. §1951(b)(2) (emphasis added); see also James, supra,
at 223–224 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (defining extortion in ACCA as “the
obtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced
by the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or
property of another” (emphasis added)).
