ALITO, J., dissenting

many persons convicted for serious spousal or child abuse
will be allowed to possess firearms.
Under 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a
“crime of domestic violence” is subject to removal, and the
term “crime of domestic violence” is defined as an offense
that, among other things, has “as an element the use [or]
attempted use . . . of physical force.” 18 U. S. C. §16(a).
Accordingly, if the Court’s interpretation of the term
“physical force” is applied to this provision, many con
victed spousal and child abusers will escape removal, a
result that Congress is unlikely to have intended.

For all these reasons, I believe that the Court’s decision
is incorrect, and I therefore respectfully dissent.
