JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus
Pp. 3–12.
(a) In interpreting the phrase “physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i),
the Court is not bound by the Florida Supreme Court’s conclusion in
State v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218, that, under Florida’s statutory
equivalent to the Armed Career Criminal Act, Fla. Stat. §775.084,
the offense of battery does not “involve the use . . . of physical force or
violence against any individual,” Fla. Stat. §776.08. The meaning of
“physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not
state law. The Court is bound, however, by the Florida Supreme
Court’s interpretation of the elements of the state law offense, includ
ing the Florida Supreme Court’s holding that §784.03(1)(a)’s element
of “[a]ctually and intentionally touching” another person is satisfied
by any intentional physical contact, no matter how slight. Pp. 3–4.
(b) Because §924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,” the
Court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning. Bailey v. United States,
516 U. S. 137, 144–145. The adjective “physical” is clear. The noun
“force,” however, has a number of meanings. Its ordinary meaning
refers to the application of strength, power, and violence—in this con
text, against another person. Pp. 4–5.
(c) The Government suggests that “force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i)’s defi
nition of “violent felony” is a legal term of art describing one of the
elements of the common-law crime of battery. At common law, that
element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching. Al
though a common-law term of art should be given its established
common-law meaning, the Court does not ascribe to a statutory term
a common-law meaning where that meaning does not fit. Here
“physical force” is used in defining not the crime of battery, but
rather the statutory category of “violent felony.” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). In
that context, “physical force” means violent force—i.e., force capable
of causing physical pain or injury to another person. Cf. Leocal v.
Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11. Moreover, it is significant that the meaning
the Government seeks to impute to the term “force” derives from the
elements of a common-law misdemeanor. Nothing in the text of
§924(e)(2)(B)(i) suggests that “force” in the definition of a “violent fel
ony” should be regarded as a common-law term of art used to define
the contours of a misdemeanor. Nor can any negative inference
about the amount of “force” required by §924(e)(2)(B)(i) be drawn
from §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and §922(g)(8)(C)(ii). Pp. 5–9.
(d) There is no force to the Government’s prediction that this deci
sion will undermine its ability to enforce §922(g)(9)’s firearm disabil
ity against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of
domestic violence that has as an element the “use . . . of physical
force,” §921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The Court interprets the phrase “physical
force” only in the context of a statutory definition of “violent felony,”
