ALITO, J., dissenting

and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion. ”
Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal

In
18
U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii)—the clause immediately following the
clause at issue in this case—the term “violent felony” is
defined as including any crime that “involves conduct that
presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an
other.” (Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not
include a similar limitation in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should
presume that it did not intend for such a limitation to
apply.
The language used by Congress in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii)
further illustrates this point. This provision criminalizes,
among other things, the possession of a firearm by a per
son who is subject to a court order that “explicitly prohib
its the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical
force against [an] intimate partner or child that would
reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.” (Emphasis
added.) Although §922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until
eight years after §924(e)(2)(B)(i), see ante, at 9, the former
provision is nevertheless instructive. If Congress had
wanted to include in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to
those in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and §922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress
could have easily done so expressly.
II
The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret
18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the com
mon-law understanding, but neither is persuasive.
A
The Court first argues that §924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read
to refer to “violent” force because that provision defines
the term “violent felony.” Ante, at 6. But it is apparent
that ACCA uses “violent felony” as a term of art with a
wider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary
