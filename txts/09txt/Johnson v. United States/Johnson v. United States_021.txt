JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

§784.07(2)(b) (1987) (making simple battery of a police
officer a felony); Idaho Code §18–915(c) (Lexis 1987)
(same); Ill. Crim. Code §12–4(b)(6) (1988) (same); La. Stat.
Ann. §§14:33, 14:43.1 (West 1986) (sexual battery punish
able by more than one year’s imprisonment); N. M. Stat.
Ann. §40A–22–23 (1972) (battery of a police officer a fel
ony); see also Kansas Stat. Ann. §21–3413(b) (Supp. 1994)
(simple battery of corrections officers a felony).2
ACCA’s mechanism for identifying the battery convic
tions that merit treatment as “violent felon[ies]” is con
tained in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), which provides that
an offense committed by an adult is not a “violent felony”
unless it is “punishable by imprisonment for a term ex
ceeding one year.” Consequently, while all convictions
under battery statutes that track the common-law defini
tion of the offense satisfy the requirements of
§924(e)(2)(B)(i)—because they have “as an element the
use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force
against the person of another”—not all battery convictions
qualify as convictions for a violent felony because
§924(e)(2)(B) excludes any battery conviction that was not
regarded by the jurisdiction of conviction as being suffi
ciently serious to be punishable by imprisonment for more
than one year. There is nothing extraordinary or unlikely
about this approach.
III
The Court’s interpretation will have untoward conse
quences. Almost half of the States have statutes that
reach both the use of violent force and force that is not
——————
2 These state statutes show that Congress, by using a term of art,
“force,” did not adopt a meaning “peculiar . . . [to the] definition of a
misdemeanor,” see ante, at 7, and, therefore, they are relevant in
determining whether touching involves the use of force under ACCA.
See ante, at 7, n. 1.
