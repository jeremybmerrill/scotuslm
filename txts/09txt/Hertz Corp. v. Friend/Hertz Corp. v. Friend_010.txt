HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND
Opinion of the Court

(1844), the Court modified this initial approach. It held
that a corporation was to be deemed an artificial person of
the State by which it had been created, and its citizenship
for jurisdictional purposes determined accordingly. Id., at
558–559. Ten years later, the Court in Marshall v. Balti
more & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314 (1854), held that the
reason a corporation was a citizen of its State of incorpora
tion was that, for the limited purpose of determining
corporate citizenship, courts could conclusively (and artifi
cially) presume that a corporation’s shareholders were
citizens of the State of incorporation. Id., at 327–328.
And it reaffirmed Letson. 16 How., at 325–326. Whatever
the rationale, the practical upshot was that, for diversity
purposes, the federal courts considered a corporation to be
a citizen of the State of its incorporation. 13F C. Wright,
A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure
§3623, pp. 1–7 (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).
In 1928 this Court made clear that the “state of incorpo
ration” rule was virtually absolute. It held that a corpora
tion closely identified with State A could proceed in a
federal court located in that State as long as the corpora
tion had filed its incorporation papers in State B, perhaps
a State where the corporation did no business at all. See
Black and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown and
Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518, 522–525
(refusing to question corporation’s reincorporation motives
and finding diversity jurisdiction). Subsequently, many in
Congress and those who testified before it pointed out that
this interpretation was at odds with diversity jurisdiction’s
basic rationale, namely, opening the federal courts’ doors
to those who might otherwise suffer from local prejudice
against out-of-state parties. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 530, 72d
Cong., 1st Sess., 2, 4–7 (1932). Through its choice of the
State of incorporation, a corporation could manipulate
federal-court jurisdiction, for example, opening the federal
courts’ doors in a State where it conducted nearly all its
