HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND
Opinion of the Court

(applying “nerve center” test).
II
At the outset, we consider a jurisdictional objection.
Respondents point out that the statute permitting Hertz
to appeal the District Court’s remand order to the Court of
Appeals, 28 U. S. C. §1453(c), constitutes an exception to a
more general jurisdictional rule that remand orders are
“not reviewable on appeal.” §1447(d). They add that the
language of §1453(c) refers only to “court[s] of appeals,”
not to the Supreme Court. The statute also says that if “a
final judgment on the appeal” in a court of appeals “is not
issued before the end” of 60 days (with a possible 10-day
extension), “the appeal shall be denied.” And respondents
draw from these statutory circumstances the conclusion
that Congress intended to permit review of a remand
order only by a court of appeals, not by the Supreme Court
(at least not if, as here, this Court’s grant of certiorari
comes after §1453(c)’s time period has elapsed).
This argument, however, makes far too much of too
little. We normally do not read statutory silence as implic
itly modifying or limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction that
another statute specifically grants. Felker v. Turpin, 518
U. S. 651, 660–661 (1996); Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85,
104–105 (1869). Here, another, pre-existing federal stat
ute gives this Court jurisdiction to “revie[w] . . . [b]y writ
of certiorari” cases that, like this case, are “in the courts of
appeals” when we grant the writ. 28 U. S. C. §1254. This
statutory jurisdictional grant replicates similar grants
that yet older statutes provided. See, e.g., §1254, 62 Stat.
928; §1, 43 Stat. 938–939 (amending §240, 36 Stat. 1157);
§240, 36 Stat. 1157; Evarts Act, §6, 26 Stat. 828. This
history provides particularly strong reasons not to read
§1453(c)’s silence or ambiguous language as modifying or
limiting our pre-existing jurisdiction.
We thus interpret §1453(c)’s “60-day” requirement as
