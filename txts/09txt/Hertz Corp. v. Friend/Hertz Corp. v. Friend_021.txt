Opinion of the Court

the initial “half of gross income” test. A “nerve center” test
offers such a possibility. A general business activities test
does not.
B
We recognize that there may be no perfect test that
satisfies all administrative and purposive criteria. We
recognize as well that, under the “nerve center” test we
adopt today, there will be hard cases. For example, in this
era of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their
command and coordinating functions among officers who
work at several different locations, perhaps communicat
ing over the Internet. That said, our test nonetheless
points courts in a single direction, towards the center of
overall direction, control, and coordination. Courts do not
have to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or reve
nues different in kind, one from the other. Our approach
provides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply,
not a test that will, in all instances, automatically gener
ate a result.
We also recognize that the use of a “nerve center” test
may in some cases produce results that seem to cut
against the basic rationale for 28 U. S. C. §1332, see su
pra, at 6. For example, if the bulk of a company’s business
activities visible to the public take place in New Jersey,
while its top officers direct those activities just across the
river in New York, the “principal place of business” is New
York. One could argue that members of the public in New
Jersey would be less likely to be prejudiced against the
corporation than persons in New York—yet the corpora
tion will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case
to federal court. And note too that the same corporation
would be unable to remove a New York state case to fed
eral court, despite the New York public’s presumed preju
dice against the corporation.
We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise.
