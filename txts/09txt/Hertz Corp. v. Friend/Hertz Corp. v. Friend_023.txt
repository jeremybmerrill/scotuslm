Opinion of the Court

place of actual direction, control, and coordination, in the
absence of such manipulation.
VI
Petitioner’s unchallenged declaration suggests that
Hertz’s center of direction, control, and coordination, its
“nerve center,” and its corporate headquarters are one and
the same, and they are located in New Jersey, not in
California. Because respondents should have a fair opportunity to litigate their case in light of our holding,
however, we vacate the Ninth Circuit’s judgment and
remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
