Opinion of the Court

interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act to answer this ques
tion in part:
“Where a corporation is engaged in far-flung and var
ied activities which are carried on in different states,
its principal place of business is the nerve center from
which it radiates out to its constituent parts and from
which its officers direct, control and coordinate all ac
tivities without regard to locale, in the furtherance of
the corporate objective. The test applied by our Court
of Appeals, is that place where the corporation has an
‘office from which its business was directed and con
trolled’—the place where ‘all of its business was under
the supreme direction and control of its officers.’ ”
Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at 865.
Numerous Circuits have since followed this rule, applying
the “nerve center” test for corporations with “far-flung”
business activities. See, e.g., Topp v. Compair Inc., 814
F. 2d 830, 834 (CA1 1987); see also 15 J. Moore et al.,
Moore’s Federal Practice §102.54[2], p. 102–112.1 (3d ed.
2009) (hereinafter Moore’s).
Scot’s analysis, however, did not go far enough. For it
did not answer what courts should do when the operations
of the corporation are not “far-flung” but rather limited to
only a few States. When faced with this question, various
courts have focused more heavily on where a corporation’s
actual business activities are located. See, e.g., DiazRodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp., 410 F. 3d 56, 60–61 (CA1
2005); R. G. Barry Corp. v. Mushroom Makers, Inc., 612
F. 2d 651, 656–657 (CA2 1979); see also 15 Moore’s
§102.54, at 102–112.1.
Perhaps because corporations come in many different
forms, involve many different kinds of business activities,
and locate offices and plants for different reasons in differ
ent ways in different regions, a general “business activi
ties” approach has proved unusually difficult to apply.
