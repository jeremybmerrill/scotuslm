HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND
Opinion of the Court

State where it has its principal place of business.” §2, 72
Stat. 415.
IV
The phrase “principal place of business” has proved
more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.
Decisions under the Bankruptcy Act did not provide the
firm guidance for which Judge Maris had hoped because
courts interpreting bankruptcy law did not agree about
how to determine a corporation’s “principal place of busi
ness.” Compare Burdick v. Dillon, 144 F. 737, 738 (CA1
1906) (holding that a corporation’s “principal office, rather
than a factory, mill, or mine . . . constitutes the ‘principal
place of business’ ”), with Continental Coal Corp. v.
Roszelle Bros., 242 F. 243, 247 (CA6 1917) (identifying the
“principal place of business” as the location of mining
activities, rather than the “principal office”); see also
Friedenthal, New Limitations on Federal Jurisdiction, 11
Stan. L. Rev. 213, 223 (1959) (“The cases under the Bank
ruptcy Act provide no rigid legal formula for the determi
nation of the principal place of business”).
After Congress’ amendment, courts were similarly
uncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation’s
“principal place of business” for diversity purposes. If a
corporation’s headquarters and executive offices were in
the same State in which it did most of its business, the
test seemed straightforward. The “principal place of
business” was located in that State. See, e.g., Long v.
Silver, 248 F. 3d 309, 314–315 (CA4 2001); Pinnacle Con
sultants, Ltd. v. Leucadia Nat. Corp., 101 F. 3d 900, 906–
907 (CA2 1996).
But suppose those corporate headquarters, including
executive offices, are in one State, while the corporation’s
plants or other centers of business activity are located in
other States? In 1959 a distinguished federal district
judge, Edward Weinfeld, relied on the Second Circuit’s
