HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND
Opinion of the Court

Courts must decide which factors are more important than
others: for example, plant location, sales or servicing
centers; transactions, payrolls, or revenue generation.
See, e.g., R. G. Barry Corp., supra, at 656–657 (place of
sales and advertisement, office, and full-time employees);
Diaz-Rodriguez, supra, at 61–62 (place of stores and in
ventory, employees, income, and sales).
The number of factors grew as courts explicitly com
bined aspects of the “nerve center” and “business activity”
tests to look to a corporation’s “total activities,” sometimes
to try to determine what treatises have described as the
corporation’s “center of gravity.” See, e.g., Gafford v.
General Elec. Co., 997 F. 2d 150, 162–163 (CA6 1993);
Amoco Rocmount Co. v. Anschutz Corp., 7 F. 3d 909, 915
(CA10 1993); 13F Wright & Miller §3625, at 100. A major
treatise confirms this growing complexity, listing Circuit
by Circuit, cases that highlight different factors or empha
size similar factors differently, and reporting that the
“federal courts of appeals have employed various tests”—
tests which “tend to overlap” and which are sometimes
described in “language” that “is imprecise.” 15 Moore’s
§102.54[2], at 102–112. See also id., §§102.54[2], [13], at
102–112 to 102–122 (describing, in 14 pages, major tests
as looking to the “nerve center,” “locus of operations,” or
“center of corporate activities”). Not surprisingly, differ
ent circuits (and sometimes different courts within a
single circuit) have applied these highly general multifac
tor tests in different ways. Id., §§102.54[3]–[7], [11]–[13]
(noting that the First Circuit “has never explained a basis
for choosing between ‘the center of corporate activity’ test
and the ‘locus of operations’ test”; the Second Circuit uses
a “two-part test” similar to that of the Fifth, Ninth, and
Eleventh Circuits involving an initial determination as to
whether “a corporation’s activities are centralized or de
centralized” followed by an application of either the “place
of operations” or “nerve center” test; the Third Circuit
