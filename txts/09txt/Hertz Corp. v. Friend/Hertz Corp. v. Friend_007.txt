Opinion of the Court

The District Court of the Northern District of California
accepted Hertz’s statement of the facts as undisputed.
But it concluded that, given those facts, Hertz was a citi
zen of California. In reaching this conclusion, the court
applied Ninth Circuit precedent, which instructs courts to
identify a corporation’s “principal place of business” by
first determining the amount of a corporation’s business
activity State by State. If the amount of activity is “sig
nificantly larger” or “substantially predominates” in one
State, then that State is the corporation’s “principal place
of business.” If there is no such State, then the “principal
place of business” is the corporation’s “ ‘nerve center,’ ” i.e.,
the place where “ ‘the majority of its executive and admin
istrative functions are performed.’ ” Friend v. Hertz, No.
C–07–5222 MMC (ND Cal., Jan. 15, 2008), p. 3 (hereinaf
ter Order); Tosco Corp. v. Communities for a Better Envi
ronment, 236 F. 3d 495, 500–502 (CA9 2001) (per curiam).
Applying this test, the District Court found that the
“plurality of each of the relevant business activities” was
in California, and that “the differential between the
amount of those activities” in California and the amount
in “the next closest state” was “significant.” Order 4.
Hence, Hertz’s “principal place of business” was Califor
nia, and diversity jurisdiction was thus lacking. The
District Court consequently remanded the case to the
state courts.
Hertz appealed the District Court’s remand order. 28
U. S. C. §1453(c). The Ninth Circuit affirmed in a brief
memorandum opinion. 297 Fed. Appx. 690 (2008). Hertz
filed a petition for certiorari. And, in light of differences
among the Circuits in the application of the test for corpo
rate citizenship, we granted the writ. Compare Tosco
Corp., supra, at 500–502, and Capitol Indemnity Corp. v.
Russellville Steel Co., 367 F. 3d 831, 836 (CA8 2004) (ap
plying “total activity” test and looking at “all corporate
activities”), with Wisconsin Knife Works, supra, at 1282
