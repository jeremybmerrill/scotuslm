HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND
Opinion of the Court

15 (requiring corporation to show that “less than fifty per
cent of its gross income was derived from business trans
acted within the state where the Federal court is held”).
If, for example, a citizen of California sued (under state
law in state court) a corporation that received half or more
of its gross income from California, that corporation would
not be able to remove the case to federal court, even if
Delaware was its State of incorporation.
During the spring and summer of 1951 committee mem
bers circulated their report and attended circuit confer
ences at which federal judges discussed the report’s rec
ommendations. Reflecting those criticisms, the committee
filed a new report in September, in which it revised its
corporate citizenship recommendation. It now proposed
that “ ‘a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of the state
of its original creation . . . [and] shall also be deemed a
citizen of a state where it has its principal place of busi
ness.’ ” Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of
the Committee on Jurisdiction and Venue 4 (Sept. 24,
1951) (hereinafter Sept. Committee Rept.)—the source of
the present-day statutory language. See Hearings on
H. R. 2516 et al. before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House
Committee on the Judiciary, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 9
(1957) (hereinafter House Hearings). The committee
wrote that this new language would provide a “simpler
and more practical formula” than the “gross income” test.
Sept. Committee Rept. 2. It added that the language
“ha[d] a precedent in the jurisdictional provisions of the
Bankruptcy Act.” Id., at 2–3.
In mid-1957 the committee presented its reports to the
House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary.
