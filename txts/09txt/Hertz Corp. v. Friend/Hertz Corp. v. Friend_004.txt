HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND
Syllabus
jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that ac
company a more uniform legal system. Pp. 17–18.
(iii) If the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipula
tion—for example, that the alleged “nerve center” is nothing more
than a mail drop box, a bare office with a computer, or the location of
an annual executive retreat—the courts should instead take as the
“nerve center” the place of actual direction, control, and coordination,
in the absence of such manipulation. Pp. 18–19.
(d) Although petitioner’s unchallenged declaration suggests that
Hertz’s “nerve center” and its corporate headquarters are one and the
same, and that they are located in New Jersey, not in California, re
spondents should have a fair opportunity on remand to litigate their
case in light of today’s holding. P. 19.

297 Fed. Appx. 690, vacated and remanded.
BREYER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
