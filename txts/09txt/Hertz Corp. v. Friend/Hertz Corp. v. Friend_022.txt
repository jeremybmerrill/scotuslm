HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND
Opinion of the Court

However, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule,
we must accept them. Accepting occasionally counterin
tuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to
avoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while
producing the benefits that accompany a more uniform
legal system.
The burden of persuasion for establishing diversity
jurisdiction, of course, remains on the party asserting it.
Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.
375, 377 (1994); McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance
Corp., 298 U. S. 178, 189 (1936); see also 13E Wright &
Miller §3602.1, at 119. When challenged on allegations of
jurisdictional facts, the parties must support their allega
tions by competent proof. McNutt, supra, at 189; 15
Moore’s §102.14, at 102–32 to 102–32.1. And when faced
with such a challenge, we reject suggestions such as,
for example, the one made by petitioner that the mere
filing of a form like the Securities and Exchange Commis
sion’s Form 10–K listing a corporation’s “principal execu
tive offices” would, without more, be sufficient proof to
establish a corporation’s “nerve center.” See, e.g., SEC
Form 10–K, online at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/
form10-k.pdf. (as visited Feb. 19, 2010, and available in
Clerk of Court’s case file). Cf. Dimmitt & Owens Finan
cial, Inc. v. United States, 787 F. 2d 1186, 1190–1192 (CA7
1986) (distinguishing “principal executive office” in the tax
lien context, see 26 U. S. C. §6323(f)(2), from “principal
place of business” under 28 U. S. C. §1332(c)). Such possi
bilities would readily permit jurisdictional manipulation,
thereby subverting a major reason for the insertion of the
“principal place of business” language in the diversity
statute. Indeed, if the record reveals attempts at manipu
lation—for example, that the alleged “nerve center” is
nothing more than a mail drop box, a bare office with a
computer, or the location of an annual executive retreat—
the courts should instead take as the “nerve center” the
