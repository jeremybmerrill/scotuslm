Opinion of the Court

applies the “center of corporate activities” test searching
for the “headquarters of a corporation’s day-to-day activ
ity”; the Fourth Circuit has “endorsed neither [the ‘nerve
center’ or ‘place of operations’] test to the exclusion of the
other”; the Tenth Circuit directs consideration of the “total
activity of the company considered as a whole”). See also
13F Wright & Miller §3625 (describing, in 73 pages, the
“nerve center,” “corporate activities,” and “total activity”
tests as part of an effort to locate the corporation’s “center
of gravity,” while specifying different ways in which differ
ent circuits apply these or other factors).
This complexity may reflect an unmediated judicial
effort to apply the statutory phrase “principal place of
business” in light of the general purpose of diversity juris
diction, i.e., an effort to find the State where a corporation
is least likely to suffer out-of-state prejudice when it is
sued in a local court, Pease v. Peck, 18 How. 595, 599
(1856). But, if so, that task seems doomed to failure.
After all, the relevant purposive concern—prejudice
against an out-of-state party—will often depend upon
factors that courts cannot easily measure, for example, a
corporation’s image, its history, and its advertising, while
the factors that courts can more easily measure, for exam
ple, its office or plant location, its sales, its employment, or
the nature of the goods or services it supplies, will some
times bear no more than a distant relation to the likeli
hood of prejudice. At the same time, this approach is at
war with administrative simplicity. And it has failed to
achieve a nationally uniform interpretation of federal law,
an unfortunate consequence in a federal legal system.

In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation
of the statutory phrase, we have reviewed the Courts of
Appeals’ divergent and increasingly complex interpreta
