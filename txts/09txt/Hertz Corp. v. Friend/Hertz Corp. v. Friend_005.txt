THE HERTZ CORPORATION, PETITIONER v.

MELINDA FRIEND ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[February 23, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The federal diversity jurisdiction statute provides that
“a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State
by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it
has its principal place of business.” 28 U. S. C. §1332(c)(1)
(emphasis added). We seek here to resolve different inter
pretations that the Circuits have given this phrase. In
doing so, we place primary weight upon the need for judi
cial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as
simple as possible. And we conclude that the phrase
“principal place of business” refers to the place where the
corporation’s high level officers direct, control, and coordi
nate the corporation’s activities. Lower federal courts
have often metaphorically called that place the corpora
tion’s “nerve center.” See, e.g., Wisconsin Knife Works v.
National Metal Crafters, 781 F. 2d 1280, 1282 (CA7 1986);
Scot Typewriter Co. v. Underwood Corp., 170 F. Supp. 862,
865 (SDNY 1959) (Weinfeld, J.). We believe that the
“nerve center” will typically be found at a corporation’s
headquarters.
