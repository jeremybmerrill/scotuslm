Opinion of the Court

simply requiring a court of appeals to reach a decision
within a specified time—not to deprive this Court of sub
sequent jurisdiction to review the case. See Aetna Casu
alty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466–467
(1947); Gay v. Ruff, 292 U. S. 25, 28–31 (1934).
III
We begin our “principal place of business” discussion
with a brief review of relevant history. The Constitution
provides that the “judicial Power shall extend” to “Contro
versies . . . between Citizens of different States.” Art. III,
§2. This language, however, does not automatically confer
diversity jurisdiction upon the federal courts. Rather, it
authorizes Congress to do so and, in doing so, to determine
the scope of the federal courts’ jurisdiction within constitu
tional limits. Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260 U. S. 226,
233–234 (1922); Mayor v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 247, 252 (1868).
Congress first authorized federal courts to exercise
diversity jurisdiction in 1789 when, in the First Judiciary
Act, Congress granted federal courts authority to hear
suits “between a citizen of the State where the suit is
brought, and a citizen of another State.” §11, 1 Stat. 78.
The statute said nothing about corporations. In 1809,
Chief Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court,
described a corporation as an “invisible, intangible, and
artificial being” which was “certainly not a citizen.” Bank
of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809). But
the Court held that a corporation could invoke the federal
courts’ diversity jurisdiction based on a pleading that the
corporation’s shareholders were all citizens of a different
State from the defendants, as “the term citizen ought to be
understood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is
used in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons
who come into court, in this case, under their corporate
name.” Id., at 91–92.
