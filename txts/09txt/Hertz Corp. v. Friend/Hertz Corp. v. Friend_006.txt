HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND 

Opinion of the Court 


I

In September 2007, respondents Melinda Friend and
John Nhieu, two California citizens, sued petitioner, the
Hertz Corporation, in a California state court. They
sought damages for what they claimed were violations of
California’s wage and hour laws. App. to Pet. for Cert.
20a. And they requested relief on behalf of a potential
class composed of California citizens who had allegedly
suffered similar harms.
Hertz filed a notice seeking removal to a federal court.
28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), 1441(a). Hertz claimed that the
plaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of different
States. §§1332(a)(1), (c)(1). Hence, the federal court
possessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Friend and
Nhieu, however, claimed that the Hertz Corporation was a
California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diver
sity jurisdiction was lacking.
To support its position, Hertz submitted a declaration
by an employee relations manager that sought to show
that Hertz’s “principal place of business” was in New
Jersey, not in California. The declaration stated, among
other things, that Hertz operated facilities in 44 States;
and that California—which had about 12% of the Nation’s
population, Pet. for Cert. 8—accounted for 273 of Hertz’s
1,606 car rental locations; about 2,300 of its 11,230 full
time employees; about $811 million of its $4.371 billion in
annual revenue; and about 3.8 million of its approximately
21 million annual transactions, i.e., rentals. The declara
tion also stated that the “leadership of Hertz and its do
mestic subsidiaries” is located at Hertz’s “corporate head
quarters” in Park Ridge, New Jersey; that its “core
executive and administrative functions . . . are carried out”
there and “to a lesser extent” in Oklahoma City, Okla
homa; and that its “major administrative operations . . .
are found” at those two locations. App. to Pet. for Cert.
26a–30a.
