Opinion of the Court

business by filing incorporation papers elsewhere. Id., at
4 (“Since the Supreme Court has decided that a corpora
tion is a citizen . . . it has become a common practice for
corporations to be incorporated in one State while they do
business in another. And there is no doubt but that it
often occurs simply for the purpose of being able to have
the advantage of choosing between two tribunals in case of
litigation”). See also Hearings on S. 937 et al. before a
Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
72d Cong., 1st Sess., 4–5 (1932) (Letter from Sen. George
W. Norris to Attorney General William D. Mitchell (May
24, 1930)) (citing a “common practice for individuals to

Jurisdiction and Venue, issued a report (hereinafter Mar.
Committee Rept.).
Among its observations, the committee found a general
need “to prevent frauds and abuses” with respect to juris
diction. Id., at 14. The committee recommended against
eliminating diversity cases altogether. Id., at 28. Instead
it recommended, along with other proposals, a statutory
amendment that would make a corporation a citizen both
of the State of its incorporation and any State from which
it received more than half of its gross income. Id., at 14–
