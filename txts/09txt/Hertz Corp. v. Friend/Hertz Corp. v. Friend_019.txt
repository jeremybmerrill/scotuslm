Opinion of the Court

application of a more general business activities test has
led some courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a
particular place within a State, but incorrectly at the
State itself, measuring the total amount of business activi
ties that the corporation conducts there and determining
whether they are “significantly larger” than in the next
ranking State. 297 Fed. Appx. 690.
This approach invites greater litigation and can lead to
strange results, as the Ninth Circuit has since recognized.
Namely, if a “corporation may be deemed a citizen of
California on th[e] basis” of “activities [that] roughly
reflect California’s larger population . . . nearly every
national retailer—no matter how far flung its operations—
will be deemed a citizen of California for diversity pur
poses.” Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev., N. A., 557 F. 3d 1026,
1029–1030 (2009). But why award or decline diversity
jurisdiction on the basis of a State’s population, whether
measured directly, indirectly (say proportionately), or with
modifications?
Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a
jurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375
(1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (eschewing
“the sort of vague boundary that is to be avoided in the
area of subject-matter jurisdiction wherever possible”).
Complex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up
time and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of
their claims, but which court is the right court to decide
those claims. Cf. Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U. S.
458, 464, n. 13 (1980). Complex tests produce appeals and
reversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish
the likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a
claim’s legal and factual merits. Judicial resources too are
at stake. Courts have an independent obligation to de
termine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even
when no party challenges it. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546
U. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil
