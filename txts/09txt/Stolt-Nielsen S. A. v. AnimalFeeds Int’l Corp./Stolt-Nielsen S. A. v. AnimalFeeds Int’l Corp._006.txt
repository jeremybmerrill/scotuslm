known as the “Vegoilvoy” charter party. Petitioners as­

Symposium on Charter Parties: The History, Develop­

Tulane L. Rev. 743, 753 (1975) (“Voyage charter parties
are highly standardized, with many commodities and
charterers having their own specialized forms”).
Adopted in 1950, the Vegoilvoy charter party contains
the following arbitration clause:
“Arbitration. Any dispute arising from the making,
performance or termination of this Charter Party
shall be settled in New York, Owner and Charterer
each appointing an arbitrator, who shall be a mer­
chant, broker or individual experienced in the ship­
ping business; the two thus chosen, if they cannot
agree, shall nominate a third arbitrator who shall be
an Admiralty lawyer. Such arbitration shall be con­
ducted in conformity with the provisions and proce­
dure of the United States Arbitration Act [i.e., the
FAA], and a judgment of the Court shall be entered
upon any award made by said arbitrator.” App. to
Pet. for Cert. 69a.

fixing conspiracy. When AnimalFeeds learned of this, it
brought a putative class action against petitioners in the
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,
