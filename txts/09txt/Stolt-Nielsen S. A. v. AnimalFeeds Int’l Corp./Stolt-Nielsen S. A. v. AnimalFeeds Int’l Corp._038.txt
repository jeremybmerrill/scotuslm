STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

at 13–14) (“[R]ules allowing multiple claims (and claims
by or against multiple parties) to be litigated together . . .
neither change plaintiffs’ separate entitlements to relief
nor abridge defendants’ rights; they alter only how the
claims are processed.”). That the arbitrators endeavored
to perform their assigned task honestly is not contested.
“Courts . . . do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal
error by an arbitrator as an appellate court does in review
ing decisions of lower courts.” Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc.,
484 U. S. 29, 38 (1987). The arbitrators here not merely
“arguably,” but certainly, “constru[ed] . . . the contract”
with fidelity to their commission. Ibid. This Court, there
fore, may not disturb the arbitrators’ judgment, even if
convinced that “serious error” infected the panel’s award.

The Court not only intrudes on a decision the parties
referred to arbitrators. It compounds the intrusion by
according the arbitrators no opportunity to clarify their
decision and thereby to cure the error the Court perceives.
Section 10(b), the Court asserts, invests in this tribunal
authority to “decide the question that was originally re
ferred to the panel.” Ante, at 12. The controlling provi
sion, however, says nothing of the kind. Section 10(b)
reads, in full: “If an award is vacated and the time within
which the agreement required the award to be made has
not expired, the court may, in its discretion, direct a re
hearing by the arbitrators.” (Emphasis added.) Just as
§10(a)(4) provides no justification for the Court’s disposi
tion, see supra, at 6–9 and this page, so, too, §10(b) pro
vides no grounding for the Court’s peremptory action.
