GINSBURG, J., dissenting

court to vacate an arbitration panel’s decision “only in
very unusual circumstances.” First Options of Chicago,
Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 942 (1995). The four
grounds for vacatur codified in §10(a) restate the long
standing rule that, “[i]f [an arbitration] award is within
the submission, and contains the honest decision of the
arbitrators, after a full and fair hearing of the parties, a
court . . . will not set [the award] aside for error, either in
law or fact.” Burchell v. Marsh, 17 How. 344, 349 (1855).
The sole §10 ground Stolt-Nielsen invokes for vacating
the arbitrators’ decision is §10(a)(4). The question under
that provision is “whether the arbitrators had the power,
based on the parties’ submissions or the arbitration
agreement, to reach a certain issue, not whether the arbi
trators correctly decided that issue.” DiRussa v. Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., 121 F. 3d 818, 824 (CA2 1997); Com
prehensive Accounting Corp. v. Rudell, 760 F. 2d 138, 140
(CA7 1985). The parties’ supplemental agreement, refer
ring the class-arbitration issue to an arbitration panel,
undoubtedly empowered the arbitrators to render their
clause-construction decision.
That scarcely debatable
point should resolve this case.
——————
“In any of the following cases the United States court in and for the
district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the
award upon the application of any party to the arbitration—
“(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue
means;
“(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitra
tors, or either of them;
“(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to
postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to
hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other
misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or
“(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly
executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the
subject matter submitted was not made.”
