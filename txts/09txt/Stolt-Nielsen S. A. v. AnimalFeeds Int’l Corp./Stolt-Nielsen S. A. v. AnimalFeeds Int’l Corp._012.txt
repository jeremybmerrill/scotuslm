STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
Opinion of the Court

ceedings, AnimalFeeds made three arguments in support of construing the arbitration clause to permit class
arbitration:
“The parties’ arbitration clause should be construed
to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is silent on the issue of class treatment and, without express prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under
Bazzle; (b) the clause should be construed to permit
class arbitration as a matter of public policy; and (c)
the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable
if it forbade class arbitration.” App. in No. 06–3474–
cv (CA2), at A–308 to A–309 (emphasis added).
The arbitrators expressly rejected AnimalFeeds’ first
argument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, and said nothing
about the third. Instead, the panel appears to have rested
its decision on AnimalFeeds’ public policy argument.
Because the parties agreed their agreement was “silent” in
the sense that they had not reached any agreement on the
issue of class arbitration, the arbitrators’ proper task was
to identify the rule of law that governs in that situation.
Had they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably
would have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the
two bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing,
i.e., either federal maritime law or New York law. But the
panel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule
of decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt
to determine what rule would govern under either maritime or New York law in the case of a “silent” contract.
Instead, the panel based its decision on post-Bazzle arbitral decisions that “construed a wide variety of clauses in a
wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.”
App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel did not mention
whether any of these decisions were based on a rule de-
