GINSBURG, J., dissenting

proceed on a class basis, the Court apparently demands
contractual language one can read as affirmatively author
izing class arbitration. See ante, at 20 (“[A] party may not
be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration
unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the
party agreed to do so.”); ante, at 23. The breadth of the
arbitration clause, and the absence of any provision waiv
ing or banning class proceedings,10 will not do. Ante, at
20–23.
The Court ties the requirement of affirmative authoriza
tion to “the basic precept that arbitration ‘is a matter of
consent, not coercion.’ ” Ante, at 17 (quoting Volt Informa
tion Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford
Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989)). Parties may
“specify with whom they choose to arbitrate,” the Court
observes, just as they may “limit the issues they choose to
arbitrate.” Ante, at 19. But arbitrators, in delineating an
appropriate class, need not, and should not, disregard
such contractual constraints. In this case, for example,
AnimalFeeds proposes to pursue, on behalf of a class, only
“claims . . . arising out of any [charter party agreement]
. . . that provides for arbitration.” App. to Pet. for Cert.
56a (emphasis added). Should the arbitrators certify the
proposed class, they would adjudicate only the rights of
persons “with whom” Stolt-Nielsen agreed to arbitrate,
and only “issues” subject to arbitration. Ante, at 19 (em
phasis omitted).
——————
10 Several courts have invalidated contractual bans on, or waivers of,
class arbitration because proceeding on an individual basis was not
feasible in view of the high costs entailed and the slim benefits achiev
able. See, e.g., In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation, 554 F. 3d
300, 315–316, 320 (CA2 2009); Kristian v. Comcast Corp., 446 F. 3d 25,
55, 59 (CA1 2006); Discover Bank v. Superior Court, 36 Cal. 4th 148,
162–163, 113 P. 3d 1100, 1110 (2005); Leonard v. Terminix Int’l Co.,
LP, 854 So. 2d 529, 539 (Ala. 2002). Were there no right to proceed on
behalf of a class in the first place, however, a provision banning or
waiving recourse to this aggregation device would be superfluous.
