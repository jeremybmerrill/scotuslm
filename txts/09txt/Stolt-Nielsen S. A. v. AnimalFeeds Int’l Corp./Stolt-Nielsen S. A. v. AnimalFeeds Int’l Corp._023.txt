Opinion of the Court

see also Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S.
574, 581 (1960) (an arbitrator “has no general charter to
administer justice for a community which transcends the
parties” but rather is “part of a system of self-government
created by and confined to the parties” (internal quotation
marks omitted)).
Underscoring the consensual nature of private dispute
resolution, we have held that parties are “ ‘generally free
to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.’ ”
Mastrobuono, supra, at 57; see also AT&T Technologies,
supra, at 648–649. For example, we have held that par­
ties may agree to limit the issues they choose to arbitrate,
see Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 628, and may agree on
rules under which any arbitration will proceed, Volt,
supra, at 479. They may choose who will resolve specific
disputes. E.g., App. 30a; Alexander v. Gardner-Denver
Co., 415 U. S. 36, 57 (1974); Burchell v. Marsh, 17 How.
344, 349 (1855); see also International Produce, Inc. v.

sought-after arbitrators are those who are prominent and
experienced members of the specific business community
in which the dispute to be arbitrated arose”), cert. denied,
451 U. S. 1017 (1981).
We think it is also clear from our precedents and the
contractual nature of arbitration that parties may specify
with whom they choose to arbitrate their disputes. See
EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 289 (2002)
(“[N]othing in the [FAA] authorizes a court to compel
arbitration of any issues, or by any parties, that are not
already covered in the agreement” (emphasis added));
Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr.
Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 20 (1983) (“[A]n arbitration agreement
must be enforced notwithstanding the presence of other
persons who are parties to the underlying dispute but not
to the arbitration agreement”); Steelworkers, supra, at 581
(an arbitrator “has no general charter to administer jus­
