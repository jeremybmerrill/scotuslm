Opinion of the Court

tained an arbitration clause but did not expressly mention
class arbitration. Nevertheless, an arbitrator conducted
class arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the
customers.
The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the
awards. Bazzle v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 351 S. C.
244, 569 S. E. 2d 349 (2002). After discussing both Seventh Circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority
to order classwide arbitration under §4 of the FAA, see
Champ v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269 (1995), and
conflicting California precedent, see Keating v. Superior
Court of Alameda Cty., 31 Cal. 3d 584, 645 P. 2d 1192
(1982), the State Supreme Court elected to follow the

a trial court to “order class-wide arbitration under adhesive but enforceable franchise contracts,” 351 S. C., at 259,
266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357, 360. Under this approach, the
South Carolina court observed, a trial judge must

and should take into account factors such as “efficiency”
and “equity.” Id., at 260, and n. 15, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357,
and n. 15.
Applying these standards to the case before it, the South
Carolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause
in the Green Tree contracts was “silent regarding classwide arbitration.” Id., at 263, 569 S. E. 2d, at 359
(emphasis deleted). The Court described its holding as
follows:
“[W]e . . . hold that class-wide arbitration may be ordered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it
would serve efficiency and equity, and would not result in prejudice. If we enforced a mandatory, adhesive arbitration clause, but prohibited class actions in
