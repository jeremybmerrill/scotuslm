GINSBURG, J., dissenting

that “the arbitrators [had] exceeded their powers.”
§10(a)(4). The Court of Appeals upheld the award: “Be
cause the parties specifically agreed that the arbitration
panel would decide whether the arbitration claus[e] per
mitted class arbitration,” the Second Circuit reasoned,
“the arbitration panel did not exceed its authority in decid
ing that issue—irrespective of whether it decided the issue
correctly.” 548 F. 3d 85, 101 (2008).

I consider, first, the fitness of the arbitrators’ clause
construction award for judicial review. The arbitrators
decided the issue, in accord with the parties’ supplemental
agreement, “as a threshold matter.” App. 56a. Their
decision that the charter-party arbitration clause permit
ted class arbitration was abstract and highly interlocu
tory. The panel did not decide whether the particular
claims AnimalFeeds advanced were suitable for class
resolution, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a; much less
did it delineate any class or consider whether, “if a class is
certified, . . . members of the putative class should be
required to ‘opt in’ to th[e] proceeding,” id., at 52a.
The Court, ante, at 6, n. 2, does not persuasively justify
judicial intervention so early in the game or convincingly
reconcile its adjudication with the firm final-judgment
rule prevailing in the federal court system. See, e.g., 28
U. S. C. §1257 (providing for petitions for certiorari from
“[f]inal judgments or decrees” of state courts); §1291 (pro
viding for Court of Appeals review of district court “final
decisions”); Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233
(1945) (describing “final decision” generally as “one which
ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for
the court to do but execute the judgment”).
We have equated to “final decisions” a slim set of “col
lateral orders” that share these characteristics: They “are
conclusive, [they] resolve important questions separate
