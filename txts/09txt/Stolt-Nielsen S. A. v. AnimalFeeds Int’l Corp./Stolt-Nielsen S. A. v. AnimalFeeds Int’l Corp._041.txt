GINSBURG, J., dissenting

class arbitration. Class arbitration may be ordered if
“there is a contractual basis for concluding that the
part[ies] agreed” “to submit to class arbitration”. Ante, at
20; see ante, at 23, n. 10 (“We have no occasion to decide
what contractual basis may support a finding that the
parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.”).
Second, by observing that “the parties [here] are sophisti
cated business entities,” and “that it is customary for the
shipper to choose the charter party that is used for a
particular shipment,” the Court apparently spares from its
affirmative-authorization requirement contracts of adhe
sion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Ante, at 20.
While these qualifications limit the scope of the Court’s
decision, I remain persuaded that the arbitrators’ judg
ment should not have been disturbed.

For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the petition
for want of a controversy ripe for judicial review. Were I
to reach the merits, I would affirm the Second Circuit’s
judgment confirming the arbitrators’ clause-construction
decision.
