Opinion of the Court

arbitration are comparable to those of class-action litiga­
tion, cf. App. in No. 06–3474–cv (CA2), at A–77, A–79,
¶¶30, 31, 40, even though the scope of judicial review is
much more limited, see Hall Street, 552 U. S., at 588. We
think that the differences between bilateral and class­
action arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,
consistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that
the parties’ mere silence on the issue of class-action arbi­
tration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in
class proceedings.10
The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by
characterizing the question before the arbitrators as being
merely what “procedural mode” was available to present
AnimalFeeds’ claims. Post, at 9. If the question were that
simple, there would be no need to consider the parties’
intent with respect to class arbitration. See Howsam,
supra, at 84 (committing “procedural questions” presump­
tively to the arbitrator’s discretion (internal quotation
marks omitted)). But the FAA requires more. Contrary to
the dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasiz­
ing the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the ques­
tion as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class
arbitration. Here, where the parties stipulated that there
was “no agreement” on this question, it follows that the
parties cannot be compelled to submit their dispute to
class arbitration.
V
For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceed­
ings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

have no occasion to decide what contractual basis may support
a finding that the parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.
Here, as noted, the parties stipulated that there was “no agreement” on
the issue of class-action arbitration. App. 77a.
