STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

The Court also links its affirmative-authorization re
quirement to the parties’ right to stipulate rules under
which arbitration may proceed. See ibid. The question,
however, is the proper default rule when there is no stipu
lation. Arbitration provisions, this Court has noted, are a
species of forum-selection clauses. See Scherk v. AlbertoCulver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 519 (1974). Suppose the parties
had chosen a New York judicial forum for resolution of
“any dispute” involving a contract for ocean carriage of
goods. There is little question that the designated court,
state or federal, would have authority to conduct claims
like AnimalFeeds’ on a class basis. Why should the class
action prospect vanish when the “any dispute” clause is
contained in an arbitration agreement? Cf. Connecticut
General Life Ins. Co. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada,
210 F. 3d 771, 774–776 (CA7 2000) (reading contract’s
authorization to arbitrate “[a]ny dispute” to permit con
solidation of arbitrations). If the Court is right that arbi
trators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class pro
ceedings, see ante, at 21–22, then the claimant should
retain its right to proceed in that format in court.

When adjudication is costly and individual claims are no
more than modest in size, class proceedings may be “the
thing,” i.e., without them, potential claimants will have
little, if any, incentive to seek vindication of their rights.
Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 617
(1997); Carnegie v. Household Int’l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656,
661 (CA7 2004) (“The realistic alternative to a class action
is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits,
as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.”). Mindful that
disallowance of class proceedings severely shrinks the
dimensions of the case or controversy a claimant can
mount, I note some stopping points in the Court’s decision.
First, the Court does not insist on express consent to
