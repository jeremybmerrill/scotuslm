STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
Opinion of the Court

cluded in the class would never intend that the arbitration
clauses would permit a class arbitration.”6 Id., at 50a–
——————
6 Petitioners produced expert evidence from experienced maritime
arbitrators demonstrating that it is customary in the shipping business
for parties to resolve their disputes through bilateral arbitration. See,
e.g., App. 126a (expert declaration of John Kimball) (“In the 30 years I
have been practicing as a maritime lawyer, I have never encountered
an arbitration clause in a charter party that could be construed as
allowing class action arbitration”); id., at 139a (expert declaration of
Bruce Harris) (“I have been working as a maritime arbitrator for thirty
years and this matter is the first I have ever encountered where the
issue of a class action arbitration has even been raised”). These experts
amplified their written statements in their live testimony, as well. See,
e.g., App. 112a, 113a (Mr. Kimball) (opining that the prospect of a class
action in a maritime arbitration would be “quite foreign” to overseas
shipping executives and charterers); id., at 111a–112a (Mr. Harris)
(opining that in the view of the London Corps of International Arbitra­
tion, class arbitration is “inconceivable”).
Under both New York law and general maritime law, evidence of
“custom and usage” is relevant to determining the parties’ intent when
an express agreement is ambiguous. See Excess Ins. Co. v. Factory
Mut. Ins. Co., 3 N. Y. 3d 577, 590–591, 822 N. E. 2d 768, 777 (2004)
(“Our precedent establishes that where there is ambiguity in a reinsur­
ance certificate, the surrounding circumstances, including industry
custom and practice, should be taken into consideration”); Lopez v.
Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y., 40 N. Y. 2d 605, 609, 357 N. E. 2d
951, 954–955 (1976) (where contract terms were ambiguous, parol
evidence of custom and practice was properly admitted to show parties’
intent); 407 East 61st Garage, Inc. v. Savoy Fifth Avenue Corp., 23 N. Y.
2d 275, 281, 244 N. E. 2d 37, 41 (1968) (contract was “not so free from
ambiguity to preclude extrinsic evidence” of industry “custom and
usage” that would “establish the correct interpretation or understand­
ing of the agreement as to its term”). See also Great Circle Lines, Ltd.
v. Matheson & Co., 681 F. 2d 121, 125 (CA2 1982) (“Certain long­
standing customs of the shipping industry are crucial factors to be
considered when deciding whether there has been a meeting of the
minds on a maritime contract”); Samsun Corp. v. Khozestan Mashine
Kar Co., 926 F. Supp. 436, 439 (SDNY 1996) (“[W]here as here the
contract is one of charter party, established practices and customs of
the shipping industry inform the court’s analysis of what the parties
agreed to”); Hough, Admiralty Jurisdiction—Of Late Years, 37 Harv.
