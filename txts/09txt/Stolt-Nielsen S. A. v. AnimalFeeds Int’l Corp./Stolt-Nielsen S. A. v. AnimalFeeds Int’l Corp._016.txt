STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
Opinion of the Court

acknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the
Vegoilvoy charter party was “silent on whether [it] per­
mit[ted] or preclude[d] class arbitration,” but that the
charter party was “not ambiguous so as to call for parol
evidence.” Ibid. This stipulation left no room for an in­
quiry regarding the parties’ intent, and any inquiry into
that settled question would have been outside the panel’s
assigned task.
The panel also commented on the breadth of the lan­
guage in the Vegoilvoy charter party, see id., at 50a, but
since the only task that was left for the panel, in light of
the parties’ stipulation, was to identify the governing rule
applicable in a case in which neither the language of the
contract nor any other evidence established that the par­
ties had reached any agreement on the question of class
arbitration, the particular wording of the charter party
was quite beside the point.
In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of
decision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New
York law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy
choice and thus exceeded its powers. As a result, under
§10(b) of the FAA, we must either “direct a rehearing by
the arbitrators” or decide the question that was originally
referred to the panel. Because we conclude that there can
be only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see
no need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.

the “resolution” of the question whether the Vegoilvoy
charter party “permit[s] this arbitration to proceed on
behalf of a class,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a, but that
understanding was incorrect.
Bazzle concerned contracts between a commercial lender
(Green Tree) and its customers. These contracts con­
