Opinion of the Court

necessary to give effect to the parties’ agreement. Thus,
we have said that “ ‘ “procedural” questions which grow out
of the dispute and bear on its final disposition’ are pre­
sumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to
decide.” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S.
79, 84 (2002) (quoting John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v.
Livingston, 376 U. S. 543, 557 (1964)). This recognition is
grounded in the background principle that “[w]hen the
parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract
have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential
to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which
is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the
court.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §204 (1979).
An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitra­
tion, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer
solely from the fact of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate.
This is so because class-action arbitration changes the
nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be
presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to
submit their disputes to an arbitrator. In bilateral arbi­
tration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate
review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of
private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency
and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to
resolve specialized disputes.

the economics of dispute resolution” (citing Circuit City

because they trust his knowledge and judgment concern­
ing the demands and norms of industrial relations”). But
the relative benefits of class-action arbitration are much
less assured, giving reason to doubt the parties’ mutual
