Opinion of the Court

asserting antitrust claims for supracompetitive prices that
petitioners allegedly charged their customers over a period
of several years.
Other charterers brought similar suits. In one of these,
the District Court for the District of Connecticut held that
the charterers’ claims were not subject to arbitration
under the applicable arbitration clause, but the Second
Circuit reversed. See JLM Industries, Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen
S. A., 387 F. 3d 163, 183 (2004). While that appeal was
pending, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
ordered the consolidation of then-pending actions against
petitioners, including AnimalFeeds’ action, in the District
of Connecticut. See In re Parcel Tanker Shipping Services
Antitrust Litigation, 296 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1371, and n. 1
(JPML 2003). The parties agree that as a consequence of
these judgments and orders, AnimalFeeds and petitioners
must arbitrate their antitrust dispute.

In 2005, AnimalFeeds served petitioners with a demand
for class arbitration, designating New York City as the
place of arbitration and seeking to represent a class of

services globally for bulk liquid chemicals, edible oils,
acids, and other specialty liquids from [petitioners] at any
time during the period from August 1, 1998, to November
30, 2002.” 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (internal quotation
marks omitted). The parties entered into a supplemental
agreement providing for the question of class arbitration
to be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to
“follow and be bound by Rules 3 through 7 of the American
Arbitration Association’s Supplementary Rules for Class
Arbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003).” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 59a. These rules (hereinafter Class Rules) were
developed by the American Arbitration Association (AAA)
after our decision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle,
