STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

from the merits, and [they] are effectively unreviewable on
appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.”
Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 4–5) (quoting Swint v. Chambers
County Comm’n, 514 U. S. 35, 42 (1995)). “[O]rders relat
ing to class certification” in federal court, it is settled, do
not fit that bill. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S.

Congress, of course, can provide exceptions to the “final
decision” rule. Prescriptions in point include §1292 (im
mediately appealable “[i]nterlocutory decisions”); §2072(c)
(authorizing promulgation of rules defining when a dis
trict court ruling is final for purposes of appeal under
§1291); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(f) (pursuant to §1292(e),
accords Courts of Appeals discretion to permit appeals
from district court orders granting or denying class-action
certification); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b) (providing for
“entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer
than all, of the claims or parties”). Did Congress provide
for immediate review of the preliminary ruling in question
here?
Section 16 of the FAA, governing appellate review of
district court arbitration orders, lists as an appealable
disposition a district court decision “confirming or denying
confirmation of an award or partial award.” 9 U. S. C.
§16(a)(1)(D). Notably, the arbitrators in the matter at
hand labeled their decision “Partial Final Clause Con
struction Award.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. It cannot be
true, however, that parties or arbitrators can gain instant
review by slicing off a preliminary decision or a procedural
——————
4 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), adopted in response to Coopers
& Lybrand, gives Courts of Appeals discretion to permit an appeal from
an order granting or denying class-action certification. But the rule
would not permit review of a preliminary order of the kind at
issue here, i.e., one that defers decision whether to grant or deny
certification.
