1:06–CV–00420–JSR (SDNY) in App. in No. 06–3474–cv
(CA2), p. A–17, ¶16 (citing §10(a)(4) as a ground for vaca­
tur of the award); see also id., at A–15 to A–16, ¶9 (invok­
ing the District Court’s jurisdiction under 9 U. S. C. §203
and 28 U. S. C. §§1331 and 1333). The District Court
vacated the award, concluding that the arbitrators’ deci­
sion was made in “manifest disregard” of the law insofar
as the arbitrators failed to conduct a choice-of-law analy­
sis. 435 F. Supp. 2d 382, 384–385 (SDNY 2006). See
Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427, 436–437 (1953) (“[T]he
interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to
manifest disregard are not subject, in the federal courts, to
judicial review for error in interpretation”); see also Peti­
tion to Vacate Arbitration Award, supra, at A–17, ¶17
(alleging that the arbitration panel “manifestly disre­
garded the law”). Had such an analysis been conducted,
the District Court held, the arbitrators would have applied
the rule of federal maritime law requiring that contracts
be interpreted in light of custom and usage. 435 F. Supp.
2d, at 385–386.
AnimalFeeds appealed to the Court of Appeals, which
reversed. See 9 U. S. C. §16(a)(1)(E) (“An appeal may be
taken from . . . an order . . . vacating an award”). As an
initial matter, the Court of Appeals held that the “mani­
fest disregard” standard survived our decision in Hall
Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576
(2008), as a “judicial gloss” on the enumerated grounds for
vacatur of arbitration awards under 9 U. S. C. §10. 548
F. 3d, at 94. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals concluded
that, because petitioners had cited no authority applying a
federal maritime rule of custom and usage against class
arbitration, the arbitrators’ decision was not in manifest
disregard of federal maritime law. Id., at 97–98. Nor had
the arbitrators manifestly disregarded New York law, the
Court of Appeals continued, since nothing in New York
