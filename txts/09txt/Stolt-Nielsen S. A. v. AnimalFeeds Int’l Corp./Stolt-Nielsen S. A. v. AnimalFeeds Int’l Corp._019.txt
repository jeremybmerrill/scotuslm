Opinion of the Court

fore concluded that the decision of the State Supreme
Court should be vacated and that the case should be re­
manded for a decision by the arbitrator on the question
whether the contracts were indeed “silent.” The plurality
did not decide either the second or the third question
noted above.
JUSTICE STEVENS concurred in the judgment vacating
and remanding because otherwise there would have been
“no controlling judgment of the Court,” but he did not
endorse the plurality’s rationale. Id., at 455 (opinion
concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). He did
not take a definitive position on the first question, stating
only that “[a]rguably the interpretation of the parties’
agreement should have been made in the first instance by
the arbitrator.” Ibid. (emphasis added). But because he
did not believe that Green Tree had raised the question of
the appropriate decision maker, he preferred not to reach
that question and, instead, would have affirmed the deci­
sion of the State Supreme Court on the ground that “the
decision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct
as a matter of law.” Ibid. Accordingly, his analysis by­
passed the first question noted above and rested instead
on his resolution of the second and third questions. Thus,
Bazzle did not yield a majority decision on any of the three
questions.

tor, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class
arbitration. See App. 89a (transcript of argument before
arbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: “What
[Bazzle] says is that the contract interpretation issue is
left up to the arbitrator, that’s the rule in [Bazzle]”). In
