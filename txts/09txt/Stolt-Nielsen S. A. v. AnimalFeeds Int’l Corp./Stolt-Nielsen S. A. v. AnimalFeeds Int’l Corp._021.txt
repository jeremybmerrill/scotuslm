open, and we turn to it now.
IV
While the interpretation of an arbitration agreement is
generally a matter of state law, see Arthur Andersen LLP
v. Carlisle, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6); Perry v.
Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 493, n. 9 (1987), the FAA imposes
certain rules of fundamental importance, including the
basic precept that arbitration “is a matter of consent, not
coercion,” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of
Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468,
479 (1989).

In 1925, Congress enacted the United States Arbitration
Act, as the FAA was formerly known, for the express
purpose of making “valid and enforceable written provi­
sions or agreements for arbitration of disputes arising out
of contracts, maritime transactions, or commerce among
the States or Territories or with foreign nations.” 43 Stat.
883. Reenacted and codified in 1947, see 61 Stat. 669,9 the

argument in favor of a class action arbitration . . . and may not be relied
upon by the Parties, any arbitration panel, any court, or any other
tribunal for such purposes.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a–63a (emphasis
added). As with any agreement to arbitrate, we are obliged to enforce
the parties’ supplemental agreement “according to its terms.” Mastro
buono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 58 (1995). The
question that the arbitration panel was charged with deciding was
whether the arbitration clause in the Vegoilvoy charter party allowed
for class arbitration, and nothing in the supplemental agreement
conferred authority on the arbitrators to exceed the terms of the charter
party itself. Thus, contrary to AnimalFeeds’ argument, these state­
ments show that petitioners did not waive their argument that Bazzle
did not establish the standard for the decision maker to apply when
construing an arbitration clause.
