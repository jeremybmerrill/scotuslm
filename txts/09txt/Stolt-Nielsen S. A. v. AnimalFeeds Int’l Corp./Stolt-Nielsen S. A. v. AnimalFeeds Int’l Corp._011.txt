Opinion of the Court

II 

A

Petitioners contend that the decision of the arbitration
panel must be vacated, but in order to obtain that relief,
they must clear a high hurdle. It is not enough for peti­
tioners to show that the panel committed an error—or
even a serious error. See Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.
Mine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000); Paperworkers v.
Misco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29, 38 (1987). “It is only when [an]
arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of
the agreement and effectively ‘dispense[s] his own brand
of industrial justice’ that his decision may be unenforce­
able.” Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532
U. S. 504, 509 (2001) (per curiam) (quoting Steelworkers v.
Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593, 597 (1960)).
In that situation, an arbitration decision may be vacated
under §10(a)(4) of the FAA on the ground that the arbitra­
tor “exceeded [his] powers,” for the task of an arbitrator is
to interpret and enforce a contract, not to make public
policy. In this case, we must conclude that what the arbi­
tration panel did was simply to impose its own view of
sound policy regarding class arbitration.3

do not decide whether “ ‘manifest disregard’ ” survives our deci­
sion in Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576, 585
(2008), as an independent ground for review or as a judicial gloss on the
enumerated grounds for vacatur set forth at 9 U. S. C. §10. AnimalFeeds characterizes that standard as requiring a showing that the
arbitrators “knew of the relevant [legal] principle, appreciated that this
principle controlled the outcome of the disputed issue, and nonetheless
willfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it.” Brief for
Respondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming, ar
guendo, that such a standard applies, we find it satisfied for the rea­
sons that follow.
