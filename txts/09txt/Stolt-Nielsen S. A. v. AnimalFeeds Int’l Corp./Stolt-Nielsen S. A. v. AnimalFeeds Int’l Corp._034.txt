STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

(“[Piecemeal review] will make arbitration more like liti
gation, a result not to be desired. It would be better to
minimize the number of occasions the parties to arbitra
tion can come to court; on the whole, this benefits the
parties, the arbitration process and the courts.”).
While lower court opinions are thus divided, this much
is plain: No decision of this Court, until today, has ever
approved immediate judicial review of an arbitrator’s
decision as preliminary as the “partial award” made in
this case.7

Even if Stolt-Nielsen had a plea ripe for judicial review,
the Court should reject it on the merits. Recall that the
parties jointly asked the arbitrators to decide, initially,
whether the arbitration clause in their shipping contracts
permitted class proceedings. See supra, at 2. The panel
did just what it was commissioned to do. It construed the
broad arbitration clause (covering “[a]ny dispute arising
from the making, performance or termination of this
Charter Party,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a) and ruled,
expressly and only, that the clause permitted class arbi
tration. The Court acts without warrant in allowing StoltNielsen essentially to repudiate its submission of the
contract-construction issue to the arbitration panel, and to
gain, in place of the arbitrators’ judgment, this Court’s de
novo determination.

a court of competent jurisdiction to confirm or to vacate” the award.
