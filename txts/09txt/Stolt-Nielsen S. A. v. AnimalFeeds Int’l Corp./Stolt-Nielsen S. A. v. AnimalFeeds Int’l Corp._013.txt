Opinion of the Court

rived from the FAA or on maritime or New York law.4
Rather than inquiring whether the FAA, maritime law,
or New York law contains a “default rule” under which an
arbitration clause is construed as allowing class arbitra­
tion in the absence of express consent, the panel proceeded
as if it had the authority of a common-law court to develop
what it viewed as the best rule to be applied in such a
situation. Perceiving a post-Bazzle consensus among
arbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in “a wide
variety of settings,” the panel considered only whether
there was any good reason not to follow that consensus in
this case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel was
not persuaded by “court cases denying consolidation of
arbitrations,”5 by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy
charter party had “never been the basis of a class action,”
or by expert opinion that “sophisticated, multinational

4 The panel’s reliance on these arbitral awards confirms that the
panel’s decision was not based on a determination regarding the
parties’ intent. All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA’s
Class Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available
when the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during
the class period ranging from 1998 to 2002. See 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2
2008) (defining the class period). Indeed, at the hearing before the
panel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that “[w]hen you talk about
expectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were
the subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before [Bazzle]. So
therefore, if you are going to talk about the parties’ intentions, pre
[Bazzle] class arbitrations were not common, post [Bazzle] they are
common.” App. 87a. Moreover, in its award, the panel appeared to
acknowledge that none of the cited arbitration awards involved a
contract between sophisticated business entities. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. 50a.
5 See Government of United Kingdom v. Boeing Co., 998 F. 2d 68, 71,
74 (CA2 1993); see also Glencore, Ltd. v. Schnitzer Steel Prods. Co., 189
F. 3d 264, 268 (CA2 1999); Champ v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269,
275 (CA7 1995). Unlike the subsequent arbitration awards that the
arbitrators cited, these decisions were available to the parties when
they entered into their contracts.
