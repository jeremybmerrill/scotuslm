GINSBURG, J., dissenting

order and declaring its resolution a “partial award.” Cf.
Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S.
576, 588 (2008) (FAA §§9–11, which provide for expedited
review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards,
“substantiat[e] a national policy favoring arbitration with
just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration’s
essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway.”).
Lacking this Court’s definitive guidance, some Courts of
Appeals have reviewed arbitration awards “finally and
definitely dispos[ing] of a separate independent claim.”
E.g., Metallgesellschaft A. G. v. M/V Capitan Constante,
790 F. 2d 280, 283 (CA2 1986).5 Others have considered
“partial award[s]” that finally “determin[e] liability, but
. . . not . . . damages.” E.g., Hart Surgical, Inc. v. Ultraci
sion, Inc., 244 F. 3d 231, 234 (CA1 2001).6 Another con
firmed an interim ruling on a “separate, discrete, inde
pendent, severable issue.” Island Creek Coal Sales Co. v.
Gainesville, 729 F. 2d 1046, 1049 (CA6 1984) (internal
quotation marks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by
Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v. Bill Harbert Constr. Co., 529
U. S. 193 (2000).
Receptivity to review of preliminary rulings rendered by
arbitrators, however, is hardly universal. See Dealer
Computer Servs., Inc. v. Dub Herring Ford, 547 F. 3d 558
(CA6 2008) (arbitration panel’s preliminary ruling that
contract did not bar class proceedings held not ripe for
review; arbitrators had not yet determined that arbitra
tion should proceed on behalf of a class); Metallgesellschaft
A. G., 790 F. 2d, at 283, 285 (Feinberg, C. J., dissenting)
——————
5 See Metallgesellschaft A. G., 790 F. 2d, at 283, 284 (Feinberg, C. J.,
dissenting) (describing exception for separate and independent claims
as “creat[ing], in effect, an arbitration analogue to [Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.]
54(b)”).
6 But see Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737 (1976) (district
court order determining liability but reserving decision on damages
held not immediately appealable).
