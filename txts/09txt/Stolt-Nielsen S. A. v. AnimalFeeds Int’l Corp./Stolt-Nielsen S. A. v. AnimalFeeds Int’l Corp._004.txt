STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
Syllabus
tration agreements as they see fit,” Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman
Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 57. They may agree to limit the issues ar
bitrated and may agree on rules under which an arbitration will pro
ceed. They may also specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their
disputes. See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 289.
Pp. 17–20.
(2) It follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to
submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for con
cluding that the party agreed to do so. Here, the arbitration panel
imposed class arbitration despite the parties’ stipulation that they
had reached “no agreement” on that issue. The panel’s conclusion is
fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbi
tration is a matter of consent. It may be appropriate to presume that
parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitra
tor to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties’
agreement. See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79,
84. But an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is
not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an
agreement to arbitrate. The differences between simple bilateral and
complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.
