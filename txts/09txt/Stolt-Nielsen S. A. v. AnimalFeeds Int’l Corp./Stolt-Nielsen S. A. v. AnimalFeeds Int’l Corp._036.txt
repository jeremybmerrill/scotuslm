STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

B
The Court’s characterization of the arbitration panel’s
decision as resting on “policy,” not law, is hardly fair
comment, for “policy” is not so much as mentioned in the
arbitrators’ award. Instead, the panel tied its conclusion
that the arbitration clause permitted class arbitration,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a, to New York law, federal mari
time law, and decisions made by other panels pursuant to
Rule 3 of the American Arbitration Association’s Supple
mentary Rules for Class Arbitrations. Id., at 49a–50a.
At the outset of its explanation, the panel rejected the
argument, proffered by AnimalFeeds, that this Court’s
decision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U. S.
444 (2003), settled the matter by “requir[ing] clear lan
guage that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class
action.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added).
Agreeing with Stolt-Nielsen in this regard, the panel said
that the test it employed looked to the language of the
particular agreement to gauge whether the parties “in
tended to permit or to preclude class action[s].” Ibid.
Concentrating on the wording of the arbitration clause,
the panel observed, is “consistent with New York law as
articulated by the [New York] Court of Appeals . . . and
with federal maritime law.” Ibid.9
Emphasizing the breadth of the clause in question—
“ ‘any dispute arising from the making, performance or
termination of this Charter Party’ shall be put to arbitra
tion,” id., at 50a—the panel noted that numerous other
partial awards had relied on language similarly compre
hensive to permit class proceedings “in a wide variety of
settings.” Id., at 49a–50a. The panel further noted “that
many of the other panels [had] rejected arguments similar
to those advanced by [Stolt-Nielsen].” Id., at 50a.

9 On New York law, the panel referred to Evans v. Famous Music
Corp., 1 N. Y. 3d 452, 807 N. E. 2d 869 (2004).
