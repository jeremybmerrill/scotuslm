STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.
Opinion of the Court

FAA provides, in pertinent part, that a “written provision
in any maritime transaction” calling for the arbitration of
a controversy arising out of such transaction “shall be
valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such
grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of
any contract,” 9 U. S. C. §2. Under the FAA, a party to an
arbitration agreement may petition a United States dis­
trict court for an order directing that “arbitration proceed
in the manner provided for in such agreement.” §4. Con­
sistent with these provisions, we have said on numerous
occasions that the central or “primary” purpose of the FAA
is to ensure that “private agreements to arbitrate are
enforced according to their terms.” Volt, supra, at 479;
Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S.
52, 57, 58 (1995); see also Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v.
Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 688 (1996). See generally 9
U. S. C. §4.
Whether enforcing an agreement to arbitrate or constru­
ing an arbitration clause, courts and arbitrators must
“give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of
the parties.” Volt, supra, at 479. In this endeavor, “as
with any other contract, the parties’ intentions control.”
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,
473 U. S. 614, 626 (1985). This is because an arbitrator
derives his or her powers from the parties’ agreement to
forgo the legal process and submit their disputes to pri­
vate dispute resolution. See AT&T Technologies, Inc. v.
Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 648–649 (1986)
(“[A]rbitrators derive their authority to resolve disputes
only because the parties have agreed in advance to submit
such grievances to arbitration”); Mitsubishi Motors, supra,
at 628 (“By agreeing to arbitrate . . . , [a party] trades the
procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for
the simplicity, informality, and expedition of arbitration”);
——————
codification).
