Per Curiam

DNA and non-DNA evidence in the record adduced at trial
supported the jury’s guilty verdict under Jackson, and we
reject respondent’s last minute attempt to recast his claim
under Brathwaite. The Court of Appeals did not consider,
however, the ineffective-assistance claims on which the
District Court also granted respondent habeas relief.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re
versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
