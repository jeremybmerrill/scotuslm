MCDANIEL v. BROWN
Per Curiam

since his trial, respondent has steadfastly maintained his
innocence.1 He was, however, admittedly intoxicated
when the crime occurred, and after he awoke on the fol

Lounge. Troy knew that Jane and her 4-year-old sister
were home alone because he answered the phone at
the bar when Jane called for her mother earlier that

Troy consumed at least 10 shots of vodka followed by
beer chasers, and was so drunk that he vomited on himself

rape at approximately 1 a.m. Although it would have
taken a sober man less than 15 minutes to walk home,
Troy did not arrive at his trailer until about 1:30 a.m. He
was wearing dark jeans, a cowboy hat, a black satin
jacket, and boots. Two witnesses saw a man dressed in
dark jeans, a cowboy hat, and a black satin jacket stum

denied involvement when a police officer claimed (wrongly) that
