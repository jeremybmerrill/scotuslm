1 a.m.
The bedroom where the rape occurred was dark, and
Jane was unable to conclusively identify her assailant.
When asked whom he reminded her of, she mentioned
both Troy and his brother Trent. Several days after the
rape, she identified a man she saw on television (Troy) as
her assailant but then stated that the man who had sent
flowers attacked her. It was Trent and Raquel who had
sent her flowers, not Troy. She was unable to identify
Troy as her assailant out of a photo lineup, and she could

had bitten her assailant, but Troy did not have any bite
marks on his hands when examined by a police officer
approximately four hours after the attack. Jane stated
that her assailant’s jacket had a zipper (Troy’s did not)
and that he wore a watch (Troy claimed he did not). Addi

left the Peacock and when Pam received Jane’s call report
ing the rape. The witnesses who saw a man stumbling
between the two trailers reported a bright green logo on
the back of the jacket, but Troy’s jacket had a yellow and
orange logo. Finally, because Jane thought she had left a
night light on when she went to bed, the police suspected
the assailant had turned off the light. The only usable
fingerprint taken from the light did not match Troy’s and
the police did not find Troy’s fingerprints in the trailer.
Other physical evidence, however, pointed to Troy. The
police recovered semen from Jane’s underwear and from
