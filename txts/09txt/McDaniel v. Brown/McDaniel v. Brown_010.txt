MCDANIEL v. BROWN
Per Curiam

Mueller finds more appropriate, the probability of a single
sibling matching respondent is 1 in 263, the probability
that among two brothers one or more would match is 1 in
132, and among four brothers it is 1 in 66. Id., at 1583.
In sum, the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns
are testimony equating random match probability with
source probability, and an underestimate of the likelihood
that one of Troy’s brothers would also match the DNA left
at the scene.

Although we granted certiorari to review respondent’s
Jackson claim, the parties now agree that the Court of
Appeals’ resolution of his claim under Jackson was in
error. See Brief for Respondent 2–3; Reply Brief for Peti
tioners 1. Indeed, respondent argues the Court of Appeals
did not decide his case under Jackson at all, but instead
resolved the question whether admission of Romero’s
inaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally
unfair and then applied Jackson to determine whether
that error was harmless.
Although both petitioners and respondent are now
aligned on the same side of the questions presented for our
review, the case is not moot because “the parties continue
to seek different relief” from this Court. Pacific Bell Tele
phone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___,
___ (2009) (slip op., at 6). Respondent primarily argues
that we affirm on his proposed alternative ground or
remand to the Ninth Circuit for analysis of his due process
claim under the standard for harmless error of Brecht v.
Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993). The State, on the
other hand, asks us to reverse. Respondent and one
amicus have also suggested that we dismiss the case as
improvidently granted, Brief for National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 27–28, but
we think prudential concerns favor our review of the Court
