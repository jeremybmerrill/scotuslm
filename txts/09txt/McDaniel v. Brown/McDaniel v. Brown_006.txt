MCDANIEL v. BROWN
Per Curiam

if trial counsel had objected, the evidence would have been
excluded or at least its importance diminished. He noted
that because trial counsel “totally failed to challenge the
DNA evidence in the case,” counsel “failed to preserve
valid issues for appeal.” App. 1101. The state postconvic
tion court denied relief, id., at 1489–1499, and the Nevada
Supreme Court affirmed, id., at 1500–1506.
Respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition,
claiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on
the sexual assault charges and that the Nevada Supreme
Court’s rejection of his claim was both contrary to, and an
unreasonable application of, Jackson. He did not bring a
typical Jackson claim, however. Rather than argue that
the totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial
was constitutionally insufficient, he argued that some of
the evidence should be excluded from the Jackson analy
sis. In particular, he argued that Romero’s testimony
related to the DNA evidence was inaccurate and unreli
able in two primary respects: Romero mischaracterized
the random match probability and misstated the probabil
ity of a DNA match among his brothers. Absent that
testimony, he contended, there was insufficient evidence
to convict him.
In support of his claim regarding the accuracy of Ro
mero’s testimony, respondent submitted a report prepared
by Laurence Mueller, a professor in ecology and evolution
ary biology (Mueller Report). The District Court supple
mented the record with the Mueller Report, even though it
was not presented to any state court, because “the thesis
of the report was argued during post-conviction.” Brown

6181129, *5, n. 2 (Nev., Dec. 14, 2006).
Relying upon the Mueller Report, the District Court set
aside the “unreliable DNA testimony” and held that with
out the DNA evidence “a reasonable doubt would exist in
the mind of any rational trier of fact.” Id., at *7. The
