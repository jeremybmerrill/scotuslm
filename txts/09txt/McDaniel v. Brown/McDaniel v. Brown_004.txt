MCDANIEL v. BROWN
Per Curiam

the rape kit. The State’s expert, Renee Romero, tested the
former and determined that the DNA matched Troy’s and
that the probability another person from the general
population would share the same DNA (the “random
match probability”) was only 1 in 3,000,000. Troy’s coun
sel did not call his own DNA expert at trial, although he
consulted with an expert in advance who found no prob
lems with Romero’s test procedures. At some time before
sentencing, Troy’s family had additional DNA testing
done. That testing showed semen taken from the rape kit
matched Troy’s DNA, with a random match probability of
1 in 10,000.
The jury found Troy guilty of sexual assault and sen
tenced him to life with the possibility of parole after 10
years.2 On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court
considered Troy’s claim that his conviction was not sup
ported by sufficient evidence, analyzing “whether the jury,
acting reasonably, could have been convinced of [Troy’s]
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Brown v. Nevada, 113
Nev. 275, 285, 934 P. 2d 235, 241 (1997) (per curiam). The
court rejected the claim, summarizing the evidence of guilt
as follows:

2 Under

Nevada law at the time of the trial, the jury, rather than the
judge, imposed the sentence for a sexual assault crime if it found the
assault resulted in substantial bodily harm. Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§200.366(3) (Michie 1992). For an assault resulting in substantial
bodily harm, the jury had the option of sentencing Troy to life without
the possibility of parole or to life with eligibility for parole after 10
years. §200.366(2)(a). The jury elected the more lenient sentence. The
judge sentenced Troy to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years
on a second count of sexual assault, to run consecutively. The Nevada
Supreme Court reversed Troy’s conviction for one count of child abuse
on double jeopardy grounds, and ordered resentencing on the second
sexual assault count. Brown v. Nevada, 113 Nev. 275, 934 P. 2d 235
(1997) (per curiam). On resentencing, the judge imposed the same
sentence as before.
