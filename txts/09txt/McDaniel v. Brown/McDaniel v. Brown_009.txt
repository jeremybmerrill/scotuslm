Per Curiam

argued at closing the jury could be “99.999967 percent
sure” in this case. App. 730. And when the prosecutor
asked Romero, in a classic example of erroneously equat
ing source probability with random match probability,
whether “it [would] be fair to say . . . that the chances that
the DNA found in the panties—the semen in the panties—
and the blood sample, the likelihood that it is not Troy
Brown would be .000033,” id., at 460, Romero ultimately
agreed that it was “not inaccurate” to state it that way,
id., at 461–462.
Looking at Romero’s testimony as a whole, though, she
also indicated that she was merely accepting the mathe
matical equivalence between 1 in 3,000,000 and the per
centage figure. At the end of the colloquy about percent
ages, she answered affirmatively the court’s question
whether the percentage was “the same math just ex
pressed differently.” Id., at 462. She pointed out that the
probability a brother would match was greater than the
random match probability, which also indicated to the jury
that the random match probability is not the same as the
likelihood that someone other than Troy was the source of
the DNA.
The Mueller Report identifies a second error in Romero’s
testimony: her estimate of the probability that one or more
of Troy’s brothers’ DNA would match. Romero testified
there was a 1 in 6,500 (or .02%) probability that one
brother would share the same DNA with another. Id., at
469, 472. When asked whether “that change[s] at all with
two brothers,” she answered no. Id., at 472. According to
Mueller, Romero’s analysis was misleading in two re
spects. First, she used an assumption regarding the par
ents under which siblings have the lowest chance of
matching that is biologically possible, but even under this
stingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers
matching (1 in 6,500) as much lower than it is (1 in 1,024
under her assumption). Second, using the assumptions
