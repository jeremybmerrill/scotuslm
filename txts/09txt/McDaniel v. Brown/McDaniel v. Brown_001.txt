E. K. MCDANIEL, WARDEN, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

TROY BROWN 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 11, 2010]


PER CURIAM.
In Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), we held
that a state prisoner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if a
federal judge finds that “upon the record evidence adduced
at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof
of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at 324. A Nevada
jury convicted respondent of rape; the evidence presented
included DNA evidence matching respondent’s DNA pro
file. Nevertheless, relying upon a report prepared by a
DNA expert over 11 years after the trial, the Federal
District Court applied the Jackson standard and granted
the writ. A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. Brown v.
Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787 (CA9 2008). We granted certiorari
to consider whether those courts misapplied Jackson.
Because the trial record includes both the DNA evidence
and other convincing evidence of guilt, we conclude that
they clearly did.
