Per Curiam

12:15 a.m., that Troy lived relatively close to the bar,
and that Troy lived very close to Jane Doe. Troy had
enough time to get from the bar to Jane Doe’s house
and to assault Jane Doe before she made the tele
phone call to her mother at approximately 1:00 a.m.
While Jane Doe could not identify her assailant, her
description of his clothing was similar to what Troy
was wearing; she also said that her assailant smelled
like beer or vomit and testimony indicated that Troy
had been drinking beer and had vomited several times
that night. Furthermore, testimony indicated that
Troy got home at approximately 1:30 a.m., which gave
him enough time to assault Jane Doe. Additionally,

in the road near Jane Doe’s house at 1:05 a.m. Troy
also washed his pants and shirt when he got home,

Respondent also argued on appeal that the trial court
erred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine
whether the DNA evidence was reliable. The court found
respondent had not raised this issue in the trial court and
concluded there was no plain error in the trial court’s
failure to conduct a hearing. Id., at 284, 934 P. 2d, at 241.
In 2001, respondent sought state postconviction relief,
claiming, inter alia, that his trial counsel was constitu

the DNA evidence. He argued that there were a number
of foundational problems with the DNA evidence, and that
