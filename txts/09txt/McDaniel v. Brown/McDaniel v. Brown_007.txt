Per Curiam

court granted respondent habeas relief on his Jackson
claim.3
The Ninth Circuit affirmed. 525 F. 3d 787. The court
held the Nevada Supreme Court had unreasonably applied
Jackson. 525 F. 3d, at 798; see 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).
The Court of Appeals first reasoned “the admission of
Romero’s unreliable and misleading testimony violated
Troy’s due process rights,” so the District Court was cor
rect to exclude it. 525 F. 3d, at 797. It then “weighed the
sufficiency of the remaining evidence,” including the Dis
trict Court’s “catalogu[e] [of] the numerous inconsistencies
that would raise a reasonable doubt as to Troy’s guilt in
the mind of any rational juror.” Ibid. In light of the
“stark” conflicts in the evidence and the State’s concession
that there was insufficient evidence absent the DNA
evidence, the court held it was objectively unreasonable
for the Nevada Supreme Court to reject respondent’s
insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. Id., at 798.
We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to consider
two questions: the proper standard of review for a Jackson
claim on federal habeas, and whether such a claim may
rely upon evidence outside the trial record that goes to the
reliability of trial evidence.

Mueller Report. The Mueller Report does not challenge

that he was denied effective assistance of counsel with respect to his
attorney’s handling of the DNA evidence and failure to adequately
investigate the victim’s stepfather as an alternative suspect. Brown v.
Farwell, No. 3:03–cv–00712–PMP–VPC, 2006 WL 6181129, *9–*10
(Nev., Dec. 14, 2006). The Court of Appeals did not consider those
claims on appeal and they are not now before us.
