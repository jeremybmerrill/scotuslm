MCDANIEL v. BROWN
Per Curiam

Romero’s qualifications as an expert or the validity of any
of the tests that she performed. Mueller instead contends
that Romero committed the so-called “prosecutor’s fallacy”
and that she underestimated the probability of a DNA
match between respondent and one of his brothers.
The prosecutor’s fallacy is the assumption that the
random match probability is the same as the probability
that the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample.
See Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic
Science, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence 133
(1996) (“Let P equal the probability of a match, given the
evidence genotype. The fallacy is to say that P is also the
probability that the DNA at the crime scene came from
someone other than the defendant”). In other words, if a
juror is told the probability a member of the general popu
lation would share the same DNA is 1 in 10,000 (random
match probability), and he takes that to mean there is
only a 1 in 10,000 chance that someone other than the
defendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime
scene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the
prosecutor’s fallacy. It is further error to equate source
probability with probability of guilt, unless there is no
explanation other than guilt for a person to be the source
of crime-scene DNA. This faulty reasoning may result in
an erroneous statement that, based on a random match
probability of 1 in 10,000, there is a .01% chance the de
fendant is innocent or a 99.99% chance the defendant is
guilty.
The Mueller Report does not dispute Romero’s opinion
that only 1 in 3,000,000 people would have the same DNA
profile as the rapist. Mueller correctly points out, how
ever, that some of Romero’s testimony—as well as the
prosecutor’s argument—suggested that the evidence also
established that there was only a .000033% chance that
respondent was innocent. The State concedes as much.
