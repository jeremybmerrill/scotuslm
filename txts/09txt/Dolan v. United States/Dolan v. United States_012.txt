Opinion of the Court

restitution in order to remedy a missed hearing deadline.
As in Montalvo-Murillo, doing so would defeat the basic
purpose of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. And,
here, as in Montalvo-Murillo, that remedy does not “pro
portion[ately]” repair the harm caused the defendant
through delay, particularly where, as here, the defendant
“knew about restitution,” including the likely amount, well
before expiration of the 90-day time limit. App. 62. In
deed, our result here follows from Montalvo-Murillo a
fortiori, for here delay at worst postpones the day of finan
cial reckoning. In Montalvo-Murillo, delay postponed a
constitutionally guaranteed bail hearing with the attached
risk that the defendant would remain improperly confined
in jail. See 495 U. S., at 728 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)
(noting the seriousness “of the deprivation of liberty that
physical detention imposes”).
Nor does Montalvo-Murillo stand alone. The Court
there found support in similar cases involving executive
officials charged with carrying out mandatory public
duties in a timely manner. See id., at 718 (citing French v.
Edwards, 13 Wall. 506, 511 (1872); Brock, supra, at 260).
Those cases, in turn, are consistent with numerous similar
decisions made by courts throughout the Nation. See, e.g.,
Taylor v. Department of Transp., 260 N. W. 2d 521, 522–
523 (Iowa 1977); Hutchinson v. Ryan, 154 Kan. 751, 756–
757, 121 P. 2d 179, 182 (1942); State v. Industrial
Comm’n, 233 Wis. 461, 466, 289 N. W. 769, 771 (1940); see
also 3 Singer, Statutory Construction §57:19, at 74 (citing
cases).
Sixth, the defendant normally can mitigate any harm
that a missed deadline might cause—at least if, as here,
he obtains the relevant information regarding the restitu
tion amount before the 90-day deadline expires. A defen
dant who fears the deadline will be (or just has been)
missed can simply tell the court, which will then likely set
a timely hearing or take other statutorily required action.
