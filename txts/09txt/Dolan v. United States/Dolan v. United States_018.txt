Opinion of the Court

restitution to a victim whose “losses are not ascertainable”
within 90 days. Compare §3664(d)(5) (first sentence) with
§3664(d)(5) (second sentence). How is that a sensible
reading of a statute that makes restitution mandatory for
victims?
Finally, petitioner asks us to apply the “rule of lenity” in
favor of his reading of the statute. Dolan has not provided
us with an example of an instance in which the “rule of
lenity” has been applied to a statutory time provision in
the criminal context. See United States v. Wiltberger, 5
Wheat. 76 (1820) (applying rule in interpreting substan
tive criminal statute); Bifulco v. United States, 447 U. S.
381, 387, 400 (1980) (applying rule in interpreting “penal
ties”). But, assuming for argument’s sake that the rule
might be so applied, and after considering the statute’s
text, structure, and purpose, we nonetheless cannot find a
statutory ambiguity sufficiently “grievous” to warrant its
application in this case. Muscarello v. United States, 524
U. S. 125, 139 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).
See Caron v. United States, 524 U. S. 308, 316 (1998)
(rejecting application of rule where the “ambiguous” read
ing “is an implausible reading of the congressional
purpose”).
For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the Tenth Circuit is
Affirmed.
