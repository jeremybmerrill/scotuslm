DOLAN v. UNITED STATES
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

against a background rule that trial courts cannot change
sentences at will.
The same is true of §3552(b), which empowers a court
that does not wish to delay sentencing but “desires more
information than is otherwise available to it” to impose a
provisional sentence during a 120-day study period. That
statute would be largely unnecessary if a trial court could
do the same by order.
In Addonizio, 442 U. S., at 189, we thought it noncon
troversial that a sentence once imposed is final, subject to
such exceptions as Congress has allowed. Contrary to the
Court’s suggestion, ante, at 13, Dolan invoked that princi
ple both here and below. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 13,
15–18, 20, 29, 33, and n. 14, 36, 48, and n. 19; Reply Brief
for Petitioner 1, 5–8; Appellant’s Opening Brief in No. 08–
2104 (CA10), pp. 12–13 (citing United States v. Blackwell,
81 F. 3d 945, 949 (CA10 1996), for the proposition that a
“district court does not have inherent authority to modify
a sentence”). That the Court finds it necessary to question
that principle—indeed, to accuse this dissent of “creat[ing]
th[e] rule,” ante, at 13—highlights how misguided its
decision is.
To counter the effects of its opinion and to restore some
semblance of finality to sentencing, the Court advises
defendants to seek mandamus—a remedy we have de
scribed as “drastic and extraordinary,” “reserved for really
extraordinary causes,” and one of “the most potent weap
ons in the judicial arsenal.” Cheney v. United States Dist.
Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004) (internal quota
tion marks omitted). What an odd procedure the Court
contemplates! A defendant, who should have received a
harsher sentence, is to invoke the drastic and extraordi
nary remedy of mandamus, to make sure he gets it. That
is not how sentencing errors are corrected: If the trial
court fails to order the appropriate sentence, the Govern
ment must appeal to correct it. It did not do so here, and
