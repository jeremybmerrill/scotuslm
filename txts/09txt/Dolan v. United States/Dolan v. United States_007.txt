DOLAN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

did not show legislative intent to “delineat[e] the classes of
cases” and “persons” properly “within a court’s adjudica
tory authority”); see also Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,
559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5–6) (discussing use
of term “jurisdictional”). The expiration of a “jurisdic
tional” deadline prevents the court from permitting or
taking the action to which the statute attached the dead
line. The prohibition is absolute. The parties cannot
waive it, nor can a court extend that deadline for equitable
reasons. See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,
552 U. S. 130, 133–134 (2008).
In other instances, we have found that certain deadlines
are more ordinary “claims-processing rules,” rules that do
not limit a court’s jurisdiction, but rather regulate the
timing of motions or claims brought before the court.
Unless a party points out to the court that another litigant
has missed such a deadline, the party forfeits the dead
line’s protection. See, e.g., Kontrick v. Ryan, supra, at
454–456 (60-day bankruptcy rule deadline for creditor’s
objection to debtor discharge); Eberhart v. United States,
546 U. S. 12, 19 (2005) (per curiam) (7-day criminal rule
deadline for filing motion for a new trial).
In still other instances, we have found that a deadline
seeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is
legally enforceable but does not deprive a judge or other
public official of the power to take the action to which the
deadline applies if the deadline is missed. See, e.g.,
United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, 722
(1990) (missed deadline for holding bail detention hearing
does not require judge to release defendant); Brock v.
Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253, 266 (1986) (missed deadline
for making final determination as to misuse of federal
grant funds does not prevent later recovery of funds);
Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 171–172
(2003) (missed deadline for assigning industry retiree
benefits does not prevent later award of benefits).
