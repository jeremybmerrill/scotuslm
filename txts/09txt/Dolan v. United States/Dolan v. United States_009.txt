DOLAN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

an older provision that left restitution to the sentencing
judge’s discretion, the statute before us (entitled “The
Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996”) says
“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, when sen
tencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense . . . ,
the court shall order . . . that the defendant make restitu
tion to the victim of the offense.” §3663A(a)(1) (emphasis
added); cf. §3663(a)(1) (stating that a court “may” order
restitution when sentencing defendants convicted of other
specified crimes). The Act goes on to provide that restitu
tion shall be ordered in the “full amount of each victim’s
losses” and “without consideration of the economic circum
stances of the defendant.” §3664(f)(1)(A).
Third, the Act’s procedural provisions reinforce this
substantive purpose, namely, that the statute seeks pri
marily to assure that victims of a crime receive full resti
tution. To be sure speed is important. The statute re
quires a sentencing judge to order the probation office to
prepare a report providing “a complete accounting of the
losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a
plea agreement, and information relating to the economic
circumstances of each defendant.” §3664(a). The prosecu
tor, after consulting with all identified victims, must
“promptly provide” a listing of the amount subject to resti
tution “not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set
for sentencing.” §3664(d)(1) (emphasis added). And the
provision before us says:
“If the victim’s losses are not ascertainable by the date
that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for
the Government or the probation officer shall so in
form the court, and the court shall set a date for the
final determination of the victim’s losses, not to ex
ceed 90 days after sentencing.” §3664(d)(5).
But the statute seeks speed primarily to help the victims
of crime and only secondarily to help the defendant. Thus,
