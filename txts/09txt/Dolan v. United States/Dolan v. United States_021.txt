ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

supra, at 189, and that Rule 45(b)(2) creates “inflexible”
“claim-processing rules,” Eberhart v. United States, 546
U. S. 12, 19 (2005) (per curiam).
Thus, if the trial court fails to impose a mandatory term
of imprisonment, see, e.g., §924(c)(1)(A), or a mandatory
fine, see, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §844(a), or a mandatory order of
restitution, see 18 U. S. C. §3663A, the Government can
not simply ask it to impose the correct sentence later. If
the error is clear, and raised within 14 days, it might be
corrected under Rule 35. Otherwise, the Government
must appeal, and seek resentencing on remand.
§§3742(b)(1), (g).
Section 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to these bed
rock rules. It permits a trial court to go forward with
sentencing while delaying any restitution order for up to
90 days. This provision is meaningful precisely because
restitution must otherwise be ordered at sentencing, and
because sentences are otherwise final unless properly
corrected. If trial courts had power to amend their sen
tences at any time, §3664(d)(5) would be unnecessary.
Here, however, the District Court failed to make use of
its limited authority under §3664(d)(5). Dolan was sen
tenced on July 30, 2007. The court declined to order resti
tution at that time or to set a date for a future restitution
order. App. 35, 39–40; see also id., at 49.1 The 90-day
period elapsed on October 28. At no time did the Govern
ment seek timely relief, whether under Rule 35 or by
appeal. Cf. Corey, supra, at 174; Berman v. United States,
302 U. S. 211, 212 (1937). Nor did it assert any claim that
the deadline had been lawfully extended or equitably
tolled, an issue that I agree is not before us, see ante, at 3,
11. But on April 24, 2008—269 days after sentencing, and
——————
1 Whether that date must itself be set at sentencing is not before us.
The order setting the date plainly cannot be entered 182 days after
sentencing, as happened here. See App. 3–4.
