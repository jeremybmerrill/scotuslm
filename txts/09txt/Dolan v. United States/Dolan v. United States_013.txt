DOLAN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

See §3664(d)(4) (providing that “court may require addi
tional documentation or hear testimony”); §3664(d)(5).
Though a deliberate failure of the sentencing court to
comply with the statute seems improbable, should that
occur, the defendant can also seek mandamus. See All
Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. §1651(a); La Buy v. Howes Leather
Co., 352 U. S. 249 (1957). Cf. Brock, 476 U. S., at 260, n. 7
(noting availability of district court action to compel
agency compliance with time-related directive).
C
Petitioner Dolan, however, believes we have under
stated the harm to a defendant that a missed deadline can
cause. To show this he makes a three-part argument: (1)
A defendant cannot appeal a sentence unless it is part of a
“final judgment”; (2) a judgment setting forth a sentence is
not “final” until it contains a definitive determination of
the amount of restitution; and (3) to delay the determina
tion of the amount of restitution beyond the 90-day dead
line is to delay the defendant’s ability to appeal for more
than 90 days—perhaps to the point where his due process
rights are threatened. Brief for Petitioner 28–33.
The critical problem with this argument lies in its third
step. As we have said, a defendant who, like petitioner
here, knows that restitution will be ordered and is aware
of the restitution amount prior to the expiration of the 90
day deadline can usually avoid additional delay simply by
pointing to the statute and asking the court to grant a
timely hearing. That did not happen here. And that
minimal burden on the defendant is a small cost relative
to the prospect of depriving innocent crime victims of their
due restitution. (Should the court still refuse, the defen
dant could seek mandamus—which we believe will rarely
be necessary.)
Even in the unlikely instances where that delay does
cause the defendant prejudice—perhaps by depriving him
