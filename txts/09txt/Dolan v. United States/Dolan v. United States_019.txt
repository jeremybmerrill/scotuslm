BRIAN RUSSELL DOLAN, PETITIONER v.

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

[June 14, 2010] 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS,
JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE KENNEDY join, dissenting.
The statute at issue in this case provides that “[i]f the
victim’s losses are not ascertainable [at least] 10 days

it said “the court shall set a date for the final determina

under §3556. See §§3551(b)–(c). Section 3556, in turn,

other provisions requiring such orders to be made “when

(1) (emphasis added). The mandatory restitution provi
sions of §3663A “apply in all sentencing proceedings for
