Opinion of the Court

After examining the language, the context, and the
purposes of the statute, we conclude that the provision
before us sets forth this third kind of limitation. The
fact that a sentencing court misses the statute’s 90-day
deadline, even through its own fault or that of the Gov
ernment, does not deprive the court of the power to order
restitution.
B
Several considerations lead us to this conclusion. First,
where, as here, a statute “does not specify a consequence
for noncompliance with” its “timing provisions,” “federal
courts will not in the ordinary course impose their own
coercive sanction.” United States v. James Daniel Good
Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 63 (1993); see also MontalvoMurillo, supra, at 717–721. Cf., e.g., Speedy Trial Act, 18
U. S. C. §3161(c)(1); §3162(a)(2) (statute specifying that
missed 70-day deadline requires dismissal of indictment);
Zedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 507–509 (2006)
(“The sanction for a violation of the Act is dismissal”).
We concede that the statute here uses the word “shall,”
§3664(d)(5), but a statute’s use of that word alone has not
always led this Court to interpret statutes to bar judges
(or other officials) from taking the action to which a
missed statutory deadline refers. See, e.g., MontalvoMurillo, supra, at 718–719 (use of word “shall” in context
of bail hearing makes duty “mandatory” but does not
mean that the “sanction for breach” is “loss of all later
powers to act”); Brock, supra, at 262 (same in context of
misuse of federal funds); Barnhart, supra, at 158–163
(same in context of benefits assignments). See also Re
gions Hospital v. Shalala, 522 U. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998)
(same in respect to federal official’s reporting date).
Second, the statute’s text places primary weight upon,
and emphasizes the importance of, imposing restitution
upon those convicted of certain federal crimes. Amending
