ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

that ends the case. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S.
___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6).
Moreover, the Court’s mandamus remedy only helps
defendants who know they are in danger of an increased
sentence. So the Court imposes another rule, namely that
the trial court must explicitly “leave open” the precise
sentence at the time of sentencing, ante, at 12, or must
make clear, “prior to the deadline’s expiration[,] that it
would order restitution” at some indeterminate time, ante,
at 1 (emphasis added). But what if the court does not
make the crucial announcement at sentencing, or “prior to
the deadline’s expiration”? Are these judicially created
deadlines to be taken more seriously than those imposed
by Congress? Or are we just back at the beginning, asking
what the “remedy” should be for failing to meet the rele
vant deadline?
The Court’s suggestion to require notice of intent to
augment the sentence at some future date may be a good
idea. But an even better one might be to set a particular
date—say, 90 days after sentencing—on which the parties
could base their expectations. That was Congress’s choice,
and it should be good enough for us.

The District Court in this case failed to order mandatory
restitution in sentencing Dolan. That was wrong. But two
wrongs do not make a right, and that mistake gave the
court no authority to amend Dolan’s sentence later, be
yond the 90 days allowed to add a sentencing term requir
ing restitution.
I am mindful of the fact that when a trial court blun
ders, the victims may suffer. Consequences like that are
the unavoidable result of having a system of rules. If no
one appeals a mistaken ruling on the amount of restitu
tion (or whether restitution applies at all), finality will
necessarily obstruct the victims’ full recovery.
