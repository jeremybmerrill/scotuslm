ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting


B

In the end, the Court does not appear to need
§3664(d)(5) at all. It instead suggests that we abandon
the bedrock rules that sentences once imposed are final,
and that the only exceptions are ones Congress chooses to
allow (and Congress has allowed various ones). The Court
instead proposes a judicial power to alter sentences, ap
parently at any time. But if a trial court can “leave open,
say, the amount of a fine,” ante, at 12, why not, say, the
number of years? Thus, after a defendant like Dolan has
served his entire sentence—and who knows how long
after?—a court might still order additional imprisonment,
additional restitution, an additional fine, or an additional
condition of supervised release. See ante, at 12–13.
The Court cites no authority in support of such “fill in
th[e] blank” sentencing, other than two cases implicated in
the Circuit split below. Ante, at 13. Prior to the enact
ment of §3664(d)(5), however, it was widely recognized
that the requirement to impose restitution “when sentenc
ing” meant that “[r]estitution must be determined at the
time of sentencing,” and could not be left open after sen
tencing had concluded. Federal Judicial Center, J. Wood,
Guideline Sentencing: An Outline of Appellate Case Law
on Selected Issues, p. 300 (Sept. 2002) (emphasis added;
citing United States v. Porter, 41 F. 3d 68, 71 (CA2 1994);
United States v. Ramilo, 986 F. 2d 333, 335–336 (CA9
1993); United States v. Prendergast, 979 F. 2d 1289, 1293
(CA8 1992); United States v. Sasnett, 925 F. 2d 392, 398–
399 (CA11 1991)).
The Court finds Rule 35(a) inapplicable because the
District Court was not “ ‘correct[ing]’ ” a clear error in the
sentence. Ante, at 14. True enough; but that is why the
Government should lose. The limitation of Rule 35(a) to
clear errors, corrected within 14 days of sentencing, does
not leave trial courts free to make other changes to sen
tences whenever they choose. Rule 35(a) only makes sense
