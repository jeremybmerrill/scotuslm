DOLAN v. UNITED STATES
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

after Dolan had already been released from prison—the
District Court nonetheless ordered $104,649.78 in restitu
tion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a, 47a.
I cannot see where that court obtained authority to add
additional terms to Dolan’s sentence. That is the step the
Court misses when it searches for the “remedy” for a
violation of §3664(d)(5). Ante, at 1. The rule is that a trial
court cannot alter a sentence after the time of sentencing.
Section 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to that rule. If
the limits are exceeded the exception does not apply, and
the general rule takes over—the sentence cannot be
changed to add a restitution provision. Section 3664(d)(5)
is self-executing: It grants authority subject to a deadline,
and if the deadline is not met, the authority is no longer
available.
The Court appears to reason that §3664(d)(5) confers the
authority to add a restitution provision for at least 90
days, and that once the camel’s nose of some permitted
delay sneaks under the tent, any further delay is permis
sible. Ante, at 3, 5. But that is not what §3664(d)(5) says.
It provides 90 days for a final determination of the victims’
losses, not a free pass to impose restitution whenever the
trial court gets around to it. The court had no more power
to order restitution 269 days after sentencing than it did
to order an additional term of imprisonment and send
Dolan back to prison.

To avoid this conclusion, the Court runs through a
series of irrelevancies that cannot trump the clear statu
tory text. It notes, for example, that §3663A provides that
“ ‘[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, when
sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense
. . . , the court shall order . . . that the defendant make
restitution to the victim of the offense.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quot
