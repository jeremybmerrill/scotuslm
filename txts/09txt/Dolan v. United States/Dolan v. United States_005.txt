DOLAN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

recommend a restitution amount. Id., at 27.
On July 30, the District Court held Dolan’s sentencing
hearing. The judge sentenced Dolan to 21 months’ impris
onment along with 3 years of supervised release. Id., at
38. The judge, aware that restitution was “mandatory,”
said that there was “insufficient information on the record
at this time regarding possible restitution payments that
may be owed,” that he would “leave that matter open,
pending the receipt of additional information,” and that
Dolan could “anticipate that such an award will be made
in the future.” Id., at 39–40. A few days later (August 8)
the court entered a judgment, which, among other things,
stated:
“Pursuant to the Mandatory Restitution Act, restitu
tion is applicable; however, no information has been
received regarding possible restitution payments that
may be owed. Therefore, the Court will not order res
titution at this time.” Id., at 49 (boldface deleted).
The probation office later prepared an addendum to the
presentence report, dated October 5, which reflected the
views of the parties, and which the judge later indicated
he had received. Id., at 54. The addendum documents the
“total amount of restitution” due in the case (about
$105,000). Id., at 52. Its date, October 5, is 67 days after
Dolan’s July 30 sentencing and 23 days before the stat
ute’s “90 days after sentencing” deadline would expire.
§3664(d)(5).
The sentencing court nonetheless set a restitution hear
ing for February 4, 2008—about three months after the
90-day deadline expired. As far as the record shows, no
one asked the court for an earlier hearing. At the hearing,
Dolan pointed out that the 90-day deadline had passed.
Id., at 54–55. And he argued that the law no longer au
thorized the court to order restitution. Id., at 60–64.
The court disagreed and ordered restitution.
