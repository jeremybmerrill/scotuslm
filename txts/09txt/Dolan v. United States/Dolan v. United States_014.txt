Opinion of the Court

of evidence to rebut the claimed restitution amount—the
defendant remains free to ask the court to take that fact
into account upon review. That inquiry might also con
sider the reason for the delay and the party responsible for
its cause, i.e., whether the Government or the victim. Cf.,
e.g., United States v. Stevens, 211 F. 3d 1, 4–6 (CA2 2000)
(tolling 90-day deadline for defendant’s bad-faith delay);
United States v. Terlingo, 327 F. 3d 216, 218–223 (CA3
2003) (same). Adopting the dissent’s approach, by con
trast, would permit a defendant’s bad-faith delay to pre
vent a timely order of restitution, potentially allowing the
defendant to manipulate whether restitution could be
awarded at all. But since we are not presented with such
a case here, we need not decide whether, or how, such
potential harm or equitable considerations should be
taken into consideration.
In focusing upon the argument’s third step, we do not
mean to imply that we accept the second premise, i.e., that
a sentencing judgment is not “final” until it contains a
definitive determination of the amount of restitution. To
the contrary, strong arguments favor the appealability of
the initial judgment irrespective of the delay in determin
ing the restitution amount. The initial judgment here
imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised re
lease, and stated that restitution would be awarded. This
Court has previously said that a judgment that imposes
“discipline” may still be “freighted with sufficiently sub
stantial indicia of finality to support an appeal.” Corey v.
United States, 375 U. S. 169, 174, 175 (1963) (internal
quotation marks omitted). And the Solicitor General
points to statutes that say that a “judgment of conviction”
that “includes” a “sentence to imprisonment” is a “final
judgment.” 18 U. S. C. §3582(b). So is a judgment that
imposes supervised release (which can be imposed only in
conjunction with a sentence of imprisonment). Ibid.;
§3583(a). So is a judgment that imposes a fine. §3572(c).
