DOLAN v. UNITED STATES
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

convictions of” certain crimes. §3663A(c)(1) (emphasis
added). And the court “at the time of sentencing” must
“state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the
particular sentence”—including its reasons for “not or
der[ing] restitution” if it fails to do so. §3553(c).
These provisions authorize restitution orders at sentenc
ing. They confer no authority to order restitution after
sentencing has concluded. When Congress permits courts
to impose criminal penalties at some time other than
sentencing, it does so explicitly. See, e.g., §3552(b) (provi
sional sentence during a study period); §3582(d) (authoriz
ing certain penalties “in imposing a sentence . . . or at any
time thereafter”); §3583(e) (permitting extension of super
vised release); §§4244(d)–(e) (provisional sentencing for
the mentally ill); see also Fed. Rules Crim. Proc.
32.2(b)(2)(B), (4)(A) (presentencing forfeiture orders); cf.
Corey v. United States, 375 U. S. 169 (1963) (appeals from
provisional and final sentences authorized by law).
Once a sentence has been imposed, moreover, it is final,
and the trial judge’s authority to modify it is narrowly
circumscribed. We have stated that “the trial courts had
no such authority” prior to the adoption of Rule 35, United
States v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178, 189, and n. 16 (1979),
and Congress has since revoked the broad authority to
correct illegal sentences originally set forth in that Rule.
See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98–473,
§215(b), 98 Stat. 2015–2016; see also Historical Notes on
1984 Amendments to Rule 35, 18 U. S. C. A., p. 605 (2008).
Today, an error may be corrected by the trial court only if
it is “clear,” and only within 14 days after the sentence is
announced. Rules 35(a), (c). The Rule of Criminal Proce
dure allowing extensions of time expressly provides that
“[t]he court may not extend the time to take any action
under Rule 35, except as stated in that rule.” Rule
45(b)(2). This Court has reiterated that time limits made
binding under Rule 35 “may not be extended,” Addonizio,
