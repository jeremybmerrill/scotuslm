Opinion of the Court

Memorandum Opinion and Restitution Order in No. CR
06–02173–RB (D NM, Apr. 24, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert.
47a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 571 F. 3d 1022
(CA10 2009). And, in light of differences among the
Courts of Appeals, we granted Dolan’s petition for certio
rari on the question. Compare United States v. Cheal, 389
F. 3d 35 (CA1 2004) (recognizing court’s authority to enter
restitution order past 90 days) and United States v. Balen
tine, 569 F. 3d 801 (CA8 2009) (same), with United States
v. Maung, 267 F. 3d 1113 (CA11 2001) (finding no such
authority), and United States v. Farr, 419 F. 3d 621 (CA7
2005) (same).

There is no doubt in this case that the court missed the
90-day statutory deadline “for the final determination of
the victim’s losses.” §3664(d)(5). No one has offered any
excuse for the court’s doing so. Nor did any party seek an
extension or “tolling” of the 90 days for equitable or for
other reasons. All the information needed to determine
the requisite restitution amount was available before the
90-day period had ended. Thus, the question before us
concerns the consequences of the missed deadline where,
as here, the statute does not specify them.
In answering this kind of question, this Court has
looked to statutory language, to the relevant context, and
to what they reveal about the purposes that a time limit is
designed to serve. The Court’s answers have varied de
pending upon the particular statute and time limit at
issue. Sometimes we have found that the statute in ques
tion imposes a “jurisdictional” condition upon, for example,
a court’s authority to hear a case, to consider pleadings, or
to act upon motions that a party seeks to file. See, e.g.,
Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). But cf. Kontrick v.
Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455 (2004) (finding bankruptcy rule
