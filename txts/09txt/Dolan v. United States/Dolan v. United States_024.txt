DOLAN v. UNITED STATES
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

tance), let alone the finality of criminal sentencing. The
cited cases are said to establish that an official’s “failure to
meet [a] deadline” does not always deprive that official of
“power to act beyond it.” Regions Hospital v. Shalala, 522
U. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998). But the failure to comply with
§3664(d)(5) does not deprive anyone of anything: The trial
court never had the general authority to alter sentences
once imposed, in the way that the administrative agencies
in the cited cases were said to have general regulatory
authority. The trial court’s authority to add a restitution
provision to an otherwise final sentence was conferred by
the very provision that limited that authority. Section
3664(d)(5) did not take away anything that might persist
in the absence of §3664(d)(5).2
Even more perplexing is the Court’s suggestion that
references to the authority of trial courts necessarily
implicate questions of jurisdiction. Ante, at 14. To say
that a court lacks authority to order belated restitution
does not use “authority” in a jurisdictional sense, see
Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 511 (2006), but
only in the same sense in which a court lacks “authority”
to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum. Such
action is an error of law, reversible on appeal, but it is not
jurisdictional. As in United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.
Espinosa, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9), compli
ance with §3664(d)(5) is “not a limitation on the . . . court’s
jurisdiction,” but it is a statutory “precondition to obtain
ing a [particular] order.” Here that condition was not
satisfied.

——————
2 United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711 (1990), is equally
inapposite: The statute in that case rested the lower court’s authority
on whether a bail hearing had been held at all (it had), whereas here
the only statutory condition is whether the losses were determined
within 90 days of sentencing (they were not).
