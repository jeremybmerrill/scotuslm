GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION 

DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON 

Opinion of the Court 


lawyers reading statutes that “a word may be known by
the company it keeps,” Russell Motor Car Co. v. United
States, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923). All participants in this
litigation acknowledge that the terms “congressional” and
“[GAO]” are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative
Branch of the Federal Government,5 and the GAO is a
federal agency.6 Relying on our opinions in S. D. Warren
Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S.
370 (2006), and Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368
(1994), the Court of Appeals reasoned that “the placement
of ‘administrative’ squarely in the middle of a list of obvi
ously federal sources strongly suggests that ‘administra
tive’ should likewise be restricted to federal administrative
reports, hearings, audits, or investigations.” 528 F. 3d, at
302. In so holding, the Court of Appeals embraced what
we might call the Sandwich Theory of the Third Circuit.
Both courts “ ‘f[ou]nd it hard to believe that the drafters of
this provision intended the word “administrative” to refer
to both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched
between modifiers which are unquestionably federal in
character.’ ” Ibid. (quoting United States ex rel. Dunleavy
v. County of Delaware, 123 F. 3d 734, 745 (CA3 1997)).
We find this use of noscitur a sociis unpersuasive. A list

U. S. Const., Art. I, §1; id., §4, cl. 1 (distinguishing “State . . .
Legislature[s]” from “the Congress”).
6 The statute refers to the GAO, mistakenly, as the “Government
Accounting Office.” It is undisputed that the intended referent was the
General Accounting Office, now renamed the Government Accountabil
ity Office. See 31 U. S. C. §3730, p. 254, n. 2 (compiler’s note); 528 F. 3d
292, 300, n. 4 (CA4 2008); United States ex rel. Mistick PBT v. Housing
Authority of Pittsburgh, 186 F. 3d 376, 387 (CA3 1999) (Alito, J.), cert.
denied, 529 U. S. 1018 (2000); see also Mistick, 186 F. 3d, at 398
(Becker, C. J., dissenting) (noting that courts have “frequently” made
the same scrivener’s error). We have described the GAO as “an inde
pendent agency within the Legislative Branch that exists in large part
to serve the needs of Congress.” Bowsher v. Merck & Co., 460 U. S. 824,
844 (1983).
