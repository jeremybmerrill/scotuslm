DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON 

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


tam actions. By replacing the Government knowledge bar
with the current text of §3730(e)(4)(A) and including an
exception for “original source[s],” Congress “allowed pri
vate parties to sue even based on information already in
the Government’s possession.” Cook County v. United
States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U. S. 119, 133 (2003). The
1986 amendments also established the right of qui tam
relators to continue as a party to a suit after the Govern
ment intervenes, 31 U. S. C. §3730(c)(1) (1988 ed.); in
creased the percentage of recovery available as an incen
tive for private suits, §3730(d)(1); and created a cause of
action against employers who retaliate against qui tam
relators, §3730(h).7

§1.04[G], p. 1–22 (Supp. 2007) (“[V]irtually all the changes introduced
in th[e] section [of the 1986 amendments addressing qui tam actions]
expanded the rights of qui tam relators”). The amendments also
contained a number of provisions facilitating enforcement generally,
e.g., lowering the requisite showing of intent by making clear that
“knowing” violations require “no proof of specific intent to defraud,” 31
U. S. C. §3729(b)(1) (1988 ed.); lengthening the statute of limitations,
§3731(b); and authorizing treble damages, §3729(a).
The Court fairly observes that the addition of “news media” to the
jurisdictional bar undercuts attributing to Congress a “single-minded”
intent to expand the availability of qui tam relief. Ante, at 19. But
neither does that provision support reading Category 2 to its broadest
possible extent. Moreover, barring suits based on “news media” disclo
sures may not have constituted a particularly significant expansion of
existing law. Courts had applied the pre-1986 Government knowledge
bar to dismiss actions based on information reported in the news
media. In United States ex rel. Thompson v. Hays, 432 F. Supp. 253,
256, 255 (DC 1976), the court dismissed a suit based on evidence
“gleaned from sources in the news media which received widespread
public attention [alleging fraud by a Member of Congress],” when the
Department of Justice “first obtained information regarding the claims
. . . as a result of [a] Washington Post article.” Similarly, the court in
United States v. Burmah Oil Co., 558 F. 2d 43, 46, n. 1 (CA2 1977) (per
curiam) characterized the Government knowledge bar as “dis
courag[ing] the filing of actions by parties having no information of
their own to contribute, but who merely plagiarized information in
