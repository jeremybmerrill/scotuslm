GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION 

DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON 

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


I
Section 3730(e)(4)(A) sets forth three categories of “pub

“allegations or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or
administrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra

Dictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining “administrative” as
“pertain[ing] to administration, especially management,
. . . [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or
things”).
Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress’ choice of two
“clearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly fed
eral term” as a “very strong contextual cue about the
meaning of ‘administrative.’ ” 528 F. 3d 292, 302 (CA4
2008). “ ‘The maxim noscitur a sociis, . . . while not an
inescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is
capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of

the Court observes, in enacting §3730(e)(4)(A) Congress errone
ously referred to the General Accounting Office—now renamed the
Government Accountability Office—as the “Government Accounting
Office.” Ante, at 6, n. 6.
