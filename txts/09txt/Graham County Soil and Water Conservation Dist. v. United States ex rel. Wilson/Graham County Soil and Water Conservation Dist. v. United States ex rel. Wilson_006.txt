Opinion of the Court

statute of limitations applicable to Wilson’s retaliation
claim, Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v.
United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409 (2005), the
Court of Appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as
time barred. 424 F. 3d 437 (CA4 2005). On remand, the
District Court subsequently dismissed Wilson’s qui tam
action for lack of jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a–
105a. The court found that Wilson had failed to refute
that her action was based upon allegations publicly dis
closed in the Audit Report and the DEHNR Report. Id., at
95a–98a. Those reports, the District Court determined,
constituted “administrative . . . report[s], . . . audit[s], or
investigation[s]” within the meaning of the FCA’s public
disclosure bar, 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A).
The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the
District Court because the reports had been generated by
state and local entities. “[O]nly federal administrative
reports, audits or investigations,” the Fourth Circuit
concluded, “qualify as public disclosures under the FCA.”
528 F. 3d 292, 301 (2008) (emphasis added). The Circuits
having divided over this issue,2 we granted certiorari to
resolve the conflict. 557 U. S. __ (2009).

2 Compare

528 F. 3d, at 301–307 (limiting this portion of the public
disclosure bar to federal sources), and United States ex rel. Dunleavy v.
County of Delaware, 123 F. 3d 734, 745–746 (CA3 1997) (same), with
United States ex rel. Bly-Magee v. Premo, 470 F. 3d 914, 918–919 (CA9
2006) (concluding that state and local sources may qualify), cert.
denied, 552 U. S. 1165 (2008), and Battle v. Board of Regents for State
of Ga., 468 F. 3d 755, 762 (CA11 2006) (per curiam) (assuming without
analysis that state audits may qualify). The Eighth Circuit appears to
have taken a “middle road” on this issue, 528 F. 3d, at 301, holding that
disclosures made in nonfederal forums may count as “ ‘administrative
. . . report[s]’ ” or “ ‘audit[s]’ ” under §3730(e)(4)(A) in some instances, as
when they relate to “a cooperative federal-state program through which
the federal government provides financial assistance.” Hays v. Hoff
man, 325 F. 3d 982, 989, cert. denied, 540 U. S. 877 (2003).
