GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION 

DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON 

Opinion of the Court 


I
In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North
Carolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to
perform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suf
fered extensive flooding. The Federal Government agreed
to shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent
Karen T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the
Graham County Soil and Conservation District, a special
purpose government body that had been delegated partial
responsibility for coordinating and performing the reme
diation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection
with this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local offi
cials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and
had a meeting with, agents of the USDA.
Graham County officials began an investigation. An
accounting firm hired by the county performed an audit
and, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified
several potential irregularities in the county’s administra
tion of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Caro
lina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural
Resources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying
similar problems. The USDA’s Office of Inspector General
eventually issued a third report that contained additional
findings.
In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petition
ers, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and
Water Conservation Districts and a number of local and
federal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by
knowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant
to the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners
retaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation
of those false claims. Following this Court’s review of the
