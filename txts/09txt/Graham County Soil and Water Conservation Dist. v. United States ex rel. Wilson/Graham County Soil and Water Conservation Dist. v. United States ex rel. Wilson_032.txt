SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Second, there is more support than the Court recognizes
for the proposition that Congress sought in the 1986
amendments to broaden the availability of qui tam relief.
The Senate Report characterized the reform effort as
intended to “enhance the Government’s ability to recover
losses sustained as a result of fraud against the Govern
ment” and dwelt at length on the “severe” and “growing”
problem of “fraud in Federal programs.” S. Rep., at 1–2;
accord, H. R. Rep. No. 99–660, p. 18 (1986) (“Evidence of
fraud in Government programs and procurement is on a
steady rise”). The Senate Report also articulated a desire
to “encourage any individual knowing of Government
fraud to bring that information forward,” and it identified
as “perhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective
enforcement [of antifraud laws] a lack of resources on the
part of Federal enforcement agencies.” S. Rep., at 2, 7.6
Consistent with these expressed views, the enacted
legislation was replete with provisions encouraging qui
——————
from bringing a qui tam suit for Medicaid fraud because the State had
previously disclosed the information to the Federal Government, even
when the State’s own investigation had discovered the fraud. S. Rep.,
at 12–13. Lower courts have observed that the Dean decision was
controversial and appears to have motivated the inclusion of the
“original source” exception in the 1986 jurisdictional bar. See, e.g.,
Wang v. FMC Corp., 975 F. 2d 1412, 1419 (CA9 1992); see also S. Rep.,
at 13 (noting resolution by the National Association of Attorneys
General criticizing Dean and urging Congress to address the problem).
6 In introducing a later and near-final version of the bill, Senator
Grassley described the reform effort as stemming “from a realization
that the Government needs help—lots of help—to adequately protect
taxpayer funds from growing and increasingly sophisticated fraud.”
132 Cong. Rec. 28580 (1986); see also United States ex rel. Siller v.
Becton Dickinson & Co., 21 F. 3d 1339, 1347 (CA4 1994) (“By 1986,
when section 3730(e)(4) was enacted, Congress had come to the conclu
sion that fraud against the Government was apparently so rampant
and difficult to identify that the Government could use all the help it
could get from private citizens with knowledge of fraud” (internal
quotation marks omitted)).
