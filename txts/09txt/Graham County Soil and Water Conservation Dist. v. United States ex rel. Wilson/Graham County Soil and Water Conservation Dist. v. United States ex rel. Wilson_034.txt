SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

To be sure, Congress was also concerned in 1986, as in
1943, with guarding against purely opportunistic, “para
sitic” qui tam relators. See S. Rep., at 10–11 (describing
history of parasitic suits and the 1943 amendments); ante,
at 12–13. Lower courts have viewed the 1986 amend
ments as striking a balance between the “twin goals of
rejecting suits which the government is capable of pursu
ing itself, while promoting those which the government is
not equipped to bring on its own.” United States ex rel.
Springfield Terminal R. Co. v. Quinn, 14 F. 3d 645, 651
(CADC 1994). But evidence that Congress sought to
balance two competing goals supports moderation in
interpreting an arguably ambiguous statutory text, rather
than woodenly reading the statutory language to its fullest
possible extent.
Third, the legislative record “ ‘contains no hint of any
intention’ ” to bar suits based on disclosures from state or
local government sources. Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 20 (quoting United States ex rel. AntiDiscrimination Center of Metro N. Y., Inc. v. Westchester
Cty., 495 F. Supp. 2d 375, 383 (SDNY 2007)). Inclusion of
state or local government sources would have constituted
a significant departure from the Federal Government
knowledge bar that had existed for four decades by 1986.
But neither the initial bills reported by the Senate and
House Committees nor statements by individual Members
of Congress about subsequent versions of the legislation
suggest any consideration or debate about expanding the
pre-1986 bar to apply to state or local government
——————
indictments returned in the courts, newspaper stories or congressional
investigations.” Congress could have reasonably assumed in 1986 that
news media would report on the kinds of high-profile frauds that would
naturally—perhaps as a result of the reporting—come to the Govern
ment’s attention, and thus would already have been covered under
existing law.
