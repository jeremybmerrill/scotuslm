GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

may be national or local in scope, that distinction is not
analogous to the difference between federal and state
government sources. 528 F. 3d, at 304.
II
In my view, the statutory context and legislative history
are also less “opaque,” cf. ante, at 17, and more supportive
of the reading adopted by the Court of Appeals, than the
majority today acknowledges. While the legislative record
is concededly incomplete, it does provide reason to exercise
caution before giving the statutory text its broadest possi
ble meaning—i.e., to encompass not only federal, but also
state and local, government sources.
Three points are particularly salient. First, prior to the
1986 amendments, the “Government knowledge” bar
unquestionably referred only to information in the posses
sion of the Federal Government.4 Even still, the bar was
criticized as overly restrictive. A Senate Report on an
initial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, de
scribed the FCA’s history and need for legislative reform,
noting “several restrictive court interpretations of the act
. . . which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.”
S. Rep. No. 99–345, p. 4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.). For
instance, courts had applied the Government knowledge
bar “even if the Government makes no effort to investigate
or take action after . . . original allegations [a]re received.”

tional Business Machines Corp., 490 F. Supp. 244 (Haw.
1980)).5

4 As

originally enacted in 1943, the bar applied to suits “based upon
evidence or information in the possession of the United States, or any
agency, officer or employee thereof, at the time such suit was brought.”
57 Stat. 609. In 1982, Congress recodified the provision to apply to
suits “based on evidence or information the Government had when the
action was brought.” 96 Stat. 979.

Dean, 729 F. 2d 1100 (CA7 1984), in which the court barred Wisconsin
