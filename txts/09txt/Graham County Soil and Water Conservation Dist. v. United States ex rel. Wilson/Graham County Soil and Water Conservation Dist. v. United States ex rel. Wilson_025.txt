GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVA-

TION DISTRICT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED 

STATES EX REL. KAREN T. WILSON 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[March 30, 2010] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I join Parts I–III and V–VI of the Court’s opinion. As for
Part IV, I agree that the stray snippets of legislative his
tory respondent, the Solicitor General, and the dissent
have collected prove nothing at all about Congress’s pur
pose in enacting 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A). Ante, at 14–
18. But I do not share the Court’s premise that if a “ ‘legis
lative purpose’ ” were “ ‘evident’ ” from such history it
would make any difference. Ante, at 17 (quoting United
States v. Bornstein, 423 U. S. 303, 310 (1976)). The Con
stitution gives legal effect to the “Laws” Congress enacts,
Art. VI, cl. 2, not the objectives its Members aimed to
achieve in voting for them. See Oncale v. Sundowner
Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80 (1998). If
§3730(e)(4)(A)’s text includes state and local administra
tive reports and audits, as the Court correctly concludes it
does, then it is utterly irrelevant whether the Members of
Congress intended otherwise. Anyway, it is utterly impos
sible to discern what the Members of Congress intended
except to the extent that intent is manifested in the only
remnant of “history” that bears the unanimous endorse
ment of the majority in each House: the text of the en
rolled bill that became law.
