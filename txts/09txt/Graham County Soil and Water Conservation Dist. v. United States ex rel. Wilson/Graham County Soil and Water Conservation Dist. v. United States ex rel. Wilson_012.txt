Opinion of the Court

types of sources that serve a common function in
§3730(e)(4)(A), then, only two are distinctly federal in
nature, while one (the news media) is distinctly nonfederal
in nature.
If the Court of Appeals was correct that the term “ad
ministrative” encompasses state and local sources in
Category 1, see 528 F. 3d, at 303, it becomes even harder
to see why the term would not do the same in Category 2.

(“[A] legislative body generally uses a particular word with
a consistent meaning in a given context”). Respondent
and the Solicitor General assert that §3730(e)(4)(A)’s two

legislative-type character are presumably just as public,
and just as likely to put the Federal Government on notice
of a potential fraud, as state and local administrative
hearings of an adjudicatory character.9

be inconsistent if it included state and local administrative hearings as
sources of public disclosures [in Category 1] and then, in the next
breath, excluded state administrative reports as sources”); In re Natu
