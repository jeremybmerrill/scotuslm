Opinion of the Court

port and the Audit Report, as petitioners allege.
In debating this question, petitioners have relied pri
marily on the statute’s text whereas respondent and the
Solicitor General, as her amicus, have relied heavily on
considerations of history and policy. Although there is
some overlap among the three types of argument, it is
useful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.

The term “administrative” “may, in various contexts,
bear a range of related meanings,” Chandler v. Judicial
Council of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 103, n. 8 (1970)

private bodies as well as to governmental bodies. When

The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that “administrative”
nevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its
application of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis.
See id., at 302–305. This maxim, literally translated as
“ ‘it is known by its associates,’ ” Black’s 1160, counsels
