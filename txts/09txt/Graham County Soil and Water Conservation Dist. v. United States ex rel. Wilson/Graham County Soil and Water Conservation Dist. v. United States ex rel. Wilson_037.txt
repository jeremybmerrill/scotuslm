11 The majority notes in passing several policy arguments advanced
by petitioners and their amici. Ante, at 20, n. 19. None merits much
weight. Petitioners are concerned about a race to the courthouse, in
which parasitic relators will capitalize on information released in a
state or local government report to the disadvantage of a slow-moving
insider. Brief for Petitioners 31. But the FCA’s first-to-file provision,
31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(5), reflects Congress’ explicit policy choice to
encourage prompt filing and, in turn, prompt recovery of defrauded
funds by the United States. Amici States are concerned that relators
may interfere with ongoing state and local government investigations
by “trolling state records and reports” for evidence of fraud. States
Brief 11. But some state freedom-of-information laws exempt materials
related to ongoing civil investigations. See, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. §45–
221(a)(11) (2008 Cum. Supp.); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 65, §67.708(b)(17)
(Purdon Supp. 2009). In any event, the FCA contains no provision
giving state or local governments a privileged position as qui tam
relators or, with respect to local governments, defendants.
