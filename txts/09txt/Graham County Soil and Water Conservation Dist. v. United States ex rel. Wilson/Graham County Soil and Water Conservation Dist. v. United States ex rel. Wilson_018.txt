Opinion of the Court

including the introduction of the term we are construing in
this case—were inserted without floor debate, as “techni
cal” amendments. That the original Senate bill mentioned
only congressional and GAO sources in Category 2 is
therefore of little moment. Neither the House nor the
Senate Committee Report explained why a federal limita
tion would be appropriate, and the subsequent addition of
“administrative” sources to this Category might be taken
as a sign that such a limitation was rejected by the full
Chambers.16

Prudential Ins. Co., 944 F. 2d 1149, 1154 (CA3 1991) (“The bill that
eventuated in the 1986 amendments underwent substantial revisions
during its legislative path. This provides ample opportunity to search
the legislative history and find some support somewhere for almost any
construction of the many ambiguous terms in the final version”); id., at
1163 (Scirica, J., dissenting) (“One difficulty in interpreting the 1986
amendments is that Congress was never completely clear about what
kind of ‘parasitic’ suits it was attempting to avoid”); Boese §4.02[A], at
4–46 (“The present Section 3730(e)(4) was enacted . . . without explana
tion by Congress”); id., §4.02[A], at 4–47 to 4–48 (“[A]pplicable legisla
tive history explaining versions [of §3730(e)(4)] not adopted is of little
help in deciphering this provision. Because Section 3730(e)(4) was
drafted subsequent to the completion of the House and Senate Commit
tee reports on the proposed False Claims Act Amendments, those
reports, which contained discussion of altogether different bars, cannot
be used in interpreting it. And the sponsors’ interpretations of the
provision ultimately enacted . . . are spare, often incorrect, and wide
ranging enough to provide some support for almost any construction of
its many ambiguities”).
16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR makes a valiant effort to unearth from the
legislative history “the balance Congress evidently sought to achieve
through the 1986 amendments.” Post, at 10. But her reconstruction of
the history assigns little weight to the side of this balance preserved by
the public disclosure bar: the desire to minimize “the potential for
parasitic lawsuits by those who learn of the fraud through public
channels and seek remuneration although they contributed nothing to
the exposure of the fraud,” United States ex rel. Doe v. John Doe Corp.,
960 F. 2d 318, 319 (CA2 1992). And her narrative contains no account
of why Category 2 emerged in the form that it did. Any such account
would necessarily be an exercise in speculation, as the record is silent
