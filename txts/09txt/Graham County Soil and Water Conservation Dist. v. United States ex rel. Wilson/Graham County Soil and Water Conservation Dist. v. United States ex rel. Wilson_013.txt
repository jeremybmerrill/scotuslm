GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON
Opinion of the Court

Respondent and the Solicitor General try to avoid this
inference, and to turn a weakness into a strength, by
further averring that the sources listed in Category 1 are
themselves only federal. See Brief for Respondent 23–24;
Brief for United States 25–26. No court has ever taken
such a view of these sources. See 528 F. 3d, at 303 (citing
cases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh
Circuits and stating that “[t]he courts have easily con
cluded that [Category 1] applies to state-level hearings”);
Sylvia §11:37, at 643, n. 1 (citing additional cases).10 The
arguments in favor of reading a federal limitation into
Category 1 are supported, if at all, by legislative history
and policy; they find no support in the statute’s text.
Moving from the narrow lens of the Sandwich Theory to
a bird’s eye view, respondent and the Solicitor General
also maintain that the “exclusively federal focus” of the
FCA counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to
encompass nonfederal sources. Brief for Respondent 10,
18; Brief for United States 13. The FCA undoubtedly has
a federal focus. But so does every other federal statute.

narrowly would have the anomalous result of allowing public disclosure
status to the most obscure local news report and the most obscure state
and local civil lawsuit or administrative hearing, but denying public
disclosure status to a formal public report of a state government
agency”).
10 Following the Court of Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 303, respondent
asserts that only the Ninth Circuit, in A-1 Ambulance Serv., Inc. v.
California, 202 F. 3d 1238, 1244 (2000), has explicitly considered and
rejected the argument that Category 1 is limited to federal sources.
Brief for Respondent 23–24. At least one other Circuit, however, has
done the same, see United States ex rel. Hafter v. Spectrum Emergency
Care, Inc., 190 F. 3d 1156, 1161, n. 6 (CA10 1999), and no lower court,
as far as we are aware, has so much as suggested that an alternative
construction might be viable. Moreover, the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh
Circuit cases cited by the Court of Appeals postdate A-1 Ambulance and
Dunleavy, 123 F. 3d 734, both of which put litigants and courts on
notice of the possibility that §3730(e)(4)(A) might be limited to federal
sources.
