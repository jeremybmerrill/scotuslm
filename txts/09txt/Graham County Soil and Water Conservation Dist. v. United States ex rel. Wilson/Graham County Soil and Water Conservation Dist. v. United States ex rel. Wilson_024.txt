Opinion of the Court 


VI 

Respondent and the Solicitor General have given nu
merous reasons why they believe their reading of the FCA
moves it closer to the golden mean between an inadequate
and an excessive scope for private enforcement. Congress
may well have endorsed those views in its recent amend
ment to the public disclosure bar. See n. 1, supra. With
respect to the version of §3730(e)(4)(A) that is before us,
however, we conclude that the term “administrative” in
Category 2 is not limited to federal sources.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
