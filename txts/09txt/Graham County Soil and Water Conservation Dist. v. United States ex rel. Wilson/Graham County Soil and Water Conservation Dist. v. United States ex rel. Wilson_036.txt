SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

position to act on it.9 The Solicitor General specifically
warns that while information in federal administrative
audits or investigations is “readily available” to attorneys
at the Department of Justice, “many state and local re
ports and investigations never come to the attention of
federal authorities.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 22. The Court dismisses this concern as “sheer
conjecture,” postulating that Government lawyers “may”
in fact learn about “quite a few” state or local reports and
investigations, particularly in joint state-federal pro
grams.10 Ante, at 18. Perhaps so. But absent any con
crete reason to believe otherwise, I would not so readily
dismiss the formal representation of the Executive Branch
entity with responsibility for, and practical experience in,
litigating FCA claims on behalf of the United States.
In sum, the statute’s plain text, evidence of Congress’

9 Of course, 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) (2006 ed.) speaks of “public
disclosure,” not notice to the Government. But the requirement of a
“public” disclosure countenances notice, both to the public and other
wise. Indeed, a number of lower courts look to whether the Federal
Government is “on notice” of alleged fraud before concluding that a
particular source is a “public disclosure of allegations or transactions”
under §3730(e)(4)(A). See, e.g., United States ex rel. Poteet v. Medtronic,
Inc., 552 F. 3d 503, 512 (CA6 2009) (“[A] public disclosure reveals fraud
if the information is sufficient to put the government on notice of the
likelihood of related fraudulent activity” (internal quotation marks
omitted)); United States v. Alcan Elec. & Eng., Inc., 197 F. 3d 1014,
1020 (CA9 1999) (similar); United States ex rel. Fine v. Sandia Corp.,
70 F. 3d 568, 572 (CA10 1995) (similar).
10 The Court observes that federal law requires some recipients of
federal funds to conduct audits, ante, at 18, n. 18, and amici States
point to the auditing and reporting requirements of the Single Audit
Act of 1984, Brief for State of Pennsylvania et al. as Amici Curiae 7–10
(hereinafter States Brief). But neither the Court nor the amici rebut
the Solicitor General’s pragmatic observation that “the vague and
summary nature of many of those reports . . . does not . . . alert the
federal government of fraud.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
31.
