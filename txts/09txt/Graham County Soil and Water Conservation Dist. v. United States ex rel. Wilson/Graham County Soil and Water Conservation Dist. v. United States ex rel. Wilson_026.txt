GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVA-

TION DISTRICT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED 

STATES EX REL. KAREN T. WILSON 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[March 30, 2010]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
dissenting.
The False Claims Act (FCA) divests federal courts of
jurisdiction to hear qui tam lawsuits based on allegations
or transactions publicly disclosed in a “congressional,
administrative, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)]
report, hearing, audit, or investigation,” unless the qui
tam relator is an “original source” of the information. 31
U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted). Today, the
Court reads the phrase “administrative . . . report, hear
ing, audit, or investigation” to encompass not only federal,
but also state and local, government sources. In my view,
the Court misreads the statutory text and gives insuffi
cient weight to contextual and historical evidence of Con
gress’ purpose in enacting §3730. I would affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that “adminis
trative” in the above-quoted provision refers only to Fed
eral Government sources.1
——————
1 As the Court notes, recent legislation amended the language of 31
U. S. C. §3730(e)(4). See ante, at 1–2, n. 1 (citing Pub. L. 111–148,
§10104(j)(2), 124 Stat. 119). Like the Court, I use the present tense
throughout this opinion in discussing the statute as it existed at the
time this case was argued before this Court.
