GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION 

DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON 

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


statutory term “ ‘abnormal income,’ ” which the statute
defined to include income resulting from “ ‘exploration,
discovery, or prospecting.’ ” 367 U. S., at 304–305 (quoting
§456(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Recogniz
ing that the word “ ‘[d]iscovery’ ” is “usable in many con
texts and with various shades of meaning,” we observed
that it “gathers meaning from the words around it” and
concluded that “[t]he three words in conjunction . . . all
describe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and
mining industries.” Id., at 307. As a result, and in light of
other contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion,
we held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera
equipment did not give rise to “abnormal income” even if
such inventions might otherwise be understood as “dis
cover[ies].” See id., at 307–313. In my view, the three
terms in Category 2 are no more “distinct” or “disparate,”
ante, at 7, than the phrase at issue in Jarecki, particularly
given the expansive plain meaning of “discovery.” Cf.
ante, at 7, n. 7. Here, application of the noscitur a sociis
principle readily yields a common feature: The sources at
issue are federal in nature, not related to state or local
governments or private entities. See Third Nat. Bank in
Nashville v. Impac Limited, Inc., 432 U. S. 312, 322–323,
315 (1977) (applying principle that “words grouped in a
list should be given related meaning” where term “ ‘injunc
tion’ ” was “sandwiched” between two other words in the
statutory phrase “ ‘attachment, injunction, or execution’ ”).3

3 The Court relies on Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338–339
(1979), for the proposition that we should not “ ‘rob’ ” any of the three
terms in Category 2 of 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) of “ ‘its independent
and ordinary significance.’ ” Ante, at 7. But Reiter involved the statu
tory term “business or property.” Those two words less readily suggest
a shared limiting principle than do “congressional, administrative, or
[GAO].” Moreover, our concern about “rob[bing]” the word “ ‘property’ ”
of its broader meaning rested on a desire not to “ignore the disjunctive
‘or’ ” in the statutory pairing. 442 U. S., at 338–339; see also id., at 339
(“Canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a
