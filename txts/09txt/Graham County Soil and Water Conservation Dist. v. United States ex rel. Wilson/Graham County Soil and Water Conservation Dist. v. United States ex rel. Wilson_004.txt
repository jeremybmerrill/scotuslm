GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVA-

TION DISTRICT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED 

STATES EX REL. KAREN T. WILSON 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[March 30, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.
Since its enactment during the Civil War, the False
Claims Act, 31 U. S. C. §§3729–3733, has authorized both
the Attorney General and private qui tam relators to
recover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims
for payment to the United States. The Act now contains a
provision barring qui tam actions based upon the public
disclosure of allegations or transactions in certain speci

whether the reference to “administrative” reports, audits,
and investigations in that provision encompasses disclo
sures made in state and local sources as well as federal
sources. We hold that it does.1
