57 Stat. 609 (codified at 31 U. S. C. §232(C) (1946 ed.)).
This amendment erected what came to be known as a
Government knowledge bar: “[O]nce the United States
learned of a false claim, only the Government could assert
its rights under the FCA against the false claimant.”

In the years that followed the 1943 amendment, the vol

an effort to strike a balance between encouraging private
persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits
such as the one in Hess. How exactly §3730(e)(4) came to
strike this balance in the way it did is a matter of consid
