Opinion of the Court

of any kind should not be a bar to a subsequent qui tam
suit”). Needless to say, this letter does not qualify as
legislative “history,” given that it was written 13 years
after the amendments were enacted. It is consequently of
scant or no value for our purposes.17
We do not doubt that Congress passed the 1986
amendments to the FCA “to strengthen the Government’s
hand in fighting false claims,” Cook County, 538 U. S., at
133–134, and “to encourage more private enforcement
suits,” S. Rep., at 23–24. It is equally beyond cavil, how
ever, that Congress passed the public disclosure bar to bar
a subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or
downright harmful. The question before us concerns the
precise scope of that subset; and on this matter, the record
is all but opaque. While “the absence of specific legislative
history in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty
to give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted
in the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting
the law in question,” United States v. Bornstein, 423 U. S.

U. S. 102, 118 (1980); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 580, n. 10
(2006); see also Hafter, 190 F. 3d, at 1161, n. 6 (refusing to credit the
Berman-Grassley letter in interpreting the public disclosure bar).
Respondent and her amici additionally contend that the enactment of
the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), 100 Stat.
1934 (codified at 31 U. S. C. §3801 et seq.), shortly before the enactment
of the FCA amendments supports their reading of the latter. See Brief
for Respondent 30–33; Brief for United States 14–15; Brief for Taxpay
ers Against Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 28–29. Yet while
“there is no question that the PFCRA was designed to operate in
tandem with the FCA,” Stevens, 529 U. S., at 786, n. 17, or that the
PFCRA is addressed to federal administrative agencies, there is also no
explicit evidence to suggest that Congress intended to limit Category
2’s reference to “administrative” sources to the same set of agencies.
The FCA’s public disclosure bar serves a distinct function not replicated
in the PFCRA; the text of the public disclosure bar contains no refer
ence to the PFCRA; and no Member of Congress, so far as we are
aware, articulated any such intent.
