Opinion of the Court

of three items, each quite distinct from the other no mat
ter how construed, is too short to be particularly illuminat
ing. Although this list may not be “completely disjunc
tive,” 528 F. 3d, at 302—it refers to “congressional,
administrative, or [GAO]” sources, §3730(e)(4)(A), rather
than “congressional, or administrative, or [GAO]”
sources—neither is it completely harmonious. The sub
stantive connection, or fit, between the terms “congres
sional,” “administrative,” and “GAO” is not so tight or so
self-evident as to demand that we “rob” any one of them
“of its independent and ordinary significance.” Reiter v.
Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338–339 (1979); see also
Russell, 261 U. S., at 519 (“That a word may be known by
the company it keeps is . . . not an invariable rule, for the
word may have a character of its own not to be submerged
by its association”). The adjectives in Category 2 are too
few and too disparate to qualify as “a string of statutory
terms,” S. D. Warren Co., 547 U. S., at 378, or “items in a
list,” Beecham, 511 U. S., at 371, in the sense that we used
those phrases in the cited cases.7

Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303 (1961), the Court
applied the noscitur a sociis maxim in construing a statutory provision
that referred to “ ‘[i]ncome resulting from exploration, discovery, or
prospecting,’ ” id., at 305 (quoting §456(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1939). JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that “the three terms in
Category 2 are no more ‘distinct’ or ‘disparate’ than the phrase at issue
in Jarecki.” Post, at 4 (dissenting opinion) (citation omitted). We
disagree. Whether taken in isolation or in context, the phrase “con
gressional, administrative, or GAO” is not as cohesive as the phrase
“exploration, discovery, or prospecting.” That is one reason why nosci
tur a sociis proved illuminating in Jarecki, and why it is less helpful in
this case. On their “face,” the terms “exploration,” “discovery,” and
“prospecting” all describe processes of searching, seeking, speculating;
the centrality of such activities to “the oil and gas and mining indus
tries” gave a clue that it was those industries Congress had in mind
when it drafted the provision. 367 U. S., at 307 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The terms “congressional,” “administrative,” and
“GAO” do not share any comparable core of meaning—or indeed any
