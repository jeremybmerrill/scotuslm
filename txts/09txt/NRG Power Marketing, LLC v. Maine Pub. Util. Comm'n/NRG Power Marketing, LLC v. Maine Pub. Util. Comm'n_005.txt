Opinion of the Court

meet their customers’ anticipated demand. For many
years in New England, the supply of capacity was barely
sufficient to meet the region’s demand. FERC and New
England’s generators, electricity providers, and power
customers made several attempts to address this problem.
This case stems from the latest effort to design a solution.
In 2003, a group of generators sought to enter into
“reliability must-run” agreements with the New England
Independent System Operator (ISO), which operates the
region’s transmission system.1 In its orders addressing
those agreements, FERC directed the ISO to develop a
new market mechanism that would set prices separately
for various geographical sub-regions. Devon Power LLC,
103 FERC ¶61,082, pp. 61,266, 61,271 (2003).
In March 2004, the ISO proposed a market structure
responsive to FERC’s directions. See Devon Power LLC,
107 FERC ¶61,240, p. 62,020 (2004). FERC set the matter
for hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),
who issued a 177-page order largely accepting the ISO’s
proposal. Devon Power LLC, 111 FERC ¶63,063, p. 65,205
(2005). Several parties filed exceptions to the ALJ’s order;
on September 20, 2005, the full Commission heard argu­
ments on the proposed market structure, and thereafter
established settlement procedures. Devon Power LLC, 113
FERC ¶61,075, p. 61,271 (2005).
After four months of negotiations, on March 6, 2006, a
settlement was reached. Of the 115 negotiating parties,
only 8 opposed the settlement.
The Settlement Agreement installed a “forward capacity
market” under which annual auctions would set capacity

not ownership, of the transmission facilities owned by member utilities.
