NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC, ET AL. v. MAINE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
No. 08–674.

Argued November 3, 2009—Decided January 13, 2010

The Mobile-Sierra doctrine—see United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile
Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power
Co., 350 U. S. 348—requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis
sion (FERC) to presume that an electricity rate set by a freely negoti
ated wholesale-energy contract meets the Federal Power Act’s (FPA)
“just and reasonable” prescription, 16 U. S. C. §7824d(a); the pre
sumption may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the contract
seriously harms the public interest. Morgan Stanley Capital Group
Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___.
For many years, New England’s supply of electricity capacity was
barely sufficient to meet the region’s demand. FERC and New Eng
land’s generators, electricity providers, and power customers made
several attempts to address the problem. This case arises from the
latest effort to design a solution. Concerned parties reached a com
prehensive settlement agreement (Agreement) that, inter alia, estab
lished rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity and pro
vided that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard would govern
rate challenges. FERC approved the Agreement, finding that it pre
sents a just and reasonable outcome that is consistent with the public
interest. Objectors to the settlement sought review in the D. C. Cir
cuit, which largely rejected their efforts to overturn FERC’s approval
order, but agreed with them that when a challenge to a contract rate
is brought by noncontracting third parties, Mobile-Sierra’s public in
terest standard does not apply.
Held: The Mobile-Sierra presumption does not depend on the identity of
the complainant who seeks FERC investigation. The presumption is
not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting par
