NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. 

UTIL. COMM’N
Opinion of the Court 





Agreement established rate-setting mechanisms for sales
of energy capacity, and provided that the Mobile-Sierra
public interest standard would govern rate challenges.
Parties who opposed the settlement petitioned for review
in the United States Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit.
Among multiple objections to FERC’s order approving the
Agreement, the settlement opponents urged that the rate
challenges of nonsettling parties should not be controlled
by the restrictive Mobile-Sierra public interest standard.
The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that “when a rate
challenge is brought by a non-contracting third party, the
Mobile-Sierra doctrine simply does not apply.” Maine Pub.
Util. Comm’n v. FERC, 520 F. 3d 464, 478 (2008) (per
curiam).
We reverse the D. C. Circuit’s judgment to the extent
that it rejects the application of Mobile-Sierra to noncon­
tracting parties. Our decision in Morgan Stanley, an­
nounced three months after the D. C. Circuit’s disposition,
made clear that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard
is not an exception to the statutory just-and-reasonable
standard; it is an application of that standard in the con­
text of rates set by contract. The “venerable Mobile-Sierra
doctrine” rests on “the stabilizing force of contracts.”
Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19); see id.,
at 22 (describing contract rates as “a key source of stabil­
ity”). To retain vitality, the doctrine must control FERC
itself, and, we hold, challenges to contract rates brought
by noncontracting as well as contracting parties.

In a capacity market, in contrast to a wholesale energy
market, an electricity provider purchases from a generator
an option to buy a quantity of energy, rather than pur­
chasing the energy itself. To maintain the reliability of
the grid, electricity providers generally purchase more
capacity, i.e., rights to acquire energy, than necessary to
