NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. 

UTIL. COMM’N
STEVENS, J., dissenting 





conditions, unless the purchaser could also prove that “the
contract seriously harms the public interest.” Morgan
Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of
Snohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 1).
The Court held in Morgan Stanley that Mobile-Sierra
established a presumption: FERC “must presume that the
rate set out in a freely negotiated wholesale-energy con
tract meets the ‘just and reasonable’ requirement imposed
by law.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). And that pre
sumption, according to the Court, is a simple application
of the just-and-reasonable standard to contract rates, not
a different standard of review. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6)
(rejecting the “obviously indefensible proposition that a
standard different from the statutory just-and-reasonable
standard applies to contract rates”). But applying the
presumption nonetheless sets a higher bar for a rate chal
lenge.1 FERC may abrogate the rate only if the public
interest is seriously harmed. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 22)
(“[U]nder the Mobile-Sierra presumption, setting aside a
contract rate requires a finding of ‘unequivocal public
necessity,’ ” Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747,
822 (1968), “or ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ Arkansas
Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U. S. 571, 582 (1981)”).
As I explained in my dissent in Morgan Stanley, the
imposition of this additional burden on purchasers chal
lenging rates was not authorized by the governing statute.
Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), all wholesale electric
ity rates must be “just and reasonable.” 16 U. S. C.
§824d(a). “[N]othing in the statute mandates differing
application of the statutory standard to rates set by con
——————
1 Whether the Court explains the Mobile-Sierra doctrine as a pre
sumption or as a different standard of review, “[t]here is no significant
difference between requiring a heightened showing to overcome an
otherwise conclusive presumption and imposing a heightened standard
of review.” Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (STEVENS,
J., dissenting).
