Opinion of the Court

Appeals rejected the objectors’ efforts to overturn FERC’s
order approving the settlement. 520 F. 3d, at 467. But
the objectors prevailed on the Mobile-Sierra issue: The
D. C. Circuit held that Mobile-Sierra applies only to con­
tracting parties. Id., at 478. In this Court, the parties
have switched places. Defenders of the settlement, includ­
ing the Mobile-Sierra provision, are petitioners; objectors
to the settlement, victorious in the Court of Appeals only
on the Mobile-Sierra issue, are respondents.
Because of the importance of the issue, and in light of
our recent decision in Morgan Stanley, we granted certio­
rari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve this question: “[Does]
Mobile-Sierra’s public-interest standard appl[y] when a
contract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a
party to the contract[?]” Brief for Petitioners i. Satisfied
that the answer to that question is yes, we reverse the
D. C. Circuit’s judgment insofar as it rejected application
of Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties.
II
The FPA gives FERC authority to regulate the “sale of
electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.” See
16 U. S. C. §824(b)(1). The Act allows regulated utilities
to set rates unilaterally by tariff; alternatively, sellers and
buyers may agree on rates by contract. See §824d(c), (d).
Whether set by tariff or contract, however, all rates must
be “just and reasonable.” §824d(a). Rates may be exam­
ined by the Commission, upon complaint or on its own
initiative, when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed
or after a rate goes into effect. §§824d(e), 824e(a). Follow­
ing a hearing, the Commission may set aside any rate
found “unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or
preferential,” and replace it with a just and reasonable
rate. §824e(a).
The Mobile-Sierra doctrine originated in twin decisions
announced on the same day in 1956: United Gas Pipe Line
