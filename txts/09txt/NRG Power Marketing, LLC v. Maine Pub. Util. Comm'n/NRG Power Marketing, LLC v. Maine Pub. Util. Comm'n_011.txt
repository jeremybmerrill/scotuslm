Opinion of the Court

Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). And if
FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract
rate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can
it be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless
may escape that presumption? 4
Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine does not overlook
third-party interests; it is framed with a view to their
protection. The doctrine directs the Commission to reject
a contract rate that “seriously harms the consuming pub­
lic.” Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17); see
Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 479
(2002) (When a buyer and a seller agree upon a rate, “the
principal regulatory responsibility [i]s not to relieve a
contracting party of an unreasonable rate, . . . but to pro­
tect against potential discrimination by favorable contract
rates between allied businesses to the detriment of other
wholesale customers.” (Emphasis added.)).
Finally, as earlier indicated, see supra, at 7–8, the D. C.
Circuit’s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate challenges
by contracting parties diminishes the animating purpose
of the doctrine: promotion of “the stability of supply ar­
rangements which all agree is essential to the health of
the [energy] industry.” Mobile, 350 U. S., at 344. That
dominant concern was expressed by FERC in the order on
review: “Stability is particularly important in this case,

positive: Contracts bind parties, not nonparties. Maine Pub. Util.
Comm’n v. FERC, 520 F. 3d 464, 478 (2008) (per curiam). MobileSierra holds sway, however, because well-informed wholesale-market
participants of approximately equal bargaining power generally can be
expected to negotiate just-and-reasonable rates, see Morgan Stanley
Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554
U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 17), and because “contract stability
ultimately benefits consumers,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 22). These
reasons for the presumption explain why FERC, surely not legally
bound by a contract rate, must apply the presumption and, correspond­
ingly, why third parties are similarly controlled by it.
