NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC, ET AL., PETITIONERS
v. MAINE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

[January 13, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
The opinion that the Court announces today is the third
chapter in a story about how a reasonable principle, ex
tended beyond its foundation, becomes bad law.
In the first chapter the Court wisely and correctly held
that a seller who is a party to a long-term contract to
provide energy to a wholesaler could not unilaterally
repudiate its contract obligations in response to changes in
market conditions by simply filing a new rate schedule
with the regulatory commission. Only if the rate was so
low that the seller might be unable to stay in business,
thereby impairing the public interest, could the seller be
excused from performing its contract. That is what the
Court held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas
Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332 (1956), and FPC v. Sierra
Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348 (1956).
In the second chapter the Court unwisely and incor
rectly held that the same rule should apply to a buyer who
had been forced by unprecedented market conditions to
enter into a long-term contract to buy energy at abnor
mally high prices. The Court held the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) could not set aside such a
contract as unjust and unreasonable, even though it sad
dled consumers with a duty to pay prices that would be
considered unjust and unreasonable under normal market
