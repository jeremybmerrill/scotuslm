NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. 

UTIL. COMM’N
Opinion of the Court 





Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v.
Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348. Both concerned
rates set by contract rather than by tariff. Mobile involved
the Natural Gas Act, which, like the FPA, requires utili­
ties to file all new rates with the regulatory commission.
15 U. S. C. §717c(c). In Mobile, we rejected a gas utility’s
argument that the file-all-new-rates requirement author­
ized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a pur­
chaser simply by filing a new tariff. 350 U. S., at 336–337.
Filing, we explained, was a precondition to changing a
rate, not an authorization to do so in violation of a lawful
contract. Id., at 339–344; see Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 4).
The Sierra case involved a further issue. Not only had
the Commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed
tariff superseded a contract rate. In addition, the Com­
mission had suggested that, in any event, the contract
rate, which the utility sought to escape, was itself unjust
and unreasonable. The Commission thought that was so
“solely because [the contract rate] yield[ed] less than a fair
return on the [utility’s] net invested capital.” 350 U. S., at
355.
The Commission’s suggestion prompted this Court to
home in on “the question of how the Commission may
evaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.”
Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The
Sierra Court answered the question this way:
“[T]he Commission’s conclusion appears on its face to
be based on an erroneous standard. . . . [W]hile it may
be that the Commission may not normally impose
upon a public utility a rate which would produce less
than a fair return, it does not follow that the public
utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate af­
fording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it
is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bar­
