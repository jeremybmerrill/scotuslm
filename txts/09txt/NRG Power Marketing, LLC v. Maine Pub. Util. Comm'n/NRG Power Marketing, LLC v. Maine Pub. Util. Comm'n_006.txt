NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. 

UTIL. COMM’N
Opinion of the Court 





prices; auctions would be conducted three years in ad­
vance of the time when the capacity would be needed.
Devon Power LLC, 115 FERC ¶61,340, pp. 62,304, 62,306–
62,308 (2006). Each energy provider would be required to
purchase enough capacity to meet its share of the “in­
stalled capacity requirement,” i.e., the minimum level of
capacity needed to maintain reliability on the grid, as
determined by the ISO. Id., at 62,307. For the three-year
gap between the first auction and the time when the ca­

Agreement prescribed a series of fixed, transition-period
payments to capacity-supplying generators.
Id., at

348 (1956) (the ‘Mobile-Sierra’ doctrine).” App. 95. Mo
bile-Sierra applies, §4.C instructs, “whether the [price is
challenged] by a Settling Party, a non-Settling Party, or
[by] the FERC acting sua sponte.” Ibid.
FERC approved the Settlement Agreement, “finding
that as a package, it presents a just and reasonable out­
come for this proceeding consistent with the public inter­
est.” 115 FERC, at 62,304. The Mobile-Sierra provision,
FERC explicitly determined, “appropriately balances the
need for rate stability and the interests of the diverse
entities who will be subject to the [forward capacity mar­
ket’s auction system].” Id., at 62,335.
Six of the eight objectors to the settlement sought re­
view in the D. C. Circuit. For the most part, the Court of
