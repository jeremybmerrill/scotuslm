Opinion of the Court

gain. . . . In such circumstances the sole concern of the
Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so
low as to adversely affect the public interest—as where
it might impair the financial ability of the public util­
ity to continue its service, cast upon other consumers
an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.”
350 U. S., at 354–355 (some emphasis added).
In a later case, we similarly explained: “The regulatory
system created by the [FPA] is premised on contractual
agreements voluntarily devised by the regulated compa­
nies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only
in circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.” Per
mian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822 (1968).3
Two Terms ago, in Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S. ___, the
Court reaffirmed and clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.
That case presented two questions: First, does the MobileSierra presumption (that contract rates freely negotiated
between sophisticated parties meet the just and reason­
able standard imposed by 16 U. S. C. §824d(a)) “apply only
when FERC has had an initial opportunity to review a
contract rate without the presumption?” 554 U. S., at ___

3 Consistent with the lead role of contracts recognized in MobileSierra, we held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas and
Water Div., 358 U. S. 103, 110–113 (1958), that parties may contract
out of the Mobile-Sierra presumption. They could do so, we ruled, by
specifying in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Commission
would supersede the contract rate. Courts of Appeals have approved an
option midway between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis Light: A contract
that does not allow the seller to supersede the contract rate by filing a
new rate may nonetheless permit the Commission to set aside the
contract rate if it results in an unfair rate of return, without a further
showing that it adversely affects the public interest. See, e.g., Papago
Tribal Util. Auth. v. FERC, 723 F. 2d 950, 953 (CADC 1983); Louisiana
Power & Light Co. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 671, 675–676 (CA5 1979).
