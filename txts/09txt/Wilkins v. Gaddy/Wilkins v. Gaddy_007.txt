Per Curiam

In holding that the District Court erred in dismissing
Wilkins’ complaint based on the supposedly de minimis
nature of his injuries, we express no view on the underly
ing merits of his excessive force claim. In order to prevail,
Wilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the
assault actually occurred but also that it was carried out
“maliciously and sadistically” rather than as part of “a
good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.” Ibid.
Moreover, even if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest
nature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the dam
ages he may recover.

The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to
proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of
the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

survived dismissal for failure to state a claim because that court’s
precedents have classified the sort of injuries alleged here as non-de
minimis. See, e.g., ibid. (permitting a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment
excessive force claim to proceed to trial where evidence indicated that
the prisoner suffered “one-centimeter abrasions on both his left knee
and left shoulder, pain in his right knee, and tenderness around his left
thumb,” as well as “back problems”); Gomez, 163 F. 3d, at 922 (refusing
to grant summary judgment on de minimis injury grounds where the
prisoner alleged “physical pain [and] bodily injuries in the form of cuts,
scrapes, [and] contusions to the face, head, and body”).
