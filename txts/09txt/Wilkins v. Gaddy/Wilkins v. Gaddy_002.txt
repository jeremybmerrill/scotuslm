WILKINS v. GADDY
Per Curiam

physically remove him from [Wilkins].” Ibid. Wilkins
further alleged that, “[a]s a result of the excessive force
used by [Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries
including a bruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood
pressure, as well as migraine headaches and dizziness”
and “psychological trauma and mental anguish including
depression, panic attacks and nightmares of the assault.”
Ibid.
The District Court, on its own motion and without a
response from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins’ complaint for
failure to state a claim. Citing Circuit precedent, the court
stated that, “[i]n order to state an excessive force claim
under the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish
that he received more than a de minimus [sic] injury.” No.
3:08–cv–00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), pp. 1, 2 (citing
Taylor v. McDuffie, 155 F. 3d 479, 483 (CA4 1998); Riley v.
Dorton, 115 F. 3d 1159, 1166 (CA4 1997) (en banc); foot
note omitted). According to the court, Wilkins’ alleged
injuries were no more severe than those deemed de mini
mis in the Circuit’s Taylor and Riley decisions. Indeed,
the court noted, Wilkins nowhere asserted that his inju
ries had required medical attention.
In a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins stated that he
was unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment
might prejudice his claim. He asserted that he had been
prescribed, and continued to take, medication for his
headaches and back pain, as well as for depression. And
he attached medical records purporting to corroborate his
injuries and course of treatment.
Describing reconsideration as “an extraordinary rem
edy,” the court declined to revisit its previous ruling. No.
3:08–cv–00138 (WD NC, Aug. 25, 2008), p. 1. The medical
records, the court observed, indicated that some of Wil
kins’ alleged injuries “were pre-existing conditions.” Id.,
at 3. Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood pres
sure and mental health issues even before the assault.
