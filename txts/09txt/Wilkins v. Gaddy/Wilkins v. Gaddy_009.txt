WILKINS v. GADDY
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

Hudson, however, discarded the requirement of serious
injury. Building upon Estelle’s mislaid foundation, the
Court concluded that force, rather than injury, is the
relevant inquiry, and that a prisoner who alleges excessive
force at the hands of prison officials and suffers nothing
more than de minimis injury can state a claim under the
Eighth Amendment. Hudson thus turned the Eighth
Amendment into “a National Code of Prison Regulation,”
503 U. S., at 28 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, 511
U. S., at 859 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), with
“federal judges [acting as] superintendents of prison condi
tions nationwide,” id., at 860. Although neither the Con
stitution nor our precedents require this result, no party
to this case asks us to overrule Hudson. Accordingly, I
concur in the Court’s judgment.
