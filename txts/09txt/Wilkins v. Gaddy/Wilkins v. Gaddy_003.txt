Per Curiam

The court acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray
after the incident “to examine his ‘bruised heel,’ ” but it
“note[d] that bruising is generally considered a de mini
mus [sic] injury.” Id., at 4. The court similarly character

headaches. The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his
complaint. In a summary disposition, the Court of Ap

court.” No. 08–7881 (CA4, Jan. 23, 2009).

to the Court of Appeals, Hudson’s injuries, which had not
required medical attention, were too “minor” to warrant
relief. Ibid.
Reversing the Court of Appeals, this Court rejected the
notion that “significant injury” is a threshold requirement
for stating an excessive force claim. The “core judicial
inquiry,” we held, was not whether a certain quantum of
injury was sustained, but rather “whether force was ap
