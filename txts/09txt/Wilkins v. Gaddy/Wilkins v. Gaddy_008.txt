THOMAS, J., concurring

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
JAMEY L. WILKINS v. OFFICER GADDY
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

No. 08–10914.

Decided February 22, 2010


JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom Justice Scalia joins, con
curring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that the Fourth Circuit’s Eighth
Amendment analysis is inconsistent with Hudson v.
McMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992). But I continue to believe
that Hudson was wrongly decided. Erickson v. Pardus,
551 U. S. 89, 95 (2007) (dissenting opinion); Farmer v.
Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 858 (1994) (opinion concurring in
judgment); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 37 (1993)
(dissenting opinion); Hudson, supra, at 17 (dissenting
opinion).
“At the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the
word ‘punishment’ referred to the penalty imposed for the
commission of a crime.” Helling, supra, at 38 (THOMAS, J.,
dissenting). The Court adhered to this understanding
until 1976, when it declared in Estelle v. Gamble, 429
U. S. 97, that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause
also extends to prison conditions not imposed as part of a
criminal sentence. See generally Hudson, supra, at 18–20
(THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, supra, at 861 (THOMAS,
J., concurring in judgment). To limit this abrupt expan
sion of the Clause, the Court specified that its new inter
pretation of the Eighth Amendment should not extend to
every deprivation a prisoner suffers, but instead should
apply “only [to] that narrow class of deprivations involving
‘serious’ injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a
culpable state of mind.” Hudson, supra, at 20 (THOMAS,
J., dissenting) (citing Estelle, supra, at 106); see generally
Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 298 (1991).
