SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
JAMEY L. WILKINS v. OFFICER GADDY
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

No. 08–10914.

Decided February 22, 2010

In Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 4 (1992), this
Court held that “the use of excessive physical force against

this case, the District Court dismissed a prisoner’s exces

his injuries were “de minimis.” Because the District
Court’s approach, affirmed on appeal, is at odds with
Hudson’s direction to decide excessive force claims based
on the nature of the force rather than the extent of the
injury, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judg
ment is reversed.

kick, knee and choke [Wilkins] until another officer had to
