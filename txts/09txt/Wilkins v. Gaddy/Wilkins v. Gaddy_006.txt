WILKINS v. GADDY
Per Curiam

claim if his injuries are de minimis.” 25 F. 3d, at 1263.
The Fourth Circuit’s strained reading of Hudson is not
defensible. This Court’s decision did not, as the Fourth
Circuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury
threshold for excessive force claims from “significant” to
“non-de minimis”—whatever those ill-defined terms might
mean. Instead, the Court aimed to shift the “core judicial
inquiry” from the extent of the injury to the nature of the
force—specifically, whether it was nontrivial and “was
applied . . . maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.”
503 U. S., at 7. To conclude, as the District Court did
here, that the absence of “some arbitrary quantity of
injury” requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force
claim improperly bypasses this core inquiry. Id., at 9.2

2 Most

Circuits to consider the issue have rejected the Fourth Cir
cuit’s de minimis injury requirement. See, e.g., Wright v. Goord, 554
F. 3d 255, 269–270 (CA2 2009) (“[O]ur Court has reversed summary
dismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where
the plaintiff’s evidence of injury was slight . . . . [T]he absence of any
significant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment
inquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of
such injury if the defendant’s use of force was malicious or sadistic”);
Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F. 3d 641, 648–649 (CA3 2002) (“[T]he Eighth
Amendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the
circumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries. . . .
[D]e minimis injuries do not necessarily establish de minimis force”);
Oliver v. Keller, 289 F. 3d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the view “that
to support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must
have suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis physical
injury” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. LaVallee,
439 F. 3d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).
The Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement
with the Fourth Circuit’s approach. See, e.g., Gomez v. Chandler, 163
F. 3d 921, 924 (1999) (“[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive
force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a
more than de minimis injury”). But see Brown v. Lippard, 472 F. 3d
384, 386 (2006) (“This Court has never directly held that injuries must
reach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force
claim”). Even in the Fifth Circuit, however, Wilkins likely would have
