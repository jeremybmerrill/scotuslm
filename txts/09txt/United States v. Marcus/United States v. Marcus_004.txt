UNITED STATES v. MARCUS
Opinion of the Court

become law until October 28, 2000. §112(a)(2), 114 Stat.
1486. Marcus noted that the indictment and the evidence
presented at trial permitted a jury to convict him exclu
sively upon the basis of actions that he took before October
28, 2000. And for that reason, Marcus argued that his
conviction violated the Constitution—in Marcus’ view, the
Ex Post Facto Clause, Art. I, §9, cl. 3. Marcus conceded
that he had not objected on these grounds in the District
Court. Letter Brief for Appellant in No. 07–4005–cr
(CA2), p. 12. But, he said, the constitutional error is
“plain,” and his conviction therefore must be set aside.
Id., at 13.
The Government replied by arguing that Marcus’ con
viction was for a single course of conduct, some of which
took place before, and some of which took place after, the
statute’s enactment date. 538 F. 3d, at 101. The Consti
tution, it said, does not forbid the application of a new
statute to such a course of conduct so long as the course of
conduct continued after the enactment of the statute. See,
e.g., United States v. Harris, 79 F. 3d 223, 229 (CA2 1996);
United States v. Duncan, 42 F. 3d 97, 104 (CA2 1994).
The Government conceded that the conviction could not
rest exclusively upon conduct which took place before the
TVPA’s enactment, but it argued that the possibility that
the jury here had convicted on that basis was “ ‘remote.’ ”
538 F. 3d, at 102. Hence, the Government claimed, it was
highly unlikely that the judge’s failure to make this aspect
of the law clear (say, by explaining to the jury that it could
not convict based on preenactment conduct alone) affected
Marcus’ “substantial rights.” Letter Brief for United
States in No. 07–4005–cr (CA2), p. 9. And the Govern
ment thus argued that the court should not recognize a
“plain error.” Ibid.
The Second Circuit noted that Marcus had not raised
his ex post facto argument in the District Court. 538 F. 3d,
at 102. The court also recognized that, under Circuit
