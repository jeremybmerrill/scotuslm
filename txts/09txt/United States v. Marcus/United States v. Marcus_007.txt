Opinion of the Court

the trial proceeds,’ ” Johnson, supra, at 468 (quoting Ari
zona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991)), such that
it is often “difficul[t]” to “asses[s] the effect of the error,”
United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 149, n. 4
(2006). See Johnson, supra, at 468–469 (citing cases in
which this Court has found “structural error,” including
Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (total depriva
tion of counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927) (lack
of an impartial trial judge); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465
U. S. 168 (1984) (right to self-representation at trial);
Waller v. Georgia, 467 U. S. 39 (1984) (violation of the
right to a public trial); and Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508
U. S. 275 (1993) (erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction)).
We cannot conclude that the error here falls within that
category.
The error at issue in this case created a risk that the
jury would convict respondent solely on the basis of con
duct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in
that conduct. A judge might have minimized, if not elimi
nated, this risk by giving the jury a proper instruction.
We see no reason why, when a judge fails to give such an
instruction, a reviewing court would find it any more
difficult to assess the likely consequences of that failure
than with numerous other kinds of instructional errors
that we have previously held to be non-“structural”—for
example, instructing a jury as to an invalid alternative
theory of guilt, Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___ (2008)
(per curiam), omitting mention of an element of an offense,
Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1 (1999), or erroneously
instructing the jury on an element, Yates v. Evatt, 500
U. S. 391 (1991); Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263
(1989) (per curiam); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987);
Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570 (1986).
Marcus argues that, like the Second Circuit, we should
apply the label “Ex Post Facto Clause violation” to the
error in this case, and that we should then treat all errors
