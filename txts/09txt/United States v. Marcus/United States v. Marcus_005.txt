Opinion of the Court

precedent, the Constitution did not prohibit conviction for
a “ ‘continuing offense’ ” so long as the conviction rested, at
least in part, upon postenactment conduct. Id., at 101
(quoting Harris, supra, at 229). But, the court held, “even
in the case of a continuing offense, if it was possible for the
jury—wh[ich] had not been given instructions regarding
the date of enactment—to convict exclusively on [the basis
of] pre-enactment conduct, then the conviction constitutes
a violation” of the Ex Post Facto Clause. 538 F. 3d, at 101.
The court noted that this was “true even under plain error
review.” Ibid. In short, under the Second Circuit’s ap
proach, “a retrial is necessary whenever there is any
possibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could
have convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment con
duct.” Id., at 102 (emphasis added).
The Government sought certiorari. And we granted the
writ, agreeing to decide whether the Second Circuit’s
approach to “plain error” review, as we have set it forth,
conflicts with this Court’s interpretation of the “plain
error” rule. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).

Rule 52(b) permits an appellate court to recognize a
“plain error that affects substantial rights,” even if the
claim of error was “not brought” to the district court’s
“attention.” Lower courts, of course, must apply the Rule
as this Court has interpreted it. And the cases that set
forth our interpretation hold that an appellate court may,
in its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only
where the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an
“error”; (2) the error is “clear or obvious, rather than sub
ject to reasonable dispute”; (3) the error “affected the
appellant’s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case
means” it “affected the outcome of the district court pro
ceedings”; and (4) “the error seriously affect[s] the fair
ness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceed
