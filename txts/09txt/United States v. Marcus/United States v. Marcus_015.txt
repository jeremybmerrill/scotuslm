STEVENS, J., dissenting

sion of litigation in their respective circuits.” United
States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 745 (1993) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting). This Court’s ever more intensive efforts to
rationalize plain-error review may have been born of a
worthy instinct. But they have trapped the appellate
courts in an analytic maze that, I have increasingly come
to believe, is more liable to frustrate than to facilitate
sound decisionmaking.
The trial error at issue in this case undermined the
defendant’s substantial rights by allowing the jury to
convict him on the basis of an incorrect belief that lawful
conduct was unlawful, and it does not take an elaborate
formula to see that. Because, in my view, the Court of
Appeals properly exercised its discretion to remedy the
error and to order a retrial, I respectfully dissent.
