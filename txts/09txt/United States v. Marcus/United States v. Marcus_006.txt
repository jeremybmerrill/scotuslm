(slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also
United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731–737 (1993);
Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 466–467 (1997);
United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 631–632 (2002).
In our view, the Second Circuit’s standard is inconsis
tent with the third and the fourth criteria set forth in
these cases. The third criterion specifies that a “plain
error” must “affec[t]” the appellant’s “substantial rights.”
In the ordinary case, to meet this standard an error must
be “prejudicial,” which means that there must be a rea
sonable probability that the error affected the outcome of
the trial. Olano, supra, at 734–735 (stating that, to satisfy
the third criterion of Rule 52(b), a defendant must “nor
mally” demonstrate that the alleged error was not “harm
less”); see also United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542
U. S. 74, 83 (2004). The Court of Appeals, however, would
notice a “plain error” and set aside a conviction whenever
there exists “any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that
the jury could have convicted based exclusively on pre
enactment conduct.” 538 F. 3d, at 102 (emphasis added).
This standard is irreconcilable with our “plain error”
precedent. See, e.g., Olano, supra, at 734–735.
We recognize that our cases speak of a need for a show
ing that the error affected the “outcome of the district
court proceedings” in the “ordinary case.” Puckett, 556
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks
omitted). And we have noted the possibility that certain
errors, termed “structural errors,” might “affect substan
tial rights” regardless of their actual impact on an appel
lant’s trial. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (reserving the
question whether “structural errors” automatically satisfy
the third “plain error” criterion); Cotton, supra, at 632
(same); Johnson, supra, at 469 (same); Olano, supra, at
735 (same). But “structural errors” are “a very limited
class” of errors that affect the “ ‘framework within which
