UNITED STATES v. MARCUS
Opinion of the Court

We do not intend to trivialize the claim that respondent
here raises. Nor do we imply that the kind of error at
issue here is unimportant. But the rule that permits
courts to recognize a “plain error” does not “remove” “se
riou[s]” errors “from the ambit of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure.” Johnson, supra, at 466. Rather, the
“plain error” rule, as interpreted by this Court, sets forth
criteria that a claim of error not raised at trial must sat
isfy. The Second Circuit’s rule would require reversal
under the “plain error” standard for errors that do not
meet those criteria. We can find no good reason to treat
respondent’s claim of error differently from others. See
Puckett, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (reviewing the
Government’s violation of a plea agreement for “plain
error”); Cotton, supra, at 631–632 (reviewing an indict
ment’s failure to charge a fact that increased defendant’s
statutory maximum sentence for “plain error”); Johnson,
supra, at 464 (reviewing the failure to submit an element
of the crime to the jury for “plain error”). Hence we must
reject the Second Circuit’s rule.
For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed. As the Court of Appeals has not yet consid
ered whether the error at issue in this case satisfies this
Court’s “plain error” standard—i.e., whether the error
affects “substantial rights” and “the fairness, integrity, or
public reputation of judicial proceedings”—we remand the
case to that court so that it may do so.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
