UNITED STATES v. MARCUS
STEVENS, J., dissenting

II
The Court does not engage the merits of that judgment,
but instead remands to the Court of Appeals to apply the
test we have devised for evaluating claims of “plain error.”
That test requires lower courts to conduct four separate
inquiries, each of which requires a distinct form of judg
ment and several of which have generated significant
appellate-court dissensus; the test may also contain an
exception for “structural errors,” a category we have never
defined clearly. With great concision, the Court manages
to summarize all of these moving parts in about five
pages. Ante, at 3–8.
Yet the language of Rule 52(b) is straightforward. It
states simply: “A plain error that affects substantial rights
may be considered even though it was not brought to the
court’s attention.” This is the mirror image of Rule 52(a),
which instructs courts to disregard any error “that does
not affect substantial rights.” The Federal Rules thus set
forth a unitary standard, which turns on whether the
error in question affected substantial rights (either in a
particular defendant’s case or in the mine run of compara
ble cases), and they leave it to judges to figure out how
best to apply that standard.
In our attempt to clarify Rule 52(b), we have, I fear,
both muddied the waters and lost sight of the wisdom
embodied in the Rule’s spare text. Errors come in an
endless variety of “shapes and sizes.” Ante, at 6. Because
error-free trials are so rare, appellate courts must repeat
edly confront the question whether a trial judge’s mistake
was harmless or warrants reversal. They become familiar
with particular judges and with the vast panoply of trial
procedures, they acquire special expertise in dealing with
recurring issues, and their doctrine evolves over time to
help clarify and classify various types of mistakes. These
are just a few of the reasons why federal appellate courts
are “allowed a wide measure of discretion in the supervi
