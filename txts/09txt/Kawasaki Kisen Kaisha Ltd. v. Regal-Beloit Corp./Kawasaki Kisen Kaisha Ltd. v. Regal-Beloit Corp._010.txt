KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
Opinion of the Court

“(2) the delivering rail carrier; or
“(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route
the property is transported in the United States or
from a place in the United States to a place in an
adjacent foreign country when transported under a
through bill of lading.
“Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not af
fect the liability of a rail carrier.” 49 U. S. C. §11706;
see also §14706(a) (motor carriers).
The Carmack Amendment thus requires a rail carrier
that “receives [property] for transportation under this
part” to issue a bill of lading. §11706(a). The provision
“this part” refers to is the STB’s jurisdiction over rail
transportation within the United States. See §10501
(2006 ed. and Supp. II). The STB is the successor to the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The STB has
“exclusive” jurisdiction to regulate “transportation by rail
carriers” between places in the United States as well as
between a place “in the United States and a place in a
foreign country.” §10501(a)(2)(F), (b) (2006 ed.). Regu
lated rail carriers must provide transportation subject to
STB rail carrier jurisdiction “on reasonable request,”
§11101(a), at reasonable rates,
§§10702, 10707(b),
11101(a), (e).
In cases where it applies, Carmack imposes upon “re
ceiving rail carrier[s]” and “delivering rail carrier[s]”
liability for damage caused during the rail route under the
bill of lading, regardless of which carrier caused the dam
age. §11706(a). Carmack’s purpose is to relieve cargo
owners “of the burden of searching out a particular negli
gent carrier from among the often numerous carriers
handling an interstate shipment of goods.” Reider v.
Thompson, 339 U. S. 113, 119 (1950). To help achieve this
goal, Carmack constrains carriers’ ability to limit liability
by contract. §11706(c).
