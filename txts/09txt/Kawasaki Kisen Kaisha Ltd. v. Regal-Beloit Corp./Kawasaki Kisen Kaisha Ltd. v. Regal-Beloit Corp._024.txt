KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
Opinion of the Court

which has yet to be “ratified by the President with the
advice and consent of the Senate.” Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 11. These so-called “Rotterdam Rules”
would explicitly allow the inland leg of an international
shipment to be governed by a different legal regime than
the ocean leg, under some circumstances. See G. A. Res.
63/122, art. 26, U. N. Doc. A/RES/63/122 (Dec. 11, 2008).

Nothing in the Rotterdam Rules, however, requires every
country to mandate a different regime to govern the inland
rail leg of an international through shipment; and, as ex
plained above, Congress, by enacting COGSA, has opted for
allowing shipments governed by a single through bill. And
if the objection is that today’s decision will undermine the
results of these international negotiations in some way,
that concern is met by the fact that the United States
Government has urged the result the Court adopts today.
See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13–29.
Congress has decided to allow parties engaged in inter

carriage of goods received for domestic rail transport, onto
what are “essentially maritime” contracts. Kirby, 543

“K” Line received the goods in China, under through
bills for shipment into the United States. “K” Line was
thus not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack and was
not required to issue bills of lading under that Amend
ment. Union Pacific is also not a receiving carrier for this
carriage and was thus not required to issue Carmack
compliant bills. Because the journey included no receiving
rail carrier that had to issue bills of lading under Car
mack, Carmack does not apply. The parties’ agreement to
litigate these cases in Tokyo is binding. The cargo owners
