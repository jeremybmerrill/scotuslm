SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Line’s own bills of lading evidence this practice, providing
that, where an “applicable international convention or
national law” exists, “cannot be departed from,” and
“would have applied” if a separate contract for inland
carriage had been made between the merchant and the
inland carrier, those laws govern “K” Line’s liability. Brief
for Respondents 53.
The recently signed United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly
or Partly by Sea, also known as the “Rotterdam Rules,”
provided an opportunity for the international community
to adopt rules for multimodal shipments that would be
uniform for both the ocean and inland legs. See generally
Train Wrecks 36–39. Instead, the final version of the
Rotterdam Rules retained the current system in which the
inland leg may be governed by a different legal regime
than the ocean leg. See United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly
or Partly by Sea, G. A. Res. 63/122, art. 26, A/RES/63/122,
(Dec. 11, 2008). The Association of American Railroads
and the United States, among others, advocated for this
outcome.15 See Proposal of the United States of America
