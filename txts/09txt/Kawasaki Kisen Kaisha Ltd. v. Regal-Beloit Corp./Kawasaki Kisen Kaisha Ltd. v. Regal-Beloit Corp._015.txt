Opinion of the Court

734.
The Court’s decision in Reider v. Thompson, 339 U. S.
113, is not to the contrary. That case involved goods
originating in Argentina, bound for an inland location in
the United States. The Court in Reider determined that
because there was no through bill of lading, the original
journey from Argentina terminated at the port of New
Orleans. Thus, the first rail carrier in the United States
was the receiving rail carrier and had to issue a Carmack
bill of lading. Id., at 117. And because that carrier had to
issue a separate bill of lading, it was not liable for damage
done during the ocean-based portion of the shipment. Id.,
at 118–119. Notably, neither Mexican Light nor Reider
addressed the situation in the present cases, where the
shipment originates overseas under a through bill of lad
ing. And, for this reason, neither case discussed COGSA.
The Carmack Amendment’s second sentence establishes
when Carmack liability applies:
“[The receiving rail carrier referred to in the first sen
tence] and any other carrier that delivers the property
and is providing transportation or service subject to
the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part are liable
to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or
bill of lading.” §11706(a)
Thus, the receiving and delivering rail carriers are subject
to liability only when damage is done to this “property,”
that is to say, to property for which Carmack’s first sen
tence requires the receiving rail carrier to issue a bill of
lading. Ibid. Put another way, Carmack applies only to
transport of property for which Carmack requires a receiv
ing carrier to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether
that carrier erroneously fails to issue such a bill. See ibid.
(“Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect
the liability of a rail carrier”). The language in some of the
Courts of Appeals’ decisions, which were rejected by the
