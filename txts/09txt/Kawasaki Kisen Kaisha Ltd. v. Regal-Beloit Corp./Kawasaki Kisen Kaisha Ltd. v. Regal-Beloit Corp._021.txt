Opinion of the Court

§102(a), 109 Stat. 847–849. There is no claim that the
1995 statute altered Carmack’s text in any manner rele
vant here, as that reenactment merely indented subsec
tions of Carmack for readability. Cf. United States v.
O’Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14)
(“[C]urrent legislative drafting guidelines . . . advise draft
ers to break lengthy statutory provisions into separate
subsections that can be read more easily”).

Where the text permits, congressional enactments
should be construed to be consistent with one another.
And the interpretation of Carmack the Court now adopts
attains the most consistency between Carmack and
COGSA. First, applying Carmack to the inland segment
of an international carriage originating overseas under a
through bill would undermine Carmack’s purposes. Car
mack is premised on the view that the shipment has a
single bill of lading and any damage during the journey is
the responsibility of both the receiving and the delivering
carrier. See supra, at 6. Yet, under the Court of Appeals’
interpretation of Carmack, there would often be no venue
in which to sue the receiving carrier. See supra, at 14–15.
Applying two different bill of lading regimes to the same
through shipment would undermine COGSA and interna
tional, container-based multimodal transport. As Kirby
explained, “[t]he international transportation industry
‘clearly has moved into a new era—the age of multimo
dalism, door-to-door transport based on efficient use of all
available modes of transportation by air, water, and
land.’ ” 543 U. S., at 25 (quoting 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admi
ralty and Maritime Law 589 (4th ed. 2004)). If Carmack
applied to an inland segment of a shipment from overseas
under a through bill, then one set of liability and venue
rules would apply when cargo is damaged at sea (COGSA)
and another almost always would apply when the damage
