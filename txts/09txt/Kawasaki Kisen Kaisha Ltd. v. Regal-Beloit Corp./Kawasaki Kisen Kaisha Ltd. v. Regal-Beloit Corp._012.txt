KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
Opinion of the Court

was damaged by a domestic rail carrier during the inland
rail portion. 543 U. S., at 19–20.
Kirby held that the through bill’s terms governed under
federal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state
laws. Id., at 23–27. Kirby explained that “so long as a bill
of lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea, its
purpose is to effectuate maritime commerce.” Id., at 27.
The Court added that “[a]pplying state law to cases like
this one would undermine the uniformity of general mari
time law.” Id., at 28. “Confusion and inefficiency will
inevitably result if more than one body of law governs a
given contract’s meaning.” Id., at 29. The Court noted
that its conclusion “reinforce[d] the liability regime Con
gress established in COGSA,” and explained that COGSA
allows parties to extend its terms to an inland portion of a
journey under a through bill of lading. Ibid. Finally, the
Court concluded that a contrary holding would defeat “the
apparent purpose of COGSA, to facilitate efficient con
tracting in contracts for carriage by sea.” Ibid.
Much of what the Court said in Kirby applies to the
present cases. “K” Line issued the through bills under
COGSA, in maritime commerce. Congress considered
such international through bills and decided to permit
parties to extend COGSA’s terms to the inland domestic
segment of the journey. The cargo owners and “K” Line
did exactly that in these cases, agreeing in the through
bills to require that any suit be brought in Tokyo.
IV
The cargo owners argue that the Carmack Amendment,
which has its own venue provisions and was not discussed
in Kirby, requires a different result. In particular they
argue that Carmack applies to the domestic inland seg
ment of the carriage here, so the Tokyo forum-selection
clause is inapplicable. For the reasons set forth below,
this contention must be rejected. Instructed by the text,
