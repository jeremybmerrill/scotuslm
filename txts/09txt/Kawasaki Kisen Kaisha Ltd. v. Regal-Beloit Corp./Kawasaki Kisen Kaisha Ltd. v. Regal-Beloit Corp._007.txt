Opinion of the Court

parties that sign subcontracts to perform services contem
plated by the bills. See id., at 20, and n. 2. Second, the
bills permit “K” Line “to sub-contract on any terms what
soever” for the completion of the journey. App. 145.
Third, the bills provide that COGSA’s terms govern the
entire journey. Fourth, the bills require that any dispute
will be governed by Japanese law. Fifth, the bills state
that any action relating to the carriage must be brought in
“Tokyo District Court in Japan.” Id., at 144. The forum
selection provision in the last clause gives rise to the
dispute here.
“K” Line, pursuant to the bills of lading, arranged for
the entire journey. It subcontracted with petitioner in No.
08–1554, Union Pacific Railroad Company, for rail ship
ment in the United States. The goods were to be shipped
in a “K” Line vessel to a port in Long Beach, California,
and then transferred to Union Pacific for rail carriage to
the final destinations.
In March and April 2005, the cargo owners brought four
different container shipments to “K” Line vessels in Chi
nese ports. All parties seem to assume that “K” Line
safely transported the cargo across the Pacific Ocean to
California. The containers were then loaded onto a Union
Pacific train and that train, or some other train operated
by Union Pacific, derailed in Tyrone, Oklahoma, allegedly
destroying the cargo.
The cargo owners filed four separate lawsuits in the
Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The
suit named “K” Line and Union Pacific as defendants.
Union Pacific removed the suits to the United States
District Court for the Central District of California. Union
Pacific and “K” Line then moved to dismiss based on the
parties’ Tokyo forum-selection clause. The District Court
granted the motion to dismiss. It decided that the forum
selection clause was reasonable and applied to Union
Pacific pursuant to the Himalaya Clause in “K” Line’s bills
