sive use in interchanging cargo with rail and motor carri­
ers providing inland transportation.’ ” Joint Application of
CSX Corp. & Sea-Land Corp. Under 49 U. S. C. §11321, 3
I. C. C. 2d 512, 519 (1987).1
The jurisdictional provisions of the ICA and the Ship­
ping Act of 1984, 46 U. S. C. §40101 et seq., confirm my
view that “K” Line is not a rail carrier “subject to the
jurisdiction of the Board,” 49 U. S. C. §11706(a), under
Carmack. The STB’s jurisdiction over transportation by
rail carriers is “exclusive,” §10501(b), while ocean carriers
are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime
Commission (FMC), 46 U. S. C. §40102; see also 46 CFR
§520.1 (2009). In addition, the Board’s jurisdiction over
water carriage is limited to domestic water carriage. 49
U. S. C. §13521(a)(3). The Board itself has concluded that
ocean carriers providing intermodal transportation jointly
with inland rail and motor carriers are subject to the
FMC’s jurisdiction rather than its own. See Improvement
of TOFC/COFC Regulations, 3 I. C. C. 2d 869, 883 (1987).
For these reasons, Carmack governs Union Pacific but
not “K” Line for the inland transportation at issue in these
cases.

In finding Carmack inapplicable to the inland transpor­
tation in these cases, the majority relies on the fact that
Carmack does not govern ocean carriers such as “K” Line.
While I agree that “K” Line is not a rail carrier, the major­
ity places too much weight on that determination. That
the ocean carrier “K” Line is not subject to Carmack does
not affect the determination that the rail carrier Union
Pacific is, for the textual reasons I have explained. The

I do not think that “K” Line conducts rail operations at all,
I would not reach the question whether “K” Line holds itself out as
offering rail common carriage. Compare Brief for Respondents 84–85,
