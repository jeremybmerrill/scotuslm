Opinion of the Court

Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528, 537–
539 (1995). By its terms, COGSA only applies to ship
ments from United States ports to ports of foreign coun
tries and vice versa. §§1(e), 13, at 1178, 1180. The stat
ute, however, allows parties “the option of extending
[certain COGSA terms] by contract” to cover “the entire
period in which [the goods] would be under [a carrier’s]
responsibility, including [a] period of . . . inland transport.”
Kirby, 543 U. S., at 29 (citing COGSA §7, at 1180). Ocean
carriers, who often must issue COGSA bills of lading, are
regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission (Maritime
Commission), which is responsible for oversight over
“common carriage of goods by water in . . . foreign com
merce.” 46 U. S. C. §40101(1).

lading issued by domestic rail carriers. Carmack was first
enacted in 1906 as an amendment to the Interstate Com
merce Act, 24 Stat. 379. The Carmack Amendment has
been altered and recodified over the last century. It now
provides, in relevant part, as follows:
“(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service
subject to the jurisdiction of the [Surface Transporta
tion Board (STB)] under this part shall issue a receipt
or bill of lading for property it receives for transporta
tion under this part. That rail carrier and any other
carrier that delivers the property and is providing
transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of
the [STB] under this part are liable to the person enti
tled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The
liability imposed under this subsection is for the ac
