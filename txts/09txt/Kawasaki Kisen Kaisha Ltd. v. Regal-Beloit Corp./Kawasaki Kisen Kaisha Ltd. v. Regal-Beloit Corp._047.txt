KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

the wrong lesson from Kirby. In that case, we were con­
cerned about displacing a single federal law, COGSA, with
50 varying state liability regimes.14 543 U. S., at 28–29.
The rule the Court establishes today creates even greater
practical difficulties than the regime we criticized in Kirby
by displacing Carmack with as many liability rules as
there are bills of lading. It would even permit different
liability rules to apply to different lawsuits arising out of
the same inland accident depending on where each piece
of cargo originated. Contrary to the Court’s view, then,
the value of uniformity articulated in Kirby is best pro­
moted by application of Carmack to the obligations of the
rail carrier during the inland leg in these cases. Cf. ante,
at 7–8, 17–18.
Finally, while purporting to effectuate the contractual
choices of the parties in the international multimodal
shipping industry, ante, at 17–20, the Court ignores the
realities of the industry’s operation. The industry has long
been accustomed to drafting bills of lading that encompass
two legal regimes, one governing ocean transportation and
another governing inland transportation, given mandatory
law governing road and rail carriage in most of Europe
and in certain countries in Asia and North Africa. See
generally Convention on the Contract for the International
Carriage of Goods by Road, May 19, 1956, 399 U. N. T. S.
189; Uniform Rules Concerning the Contract for Interna­
tional Carriage of Goods by Rail, App. B to the Convention
Concerning International Carriage by Rail, May 9, 1980,

fication of the Convention Concerning International Car­
riage of Rail of May 9, 1980, June 3, 1999. Indeed, “K”

inland leg of a multimodal international shipment traveling on a
through bill of lading because that question was not presented. Brief
