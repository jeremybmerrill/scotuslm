KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Union). Thus, the Court’s mistaken interpretation not
only upsets domestic law but also disregards industry
practice as evidenced by carefully calibrated international
negotiations.16

Because, in my view, Carmack provides the default legal
regime governing the relationship between the rail carrier
and the ocean carrier during the inland leg of a multimo­
dal shipment traveling on a through bill of lading, I would
reach the second question presented by these cases:
whether the parties validly contracted out of Carmack. I
would hold that where, as here, the STB has exempted rail
carriers from Part A of the ICA pursuant to its authority
as set forth in 49 U. S. C. §10502, such rail carriers may
not use §10709 to opt out of Carmack entirely. Instead,
such rail carriers must first offer their contractual coun­
terparties Carmack-compliant terms for liability and
claims, as §10502(e) requires. Having reached that con­
clusion, I would remand for consideration of whether the
requirements of §10502(e) were met in these cases. I set
forth these views only briefly, as the Court’s determina­
tion that Carmack does not apply at all makes resolution
of these questions moot.

rail leg of an international through shipment” is irrelevant. Ante, at 20.
The Rotterdam Rules demonstrate simply that it is common practice to
have different regimes for inland and ocean transportation, so giving
full effect to Carmack as the default law governing the relationship
between “K” Line and Union Pacific can hardly be said to “undermine
COGSA and international, container-based multimodal transport,”
ante, at 17.
