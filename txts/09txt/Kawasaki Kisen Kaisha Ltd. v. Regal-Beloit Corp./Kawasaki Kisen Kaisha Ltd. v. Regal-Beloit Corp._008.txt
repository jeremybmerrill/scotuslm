KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
Opinion of the Court

of lading. 462 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1102–1103 (2006).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir
cuit reversed and remanded. 557 F. 3d 985 (2009). The
court concluded that the Carmack Amendment applied to
the inland portion of an international shipment under a
through bill of lading and thus trumped the parties’ fo
rum-selection clause. Id., at 994–995. The court noted
that this view was consistent with the position taken by
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see id., at 994
(citing Sompo Japan Ins. Co. of Am. v. Union Pacific R.
Co., 456 F. 3d 54 (2006)), but inconsistent with the views
of the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh,
and Eleventh Circuits, see 557 F. 3d, at 994 (citing Shao v.
Link Cargo (Taiwan) Ltd., 986 F. 2d 700 (CA4 1993);
American Road Serv. Co. v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 348
F. 3d 565 (CA6 2003); Capitol Converting Equip., Inc. v.
LEP Transp., Inc., 965 F. 2d 391 (CA7 1992); Altadis USA,
Inc. ex rel. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Sea Star Line, LLC,
458 F. 3d 1288 (CA11 2006)). This Court granted certio
rari to address whether Carmack applies to the inland
segment of an overseas import shipment under a through
bill of lading. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).

A

Before turning to Carmack, a brief description of
COGSA is in order; for “K” Line’s and Union Pacific’s
primary contention is that COGSA, not Carmack, controls.
COGSA governs the terms of bills of lading issued by
ocean carriers engaged in foreign trade. 49 Stat. 1207, as
amended, note following 46 U. S. C. §30701, p. 1178. It
requires each carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill that
contains certain terms. §3(3)–(8), at 1178–1179. Although
COGSA imposes some limitations on the parties’ authority
to adjust liability, it does not limit the parties’ ability to
adopt forum-selection clauses. See Vimar Seguros y
