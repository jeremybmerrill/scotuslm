SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

use of the word “requirements,” instead of the statutory
term “provision,” in the exemption order.
The Government aptly describes the policy concerns
that justify this reading of the interplay between §§10502
and 10709. Brief for United States 31–32. Because a rail
carrier’s counterparty to a §10709 contract can ordinarily
require a rail carrier to comply with common carriage
rates and terms under Part A (including Carmack), such
counterparties possess considerable bargaining power.
But rail carriers the Board has exempted from Part A
under §10502 lack any obligation to comply with that
Part. If exempt carriers could escape Carmack’s obliga­
tions under §10709, their counterparties would be at a
significant disadvantage as compared to counterparties to
contracts with nonexempt carriers. Such a disadvantage
cannot be squared with Congress’ evident intent, as ex­
pressed in §10502(e), to ensure that no carrier may be
automatically exempted from Carmack.
This interpretation of §§10502 and 10709 imposes no
unfairness on exempt rail carriers. As the Court of Ap­
peals explained, “carriers providing exempt transportation
gain the benefits of deregulation, but lose the opportunity
to contract for preferable terms under §10709 without first
offering Carmack terms.” 557 F. 3d 985, 1002 (CA9 2009).
Given rail carriers’ ability to charge higher rates for full
Carmack coverage, see New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. v.
Nothnagle, 346 U. S. 128, 135 (1953), and the likelihood
that some counterparties will agree to reject Carmack­
compliant terms in favor of a lower price, such a trade-off
makes eminent sense.

Whether Union Pacific properly contracted out of Car­
mack under §10502(e) requires a factual determination
better suited for resolution by the District Court in the
first instance. Accordingly, I would remand for considera­
