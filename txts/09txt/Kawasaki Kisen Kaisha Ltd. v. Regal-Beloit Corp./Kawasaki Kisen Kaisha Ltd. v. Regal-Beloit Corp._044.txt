SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

the United States.12 It does not require the rail carrier to
offer Carmack-compliant terms to anyone but the party
with whom the rail carrier contracts when it receives the
goods. It does not place obligations on the relationship
between any overseas carrier and any overseas shipper
who operate under their own bill of lading. That Congress
expected different liability regimes to govern ocean and
rail carriers can be inferred from the different regulatory
oversight provided for each type of carrier—the FMC for
the former, the STB for the latter, see supra, at 8.
Moreover, that Carmack provides certain greater pro­
tections than does COGSA demonstrates that one of Car­
mack’s purposes—beyond simply the fact of a single bill of
lading governing all rail transportation—was to specify a
protective liability regime for that part of the shipment
only. As compared to COGSA, Carmack provides height­
ened liability rules for rail transportation, compare
COGSA §4, 49 Stat. 1207, note following 46 U. S. C.
§30701, p. 1179, with 49 U. S. C. §§11706(a)–(c); stricter
venue requirements, compare Vimar Seguros y Reasegu
ros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528, 535 (1995),
with §11706(d); and more generous time allowances for
filing suit, compare COGSA §3(6), at 1179, with §11706(e).
Congress is evidently wary of creating broad exemptions
from Carmack’s regime: While Congress has given expan­
sive authority to the STB to deregulate carriers from the
requirements of the ICA, it has precluded the STB from
excusing carriers from complying with Carmack. See
infra, at 25 (discussing §10502). By taking Carmack’s
protections out of the picture for goods that travel by rail
in the United States whenever the goods first traveled by
ocean liner, it is the Court that “undermine[s] Carmack’s
purposes,” ante, at 17. Cf. Reider, 339 U. S., at 119 (apply­

12 A separate version of Carmack applies to motor and other nonrail
carriers within the United States. See supra, at 15, n. 8.
