KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
Opinion of the Court

Congress enacted Carmack in 1906, as an amendment
to the Interstate Commerce Act. At that time, the amend
ment’s provisions applied only to “property for transporta
tion from a point in one State to a point in another State.”
§7, 34 Stat. 595. Congress amended Carmack in 1915, §1,
38 Stat. 1197, and the relevant language remained un
changed until Carmack was recodified in 1978. Under the
pre-1978 language, Carmack’s bill of lading provisions
applied not only to wholly domestic rail transport but also
to cargo “receive[d] . . . for transportation” “from any point
in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign
country.” 49 U. S. C. §20(11) (1976 ed.).
Even if there could be some argument that the Carmack
Amendment before 1978 applied to imports from Canada
and Mexico because the phrase “from . . . to” could also
mean “between,” cf. Reider, supra, at 118 (explicitly not
deciding this issue), the Court is unaware of any authority
holding that the Carmack Amendment before 1978 applied
to cargo originating from nonadjacent overseas countries
under a through bill. See, e.g., In re The Cummins
Amendment, 33 I. C. C. 682, 693 (1915); Brief for Respon
dents 8 (effectively conceding this point).
In 1978, Congress adopted the Carmack Amendment in
largely its current form. §1, 92 Stat. 1337. Congress in
the statute itself stated that it was recodifying Carmack
and instructed that this recodification “may not be con
strued as making a substantive change in the la[w].”
§3(a), id., at 1466; see Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Okla
homa Tax Comm’n, 481 U. S. 454, 457, n. 1 (1987). By
interpreting the current version of the Carmack Amend
ment to cover cargo originating overseas, the Court of
Appeals disregarded this direction and dramatically ex
panded Carmack’s scope beyond its historical coverage.
Finally, in 1995, Congress reenacted Carmack. But that
reenactment evidenced no intent to affect the substantive
change that Court of Appeals’ decision would entail. See
