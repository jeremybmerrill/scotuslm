APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[June 21, 2010]

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
These cases concern through bills of lading covering
cargo for the entire course of shipment, beginning in a
foreign, overseas country and continuing to a final, inland
destination in the United States. The voyage here in
cluded ocean transit followed by transfer to a rail carrier
in this country. The Court addressed similar factual
circumstances in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. James N.
Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14 (2004). In that case the
terms of a through bill were controlled by federal maritime
law and by a federal statute known as the Carriage of
Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), note following 46 U. S. C.
§30701. Kirby held that bill of lading provisions permissi
ble under COGSA can be invoked by a domestic rail car
rier, despite contrary state law.
