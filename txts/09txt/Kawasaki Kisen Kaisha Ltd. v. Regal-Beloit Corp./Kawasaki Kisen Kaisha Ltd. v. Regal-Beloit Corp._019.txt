Opinion of the Court

against either a delivering carrier or any carrier that
caused the damage, by contrast, may be brought in vari
ous other districts. See §11706(d)(2)(B), (C). “[J]udicial
district” refers to “district court of the United States or in
a State Court.” §11706(d)(1). Carmack’s venue provisions
presume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in
a judicial district within the United States. Here, the
journey’s “point of origin” was China, so Carmack’s venue
provisions reinforce the interpretation that Carmack does
not apply to this carriage.
Indeed, if “K” Line were a receiving carrier in a case
where the journey’s “point of origin” was China, there
would be no place under Carmack to sue “K” Line, since
China is not within a judicial district “of the United States
or in a State court.” Ibid. Carmack’s original premise is
that the receiving carrier is liable for damage caused by
the other carriers in the delivery chain. This premise
would be defeated if there were no venue in which to sue
the receiving rail carrier, as opposed to suing a different
carrier under one of Carmack’s other venue provisions and
then naming the receiving carrier as a codefendant. The
far more likely conclusion is that “K” Line is not a receiv
ing rail carrier at all under Carmack, and thus Carmack,
including its venue provisions, does not apply to property
shipped under “K” Line’s through bills. True, if the sole
question were one of venue, suit could still be brought
against the carrier that caused the damage or the deliver
ing carrier. But the issue need not be explored here, for,
as the Court holds, Carmack is inapplicable in these cases.
B
Carmack’s statutory history supports the conclusion
that it does not apply to a shipment originating overseas
under a through bill. None of Carmack’s legislative ver
sions have applied to the inland domestic rail segment of
an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.
