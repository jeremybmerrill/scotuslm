KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
Syllabus
§11706(d)(1). Pp. 8–15.
(2) Carmack’s statutory history supports this conclusion. None of
its legislative versions—the original 1906 statute or the amended
1915, 1978, or 1995 ones—have applied to the inland domestic rail
segment of an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.
Pp. 15–17.
(3) This interpretation also attains the most consistency between
Carmack and COGSA. Applying Carmack to the inland segment of
an international carriage originating overseas under a through bill
would undermine Carmack’s purposes, which are premised on the
view that a shipment has a single bill of lading and any damage is
the responsibility of both receiving and delivering carriers. Under
the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation, there might be no venue in which
to sue the receiving carrier. That interpretation would also under
mine COGSA and international, container-based multimodal trans
port: COGSA’s liability and venue rules would apply when cargo is
damaged at sea and Carmack’s rules almost always would apply
when the damage occurs on land. Moreover, applying Carmack to in
ternational import shipping transport would undermine COGSA’s
purpose “to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by
sea.” Kirby, supra, at 29. The cargo owners’ contrary policy argu
ments are unavailing. Pp. 17–20.

C. J., and SCALIA, THOMAS, BREYER, and ALITO, JJ., joined. SOTOMAYOR,
