Opinion of the Court

Carmack also limits the parties’ ability to choose the
venue of their suit:
“(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be
brought in a district court of the United States or in a
State court.
“(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be
brought—
“(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judi
cial district in which the point of origin is located;
“(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judi
cial district in which the principal place of business
of the person bringing the action is located if the de
livering carrier operates a railroad or a route
through such judicial district, or in the judicial dis
trict in which the point of destination is located; and
“(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the
loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such
loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.” §11706.
For purposes of these cases, it can be assumed that if
Carmack’s terms apply to the bills of lading here, the
cargo owners would have a substantial argument that the
Tokyo forum-selection clause in the bills is pre-empted by
Carmack’s venue provisions. The parties argue about
whether they may contract out of Carmack’s venue provi
sions and other requirements, see §§10502, 10709; but in
light of the disposition and ruling to follow, those matters
need not be discussed or further explored.

under a Himalaya Clause. There, as here, the property
