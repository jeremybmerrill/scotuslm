SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

1978 version of Carmack and my reading of the current
text. The pre-1978 text referred to a carrier “receiving
property for transportation from a point in one State or
Territory or the District of Columbia to a point in another
State, Territory, [or the] District of Columbia, or from any
point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign
country.” 49 U. S. C. §20(11) (1976).9 A rail carrier like
Union Pacific who receives property in California for
transportation to locations in the American midwest “re­
ceiv[es] property from a point in one State . . . to a point in
another State,” regardless of whether the property origi­
nated in California or China. The geographical restriction
“from any point in the United States to a point in an adja­
cent foreign country” simply reflected agreements between
the ICC and its Canadian counterpart to respect each
other’s regulation of rail carriage originating in that coun­
try. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae (herein­
after Brief for United States) 17–18. It does not indicate
any rejection of Carmack’s applicability to imports as a
whole or exports to a nonadjacent foreign country.10 In­

9 The

pre-1978 version of Carmack referred generally to a “carrier,”
rather than a “rail carrier.” It was not until 1995 that Congress distin­
guished between Carmack’s applicability to rail carriers, §11706, and
motor carriers, freight forwarders, and domestic water carriers, §14706.
Pub. L. No. 104–88, §102(a), 109 Stat. 803, 847–849, 907–910.
10 The Court ignores a further reason to believe that prior to 1978,
Carmack could be understood to apply to imports as well as exports.
Even assuming (contrary to my view) that the relevant language in
Carmack governing any international commercial exchange was the
phrase “from any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent
foreign country,” the seemingly uni-directional “from . . . to” could
reasonably have been interpreted as also encompassing “to . . . from” in
light of our decision in Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Woodbury, 254
U. S. 357 (1920). In that case, this Court interpreted similar “from . . .
to” language in the jurisdictional section of the ICA as conferring
jurisdiction on the ICC over all transportation between such countries.
Id., at 359–360 (construing “ ‘transportation . . . from any place in the
United States to an adjacent foreign country’ ” in former 49 U. S. C. §1
