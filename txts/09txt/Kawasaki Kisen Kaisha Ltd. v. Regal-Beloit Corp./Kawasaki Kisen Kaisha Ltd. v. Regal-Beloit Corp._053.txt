KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

tion of that issue. Cf. 557 F. 3d, at 1003. Union Pacific
also raises a related legal argument not decided by the
courts below: that the forum selection clause at issue in
these cases is valid because venue is not encompassed
within the phrase “contractual terms for liability and
claims” in §10502(e). To the extent this argument is not
waived, it would also be properly considered on remand.

In endorsing a strained reading of the text, history, and
purpose of Carmack, the Court is evidently concerned with
a perceived need to enforce the COGSA-based contracts
that the “sophisticated cargo owners” here made with “K”
Line. Ante, at 18. But these cases do not require the
Court to interpret or examine the contract between the
cargo owners and “K” Line. The Court need consider only
the legal relationship between Union Pacific and “K” Line
as its direct contracting party. As to that relationship, it
bears emphasizing that industry actors on all sides are
sophisticated and can easily adapt to a regime in which
Carmack provides the default rule governing the rail
carrier’s liability during the inland leg of a multimodal
shipment traveling on an international through bill of
lading. See, e.g., Train Wrecks 40 (describing how ocean
and rail carriers have drafted their contracts to account
for—and permissibly escape—Carmack’s applicability); cf.
Kirby, 543 U. S., at 36 (recognizing that “our decision does
no more than provide a legal backdrop against which
future bills of lading will be negotiated”). In disregarding
Congress’ commands in both Carmack and COGSA and in
discounting the practical realities reflected in the Rotter­
dam Rules and other international conventions governing
the carriage of goods, the Court ignores what we acknowl­
edged in Kirby: “It is not . . . this Court’s task to structure
the international shipping industry.” Ibid. I respectfully
dissent.
