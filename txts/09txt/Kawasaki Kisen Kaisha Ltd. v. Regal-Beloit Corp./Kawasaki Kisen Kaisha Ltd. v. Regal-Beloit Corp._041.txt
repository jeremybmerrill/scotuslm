KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

stead, the “adjacent foreign country” provision was expan­
sive rather than limiting, ensuring that Carmack would
apply where a shipment traveled by rail from New York
City through to Montreal without stopping at the border of
Canada.
Third, to the extent there are meaningful differences
between the pre-1978 text of Carmack and its current text,
it is the current text that we should interpret, regardless
of Congress’ general hortatory statement in the 1978
Public Law applicable to the entire ICA. As we have often
observed, “[a] specific provision controls one of more gen­
eral application.” Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S.
395, 407 (1991). The general statement that Congress
intended no change to the ICA should not require us to
ignore what the current text of the specific Carmack pro­
vision says, as both Union Pacific and “K” Line explicitly
ask us to do. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 08–1554, at 20
(“The Pre-1978 Statutory Language Controls This Case”);
Brief for Petitioners in No. 08–1553, at 41–49 (arguing for
reliance on pre-1978 text). Petitioners’ view of statutory
interpretation would give rise to an unwieldy—and un­
just—system. I would have thought it beyond cavil that
litigants are entitled to rely on the currently applicable
version of enacted statutes to determine their rights and
obligations.
In the final analysis, the meaning of the pre-1978 lan­
——————
to include “transportation . . . from that country to the United States”).
Given the “presumption that a given term is used to mean the same
thing throughout a statute,” Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118
(1994) (citing Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S.
427 (1932)), our construction of “from . . . to” in the ICA’s jurisdictional
provision could reasonably have been read to sweep imports within the
scope of Carmack. I would not, however, read “from . . . to” in the
current version of §11706(a)(3) to encompass “to . . . from,” as Congress
specifically amended the similar language in the jurisdictional provi­
sion at §10501(a)(2) to “between” while leaving intact the “to . . . from”
in Carmack, against the background of Woodbury.
