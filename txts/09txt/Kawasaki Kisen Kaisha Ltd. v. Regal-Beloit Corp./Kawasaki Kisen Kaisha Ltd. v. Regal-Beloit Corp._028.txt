SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

“(2) the delivering rail carrier; or
“(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route the
property is transported in the United States or from
a place in the United States to a place in an adja­
cent foreign country when transported under a
through bill of lading.
“Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not af­
fect the liability of a rail carrier. A delivering rail car­
rier is deemed to be the rail carrier performing the
line-haul transportation nearest the destination but
does not include a rail carrier providing only a switch­
ing service at the destination.”
With respect to the Board’s jurisdiction, §10501(a) pro­
vides as follows:
“(1) Subject to this chapter, the Board has jurisdic­
tion over transportation by rail carrier that is—
“(A) only by railroad; or
“(B) by railroad and water, when the transporta­
tion is under common control, management, or ar­
rangement for a continuous carriage or shipment.
“(2) Jurisdiction under paragraph (1) applies only to
transportation in the United States between a place
in—
“(A) a State and a place in the same or another
State as part of the interstate rail network;
.
.
.
.
.
“(E) the United States and another place in the
United States through a foreign country; or
“(F) the United States and a place in a foreign
country.”

practically compels the conclusion that the Carmack
Amendment applies in a typical multimodal carriage case
