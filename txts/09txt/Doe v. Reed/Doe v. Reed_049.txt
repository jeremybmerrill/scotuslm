JOHN DOE #1, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. SAM REED, 

WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.
Just as “[c]onfidence in the integrity of our electoral
processes is essential to the functioning of our participa
tory democracy,” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 4 (2006)
(per curiam), so too is citizen participation in those proc
esses, which necessarily entails political speech and asso
ciation under the First Amendment. In my view, com
pelled disclosure of signed referendum and initiative
petitions1 under the Washington Public Records Act
(PRA), Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001, et seq. (2008), severely
burdens those rights and chills citizen participation in the
referendum process. Given those burdens, I would hold
that Washington’s decision to subject all referendum
petitions to public disclosure is unconstitutional because
there will always be a less restrictive means by which
Washington can vindicate its stated interest in preserving
the integrity of its referendum process. I respectfully
dissent.

1 Generally speaking, in a referendum, voters approve or reject an Act
already passed by the legislature. In an initiative, voters adopt or
reject an entirely new law, either a statute or a constitutional amend
ment. See T. Cronin, Direct Democracy: The Politics of Initiative,
Referendum, and Recall 2 (1989).
