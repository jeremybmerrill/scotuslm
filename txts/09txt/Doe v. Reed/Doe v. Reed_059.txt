THOMAS, J., dissenting

the secretary’s decision to certify (or not to certify) a refer
endum petition, §29A.72.240, Washington thus appears to
provide even more of the “less problematic measures” than
Colorado did to “protect the integrity of the initiative
process,” ACLF, supra, at 204, and I see no reason why
Washington’s identical provisions should not “inform” the
analysis here.
It is readily apparent that Washington can vindicate its
stated interest in “transparency and accountability”
through a number of more narrowly tailored means than
wholesale public disclosure. Accordingly, this interest
cannot justify applying the PRA to a referendum petition.

Washington also contends that it has a compelling
interest in “providing relevant information to Washington
voters,” and that on-demand disclosure to the public is a
narrowly tailored means of furthering that interest. Brief
for Respondent Reed 44. This argument is easily dis
patched, since this Court has already rejected it in a simi
lar context.
In McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334
(1995), the Court held that an Ohio law prohibiting
anonymous political pamphleting violated the First
Amendment. One of the interests Ohio had invoked to
justify that law was identical to Washington’s here: the
“interest in providing the electorate with relevant infor
mation.” Id., at 348. The Court called that interest
“plainly insufficient to support the constitutionality of
[Ohio’s] disclosure requirement.” Id., at 349. “The simple
interest in providing voters with additional relevant in
formation does not justify a state requirement that a
writer make statements or disclosures she would other
wise omit.” Id., at 348. “Don’t underestimate the common
man,” we advised. Id., at 348, n. 11 (internal quotation
marks omitted).
