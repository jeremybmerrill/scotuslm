THOMAS, J., dissenting

associational rights, and a long, unbroken line of this
Court’s precedents holds that privacy of association is
protected under the First Amendment. See supra, at 4–5.
The loss of associational privacy that comes with disclos
ing referendum petitions to the general public under the
PRA constitutes the same harm as to each signer of each
referendum, regardless of the topic. To be sure, a referen
dum signer may be more willing to disclose to the general
public his political association with persons signing cer
tain referendum measures than his association with oth
ers. But that choice belongs to the voter; the State may
not make it for him by ascribing a lower level of First
Amendment protection to an associational interest that
some think a voter may be (or should be) more willing to
disclose. Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of
Va., 515 U. S. 819, 828 (1995) (“In the realm of private
speech or expression, government regulation may not
favor one speaker over another”).
Finally, the less restrictive means available to vindicate
Washington’s transparency and accountability interest
can be employed for all referendum measures, regardless
of topic. There is nothing measure-specific about an elec
tronic database or additional observers. And the forgery
prohibition and other existing requirements in Washing
ton law that help “protect the integrity of the initiative
process,” ACLF, 525 U. S., at 204, apply equally to all
referendum measures.
Because the strength of Washington’s interest in trans
parency and a signer’s individual First Amendment inter
est in privacy of political association remain constant
across all referendum topics, and because less restrictive
means to protect the integrity of the referendum process
are not topic specific, I would hold that on-demand public
disclosure of referendum petitions under the PRA is not
narrowly tailored for any referendum.
