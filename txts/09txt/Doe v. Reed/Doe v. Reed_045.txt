J. Wise, The End of An Era 55–56 (1899)).

Thirteen States, 1776–1789, p. 101 (1982) (Dinkin).
Although there was variation, the election official would
ordinarily compile a poll with the name and residence of
each voter, and the name of the candidate for whom he
voted. See C. Bishop, History of Elections in the American
Colonies 160–64 (1893) (Bishop); P. Argersinger, Struc
ture, Process, and Party: Essays in American Political
History 47 (1992) (Argersinger). To prevent fraud, the
Colonies in Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey
adopted the English rule that “copies of the poll must be
delivered on demand to persons who were willing to pay a
reasonable charge for the labor of writing them.” Bishop

of the poll, ibid., and required the legislature to examine
the poll in a contested election, id., at 188–189. Thus, as

identifying information about who voted and for which
candidate, it also disclosed that information to the public.
Any suggestion that viva voce voting infringed the ac
cepted understanding of the pre-existing freedom of
speech to which the First Amendment’s text refers is
refuted by the fact that several state constitutions that
required or authorized viva voce voting also explicitly
guaranteed the freedom of speech. See, e.g., Ky. Const.,
Art. X, §7, Art. VI, §16 (1799); Ill. Const., Art. VIII, §22,
Art. I, §28 (1818). Surely one constitutional provision did
not render the other invalid.
Of course the practice of viva voce voting was gradually
replaced with the paper ballot, which was thought to
reduce fraud and undue influence. See Evans 1–6; Dinkin
101–106. There is no indication that the shift resulted
from a sudden realization that public voting infringed
