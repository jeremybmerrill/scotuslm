THOMAS, J., dissenting

thus limiting [the] ability to make the matter the focus of
statewide discussion.” Meyer, 486 U. S., at 423. Such
restrictions “inevitabl[y] . . . reduc[e] the total quantum of
speech on a public issue.” Ibid. The very public that the
PRA is supposed to serve is thus harmed by the way
Washington implements that statute here.

Petitioners do not argue that the Constitution gives
supporters of referendum petitions a right to act without
anyone knowing their identities. Thus, Washington’s
requirements that referendum supporters sign their
names and addresses to a referendum petition, and that
this information be disclosed to the State for canvassing
and verification, see Wash. Rev. Code §29A.72.230, are not
at issue. And, petitioners do not contend that Washing
ton’s citizens may never obtain access to referendum data.
Thus, Washington’s rules allowing access to at least two
representative observers from each side, see ibid., and
authorizing courts to review the secretary of state’s verifi
cation and canvassing decision if those observers are
dissatisfied with the secretary’s decision, see §29A.72.240,
are also not in question.
The Court is asked to assess the constitutionality of the
PRA only with regard to referendum petitions. The ques
tion before us is whether all signers of all referendum
petitions must resort to “substantial litigation over an
extended time,” Citizens United, supra, at ___ (slip op., at
9), to prevent Washington from trenching on their pro
tected First Amendment rights by subjecting their refer
endum-petition signatures to on-demand public disclosure.
In my view, they need not.
