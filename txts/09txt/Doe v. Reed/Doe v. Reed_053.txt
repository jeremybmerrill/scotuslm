THOMAS, J., dissenting

the First Amendment. Citizens Against Rent Control,
supra, at 295 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 15
(1976) (per curiam)).
This Court has long recognized the “vital relationship
between” political association “and privacy in one’s asso
ciations,” NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.
449, 462 (1958), and held that “[t]he Constitution protects
against the compelled disclosure of political associations
and beliefs,” Brown v. Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign
Comm. (Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 91 (1982). This constitutional
protection “yield[s] only to a subordinating interest of the
State that is compelling, and then only if there is a sub
stantial relation between the information sought and an
overriding and compelling state interest.” Id., at 91–92
(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omit
ted). Thus, unlike the Court, I read our precedents to
require application of strict scrutiny to laws that compel
disclosure of protected First Amendment association.
Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc.,
525 U. S. 182, 206, 212 (1999) (ACLF) (THOMAS, J., con
curring in judgment). Under that standard, a disclosure
requirement passes constitutional muster only if it is
narrowly tailored—i.e., the least restrictive means—to
serve a compelling state interest. See id., at 206.
B
Washington’s application of the PRA to a referendum
petition does not survive strict scrutiny.

Washington first contends that it has a compelling
interest in “transparency and accountability,” which it
claims encompasses several subordinate interests: pre
serving the integrity of its election process, preventing
corruption, deterring fraud, and correcting mistakes by
the secretary of state or by petition signers. See Brief for
