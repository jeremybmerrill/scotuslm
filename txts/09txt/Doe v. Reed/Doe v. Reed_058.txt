DOE v. REED
THOMAS, J., dissenting

First, it is a crime in Washington to forge a signature on a
referendum petition, or to knowingly sign one more than
once. See §29A.84.230. Second, referendum supporters
must gather a large number of valid signatures—four
percent of the votes cast for Governor in the immediately
preceding gubernatorial election—to place a referendum
petition on the ballot. §29A.72.150. Third, Washington’s
required referendum petition form limits each petition to a
single subject. See §29A.72.130. Fourth, a large, plainEnglish warning must appear at the top of the referendum
petition, alerting signers to the law’s requirements. See
§29A.72.140. Fifth, Washington prescribes the text of the
declaration that a circulator must submit along with the
signed petition sheets. See §29A.72.130. Sixth, Washing

§29A.72.230.
The Court’s dismissive treatment of those provisions,
see ante, at 9, is perplexing, given the analysis that the
Court endorsed in ACLF. There, the Court held that two
disclosure requirements governing Colorado’s initiative
process were unconstitutional, see 525 U. S., at 186–187,
specifically finding that they were “not warranted by the
state interests (administrative efficiency, fraud detection,
informing voters) alleged to justify” them, and emphasiz
ing that its “judgment [wa]s informed by other means
Colorado employs to accomplish its regulatory purposes.”
Id., at 192. The entire last section of the Court’s opinion
detailed those “less problematic measures” by which Colo
rado “can and d[id] meet” its “substantial interests in
regulating the ballot-initiative process.” Id., at 204 (em
phasis added). With one exception—a law deeming an
initiative void if the circulator violated any law applicable
to the circulation process—those Colorado laws correspond
exactly to the Washington regulatory requirements listed
above. See id., at 205. Including the observer provision,
§29A.72.230, and the provision permitting court review of
