JOHN DOE #1, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. SAM REED, 

WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,

This is not a hard case. It is not about a restriction on
voting or on speech and does not involve a classic disclo

nondiscriminatory policy of disclosing information already
in the State’s possession that, it has been alleged, might
one day indirectly burden petition signatories. The bur

Records Act (PRA) to referendum petitions in the vast

the State has given a more than adequate justification for

For a number of reasons, the application of the PRA to
referendum petitions does not substantially burden any
individual’s expression. First, it is not “a regulation of
pure speech.” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514
U. S. 334, 345 (1995); cf. United States v. O’Brien, 391
U. S. 367, 377 (1968). It does not prohibit expression, nor
does it require that any person signing a petition disclose
or say anything at all. See McIntyre, 514 U. S. 334. Nor
does the State’s disclosure alter the content of a speaker’s
message. See id., at 342–343.
Second, any effect on speech that disclosure might have
is minimal. The PRA does not necessarily make it more
