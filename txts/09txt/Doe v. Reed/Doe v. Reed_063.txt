THOMAS, J., dissenting

parties.” Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Thus, to succeed at that stage of litigation, plaintiffs must
point to (at least) one other instance of harassment arising
from a similar referendum. The Court has never held that
such evidence would be acceptable; but if it is, that neces
sarily means that some signers, at some point, will have
suffered actual “threats, harassment, and reprisals” for
engaging in protected First Amendment activity.
If the sponsor must wait at least until signature
gathering has started on his referendum to file an as
applied challenge, it is still unclear what sort of evidence
of “threats, harassment, or reprisals” directed toward his
supporters would satisfy the Court’s standard. How many
instances of “threats, harassment or reprisals” must a
signer endure before a court may grant relief on an as
applied challenge? And how dispersed throughout the
group of the necessary 120,000 signers, see ante, at 3,
must these threats be?
More importantly, the Court’s standard does not appear
to require actual “threats, harassment, or reprisals,” but
merely a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that disclosure of the
signers’ names and addresses will lead to such activity.
Ante, at 11 (emphasis added). What sort of evidence suf
fices to satisfy this apparently more relaxed, though per
haps more elusive, standard? Does one instance of actual
harassment directed toward one signer mean that the
“reasonable probability” requirement is met? And again,
how widespread must this “reasonable probability” be?
The Court does not answer any of these questions, leaving
a vacuum to be filled on a case-by-case basis. This will, no
doubt, result in the “drawing of” arbitrary and “question
able” “fine distinctions” by even the most well-intentioned
district or circuit judge. Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 9–10).
