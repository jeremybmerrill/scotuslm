the ballot box. Ballot peddlers paid voters and then
watched them place the ballot in the box. See L. Fredman,
The Australian Ballot: The Story of an American Reform
22–29 (1968); Argersinger 48–50. Thus, although some
state courts said that voting by ballot was meant to be
more secret than the public act of viva voce voting; and
although some state constitutional requirements of ballot
voting were held to guarantee ballot secrecy, thus prohib

purposes, see Williams v. Stein, 38 Ind. 89 (1871); Brisbin
v. Cleary, 26 Minn. 107, 1 N. W. 825 (1879); in general,
voting by ballot was by no means secret. Most important
of all for present purposes, I am aware of no assertion of
ballot secrecy that relied on federal or state constitutional
guarantees of freedom of speech.
It was precisely discontent over the nonsecret nature of
ballot voting, and the abuses that produced, which led to
the States’ adoption of the Australian secret ballot. New
York and Massachusetts began that movement in 1888,
and almost 90 percent of the States had followed suit by
1896. Burson, 504 U. S., at 203–205. But I am aware of
no contention that the Australian system was required by
the First Amendment (or the state counterparts). That
would have been utterly implausible, since the inhabitants
of the Colonies, the States, and the United States had
found public voting entirely compatible with “the freedom
of speech” for several centuries.

having legislative effect violates the First Amendment. As
I said in McIntyre, “[w]here the meaning of a constitu
tional text (such as ‘the freedom of speech’) is unclear, the
widespread and long-accepted practices of the American
people are the best indication of what fundamental beliefs
