As-applied challenges to disclosure requirements play a
critical role in protecting First Amendment freedoms. To
give speech the breathing room it needs to flourish,
prompt judicial remedies must be available well before the
relevant speech occurs and the burden of proof must be
low. In this case—both through analogy and through their
own experiences—plaintiffs have a strong case that they
are entitled to as-applied relief, and they will be able to
pursue such relief before the District Court.
