DOE v. REED
Opinion of the Court

675.
The referendum petition sponsor and certain signers
filed a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction
in the United States District Court for the Western Dis
trict of Washington, seeking to enjoin the secretary of
state from publicly releasing any documents that would
reveal the names and contact information of the R–71
petition signers. App. 4. Count I of the complaint alleges

Count I and granted them a preliminary injunction on
that count, enjoining release of the information on the
petition. 661 F. Supp. 2d 1194, 1205–1206 (WD Wash.
2009).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir
cuit reversed. Reviewing only Count I of the complaint,
the Court of Appeals held that plaintiffs were unlikely to
succeed on their claim that the PRA is unconstitutional as
applied to referendum petitions generally. It therefore
reversed the District Court’s grant of the preliminary
injunction. 586 F. 3d, at 681. We granted certiorari. 558
U. S. ___ (2010).

challenge before us. As noted, Count I of the complaint
