Opinion of STEVENS, J.

Marion County Election Bd., 553 U. S. 181, 191–200
(2008) (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (discussing voting fraud);
Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,
391 (2000) (“The quantum of empirical evidence needed to
satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judg
ments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibil
ity of the justification raised”); see also Timmons, 520
U. S., at 375 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (rejecting “imagina
tive [and] theoretical” justification supported only by “bare
assertion”).3 And there is more than enough evidence to
support the State’s election-integrity justification. See
ante, at 8–10 (opinion of the Court).
There remains the issue of petitioners’ as-applied chal
lenge. As a matter of law, the Court is correct to keep
open the possibility that in particular instances in which a
policy such as the PRA burdens expression “by the public
enmity attending publicity,” Brown v. Socialist Workers
’74 Campaign Comm. (Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 98 (1982),
speakers may have a winning constitutional claim.
“ ‘[F]rom time to time throughout history,’ ” persecuted
groups have been able “ ‘to criticize oppressive practices

3 There is no reason to think that our ordinary presumption that the
political branches are better suited than courts to weigh a policy’s
benefits and burdens is inapplicable in this case. The degree to which
we defer to a judgment by the political branches must vary up and
down with the degree to which that judgment reflects considered,
public-minded decisionmaking. Thus, when a law appears to have been
adopted without reasoned consideration, see, e.g., Salazar v. Buono,
559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 22–
23), for discriminatory purposes, see, e.g., Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U. S.
516, 517–518, 524–525 (1960), or to entrench political majorities, see,
e.g., Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 317–319, 324–326, 332–333
(2004) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), we are less willing to defer to the
institutional strengths of the legislature. That one may call into
question the process used to create a law is not a reason to “disregar[d]”
“sufficiently strong,” “valid[,] neutral justifications” for an otherwise
“nondiscriminatory” policy. Crawford, 553 U. S., at 204. But it is a
reason to examine more carefully the justifications for that measure.
