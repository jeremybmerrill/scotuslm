DOE v. REED
THOMAS, J., dissenting

“People are intelligent enough to evaluate the source
of an anonymous writing. They can see it is anony
mous. They know it is anonymous. They can evalu
ate its anonymity along with its message. . . . And
then, once they have done so, it is for them to decide
what is ‘responsible,’ what is valuable, and what is
truth.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
See also Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (“The inherent worth of
the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public

This observation applies equally to referendum meas

referendum petitions.

The foregoing analysis applies in every case involving
disclosure of a referendum measure’s supporters, as it
must for petitioners’ facial challenge to succeed. See
Washington State Grange, 552 U. S., at 449 (quoting
Salerno, 481 U. S., at 745). Washington does not argue
that the strength of its transparency and accountability
interest rises or falls based on the topic of a referendum.
Nor would such an argument be convincing. We have no
basis to assume that Washington’s interest in maintaining
the integrity of its referendum process is high for a char
ter-school referendum but low for an unemployment in
surance referendum, or that a library or land-use referen
dum is more likely to be a target of fraud or corruption
than a referendum on insurance coverage and benefits.
See ante, at 11–12. The strength of Washington’s interest
remains constant across all types of referendum measures.
So too does the strength of a signer’s First Amendment
interest. The First Amendment rights at issue here are
