DOE v. REED
Opinion of the Court

The course of this litigation, however, has framed the
legal question before us more broadly. The issue at this
stage of the case is not whether disclosure of this particu

the information on this particular petition, which is pend

(2008).

signed into law Senate Bill 5688, which “expand[ed] the
rights and responsibilities” of state-registered domestic
partners, including same-sex domestic partners. 586 F. 3d
671, 675 (CA9 2009). That same month, Protect Marriage
Washington, one of the petitioners here, was organized as
a “State Political Committee” for the purpose of collecting
the petition signatures necessary to place a referendum on
the ballot, which would give the voters themselves an
opportunity to vote on SB 5688. App. 8–9. If the referen
