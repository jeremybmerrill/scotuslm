Opinion of the Court

Referendum 71 petition.” Id., at 17. The District Court
decision was based solely on Count I; the Court of Appeals
decision reversing the District Court was similarly lim
ited. 586 F. 3d, at 676, n. 6. Neither court addressed
Count II.
The parties disagree about whether Count I is properly
viewed as a facial or as-applied challenge. Compare Reply
Brief for Petitioners 8 (“Count I expressly made an as
applied challenge”), with Brief for Respondent Reed 1
(“This is a facial challenge to Washington’s Public Records
Act”). It obviously has characteristics of both: The claim is
“as applied” in the sense that it does not seek to strike the
PRA in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers
referendum petitions. The claim is “facial” in that it is not
limited to plaintiffs’ particular case, but challenges appli
cation of the law more broadly to all referendum petitions.
The label is not what matters. The important point is
that plaintiffs’ claim and the relief that would follow—an
injunction barring the secretary of state “from making
referendum petitions available to the public,” App. 16
(Complaint Count I)—reach beyond the particular circum
stances of these plaintiffs. They must therefore satisfy our
standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.
