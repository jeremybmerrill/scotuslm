JOHN DOE #1, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. SAM REED, 

WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The State of Washington allows its citizens to challenge
state laws by referendum. Roughly four percent of Wash
ington voters must sign a petition to place such a referen
dum on the ballot. That petition, which by law must
include the names and addresses of the signers, is then
submitted to the government for verification and canvass
ing, to ensure that only lawful signatures are counted.
The Washington Public Records Act (PRA) authorizes
private parties to obtain copies of government documents,
and the State construes the PRA to cover submitted refer
endum petitions.
This case arises out of a state law extending certain
benefits to same-sex couples, and a corresponding referen
dum petition to put that law to a popular vote. Respon
dent intervenors invoked the PRA to obtain copies of the
petition, with the names and addresses of the signers.
Certain petition signers and the petition sponsor objected,
arguing that such public disclosure would violate their
rights under the First Amendment.
