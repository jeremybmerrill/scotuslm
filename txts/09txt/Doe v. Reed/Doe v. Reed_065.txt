These characteristics of initiative and referendum
drives persist today. Consider, for example, the goal of
increasing ethics in government—a seemingly laudable
and unobjectionable goal. So thought some citizens of
Utah, who, frustrated with the state legislature’s failure to
pass ethics laws commensurate with their preferences,

supermajority in both the Utah House of Representatives
(71%) and the Utah Senate (72%), see State Yellow Book:
