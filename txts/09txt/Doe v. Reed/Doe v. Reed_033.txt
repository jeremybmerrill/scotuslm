DOE v. REED
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

mean that any party attempting to challenge particular
applications of the State’s regulations will bear a heavy
burden. Even when a referendum involves a particularly
controversial subject and some petition signers fear har
assment from nonstate actors, a State’s important inter
ests in “protect[ing] the integrity and reliability of the
initiative process” remain undiminished, and the State
retains significant discretion in advancing those interests.
Buckley, 525 U. S., at 191. Likewise, because the expres
sive interests implicated by the act of petition signing are
always modest, I find it difficult to see how any incre
mental disincentive to sign a petition would tip the consti
tutional balance. Case-specific relief may be available
when a State selectively applies a facially neutral petition
disclosure rule in a manner that discriminates based on
the content of referenda or the viewpoint of petition sign
ers, or in the rare circumstance in which disclosure poses
a reasonable probability of serious and widespread har
assment that the State is unwilling or unable to control.
Cf. NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449
(1958). Allowing case-specific invalidation under a more
forgiving standard would unduly diminish the substantial
breathing room States are afforded to adopt and imple
ment reasonable, nondiscriminatory measures like the
disclosure requirement now at issue. Accordingly, courts
presented with an as-applied challenge to a regulation
authorizing the disclosure of referendum petitions should
be deeply skeptical of any assertion that the Constitution,
which embraces political transparency, compels States to
conceal the identity of persons who seek to participate in
lawmaking through a state-created referendum process.
With this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court.
