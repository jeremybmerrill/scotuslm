DOE v. REED
ALITO, J., concurring

ensure the integrity of the referendum process. The State
of Washington first authorized voter initiatives via consti
tutional amendment in 1912, and the following year the
Washington Legislature passed a statute specifying the
particulars of the referendum process. See State ex rel.
Case v. Superior Ct. for Thurston Cty., 81 Wash. 623, 628,
143 P. 461, 462 (1914). Significantly, Washington’s laws
pertaining to initiatives and referenda did not then and do
not now authorize the public disclosure of signatory in
formation. See Wash. Rev. Code §29A.72.010 et seq.; 1913
Wash. Laws. pp. 418–437. Instead, the public disclosure
requirement stems from the PRA, which was enacted in
1972 and which requires the public disclosure of state
documents generally, not referendum documents specifi
cally. See Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq. Indeed, if
anything, Washington’s referenda and initiative laws
suggest that signatory information should remain confi
dential: Outside observers are permitted to observe the
secretary of state’s verification and canvassing process
only “so long as they make no record of the names, ad
dresses, or other information on the petitions or related
records during the verification process,” §29A.72.230, and
the State is required to destroy all those petitions that fail
to qualify for the ballot, §29A.72.200.
Second, the State fails to come to grips with the fact
that public disclosure of referendum signatory information
is a relatively recent practice in Washington. Prior to the
adoption of the PRA in 1972, the Washington attorney
general took the view that referendum petitions were not
subject to public disclosure. See Op. Wash. Atty. Gen. 55–
57 No. 274, pp. 1–2 (May 28, 1956), online at
