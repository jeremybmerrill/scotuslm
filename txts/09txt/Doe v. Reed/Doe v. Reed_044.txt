DOE v. REED
SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

of opinions.” Id., at 5 (discussing J. W. Sullivan, Direct
Legislation by the Citizenship through the Initiative and
Referendum (1892)). Plaintiffs’ argument implies that the
public nature of these practices, so longstanding and
unquestioned, violated the freedom of speech. There is no
historical support for such a claim.

Legislating was not the only governmental act that was
public in America. Voting was public until 1888 when the
States began to adopt the Australian secret ballot. See
Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 203 (1992) (plurality

a bench with their clerks before them. Where practi

whatever was the office to be filled. He replied by
proclaiming the name of his favorite. Then the clerks
enrolled the vote, and the judges announced it as en

he voted arose, bowed, and thanked him aloud; and
