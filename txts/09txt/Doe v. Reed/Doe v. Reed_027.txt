tendency on the part of the legislature to regard the sign
ing of an initiative petition as a matter concerning only
the individual signers except in so far as necessary to
safeguard against abuses of the privilege”). Indeed, the
secretary of state represents on his Web site that even
after the PRA was enacted, “various Secretary of State
administrations took the position, from 1973 to 1998, that
the personal information on petition sheets were NOT
subject to disclosure.” B. Zylstra, The Disclosure History
of Petition Sheets (Sept. 17, 2009), online at

Although the
secretary of state apparently changed this policy in the
late 1990’s, it appears that the secretary did not release
any initiative petitions until 2006. Ibid. And to date, the
secretary has released only a handful of petitions. Ibid.;
App. 26. That history substantially undermines the
State’s assertion that public disclosure is necessary to
ensure the integrity of the referendum process. For nearly
a century, Washington’s referendum process operated—
and apparently operated successfully—without the public
disclosure of signatory information. The State has failed
to explain how circumstances have changed so dramati

required.
Third, the experiences of other States demonstrates that
publicly disclosing the names and identifying information
of referendum signatories is not necessary to protect
against fraud and mistake. To give but one example,
California has had more initiatives on the ballot than any
other State save Oregon. See Initiative and Referendum

Nonetheless, California law
explicitly protects the privacy of initiative and referendum
signatories. See Cal. Elec. Code Ann. §18650 (West 2003);
