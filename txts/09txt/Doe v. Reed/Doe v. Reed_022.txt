DOE v. REED
ALITO, J., concurring

quirement can rely on “evidence of reprisals and threats
directed against individuals or organizations holding
similar views”). Proposition 8 amended the California
Constitution to provide that “[o]nly marriage between a
man and a woman is valid or recognized in California,”
Cal. Const., Art. I, §7.5, and plaintiffs submitted to the
District Court substantial evidence of the harassment
suffered by Proposition 8 supporters, see Declaration of
Scott F. Bieniek in No. C:09–5456 (WD Wash.), Exhs. 12,
13. Members of this Court have also noted that harass
ment. See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2–3); Citizens United, 558
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2–3) (opinion of THOMAS, J.).
Indeed, if the evidence relating to Proposition 8 is not
sufficient to obtain an as-applied exemption in this case,
one may wonder whether that vehicle provides any mean
ingful protection for the First Amendment rights of per
sons who circulate and sign referendum and initiative
petitions.
What is more, when plaintiffs return to the District
Court, they will have the opportunity to develop evidence
of intimidation and harassment of Referendum 71 sup
porters—an opportunity that was pretermitted because of
the District Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunc
tion on count 1 of plaintiffs’ complaint. See 661 F. Supp.
2d 1194, 1205–1206 (WD Wash. 2009); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40–
41. For example, plaintiffs allege that the campaign
manager for one of the plaintiff groups received threaten
ing e-mails and phone calls, and that the threats were so
severe that the manager filed a complaint with the local
sheriff and had his children sleep in an interior room of
his home. App. 9–10.

public disclosure of referendum signatory information
