SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

tions enacted around the time of the founding had similar
provisions. See, e.g., Ky. Const., Art. I, §20 (1792); Ga.
Const., Art. I, §15 (1798). The desirability of public ac
countability was obvious. “[A]s to the votes of representa
tives and senators in Congress, no man has yet been bold
enough to vindicate a secret or ballot vote, as either more
safe or more wise, more promotive of independence in the
members, or more beneficial to their constituents.” 1 J.
Story, Commentaries on the Constitution §841, p. 591
(4th ed. 1873).
Moreover, even when the people asked Congress for
legislative changes—by exercising their constitutional
right “to petition the Government for a redress of griev
ances,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 1—they did so publicly. The
petition was read aloud in Congress. Mazzone, Freedom’s
Associations, 77 Wash. L. Rev. 639, 726 (2002). The peti
tioner’s name (when large groups were not involved), his
request, and what action Congress had taken on the peti
tion were consistently recorded in the House and Senate
Journals. See, e.g., Journal of the Senate, June 18, 1790,
1st Cong., 1st Sess., 163; Journal of the House of Repre
sentatives, Nov. 24, 1820, 16th Cong., 2d Sess., 32. Even
when the people exercised legislative power directly, they
did so not anonymously, but openly in town hall meetings.
See generally J. Zimmerman, The New England Town
Meeting (1999).
Petitioning the government and participating in the
traditional town meeting were precursors of the modern
initiative and referendum. Those innovations were mod
eled after similar devices used by the Swiss democracy in
the 1800’s, and were first used in the United States by
South Dakota in 1898. See S. Piott, Giving Voters a Voice
1–3, 16 (2003). The most influential advocate of the initia
tive and referendum in the United States analogized the
Swiss practice to the town meeting, because both “re
quired open conduct of political affairs and free expression
