JOHN DOE #1, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. SAM REED, 

WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring.
The Court holds that the disclosure under the Washing
ton Public Records Act (PRA), Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001
et seq. (2008), of the names and addresses of persons who
sign referendum petitions does not as a general matter
violate the First Amendment, ante, at 13, and I agree with
that conclusion.
Many referendum petitions concern
relatively uncontroversial matters, see ante, at 11–12, and
plaintiffs have provided no reason to think that disclosure
of signatory information in those contexts would signifi
cantly chill the willingness of voters to sign. Plaintiffs’
facial challenge therefore must fail. See ante, at 2, 5.
Nonetheless, facially valid disclosure requirements can
impose heavy burdens on First Amendment rights in
individual cases. Acknowledging that reality, we have
long held that speakers can obtain as-applied exemptions
from disclosure requirements if they can show “a reason
able probability that the compelled disclosure of [personal
information] will subject them to threats, harassment, or
reprisals from either Government officials or private
parties.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 74 (1976) (per
curiam); see also Citizens United v. Federal Election
Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 52); McCon
nell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 197–198
(2003); Brown v. Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign Comm.
