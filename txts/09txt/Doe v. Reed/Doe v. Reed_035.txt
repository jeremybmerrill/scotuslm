DOE v. REED
Opinion of STEVENS, J.

difficult to circulate or obtain signatures on a petition, see
Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc.,
525 U. S. 182, 193–196 (1999); Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S.
414, 422–423 (1988), or to communicate one’s views gen
erally. Regardless of whether someone signs a referendum
petition, that person remains free to say anything to any
one at any time. If disclosure indirectly burdens a
speaker, “the amount of speech covered” is small—only a
single, narrow message conveying one fact in one place,
Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of
Stratton, 536 U. S. 150, 165 (2002); cf. Cox v. New Hamp
shire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941). And while the democratic act
of casting a ballot or signing a petition does serve an
expressive purpose, the act does not involve any “interac
tive communication,” Meyer, 486 U. S., at 422, and is “not
principally” a method of “individual expression of political
sentiment,” Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520
U. S. 351, 373 (1997) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); cf. O’Brien,
391 U. S., at 377.1
Weighed against the possible burden on constitutional
rights are the State’s justifications for its rule. In this
case, the State has posited a perfectly adequate justifica
tion: an interest in deterring and detecting petition fraud.2
Given the pedigree of this interest and of similar regula
tions, the State need not produce concrete evidence that
the PRA is the best way to prevent fraud. See Crawford v.

1 Although

a “petition” is a classic means of political expression, the
type of petition at issue in this case is not merely a document on which
people are expressing their views but rather is a state-created forum with
a particular function: sorting those issues that have enough public
support to warrant limited space on a referendum ballot. Cf. Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 278 (1981) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).
2 Washington also points out that its disclosure policy informs voters
about who supports the particular referendum. In certain election-law
contexts, this informational rationale (among others) may provide a
basis for regulation; in this case, there is no need to look beyond the
State’s quite obvious antifraud interest.
