Opinion of the Court

“[D]isclosure requirements may burden the ability to
speak, but they . . . do not prevent anyone from speaking.”
Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___,
___ (2010) (slip op., at 51) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
We have a series of precedents considering First
Amendment challenges to disclosure requirements in the
electoral context. These precedents have reviewed such
challenges under what has been termed “exacting scru
tiny.” See, e.g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 64 (1976)
(per curiam) (“Since NAACP v. Alabama [357 U. S. 449
(1958),] we have required that the subordinating interests
of the State [offered to justify compelled disclosure] sur

(slip op., at 51) (“The Court has subjected [disclosure]
requirements to ‘exacting scrutiny’ ” (quoting Buckley,
supra, at 64)); Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U. S.
___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 18) (governmental interest in
disclosure “ ‘must survive exacting scrutiny’ ” (quoting
Buckley, supra, at 64)); Buckley v. American Constitu
tional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 U. S. 182, 204 (1999)
(ACLF) (finding that disclosure rules “fail[ed] exacting
scrutiny” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
That standard “requires a ‘substantial relation’ between
the disclosure requirement and a ‘sufficiently important’
governmental interest.” Citizens United, supra, at ___
(slip op., at 51) (quoting Buckley, supra, at 64, 66). To
withstand this scrutiny, “the strength of the governmental
interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden
on First Amendment rights.” Davis, supra, at ___ (slip op.,
at 18) (citing Buckley, supra, at 68, 71).1

1 JUSTICE SCALIA doubts whether petition signing is entitled to any
First Amendment protection at all. Post, at 1 (opinion concurring in
judgment). His skepticism is based on the view that petition signing
has “legal effects” in the legislative process, while other aspects of
political participation—with respect to which we have held there is a
