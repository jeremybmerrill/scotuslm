JOHN DOE #1, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. SAM REED, 

WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 2010] 


JUSTICE BREYER, concurring.
In circumstances where, as here, “a law significantly
implicates competing constitutionally protected interests
in complex ways,” the Court balances interests. Nixon v.
Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 402
(2000) (BREYER, J., concurring). “And in practice that has
meant asking whether the statute burdens any one such
interest in a manner out of proportion to the statute’s
salutary effects upon the others.” Ibid. As I read their
opinions, this is what both the Court and JUSTICE
STEVENS do. See ante, at 7 (opinion of the Court); post, at
2 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). And for the reasons stated in those opinions
(as well as many of the reasons discussed by JUSTICE
SOTOMAYOR), I would uphold the statute challenged in
this case. With this understanding, I join the opinion of
the Court and JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion.
