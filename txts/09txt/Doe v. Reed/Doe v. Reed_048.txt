DOE v. REED
SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

it was intended to enshrine.” 514 U. S., at 378 (dissenting
opinion). Just as the century-old practice of States’ pro
hibiting anonymous electioneering was sufficient for me to
reject the First Amendment claim to anonymity in McIn
tyre, the many-centuries-old practices of public legislating
and voting are sufficient for me to reject plaintiffs’ claim.
Plaintiffs raise concerns that the disclosure of petition
signatures may lead to threats and intimidation. Of
course nothing prevents the people of Washington from
keeping petition signatures secret to avoid that—just as
nothing prevented the States from moving to the secret
ballot. But there is no constitutional basis for this Court
to impose that course upon the States—or to insist (as
today’s opinion does) that it can only be avoided by the
demonstration of a “sufficiently important governmental
interest,” ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).
And it may even be a bad idea to keep petition signatures
secret. There are laws against threats and intimidation;
and harsh criticism, short of unlawful action, is a price our
people have traditionally been willing to pay for self
governance. Requiring people to stand up in public for
their political acts fosters civic courage, without which
democracy is doomed. For my part, I do not look forward
to a society which, thanks to the Supreme Court, cam
paigns anonymously (McIntyre) and even exercises the
direct democracy of initiative and referendum hidden from
public scrutiny and protected from the accountability of
criticism. This does not resemble the Home of the Brave.
