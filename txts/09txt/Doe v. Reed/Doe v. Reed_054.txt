DOE v. REED
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Respondent Reed 40–42; 57–59.
It is true that a State has a substantial interest in regu
lating its referendum and initiative processes “to protect
the[ir] integrity and reliability.” ACLF, 525 U. S., at 191.
But Washington points to no precedent from this Court
recognizing “correcting errors” as a distinct compelling
interest that could support disclosure regulations. And
our cases strongly suggest that preventing corruption and
deterring fraud bear less weight in this particular elec
toral context: the signature-gathering stage of a referen
dum or initiative drive. The Court has twice observed that
“ ‘the risk of fraud or corruption, or the appearance
thereof, is more remote at the petition stage of an initia
tive than at the time of balloting.’ ” Id., at 203 (quoting
Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 427 (1988)). Similarly,
because “[r]eferenda are held on issues, not candidates for
public office,” the “risk of corruption perceived in cases
involving candidate elections simply is not present in a
popular vote on a public issue.” First Nat. Bank of Boston
v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 790 (1978) (citations omitted).
We should not abandon those principles merely because
Washington and its amici can point to a mere eight in
stances of initiative-related fraud, see Brief for Respon
dent Reed 42; Brief for State of Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae
22–24, among the 809 initiative measures placed on
state ballots in this country between 1988 and 2008,
see Initiative and Referendum Institute, Initiative Use

IRI%20Initiative%20Use%20(1904-2008).pdf (as visited
June 21, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).
If anything, these meager figures reinforce the conclusion
that the risks of fraud or corruption in the initiative and
referendum process are remote and thereby undermine
Washington’s claim that those two interests should be
considered compelling for purposes of strict scrutiny.
Thus, I am not persuaded that Washington’s interest in
