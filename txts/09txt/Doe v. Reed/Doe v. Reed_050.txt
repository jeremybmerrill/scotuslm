DOE v. REED
THOMAS, J., dissenting

I
This case concerns the interaction of two distinct sets of
Washington statutes. The first set, codified in Washing
ton’s Election Code, regulates the referendum and initia
tive process. These statutes require, among other things,
that referendum signers write their names and addresses
on petition sheets, and mandate that this information
be disclosed to Washington’s secretary of state for canvass
ing and verification. See, e.g., §§29A.72.130, 29A.72.230
(2008). Petitioners do not contend that these require
ments violate their First Amendment rights; that is, they
do not argue that the Constitution allows them to support
a referendum measure without disclosing their names to
the State.
The second set of statutes—the PRA—is not a referen
dum or election regulation. Rather, the PRA requires
disclosure of all nonexempt “public records” upon request
by any person. See §§42.56.010(2), 42.56.070. Washing
ton has concluded that signed referendum petitions are
“public records” subject to disclosure under the PRA, and
has “routinely disclosed petitions in response to public
records requests.” Brief for Respondent Reed 5–6.
Petitioners do not challenge the constitutionality of the
PRA generally. They contend only that Washington vio
lates their First Amendment rights by construing the PRA
to apply to signed referendum petitions. See Brief for
Petitioners 35–39. As the Court notes, the parties dispute
whether this challenge is best conceived as a facial chal
lenge or an as-applied challenge. See ante, at 5. In my
view, the Court correctly concludes that petitioners must
“satisfy our standards for a facial challenge” because their
claim, and the relief that they seek, “reach beyond” their
“particular circumstances.” Ibid.
We typically disfavor facial challenges. See Washington
State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552
U. S. 442, 449 (2008). They “often rest on speculation,”
