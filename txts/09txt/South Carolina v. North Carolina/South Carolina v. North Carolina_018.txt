With these considerations in mind, we turn to Duke
Energy’s asserted interests. Duke Energy operates 11
dams and reservoirs in both States that generate electric­
ity for the region and control the flow of the river. The
complaint itself acknowledges the relationship between
river flow and Duke Energy’s operations, noting that a
severe drought that ended in 2002 forced Duke Energy to
“reduce dramatically” its hydroelectric power generation
from the Catawba River. Complaint ¶17(c). It is likely
that any equitable apportionment of the river will need to
take into account the amount of water that Duke Energy
needs to sustain its operations and provide electricity to
the region, thus giving Duke Energy a strong interest in
the outcome of this litigation. See Colorado v. New Mex
ico, supra, at 188 (noting the appropriateness of consider­
ing “the balance of harm and benefit that might result”
from a State’s proposed diversion of a river). There is,
moreover, no other similarly situated entity on the Ca­
tawba River, setting Duke’s interests apart from the class
of all other citizens of the States. See New Jersey v. New
York, supra, at 373.
Just as important, Duke Energy has a unique and com­
pelling interest in protecting the terms of its existing
FERC license and the CRA that forms the basis of Duke
Energy’s pending renewal application.7 Through its dams,
Duke Energy controls the flow of the Catawba River under
the terms of its 50-year FERC license, which regulates the
very subject matter in dispute: the river’s minimum flow
into South Carolina. See Order Issuing License (Major),
Duke Power Co., Project No. 2232, 20 F. P. C. 360, 371–372
(1958) (Articles 31 and 32). The CRA, likewise, represents
——————
7 Duke Energy is operating under a temporary extension of its 50­
year FERC license, which expired in 2008, and the CRA represents
Duke Energy’s investment in a new 50-year license.
