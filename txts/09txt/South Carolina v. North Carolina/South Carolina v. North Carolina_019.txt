SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

the full consensus of 70 parties from both States regarding
the appropriate minimum continuous flow of Catawba
River water into South Carolina under a variety of natural
conditions and, in times of drought, the conservation
measures to be taken by entities that withdraw water
from the Catawba River. These factors undeniably are
relevant to any “just and equitable apportionment” of the
Catawba River, see Colorado v. New Mexico, 459 U. S., at

this action, and we find that neither State is situated to do
so properly. We believe that Duke Energy should be
permitted to represent its own interests.
For these reasons, we agree with the Special Master
that Duke Energy should be permitted to intervene, and
we overrule South Carolina’s exception in that regard.

We conclude, however, that Charlotte has not carried its
burden of showing a sufficient interest for intervention in
this action. Charlotte is a municipality of North Carolina,
and for purposes of this litigation, its transfers of water
from the Catawba River basin constitute part of North
Carolina’s equitable share. While it is true that the com­
plaint names Charlotte as an entity authorized by North
Carolina to carry out a large transfer of water from the
