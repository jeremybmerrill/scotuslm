Syllabus
riety of natural conditions and the conservation measures to be taken
during droughts. Moreover, neither State is situated to properly rep
resent Duke Energy’s compelling interests. Neither has signed the
CRA or expressed an intention to defend its terms, and, in fact, North
Carolina intends to seek its modification. Pp. 14–16.
(3) However, because Charlotte’s interest is not sufficiently
unique and will be properly represented by North Carolina, the city’s
intervention is not required. Charlotte is a North Carolina munici
pality, and for purposes of this litigation, its water transfers from the
river basin constitute part of that State’s equitable share. While the
complaint names Charlotte as an entity authorized by North Caro
lina to carry out a large water transfer from the river basin, the com
plaint does not seek relief against Charlotte directly, but, rather,
seeks relief against all North Carolina-authorized water transfers in
excess of that State’s equitable share. Charlotte, therefore, occupies
a class of affected North Carolina water users, and the magnitude of
its authorized transfer does not distinguish it in kind from other class
members. Nor does Charlotte represent interstate interests that fall
on both sides of this dispute, as does the CRWSP. Pp. 16–18.
