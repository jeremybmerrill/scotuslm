Opinion of the Court

were seeking equitable apportionment of water resources.
See, e.g., Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 608, n. 1
(1983); Texas v. New Mexico, 343 U. S. 932 (1952); New
Jersey v. City of New York, 279 U. S. 823 (1929) (per cu
riam). It is, thus, not a novel proposition to accord party
status to a citizen in an original action between States.
This Court likewise has granted leave, under appropri­
ate circumstances, for nonstate entities to intervene as
parties in original actions between States for nearly 90
years. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 745,
n. 21 (1981). In Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 581,
598 (1922), a boundary dispute that threatened to erupt in
armed hostilities, the Court allowed individual and corpo­
rate citizens to intervene to protect their rights in con­
tested land. See, e.g., Oklahoma v. Texas, 254 U. S. 609
(1920).3 More recently, the Court has allowed a munici­
pality to intervene in a sovereign boundary dispute, see
Texas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S. 465, 466 (1976) (per curiam),
and has permitted private corporations to intervene in an
original action challenging a State’s imposition of a tax
that burdened interstate commerce and contravened the
Supremacy Clause, see Maryland v. Louisiana, supra, at
745, n. 21.
In this case, the Special Master crafted a rule of inter­
vention that accounts for the full compass of our prece­
dents. But a compelling reason for allowing citizens to
participate in one original action is not necessarily a com­
pelling reason for allowing citizens to intervene in all

3 THE

CHIEF JUSTICE argues against drawing conclusions from the
intervention that we allowed in Oklahoma v. Texas, 254 U. S. 609
(1920). See post, at 7–8 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part). But the circumstances surrounding that dispute fit
the “ ‘model case’ ” for invoking this Court’s original jurisdiction, post, at
2, and counsel against inferring from our precedents, as THE CHIEF
JUSTICE does with respect to equitable apportionment actions, a rule
against nonstate intervention in such “weighty controversies,” ibid.
