SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

I
Two basic principles have guided the exercise of our
constitutionally conferred original jurisdiction. The first is
an appreciation that our original jurisdiction, “delicate
and grave,” Louisiana v. Texas, 176 U. S. 1, 15 (1900), was
granted to provide a forum for the peaceful resolution of
weighty controversies involving the States. “The model
case for invocation of this Court’s original jurisdiction is a
dispute between States of such seriousness that it would
amount to casus belli if the States were fully sovereign.”
Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 571, n. 18 (1983). In
determining whether to exercise original jurisdiction, we
accordingly focus on “the nature of the interest of the
complaining State,” and in particular the “seriousness and
dignity” of the claim asserted. Mississippi v. Louisiana,
506 U. S. 73, 77 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Original jurisdiction is for the resolution of state claims,
not private claims. To invoke that jurisdiction, a State
“must, of course, represent an interest of her own and not
merely that of her citizens or corporations.” Arkansas v.
Texas, 346 U. S. 368, 370 (1953); see Kansas v. Colorado,
533 U. S. 1, 8–9 (2001); Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426
U. S. 660, 665 (1976) (per curiam) (It is “settled doctrine
that a State has standing to sue only when its sovereign or
quasi-sovereign interests are implicated and it is not
merely litigating as a volunteer the personal claims of its
citizens”). And in deciding whether a State meets that
requirement, this Court considers whether the State is “in
full control of [the] litigation.” Kansas v. Colorado, supra,
at 8.
The second guiding principle is a practical one: We are
not well suited to assume the role of a trial judge. See
Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U. S. 493, 498
(1971). We have attempted to address that reality by
relying on the services of able special masters, who have
become vitally important in allowing us to manage our
