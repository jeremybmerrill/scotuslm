Opinion of the Court

174 (1930)). This principle serves the twin purposes of
ensuring that due respect is given to “sovereign dignity”
and providing “a working rule for good judicial admini­
stration.” 345 U. S., at 373. The Court, thus, set forth the
following standard governing intervention in an original
action by a nonstate entity:
“An intervenor whose state is already a party should
have the burden of showing some compelling interest
in his own right, apart from his interest in a class
with all other citizens and creatures of the state,
which interest is not properly represented by the
state.” Ibid.
On several subsequent occasions the Court has reaffirmed
this “general rule.” See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S. 1,
21–22 (1995); United States v. Nevada, 412 U. S. 534, 538
(1973) (per curiam); Illinois v. Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 97
(1972).
We acknowledge that the standard for intervention in
original actions by nonstate entities is high—and appro­
priately so. Such actions tax the limited resources of this
Court by requiring us “awkwardly to play the role of fact­
finder” and diverting our attention from our “primary
responsibility as an appellate tribunal.” Ohio v. Wyan
dotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U. S. 493, 498 (1971); Mary
land v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 762 (1981) (Rehnquist,
J., dissenting). In order to ensure that original actions do
not assume the “dimensions of ordinary class actions,”
New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373, we exercise our
original jurisdiction “sparingly” and retain “substantial
discretion” to decide whether a particular claim requires
“an original forum in this Court,” Mississippi v. Louisiana,
506 U. S. 73, 76 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Respect for state sovereignty also calls for a high
threshold to intervention by nonstate parties in a sover­
eign dispute committed to this Court’s original jurisdic­
