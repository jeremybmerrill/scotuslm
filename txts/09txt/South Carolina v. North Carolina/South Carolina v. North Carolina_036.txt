SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

ity does not explain why that familiar and customary
approach might be inadequate in this case.

Our original jurisdiction over actions between States is
concerned with disputes so serious that they would be
grounds for war if the States were truly sovereign. Texas
v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 571, n. 18. A dispute between
States over rights to water fits that bill; a squabble among
private entities within a State over how to divvy up that
State’s share does not. A judgment in an equitable appor
tionment action binds the States; it is not binding with
respect to particular uses asserted by private entities.
Allowing intervention by such entities would vastly com
plicate and delay already complicated and lengthy actions.
And the benefits private entities might bring can be read
ily secured, as has typically been done, by their participa
tion as amici curiae.
In light of all this, it is difficult to understand why the
Court grants nonsovereign entities leave to intervene in
this equitable apportionment action, and easy to under
stand why the Court has never before done so in such a
case.
I would grant South Carolina’s exceptions, and deny the
motions to intervene.

deny intervention in Nebraska v. Wyoming. The Special Master later
allowed one of the entities, Basin Electric Power Cooperative, to inter
vene as a party based on changed circumstances. See Addendum to
Reply Brief for Duke Energy 2–5. That decision was never reviewed by
the Court.
