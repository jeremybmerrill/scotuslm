STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, PLAINTIFF v. STATE 

OF NORTH CAROLINA 

ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER
[January 20, 2010]

JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
The State of South Carolina brought this original action
against the State of North Carolina, seeking an equitable
apportionment of the Catawba River. We appointed a
Special Master and referred the matter to her, together
with the motions of three nonstate entities seeking to
intervene in the dispute as parties. South Carolina op­
posed the motions. After holding a hearing, the Special
Master granted the motions and, upon South Carolina’s
request, memorialized the reasons for her decision in a
First Interim Report. South Carolina then presented
exceptions, and we set the matter for argument.
Two of the three proposed intervenors have satisfied the
standard for intervention in original actions that we ar­
ticulated nearly 60 years ago in New Jersey v. New York,
345 U. S. 369 (1953) (per curiam). Accordingly, we over­
rule South Carolina’s exceptions with respect to the Ca­
tawba River Water Supply Project (hereinafter CRWSP)
and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (hereinafter Duke En­
ergy), but we sustain South Carolina’s exception with
respect to the city of Charlotte, North Carolina (hereinaf­
ter Charlotte).
