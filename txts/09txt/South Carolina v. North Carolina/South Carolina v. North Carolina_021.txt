SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

conclusion. North Carolina has said that it will defend
Charlotte’s authorized 33 mgd transfer. Tr. of Oral Arg.
52–53. The State expressly disagrees with Charlotte’s
assertion that the city’s interest is not adequately repre­
sented by the State. Brief of State of North Carolina in
Opposition to Plaintiff’s Exceptions 22. Indeed, in re­
sponse to Charlotte’s motion to intervene, North Carolina
wrote the following:
“[T]he State must represent the interests of every per­
son that uses water from the North Carolina portion
of the Catawba River basin. In fact, the State has a
particular concern for its political subdivisions, such
as Charlotte, which actually operate the infrastruc­
ture to provide water to the State’s citizens. . . . The
State has every reason to defend the [transfers] that it
has authorized for the benefit of its citizens. The
State cannot agree with any implication that because
it represents all of the users of water in North Caro­
lina it cannot, or will not represent the interests of
Charlotte in this litigation initiated by South Caro­
lina.” Brief for State of North Carolina in Response to
City of Charlotte’s Motion for Leave to Intervene and
File Answer 1–2.
These statements are consistent with North Carolina’s
role as parens patriae, and we see no reason that North
Carolina cannot represent Charlotte’s interest in this
sovereign dispute. See New Jersey v. New York, supra, at
374 (noting that Philadelphia’s interest “is invariably
served by the Commonwealth’s position”).
Because we are not persuaded that Charlotte’s interest
is sufficiently unique and not properly represented by
North Carolina to require the city’s intervention as a party
in this litigation, we sustain South Carolina’s exception.8
