Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

her the Court, can have the benefit of the views of those
seeking to intervene by according them the status of amici
curiae. “Where he presents no new questions, a third
party can contribute usually most effectively and always
most expeditiously by a brief amicus curiae and not by
intervention.” Bush v. Viterna, 740 F. 2d 350, 359 (CA5
1984) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Courts often treat amicus participation as an alternative
to intervention. See 7C C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane,
Federal Practice and Procedure §1913, p. 495, and n. 26
(2007) (citing examples). And this Court often denies
motions to intervene while granting leave to participate as
an amicus in original actions generally, see, e.g., Kentucky
v. Indiana, 445 U. S. 941 (1980); United States v. Califor
nia, 377 U. S. 926 (1964); cf. New Hampshire v. Maine,
426 U. S. 363, 365, n. 2 (1976), and in equitable appor
tionment actions specifically, see, e.g., Arizona v. Califor
nia, 530 U. S. 392, 419, n. 6 (2000); Nebraska v. Wyoming,
507 U. S. 584, 589–590 (1993).
Nebraska v. Wyoming is particularly instructive on this
point. The Court there adopted the recommendation of
the Special Master to deny intervention to certain entities.
See id., at 589–590; Second Interim Report of Special
Master, O. T. 1991, No. 108, Orig., pp. 108–109. The
interests of those entities in the water dispute were quite
similar to the interests of the entities seeking to intervene
here: One operated a powerplant and a reservoir on the
Laramie River, and another was a power district seeking
to protect its FERC license. See First Interim Report of
Special Master, O. T. 1988, No. 108, Orig., pp. 11–14, 9a.
While it adopted the Special Master’s recommendation to
deny intervention, the Court nonetheless permitted those
entities to participate as amici. See 507 U. S., at 589–590;
Nebraska v. Wyoming, 502 U. S. 1055 (1992).2 The major
