SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

from the terms set out in the decree, so long as the total
diversion of water in Colorado was no greater than the
decree allowed. See id., at 584–585; 309 U. S., at 579–581.
We reiterated the point in Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S.
589, 627 (1945), observing that the apportionment of a
waterway between the States has only an “indirect effect”
on the rights of individuals within the States.
All this explains our long history of rejecting attempts
by nonsovereign entities to intervene in equitable appor
tionment actions. New Jersey v. New York was itself an
equitable apportionment suit, and we denied intervention
in that case. We have also summarily denied motions to
intervene in other water disputes between the States. See
Arizona v. California, 514 U. S. 1081 (1995); Arizona v.
California, 345 U. S. 914 (1953); Nebraska v. Wyoming,
296 U. S. 548 (1935); Wisconsin v. Illinois, 279 U. S. 821
(1929). And we have strongly intimated in other decisions
(albeit in dictum) that private entities can rarely, if ever,
intervene in original actions involving the apportionment
of interstate waterways. See United States v. Nevada,
supra, at 538 (“[I]ndividual users of water . . . ordinarily
would have no right to intervene in an original action in
this Court”); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S., at 22 (“We
have said on many occasions that water disputes among
States may be resolved by compact or decree without the
participation of individual claimants”).1

majority contends that this dissent reads our precedents to
establish “a rule against nonstate intervention” in equitable appor
tionment actions. Ante, at 7, n. 3. The number of nonsovereigns that
the Court should permit to intervene in water disputes is small—
indeed, it was zero until today. But that does not mean that a private
entity could not satisfy the New Jersey v. New York test by, for exam
ple, asserting water-use rights that are not dependent upon the rights
of state parties. A private party (or perhaps a Compact Clause entity)
with a federal statutory right to a certain quantity of water might have
a compelling interest in an equitable apportionment action that is not
fairly represented by the States. The putative intervenors in this case,
