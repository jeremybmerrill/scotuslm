SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

intervene would have made it difficult to refuse attempts
to intervene by other users of water from the Delaware
River, including other cities, and even “[l]arge industrial
plants.” Ibid. The New Jersey v. New York test, properly
applied, provides a much-needed limiting principle that
prevents the expansion of our original proceedings “to the
dimensions of ordinary class actions,” ibid., or “town
meeting lawsuits,” id., at 376 (Jackson, J., dissenting).

504; Utah v. United States, 394 U. S. 89, 95–96 (1969) (per
curiam).

Applying these principles, this Court has never granted
a nonsovereign entity’s motion to intervene in an equitable
apportionment action. The reason is straightforward: An
interest in water is an interest shared with other citizens,
and is properly pressed or defended by the State. And a
private entity’s interest in its particular share of the
State’s water, once the water is allocated between the

State on its own. New Jersey v. New York, supra, at 373.
The interests of a State’s citizens in the use of water
derive entirely from the State’s sovereign interest in the
waterway. If the State has no claim to the waters of an
interstate river, then its citizens have none either. See
Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co.,
304 U. S. 92, 102 (1938). We have long recognized, there
fore, that the State must be deemed to represent its citi
zens’ interests in an equitable apportionment action. See
United States v. Nevada, 412 U. S. 534, 539 (1973) (per
curiam) (“For the purposes of dividing the waters of an
interstate stream with another State, [a State] has the
right, parens patriae, to represent all the nonfederal users
in its own State insofar as the share allocated to the other
State is concerned”). Precisely because the State repre
