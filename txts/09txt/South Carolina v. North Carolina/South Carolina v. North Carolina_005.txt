SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

I

A

We granted leave for South Carolina to file its complaint
in this matter two years ago. South Carolina v. North
Carolina, 552 U. S. 804 (2007). The gravamen of the
complaint is that North Carolina has authorized upstream
transfers of water from the Catawba River basin that
exceed North Carolina’s equitable share of the river. It
has done so, according to the complaint, pursuant to a
North Carolina statute that requires any person seeking
to transfer more than 2 million gallons of water per day
(mgd) from the Catawba River basin to obtain a permit
from the North Carolina Environmental Management
Commission.
See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §143–
215.22L(a)(1) (Lexis 2007); §143–215.22G(1)(h). Through
that agency, the complaint alleges, North Carolina has
issued at least two such permits, one to Charlotte for the
transfer of up to 33 mgd, and one to the North Carolina
cities of Concord and Kannapolis for the transfer of 10
mgd. In addition, the complaint alleges, North Carolina’s
permitting statute “grandfathers” a 5 mgd transfer by the
CRWSP, and “implicitly authorize[s]” an unknown number
of transfers of less than 2 mgd. Complaint ¶¶18, 21, 22.
South Carolina claims that the net effect of these up­
stream transfers is to deprive South Carolina of its equi­
table share of the Catawba River’s water, particularly
during periods of drought or low river flow.
South Carolina seeks relief in the form of a decree that
equitably apportions the Catawba River between the two
States, enjoins North Carolina from authorizing transfers
of water from the Catawba River exceeding that State’s
equitable share, and declares North Carolina’s permitting
statute invalid to the extent it is used to authorize trans­
fers of water from the Catawba River that exceed North
Carolina’s equitable share. See generally Complaint,
Prayer for Relief ¶¶1–3. The complaint does not specify a
