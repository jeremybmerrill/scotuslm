Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 138, Orig.

STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, PLAINTIFF v. STATE 

OF NORTH CAROLINA 

ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER
[January 20, 2010]

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS,
JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, concur
ring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
The Court correctly rejects the Special Master’s formu
lation of a new test for intervention in original actions,
and correctly denies the city of Charlotte leave to inter
vene. The majority goes on, however, to misapply our
established test in granting intervention to Duke Energy
Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy), and the Catawba River
Water Supply Project (CRWSP).
The result is literally unprecedented: Even though
equitable apportionment actions are a significant part of
our original docket, this Court has never before granted
intervention in such a case to an entity other than a State,
the United States, or an Indian tribe. Never. That is
because the apportionment of an interstate waterway is a
sovereign dispute, and the key to intervention in such an
action is just that—sovereignty. The Court’s decision to
permit nonsovereigns to intervene in this case has the
potential to alter in a fundamental way the nature of our
original jurisdiction, transforming it from a means of
resolving high disputes between sovereigns into a forum
for airing private interests. Given the importance of
maintaining the proper limits on that jurisdiction, I re
spectfully dissent.
