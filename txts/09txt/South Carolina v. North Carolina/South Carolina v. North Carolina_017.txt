SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

ther State has sufficient interest in maintaining that
balance to represent the full scope of the CRWSP’s
interests.
Accordingly, we believe that the CRWSP should be
allowed to intervene to represent its own compelling inter­

We conclude, as well, that Duke Energy has demon­

we arrive at a “ ‘just and equitable apportionment’ ” of an
interstate stream. Colorado v. New Mexico, supra, at 183.
We do not approach the task in formulaic fashion, New

relevant factors,” including, but not limited to:
“ ‘physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive
use of water in the several sections of the river, the

tical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas,
[and] the damage to upstream areas as compared to
the benefits to downstream areas if a limitation is im­
posed on the former.’ ” Colorado v. New Mexico, su
pra, at 183 (quoting Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra, at
618).
In performing this task, there is no substitute for “ ‘the
exercise of an informed judgment,’ ” Colorado v. New
Mexico, supra, at 183, and we will not hesitate to seek out
the most relevant information from the source best situ­
ated to provide it. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S.,
at 745, n. 21 (allowing intervention of private pipeline
companies “in the interest of a full exposition of the
