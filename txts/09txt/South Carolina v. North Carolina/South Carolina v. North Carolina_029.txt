Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

The majority contends that the result in this case is not
a “new development,” and that its holding is supported by
“nearly 90 years” of precedent. Ante, at 6–7. But in sup
port of those statements, the majority cites only four
decisions in which the Court has granted a motion to
intervene in an original suit—and of course none in which
this Court granted the motion of a nonsovereign entity to
intervene in an equitable apportionment action. The cases
the majority cites demonstrate what constitutes a “compel
ling interest in [the intervenor’s] own right, apart from his
interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of
the state.” New Jersey v. New York, supra, at 373. But
the intervenor interests in those cases were quite different
from the general shared interest in water at issue here.
Take Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983). There
we allowed several Indian Tribes to intervene in a water
dispute. Id., at 615. As the Court in that case made clear,
however, the Indian Tribes were allowed to intervene
because they were sovereign entities. Ibid. The Court
distinguished New Jersey v. New York on that very
ground. See 460 U. S., at 615, n. 5.
The other cases relied upon by the majority are even
farther afield. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725
(1981); Texas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S. 465 (1976) (per cu
riam); Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574 (1922). None was
an equitable apportionment action. Two involved bound
ary disputes in which the Court allowed nonsovereign
intervenors to claim title to certain parcels of property.
See Texas v. Louisiana, supra, at 466 (permitting inter
vention by the city of Port Arthur, Texas); Oklahoma v.
Texas, supra, at 580–581 (same for private parties). A
claim to title in a particular piece of property is quite
different from a general interest shared by all citizens in
the State’s waters. And it would be particularly inapt to
—————— 

however, do not hold rights of this sort.
