SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

tion. Under 28 U. S. C. §1251, this Court exercises “origi­
nal and exclusive” jurisdiction to resolve controversies
between States that, if arising among independent na­
tions, “would be settled by treaty or by force.” Kansas v.
Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 98 (1907). This Court has de­
scribed its original jurisdiction as “delicate and grave,”
Louisiana v. Texas, 176 U. S. 1, 15 (1900), and has
guarded against its use as a forum in which “a state might
be judicially impeached on matters of policy by its own
subjects,” New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373. In
its sovereign capacity, a State represents the interests of
its citizens in an original action, the disposition of which
binds the citizens. Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra, at 22;
New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 372–373. A respect
for sovereign dignity, therefore, counsels in favor of re­
straint in allowing nonstate entities to intervene in such
disputes. See ibid.; accord, United States v. Texas, 143
U. S. 621, 643 (1892) (“[E]xclusive jurisdiction was given
to this court, because it best comported with the dignity of
a State, that a case in which it was a party should be
determined in the highest, rather than in a subordinate
judicial tribunal of the nation”).5
That the standard for intervention in original actions by
nonstate entities is high, however, does not mean that it is
insurmountable. Indeed, as the Special Master correctly
recognized, our practice long has been to allow such inter­
vention in compelling circumstances. See Oklahoma v.
——————
5 South Carolina has not invoked the Eleventh Amendment as a basis
for opposing intervention. It has noted, however, that the proposed
intervenors’ claims are, in effect, against South Carolina, and thus has
reserved the right to argue that the Eleventh Amendment bars particu­
lar forms of relief sought by the proposed intervenors. As in New Jersey
v. New York, 345 U. S. 369, 372 (1953) (per curiam), we express no view
whether the Eleventh Amendment is implicated where a nonstate
entity seeks to intervene as a defendant in an original action over a
State’s objection.
