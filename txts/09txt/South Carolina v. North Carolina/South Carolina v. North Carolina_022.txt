Opinion of the Court

III
We thus overrule South Carolina’s exceptions to the
Special Master’s First Interim Report with respect to the
CRWSP and Duke Energy, but we sustain South Caro­
lina’s exception with respect to Charlotte.
It is so ordered.

sult. This Court’s Rule 17.2 allows the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
to be taken as “guides” to procedure in original actions. See Arizona v.
California, 460 U. S. 605, 614 (1983). Even if we were to look to the
standard for intervention of right in civil matters, Charlotte would not
be entitled to intervene in this dispute because an existing party—
North Carolina—adequately represents Charlotte’s interest. See Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 24(a)(2). To the extent that the standard for permissive
intervention may be an appropriate guide when a movant presents a
sufficiently “important but ancillary concern,” see Arizona, supra, at
614–616, we find no such concern here. North Carolina’s adequate
representation of Charlotte and the heightened standard for interven­
tion in original actions, see New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373,
persuade us not to apply the standard for permissive intervention set
forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)(1)(B).
