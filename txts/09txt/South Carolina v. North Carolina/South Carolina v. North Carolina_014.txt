Opinion of the Court

Texas, 258 U. S., at 581. Over the “strong objections” of
three States, for example, the Court allowed Indian tribes
to intervene in a sovereign dispute concerning the equita­
ble apportionment of the Colorado River. Arizona v. Cali
fornia, 460 U. S., at 613. The Court did so notwithstand­
ing the Tribes’ simultaneous representation by the United
States. Id., at 608–609, 612. And in a boundary dispute
among Texas, Louisiana, and the United States, the Court
allowed the city of Port Arthur, Texas, to intervene for the
purpose of protecting its interests in islands in which the
United States claimed title. Texas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S.,
at 466; Texas v. Louisiana, 416 U. S. 965 (1974). In both
of these examples, the Court found compelling interests
that warranted allowing nonstate entities to intervene in
original actions in which the intervenors were nominally
represented by sovereign parties.

Applying the standard of New Jersey v. New York, su
pra, here, we conclude that the CRWSP has demonstrated
a sufficiently compelling interest that is unlike the inter­
ests of other citizens of the States. The CRWSP is an
unusual municipal entity, established as a joint venture
with the encouragement of regulatory authorities in both
States and designed to serve the increasing water needs of
Union County, North Carolina, and Lancaster County,
South Carolina. It has an advisory board consisting of
representatives from both counties, draws its revenues
from its bistate sales, and operates infrastructure and
assets that are owned by both counties as tenants-in­
common. We are told that approximately 100,000 indi­
viduals in each State receive their water from the CRWSP
and that “roughly half” of the CRWSP’s total withdrawals
of water from the Catawba River go to South Carolina
consumers. Reply of Catawba River Water Supply Project
