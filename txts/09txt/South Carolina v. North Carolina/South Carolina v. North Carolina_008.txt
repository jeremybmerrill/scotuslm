Opinion of the Court

Carolina could not represent the city’s interests effectively
because the State was duty bound to represent the inter­
ests of all North Carolina users of the Catawba River’s
water, including users whose interests were not aligned
with Charlotte’s. Id., at 17. South Carolina also opposed
Charlotte’s motion, and we referred it to the Special Mas­
ter. 552 U. S. 1254 (2008).
B
The Special Master held a hearing and issued an order
granting all three motions for leave to intervene. At South
Carolina’s request, the Special Master set forth her find­
ings and decision as a First Interim Report, and it is this
Report to which South Carolina now presents exceptions.
The Special Master recognized that this Court has
exercised jurisdiction over nonstate parties in original
actions between two or more States. She also recognized
that in New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S. 369, the Court
considered the “appropriate standard” for a nonstate
entity’s motion to intervene in an original action. First
Interim Report of Special Master, O. T. 2008, No. 138,
Orig., p. 12 (First Interim Rept.). But in attempting to
give context to our standard, she looked beyond interven­
tion and considered original actions in which the Court
has allowed nonstate entities to be named as defendants
by the complaining State. From those examples, the
Special Master “distilled the following rule” governing
motions to intervene in original actions by nonstate
entities:
“Although the Court’s original jurisdiction presump­
tively is reserved for disputes between sovereign
——————
Stat. 877, as added, 33 U. S. C. §1341, was not. North Carolina op­
posed this argument, and the Special Master did not rely on it in
recommending that Charlotte’s motion to intervene should be granted.
As Charlotte does not reassert this argument here, we do not consider
it.
