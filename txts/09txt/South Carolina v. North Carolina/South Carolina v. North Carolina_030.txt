SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

draw general conclusions about intervention from Okla
homa v. Texas, in which the Court took the southern half
of the Red River into receivership. See 258 U. S., at 580.
In subsequently allowing persons to intervene to assert
claims to the subject property, the Court relied explicitly
on the fact that the receiver had possession and control of
the claimed parcels, and “no other court lawfully [could]
interfere with or disturb that possession or control.” Id.,
at 581.
The majority’s reliance on Maryland v. Louisiana is
equally unavailing. There, several States challenged the
constitutionality of Louisiana’s application of a tax on
natural gas that was brought into that State. 451 U. S., at
728. In two sentences within a long footnote, the Court
mentioned that it was permitting a group of pipeline
companies to intervene and challenge the tax. Id., at 745,
n. 21. The Court made clear that the pipeline companies
were able to intervene in light of the particular circum
stances in that case—namely, Louisiana’s tax was “di
rectly imposed on the owner of imported gas,” and “the
pipelines most often own[ed] the gas.” Ibid. Again, an
interest in a tax imposed only on discrete parties is obvi
ously different from a general interest shared by all citi
zens of the State.

Charlotte, Duke Energy, and CRWSP claim a variety of
specific needs for water to justify their intervention. But
all those particular needs derive from an interest in the
water of the Catawba River. That interest is not exclu
sive, but is instead shared “with all other citizens and
creatures of the state.” New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S.,
at 373. The State’s “citizens and creatures” certainly put
the Catawba’s water and flow to different uses—many for
drinking water, some for farming or recreation, others for
generating power. That does not, however, make their
