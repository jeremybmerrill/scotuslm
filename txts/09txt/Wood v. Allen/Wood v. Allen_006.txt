Opinion of the Court

among other things, that he was mentally retarded and
not eligible for the death penalty, and that his trial coun
sel were ineffective under Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668 (1984), because they failed to investigate and
present evidence of his mental deficiencies during the
penalty phase of trial. App. to Pet. for Cert. 198a–202a,
207a–210a, 213a–216a, 220a–221a, 225a. The Rule 32
court held two evidentiary hearings and denied Wood’s
claims. On appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Ap
peals remanded for further consideration in light of Atkins
v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), which held that the
Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of the men

deficient or that any deficiency prejudiced his defense. Id.,
at 257a–275a. The court first made a factual finding that
Wood’s counsel had made a strategic decision not to pur
sue evidence of his alleged mental retardation. The court
observed that counsel had requested that a Dr. Karl Kirk
land conduct a mental evaluation, had “thoroughly re
viewed Dr. Kirkland’s report,” and had “determined that
nothing in that report merited further investigation.” Id.,
at 264a, 271a. The court additionally found that counsel
appeared to have made a strategic decision not to present
to the jury the limited evidence of Wood’s mental deficien
