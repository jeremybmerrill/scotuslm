WOOD v. ALLEN
Opinion of the Court

question whether the state court reasonably determined
that Wood’s counsel made a “strategic decision” not to
pursue or present evidence of his mental deficiencies. 556
U. S. __ (2009). Wood’s petition raised two additional
questions on which we declined to grant certiorari. Ibid.
Neither of these asked us to review whether the state
court’s resolution of Wood’s ineffective-assistance-of
counsel claim was “contrary to, or involved an unreason
able application of, clearly established Federal law” under
§2254(d)(1) and Strickland.

A

Notwithstanding statements we have made about the
relationship between §§2254(d)(2) and (e)(1) in cases that
did not squarely present the issue, see Brief for Petitioner
37–38; Brief for Respondents 28–29, we have explicitly left
open the question whether §2254(e)(1) applies in every
case presenting a challenge under §2254(d)(2), see Rice v.
Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 339 (2006). The parties and their
——————
v. Blackwell, 387 F. 3d 210, 235 (CA3 2004) (“§2254(d)(2)’s reasonable
ness determination turns on a consideration of the totality of the
‘evidence presented in the state-court proceeding,’ while §2254(e)(1)
contemplates a challenge to the state court’s individual factual deter
minations, including a challenge based wholly or in part on evidence
outside the state trial record”); Trussell v. Bowersox, 447 F. 3d 588, 591
(CA8) (federal habeas relief is available only “if the state court made ‘an
unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence pre
sented in the State court proceeding,’ 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2), which
requires clear and convincing evidence that the state court’s presump
tively correct factual finding lacks evidentiary support”), cert. denied,
549 U. S. 1034 (2006); Ben-Yisrayl v. Buss, 540 F. 3d 542, 549 (CA7
2008) (§2254(d)(2) can be satisfied by showing, under §2254(e)(1), that a
state-court decision “rests upon a determination of fact that lies against
the clear weight of the evidence” because such a decision “is, by defini
tion, a decision so inadequately supported by the record as to be arbi
trary and therefore objectively unreasonable” (internal quotation marks
omitted)).
