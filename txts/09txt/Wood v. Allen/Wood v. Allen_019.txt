STEVENS, J., dissenting

investigate Wood’s mental retardation further, but the
Court fails to engage with the requisite second question:
Does the record reasonably support finding that counsel’s
decision was a strategic one? The answer to this question
is unequivocally no.
Before petitioner’s trial, his counsel learned that Wood
had an “IQ in the borderline range of intellectual function
ing,” App. 327, and was “functioning, at most,” in this
borderline range, id., at 328. Wood was “reading on less
than a 3rd grade level.” Id., at 327. His former special
education teacher testified during postconviction review
that Wood was classified as “educable mentally retarded”
by the local school system. Id., at 403. In short, Wood has
the type of significant mental deficits that we recognize as
“inherently mitigating,” Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U. S. 274,
287 (2004).3
Despite the powerful mitigating value of this evidence,
“[n]o evidence of Wood’s mental retardation was ever
presented to the jury.” 542 F. 3d 1281, 1314 (CA11 2008)
(Barkett, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Coun
sel was clearly aware that this evidence existed, id., at
1318, but chose not to investigate it beyond the conclu
sions outlined in Dr. Kirkland’s report, App. 283. In the
Court’s view, the record reasonably supports the state
court’s conclusion that “counsel made a strategic decision
not to inquire further into” Wood’s mental deficiencies,
ante, at 12. Although I agree with the majority that the
failure was the result of a “decision,” albeit a hasty one,
the Court regrettably fails to consider whether the deci
sion was also “strategic” as a matter of fact.

3 Although Wood does not fall within the class of individuals we iden
tified in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), against whom the
death penalty may not be constitutionally imposed, “the reality that
[the defendant] was ‘borderline mentally retarded,’ might well . . .
influenc[e] the jury’s appraisal of his moral culpability.” Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 398 (2000).
