WOOD v. ALLEN
STEVENS, J., dissenting

A decision cannot be fairly characterized as “strategic”
unless it is a conscious choice between two legitimate and
rational alternatives. It must be borne of deliberation and
not happenstance, inattention, or neglect. See Wiggins,
539 U. S., at 526 (concluding that counsel’s “failure to
investigate thoroughly resulted from inattention, not
reasoned strategic judgment”); Strickland, 466 U. S., at
690–691. Moreover, “a cursory investigation” does not
“automatically justif[y] a tactical decision with respect to
sentencing strategy.” Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 527. Al
though we afford deference to counsel’s strategic decisions,
Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690–691, for this deference to
apply there must be some evidence that the decision was
just that: strategic.
The lawyers’ duty to conduct a thorough investigation of
possible mitigating evidence is well established by our
cases, Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per
curiam) (slip op., at 10); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374,
387 (2005); Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 522–523; Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 396 (2000); Strickland, 466 U. S., at
688. These cases also make clear that counsel’s unconsid
ered decision to fail to discharge that duty cannot be stra
tegic. The only conceivable strategy that might support
forgoing counsel’s ethical obligations under these circum
stances would be a reasoned conclusion that further inves
tigation is futile and thus a waste of valuable time. Cf. id.,
at 691 (recognizing that counsel’s decision to abandon an
investigation is entitled to deference “when a defendant
has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain
investigations would be fruitless or even harmful”). There
is no evidence in the record to suggest that Wood’s counsel
reached such a conclusion.4 See 542 F. 3d, at 1321–1322

4 The Court conflates the strategic decision to present mitigating
evidence to the jury with the strategic decision to investigate avenues
of mitigating evidence fully, see ante, at 11–12, n. 3. My concern is that
