HOLLY WOOD, PETITIONER v. RICHARD F. ALLEN,

COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF 

CORRECTIONS, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[January 20, 2010] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996 contains two provisions governing federal-court
review of state-court factual findings. Under 28 U. S. C.
§2254(d)(2), a federal court may not grant a state pris
oner’s application for a writ of habeas corpus based on a
claim already adjudicated on the merits in state court
unless that adjudication “resulted in a decision that was
based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in
light of the evidence presented in the State court proceed
ing.” Under §2254(e)(1), “a determination of a factual
issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be cor
rect,” and the petitioner “shall have the burden of rebut
ting the presumption of correctness by clear and convinc
ing evidence.” In this case, petitioner, a capital defendant,
challenges the key factual finding made by the Alabama
state court that denied his application for postconviction
relief: that his attorneys’ failure to pursue and present
mitigating evidence of his borderline mental retardation
was a strategic decision rather than a negligent omission.
