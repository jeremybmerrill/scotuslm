Opinion of the Court

amici have offered a variety of ways to read the relation
ship between these two provisions.2 Although we granted
certiorari to resolve the question of how §§2254(d)(2) and
(e)(1) fit together, we find once more that we need not
reach this question, because our view of the reasonable
ness of the state court’s factual determination in this case
does not turn on any interpretive difference regarding the
relationship between these provisions. For present pur
poses, we assume for the sake of argument that the factual
determination at issue should be reviewed, as Wood urges,
only under §2254(d)(2) and not under §2254(e)(1). We
conclude that, under §2254(d)(2), the state court’s finding
that Wood’s counsel made a strategic decision not to pur
sue or present evidence of Wood’s mental deficiencies was
not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of
the evidence presented in the state-court proceedings. We
therefore do not need to decide whether that determina
tion should be reviewed under the arguably more deferen
tial standard set out in §2254(e)(1).
As we have observed in related contexts, “[t]he term
‘unreasonable’ is no doubt difficult to define.” Williams v.

ever, that a state-court factual determination is not un

2 In

Wood’s view, when a petitioner seeks relief based entirely on the
state-court record, a federal court reviews the state court’s findings for
reasonableness under §2254(d)(2). Section 2254(e)(1) comes into play,
according to Wood, only when a petitioner challenges individual state
court factual findings based in part on evidence that is extrinsic to the
state-court record. Brief for Petitioner 38–39. According to respon
dents, §2254(e)(1) applies to any challenge to a state court’s factual
findings under §2254(d)(2), including a challenge based solely on the
state-court record. Brief for Respondents 35–37. Respondents’ amici
offer still further variations, although they all agree with respondents
that §2254(e)(1) applies in some fashion in every habeas case reviewing
state-court factual findings. Brief for Criminal Justice Legal Founda
tion as Amicus Curiae 5, 10–14; Brief for State of Indiana et al. as
Amici Curiae 2, 12–18.
