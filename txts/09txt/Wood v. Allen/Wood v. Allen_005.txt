WOOD v. ALLEN
Opinion of the Court

Petitioner argues that the state court’s finding was unrea
sonable under §2254(d)(2) and that, in denying his federal
habeas petition, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit erroneously conflated this standard with that of
§2254(e)(1), which petitioner contends is not applicable in
cases, such as this one, not involving a separate federal
habeas evidentiary hearing.
We granted certiorari to address the relationship be
tween §§2254(d)(2) and (e)(1). We conclude, however, that
the state court’s factual determination was reasonable
even under petitioner’s reading of §2254(d)(2), and there
fore we need not address that provision’s relationship to
§2254(e)(1). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeals on that basis.

In 1993, petitioner Holly Wood broke into the home of
his ex-girlfriend and shot her in the head and face as she
lay in her bed. The victim was pronounced dead on arrival
at the hospital. Charged with capital murder during a
first-degree burglary, Wood was represented at trial in
Alabama state court by three court-appointed attorneys:
Cary Dozier and Frank Ralph, both of whom had signifi

admitted to the bar for five months at the time he was
appointed. The jury convicted Wood at the guilt phase of
trial and recommended a death sentence at the penalty
phase by a vote of 10 to 2. After a separate sentencing
hearing, the trial judge imposed the death penalty. The
Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Wood’s
conviction and sentence, Ex parte Wood, 715 So. 2d 812
(1996), as did the Alabama Supreme Court, Wood v. State,
715 So. 2d 819 (1998). This Court denied certiorari. Wood
v. Alabama, 525 U. S. 1042 (1998).
Wood petitioned for state postconviction relief under
Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 (2009), arguing,
