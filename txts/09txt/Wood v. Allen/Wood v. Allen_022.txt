WOOD v. ALLEN
STEVENS, J., dissenting

Court correctly concluded that the failure to investigate
was the product of inattention and neglect by attorneys
preoccupied with other concerns and not the product of a
deliberate choice between two permissible alternatives.
For the state court to conclude otherwise was thus “an
unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the
evidence presented in the State court proceeding” within
the meaning of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2).6
I therefore respectfully dissent.

——————
6 I would also reach the same conclusion were I to agree with the
respondents and their amici that a habeas petitioner must pierce
§2254(e)(1)’s presumption of correctness with respect to state-court
findings of fact before he can proceed to show he is entitled to relief
under §2254(d)(2). See ante, at 9, n. 2.
