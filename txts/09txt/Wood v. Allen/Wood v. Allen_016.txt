Opinion of the Court

sional judgment under Strickland or whether the applica
tion of Strickland was reasonable under §2254(d)(1). Cf.
Rice, 546 U. S., at 342 (“The question whether a state
court errs in determining the facts is a different question
from whether it errs in applying the law”). These latter
two questions may be “related to the one petitione[r] pre
sented, and perhaps complementary to the one petitione[r]
presented,” but they are “not fairly included therein.” Yee
v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 537 (1992) (internal quotation
marks omitted).
It is true that Wood’s petition discussed the Eleventh
Circuit’s misapplication of §2254(d)(1) and Strickland.
Pet. for Cert. 22–27. But “the fact that [petitioner] dis
cussed this issue in the text of [his] petition for certiorari
does not bring it before us. Rule 14.1(a) requires that a
subsidiary question be fairly included in the question
presented for our review.” Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabu
shiki Kaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27, 31, n. 5
(1993) (per curiam). We therefore do not address Wood’s
argument that the state court unreasonably applied
Strickland in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel
claim on the merits.

Because the resolution of this case does not turn on
them, we leave for another day the questions of how and
when §2254(e)(1) applies in challenges to a state court’s
factual determinations under §2254(d)(2). We hold simply
that, even under petitioner’s reading of §2254(d)(2), the
state court’s conclusion that Wood’s counsel made a stra
tegic decision not to pursue or present evidence of his
mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable determina
tion of the facts. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of
the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
It is so ordered.
