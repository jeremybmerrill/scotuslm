attorney,” unassisted by senior counsel, “realized too

factual findings “based entirely on the state record,” the federal court
reviews those findings for reasonableness only under §2254(d)(2), but
where a petitioner challenges such findings based in part on evidence
that is extrinsic to the state-court record, §2254(e)(1) applies); Lambert
