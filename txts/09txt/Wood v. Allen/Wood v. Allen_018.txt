WOOD v. ALLEN
STEVENS, J., dissenting

may well be correct that the state court reasonably con
cluded that counsel made a decision not to pursue Dr.
Kirkland’s report for either guilt or penalty phase pur
poses, ante, at 10–12, but to reject Wood’s claim the state
court also had to reasonably conclude that such a decision
was borne of strategy. And whether counsel’s decision was
the product of strategy is a question of fact for purposes of
28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2).1 Cf. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S.
510, 526–527 (2003) (observing that “the ‘strategic deci
sion’ the state courts and respondents all invoke to justify
counsel’s limited pursuit of mitigating evidence resembles
more a post hoc rationalization of counsel’s conduct than
an accurate description of their deliberations prior to
sentencing”); Carr v. Schofield, 364 F. 3d 1246, 1264
(CA11 2004) (identifying “whether counsel’s decisions were
tactical or strategic” as a question of fact (citing Horton v.
Zant, 941 F. 2d 1449, 1462 (CA11 1991)));2 Berryman v.
Morton, 100 F. 3d 1089, 1095 (CA3 1996) (same). In other
words, the Court correctly concludes that the record rea
sonably supports a finding that counsel decided not to

1 The

Court explains: “Whether the state court reasonably determined
that there was a strategic decision under §2254(d)(2) is a different
question from whether the strategic decision itself was a reasonable
exercise of professional judgment under Strickland or whether the
application of Strickland was reasonable under §2254(d)(1).” Ante, at
12–13. I agree with the majority that whether a particular strategic
decision is reasonable or not is the Strickland question we would
address were we reviewing Wood’s claim for habeas relief under
§2254(d)(1).
2 Indeed, the law in the Eleventh Circuit on this point is well settled:
“ ‘The question of whether an attorney’s actions were actually the
product of a tactical or strategic decision is an issue of fact . . . . ’ ”
Fotopoulos v. Secretary, Dept. of Corrections, 516 F. 3d 1229, 1233
(CA11 2008) (quoting Provenzano v. Singletary, 148 F. 3d 1327, 1330
(CA11 1998)); see also Lamarca v. Secretary, Dept. of Corrections, 568
F. 3d 929, 938 (CA11 2009) (same). Thus, it is quite understandable
that Wood framed the questions presented in his petition for certiorari
as arising under §2254(d)(2).
