HOLLY WOOD, PETITIONER v. RICHARD F. ALLEN,

dissenting.
There is a world of difference between a decision not to
introduce evidence at the guilt phase of a trial and a fail

made a perfectly sensible decision not to introduce Dr.
Kirkland’s report into evidence or to call him as a witness.

also made a strategic decision to forgo investigating pow
erful mitigating evidence of Wood’s mental deficits for the
penalty phase. On the contrary, the only reasonable
factual conclusion I can draw from this record is that
counsel’s decision to do so was the result of inattention
and neglect. Because such a decision is the antithesis of a
“strategic” choice, I would reverse the decision of the Court
of Appeals.

was the product of a strategy is still before us. The Court
