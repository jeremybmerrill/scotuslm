report. Trotter testified that Dozier told him that nothing in the re
port merited further investigation, a recollection supported by the at
torneys’ contemporaneous letters; and Trotter told the sentencing
judge that counsel did not intend to introduce the report to the jury.
This evidence can fairly be read to support the Rule 32 court’s factual
determination that counsel’s failure to pursue or present evidence of
Wood’s mental deficiencies was not mere oversight or neglect but the
result of a deliberate decision to focus on other defenses. Most of the
contrary evidence Wood highlights—e.g., that Dozier and Ralph put
the inexperienced Trotter in charge of the penalty phase proceed
ings—speaks not to whether counsel made a strategic decision, but to
whether counsel’s judgment was reasonable, a question not before
this Court. Any evidence plausibly inconsistent with the strategic
decision finding does not suffice to show that the finding was unrea
sonable. Pp. 8–12.
2. Because Wood’s argument that the state court unreasonably ap
plied Strickland in rejecting his ineffective-assistance claim on the
merits is not “fairly included” in the questions presented under this
Court’s Rule 14.1(a), it will not be addressed here. Pp. 12–13.
