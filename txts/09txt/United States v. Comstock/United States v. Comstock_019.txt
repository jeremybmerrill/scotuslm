UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
Opinion of the Court

Necessary and Proper Clause when it “provides an alter
native to [otherwise] unsatisfactory options” that are
“obviously inefficient”).
Fourth, the statute properly accounts for state interests.
Respondents and the dissent contend that §4248 violates
the Tenth Amendment because it “invades the province of
state sovereignty” in an area typically left to state control.
New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 155 (1992); see
Brief for Respondents 35–47; post, at 7–8, 19–23 (THOMAS,
