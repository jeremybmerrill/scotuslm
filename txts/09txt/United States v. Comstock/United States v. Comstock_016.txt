Opinion of the Court

“release would endanger the safety of persons, property or
the public interest in general—not merely the interests
peculiar to the United States as such.” United States v.
Curry, 410 F. 2d 1372, 1374 (CA4 1969); see also Royal v.
United States, 274 F. 2d 846, 851–852 (CA10 1960).
In 1984, Congress modified these basic statutes. See
Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2057, 18
U. S. C. §§4241–4247 (2006 ed.). As relevant here, it
altered the provision just discussed, regarding the pris
oner’s danger to the “interests of the United States,” to
conform more closely to the then-existing judicial interpre
tation of that language, i.e., it altered the language so as
to authorize (explicitly) civil commitment if, in addition to
the other conditions, the prisoner’s “release would create a
substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or
serious damage to the property of another.” §4246(d).
Congress also elaborated upon the required condition
“that suitable arrangements . . . are not otherwise avail
able” by directing the Attorney General to seek alternative
placement in state facilities, as we have set forth above.
See ibid.; supra, at 2–3. With these modifications, the
statutes continue to authorize the civil commitment of
individuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous, once
they have been charged with, or convicted of, a federal
crime. §§4241(d), 4246; see also §4243(d). They continue
to provide for the continued civil commitment of those
individuals when they are “due for release” from federal
custody because their “sentence is about to expire.” §4246.
And, as we have previously set forth, they establish vari
ous procedural and other requirements. E.g., §4247.
In 2006, Congress enacted the particular statute before
us. §302, 120 Stat. 619, 18 U. S. C. §4248. It differs from
earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons
who, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.
Notably, many of these individuals were likely already
subject to civil commitment under §4246, which, since
