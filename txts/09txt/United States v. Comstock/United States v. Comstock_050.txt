THOMAS, J., dissenting

that interferes with a federal law that executes an enu
merated power or in a geographic location over which
Congress has plenary authority.10
In sum, the enumerated powers that justify a criminal
defendant’s arrest or conviction cannot justify his subse
quent civil detention under §4248.
B
The remaining “considerations” in the Court’s five-part
inquiry do not alter this conclusion.
1
First, in a final attempt to analogize §4248 to laws that
authorize the Federal Government to provide care and
treatment to prisoners while they await trial or serve a
criminal sentence, the Court cites the Second Restatement
of Torts for the proposition that the Federal Government
has a “custodial interest” in its prisoners, ante, at 22, and,
thus, a broad “constitutional power to act in order to pro
tect nearby (and other) communities” from the dangers

10 The Constitution grants Congress plenary authority over certain
jurisdictions where no other sovereign exists, including the District of
Columbia, Art. I, §8, cl. 17, and federal territories, Art. IV, §3, cl. 2. In
addition, Congress has “broad general powers to legislate in respect to
Indian tribes,” United States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (citing
Art. I, §8, cl. 3; Art. II, §2, cl. 2), including certain special responsibili
ties over “Indian country,” 18 U. S. C. §1151. Although the Necessary
and Proper Clause did not authorize Congress to enact §4248, I do not
rule out the possibility that Congress could provide for the civil com
mitment of individuals who enter federal custody as a result of acts
committed in these jurisdictions. See, e.g., United States v. Cohen, 733
F. 2d 128 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (upholding civil commitment of a
defendant under a District of Columbia statute authorizing the institu
tionalization of persons acquitted by reason of insanity). Although two
of the respondents in this case were either charged with or convicted of
criminal acts committed in such jurisdictions, see ante, at 3; 507
F. Supp. 2d 522, 527, and n. 2 (EDNC 2007), that question is not
presented here because §4248 does not make that fact essential to an
individual’s placement in civil detention.
