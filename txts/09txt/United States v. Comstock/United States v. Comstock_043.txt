UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
THOMAS, J., dissenting

To be sure, protecting society from violent sexual of
fenders is certainly an important end. Sexual abuse is a
despicable act with untold consequences for the victim
personally and society generally. See, e.g., Kennedy v.
Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2, (2008) (ALITO, J., dis
senting) (slip op., at 9, n. 2, 22–23). But the Constitution
does not vest in Congress the authority to protect society
from every bad act that might befall it.6 New York v.
United States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992) (“ ‘The question is
not what power the Federal Government ought to have
but what powers in fact have been given by the people’ ”
(quoting United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 63 (1936)).
In my view, this should decide the question. Section
4248 runs afoul of our settled understanding of Congress’
power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Congress
may act under that Clause only when its legislation
“carr[ies] into Execution” one of the Federal Government’s
enumerated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Section 4248 does
not execute any enumerated power. Section 4248 is there
fore unconstitutional.
III
The Court perfunctorily genuflects to McCulloch’s
framework for assessing Congress’ Necessary and Proper
Clause authority, and to the principle of dual sovereignty
it helps to maintain, then promptly abandons both in favor
of a novel five-factor test supporting its conclusion that
§4248 is a “ ‘necessary and proper’ ” adjunct to a jumble of
unenumerated “authorit[ies].” Ante, at 22. The Court’s
newly minted test cannot be reconciled with the Clause’s
plain text or with two centuries of our precedents inter
——————
6 The absence of a constitutional delegation of general police power to
Congress does not leave citizens vulnerable to the harms Congress
seeks to regulate in §4248 because, as recent legislation indicates, the
States have the capacity to address the threat that sexual offenders
pose. See n. 15, infra.
