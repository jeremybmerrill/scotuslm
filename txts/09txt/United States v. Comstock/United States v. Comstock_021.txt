UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
Opinion of the Court

Petitioner in Greenwood, supra, at 25 (“What has really
happened is that the Federal government has been dissat
isfied with the care given by the states to those mentally
incompetent who have been released by the Federal au
thorities”). Here, by contrast, as we have explained, §4248
requires the Attorney General to encourage the relevant
States to take custody of the individual without inquiring
into the “suitability” of their intended care or treatment,
and to relinquish federal authority whenever a State
asserts its own. §4248(d). Thus, if the statute at issue in
Greenwood did not invade state interests, then, a fortiori,
neither does §4248.
Fifth, the links between §4248 and an enumerated
Article I power are not too attenuated. Neither is the
statutory provision too sweeping in its scope. Invoking the
cautionary instruction that we may not “pile inference
upon inference” in order to sustain congressional action
under Article I, Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567, respondents
argue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary
and Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more
than one step removed from a specifically enumerated
power. See Brief for Respondents 21–22; Tr. of Oral Arg.
27–28. But this argument is irreconcilable with our prece
dents. Again, take Greenwood as an example. In that
case we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of
a mentally incompetent federal defendant who was ac
cused of robbing a United States Post Office. 350 U. S., at
369, 375. The underlying enumerated Article I power was
the power to “Establish Post Offices and Post Roads.”
Art. I, §8, cl. 7. But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized
in McCulloch,
“the power ‘to establish post offices and post roads’
. . . is executed by the single act of making the estab
lishment. . . . [F]rom this has been inferred the power
and duty of carrying the mail along the post road,
