UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
Opinion of the Court

1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal
prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are
thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). But
cf. H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt. 1, p. 29 (2005). Aside from
its specific focus on sexually dangerous persons, §4248 is
similar to the provisions first enacted in 1949. Cf. §4246.
In that respect, it is a modest addition to a longstanding
federal statutory framework, which has been in place
since 1855.
Third, Congress reasonably extended its longstanding
civil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually
dangerous persons who are already in federal custody,
even if doing so detains them beyond the termination of
their criminal sentence. For one thing, the Federal Gov
ernment is the custodian of its prisoners. As federal cus
todian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to
protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger
federal prisoners may pose. Cf. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457
U. S. 307, 320 (1982) (“In operating an institution such as
[a prison system], there are occasions in which it is neces
sary for the State to restrain the movement of residents—
for example, to protect them as well as others from vio
lence” (emphasis added)). Indeed, at common law, one
“who takes charge of a third person” is “under a duty to
exercise reasonable care to control” that person to prevent
him from causing reasonably foreseeable “bodily harm to
others.”
Restatement (Second) of Torts §319, p. 129
(1963–1964); see Volungus, 595 F. 3d, at 7–8 (citing cases);
see also United States v. S. A., 129 F. 3d 995, 999 (CA8
1997) (“[Congress enacted §4246] to avert the public dan
ger likely to ensue from the release of mentally ill and
dangerous detainees”). If a federal prisoner is infected
with a communicable disease that threatens others, surely
it would be “necessary and proper” for the Federal Gov
ernment to take action, pursuant to its role as federal
custodian, to refuse (at least until the threat diminishes)
