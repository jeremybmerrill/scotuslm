UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. GRAYDON 

EARL COMSTOCK, JR., ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[May 17, 2010] 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.
I am concerned about the breadth of the Court’s lan
guage, see ante, at 2–4 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judg
ment), and the ambiguity of the standard that the Court
applies, see post, at 9 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), but I am
persuaded, on narrow grounds, that it was “necessary and
proper” for Congress to enact the statute at issue in this
case, 18 U. S. C. §4248, in order to “carr[y] into Execution”
powers specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitu
tion, see Art. I, §8, cl. 18.
Section 4248 was enacted to protect the public from
federal prisoners who suffer from “a serious mental ill
ness, abnormality, or disorder” and who, if released, would
have “serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent
conduct or child molestation.”
See §§4247(a)(5), (6),
4248(d). Under this law, if neither the State of a pris
oner’s domicile nor the State in which the prisoner was
tried will assume the responsibility for the prisoner’s
“custody, care, and treatment,” the Federal Government is
authorized to undertake that responsibility. §4248(d).
The statute recognizes that, in many cases, no State will
assume the heavy financial burden of civilly committing a
dangerous federal prisoner who, as a result of lengthy
federal incarceration, no longer has any substantial ties to
any State.
