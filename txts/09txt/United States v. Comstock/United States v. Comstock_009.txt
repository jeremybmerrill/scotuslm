UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
Opinion of the Court

Marshall emphasized that the word “necessary” does not
mean “absolutely necessary.” Id., at 413–415 (emphasis
deleted); Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462
(2003) (“[W]e long ago rejected the view that the Neces
sary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress
be ‘ “absolutely necessary” ’ to the exercise of an enumer
ated power”). In language that has come to define the
scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, he wrote:
“Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of
the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not
prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the
constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch, supra, at
421.
We have since made clear that, in determining whether
the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the
legislative authority to enact a particular federal statute,
we look to see whether the statute constitutes a means
that is rationally related to the implementation of a con
stitutionally enumerated power. Sabri v. United States,
541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004) (using term “means-ends ration
ality” to describe the necessary relationship); ibid. (up
holding Congress’ “authority under the Necessary and
Proper Clause” to enact a criminal statute in furtherance
of the federal power granted by the Spending Clause); see
Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 22 (2005) (holding that
because “Congress had a rational basis” for concluding
that a statute implements Commerce Clause power, the
statute falls within the scope of congressional “authority to
‘make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper’ to
‘regulate Commerce . . . among the several States’ ” (ellip
sis in original)); see also United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.
549, 557 (1995); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Rec
lamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981).
Of course, as Chief Justice Marshall stated, a federal
