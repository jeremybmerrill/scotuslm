UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
THOMAS, J., dissenting

see ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (noting
that many federal prisoners, “as a result of lengthy federal
incarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any
State”). I disagree with the premise of that argument. As
an initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional
authority to “take charge” of a federal prisoner released
within their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that pow
ers not delegated to the Federal Government are “re
served” to the States, and to the people). In addition, the
assumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise
that authority is, in my view, implausible. The Govern
ment stated at oral argument that its “default position” is
to release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was
convicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR §2.33(b)
(2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue
that a State has the power to refuse such a person domi
cile within its borders. Thus, they appear to assume that,
in the absence of 18 U. S. C. §4248, a State would take no
action when informed by the BOP that a sexually danger
ous federal prisoner was about to be released within its
jurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state laws enacted
in recent decades to protect communities from sex offend
ers,15 the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite

15 As

we have noted before, all 50 States have developed “some varia
tion” of a system “for mandatory registration of sex offenders and
corresponding community notification.” Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89–
90 (2003). In addition, several States have taken further steps; some
impose residency restrictions on sex offenders, see, e.g., Kennedy v.
Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___ , ___, n. 5 (2008) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip
op., at 11, n. 5) (collecting statutes), and, most relevant here, 22 States
have enacted involuntary civil-commitment laws substantially similar
to §4248, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §36–3701 et seq. (West 2009); Cal.
Welf. & Inst. Code Ann. §6600 et seq. (West 1988 and Supp. 2010); Fla.
Stat. §394.910 et seq. (2007); Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann., ch. 725, §205 et seq.
(West 2008); Iowa Code §229A (2009); Kan. Stat. Ann. §59–29a01 et
seq. (2005 and 2008 Cum. Supp.); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 123A (West
2008); Minn. Stat. §253B (2008 and 2009 Supp.); Mo. Rev. Stat.
