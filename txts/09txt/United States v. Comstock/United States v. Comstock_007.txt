UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
Opinion of the Court

Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil
commitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They
claimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, crimi
nal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates
the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause,
and the Sixth and Eighth Amendments. 507 F. Supp. 2d,
at 528. They claimed that the statute denies them sub
stantive due process and equal protection of the laws.
Ibid. They claimed that it violates their procedural due
process rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerous
ness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead
of by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid. And, finally,
they claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress ex
ceeded the powers granted to it by Art. I, §8 of the Consti
tution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause
and the Necessary and Proper Clause. 507 F. Supp. 2d, at
528–529.
The District Court, accepting two of the respondents’
claims, granted their motion to dismiss. It agreed with
respondents that the Constitution requires proof beyond a
reasonable doubt, id., at 551–559 (citing In re Winship,
397 U. S. 358 (1970)), and it agreed that, in enacting the
statute, Congress exceeded its Article I legislative powers,
507 F. Supp. 2d, at 530–551. On appeal, the Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal on
this latter, legislative-power ground. 551 F. 3d 274, 278–
284 (2009). It did not decide the standard-of-proof ques
tion, nor did it address any of respondents’ other constitu
tional challenges. Id., at 276, n. 1.
The Government sought certiorari, and we granted its
request, limited to the question of Congress’ authority
under Art. I, §8 of the Constitution. Pet. for Cert. i. Since
then, two other Courts of Appeals have considered that
same question, each deciding it in the Government’s favor,
thereby creating a split of authority among the Circuits.
