Syllabus
congressional determination alone.” Burroughs v. United States, 290
U. S. 534, 547–548. Thus, although the Constitution nowhere grants
Congress express power to create federal crimes beyond those specifi
cally enumerated, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to
provide appropriately for those imprisoned, or to maintain the secu
rity of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the
federal imprisonment of others, Congress possesses broad authority
to do each of those things under the Clause. Pp. 5–9.
(2) Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental
health care to federal prisoners, and has long provided for their civil
commitment. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; Insanity De
fense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. §§4241–4247. A longstanding
history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s con
stitutionality, see, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397
U. S. 664, 678, but can be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a
congressional statutory scheme,” Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 21,
and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the
new statute and pre-existing federal interests. Section 4248 differs
from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due
to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous. Many of these individu
als, however, were likely already subject to civil commitment under
§4246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention
of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are
thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). The similarities
between §4246 and §4248 demonstrate that the latter is a modest
addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework. Pp. 9–14.
(3) There are sound reasons for §4248’s enactment. The Federal
Government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional
power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from
the danger such prisoners may pose. Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably
adapted” to Congress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian.
United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 121. Congress could have rea
sonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental ill
ness that causes them to “have serious difficulty in refraining from
sexually violent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high
danger to the public if released. And Congress could also have rea
sonably concluded that a reasonable number of such individuals
would likely not be detained by the States if released from federal
custody. Congress’ desire to address these specific challenges, taken
together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the
conclusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end rationality,”
Sabri, supra, at 605. Pp. 14–16.
(4) Respondents’ contention that §4248 violates the Tenth Amend
ment because it invades the province of state sovereignty in an area
