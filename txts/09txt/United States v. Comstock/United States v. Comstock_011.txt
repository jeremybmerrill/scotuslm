UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
Opinion of the Court

McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 416 (“All admit that the govern
ment may, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws;
and yet, this is not among the enumerated powers of
Congress”); see also United States v. Fox, 95 U. S. 670, 672
(1878). And Congress routinely exercises its authority to
enact criminal laws in furtherance of, for example, its
enumerated powers to regulate interstate and foreign
commerce, to enforce civil rights, to spend funds for the
general welfare, to establish federal courts, to establish
post offices, to regulate bankruptcy, to regulate naturali
zation, and so forth. Art. I, §8, cls. 1, 3, 4, 7, 9; Amdts. 13–
15. See, e.g., Lottery Case, supra (upholding criminal
statute enacted in furtherance of the Commerce Clause);
Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651 (1884) (upholding
Congress’ authority to enact Rev. Stat. §5508, currently 18
U. S. C. §241 (criminalizing civil-rights violations) and
Rev. Stat. §5520, currently 42 U. S. C. §1973j (criminaliz
ing voting-rights violations) in furtherance of the Four
teenth and Fifteenth Amendments); Sabri, supra, (uphold
ing criminal statute enacted in furtherance of the
Spending Clause); Jinks, supra, at 462, n. 2 (citing
McCulloch, supra, at 417) (describing perjury and witness
tampering as federal crimes enacted in furtherance of the
power to constitute federal tribunals); see also 18 U. S. C.
§1691 et seq. (postal crimes); §151 et seq. (bankruptcy
crimes); 8 U. S. C. §§1324–1328 (immigration crimes).
Similarly, Congress, in order to help ensure the en
forcement of federal criminal laws enacted in furtherance
of its enumerated powers, “can cause a prison to be erected
at any place within the jurisdiction of the United States,
and direct that all persons sentenced to imprisonment
under the laws of the United States shall be confined
there.” Ex parte Karstendick, 93 U. S. 396, 400 (1876).
Moreover, Congress, having established a prison system,
can enact laws that seek to ensure that system’s safe and
responsible administration by, for example, requiring
