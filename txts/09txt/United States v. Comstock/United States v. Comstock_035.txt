UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

for years in a federal prison, often had few ties to any
State; it was a matter of speculation where they would
choose to go upon release; and accordingly no State was
enthusiastic about volunteering to shoulder the burden of
civil commitment.
The Necessary and Proper Clause does not give Con
gress carte blanche. Although the term “necessary” does
not mean “absolutely necessary” or indispensable, the
term requires an “appropriate” link between a power
conferred by the Constitution and the law enacted by
Congress. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415
(1819). And it is an obligation of this Court to enforce
compliance with that limitation. Id., at 423.
The law in question here satisfies that requirement.
This is not a case in which it is merely possible for a court
to think of a rational basis on which Congress might have
perceived an attenuated link between the powers underly
ing the federal criminal statutes and the challenged civil
commitment provision. Here, there is a substantial link to
Congress’ constitutional powers.
For this reason, I concur in the judgment that Congress
had the constitutional authority to enact 18 U. S. C.
§4248.
