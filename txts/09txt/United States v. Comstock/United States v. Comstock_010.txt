Opinion of the Court

statute, in addition to being authorized by Art. I, §8, must
also “not [be] prohibited” by the Constitution. McCulloch,
supra, at 421. But as we have already stated, the present
statute’s validity under provisions of the Constitution
other than the Necessary and Proper Clause is an issue
that is not before us. Under the question presented, the
relevant inquiry is simply “whether the means chosen are
‘reasonably adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end
under the commerce power” or under other powers that
the Constitution grants Congress the authority to imple
ment. Gonzales, supra, at 37 (SCALIA, J., concurring in
judgment) (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100,
121 (1941)).
We have also recognized that the Constitution “ad
dresse[s]” the “choice of means”
“primarily . . . to the judgment of Congress. If it can
be seen that the means adopted are really calculated
to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the ex
tent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of
the relationship between the means adopted and the
end to be attained, are matters for congressional de
termination alone.” Burroughs v. United States, 290
U. S. 534, 547–548 (1934).
See also Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355 (1903) (“[T]he
Constitution . . . . leaves to Congress a large discretion as
to the means that may be employed in executing a given
power”); Morrison, supra, at 607 (applying a “presumption
of constitutionality” when examining the scope of Con
gressional power); McCulloch, supra, at 410, 421.
Thus, the Constitution, which nowhere speaks explicitly
about the creation of federal crimes beyond those related
to “counterfeiting,” “treason,” or “Piracies and Felonies
committed on the high Seas” or “against the Law of Na
tions,” Art. I, §8, cls. 6, 10; Art. III, §3, nonetheless grants
Congress broad authority to create such crimes. See
