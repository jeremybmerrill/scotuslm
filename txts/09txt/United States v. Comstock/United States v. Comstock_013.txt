UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
Opinion of the Court

mental health care to federal prisoners, and has long
provided for their civil commitment. In 1855 it estab
lished Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in the District of Colum
bia to provide treatment to “the insane of the army and
navy . . . and of the District of Columbia.” Act of Mar. 3,
1855, 10 Stat. 682; 39 Stat. 309. In 1857 it provided for
confinement at Saint Elizabeth’s of any person within the
District of Columbia who had been “charged with [a]
crime” and who was “insane” or later became “insane
during the continuance of his or her sentence in the
United States penitentiary.” Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11
Stat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881). In
1874, expanding the geographic scope of its statutes,
Congress provided for civil commitment in federal facili
ties (or in state facilities if a State so agreed) of “all per
sons who have been or shall be convicted of any offense in
any court of the United States” and who are or “shall
become” insane “during the term of their imprisonment.”
Act of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251 (emphasis
added). And in 1882 Congress provided for similar com
mitment of those “charged” with federal offenses who
become “insane” while in the “custody” of the United
States. Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330 (emphasis
added). Thus, over the span of three decades, Congress
created a national, federal civil-commitment program
under which any person who was either charged with or
convicted of any federal offense in any federal court could
be confined in a federal mental institution.
These statutes did not raise the question presented
here, for they all provided that commitment in a federal
hospital would end upon the completion of the relevant
“terms” of federal “imprisonment” as set forth in the un
derlying criminal sentence or statute. §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252;
see 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); cf. 30 Op. Atty. Gen.
569, 571 (1916). But in the mid-1940’s that proviso was
eliminated.
