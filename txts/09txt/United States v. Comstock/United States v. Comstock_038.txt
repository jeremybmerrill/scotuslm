THOMAS, J., dissenting

Court’s definitive interpretation of that text:
“Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of
the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not
prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the
constitution, are constitutional.” 4 Wheat., at 421.
McCulloch’s summation is descriptive of the Clause
itself, providing that federal legislation is a valid exercise
of Congress’ authority under the Clause if it satisfies a
two-part test: First, the law must be directed toward a
“legitimate” end, which McCulloch defines as one “within
the scope of the [C]onstitution”—that is, the powers ex
pressly delegated to the Federal Government by some
provision in the Constitution. Second, there must be a
necessary and proper fit between the “means” (the federal
law) and the “end” (the enumerated power or powers) it is
designed to serve. Ibid. McCulloch accords Congress a
certain amount of discretion in assessing means-end fit
under this second inquiry. The means Congress selects
will be deemed “necessary” if they are “appropriate” and
“plainly adapted” to the exercise of an enumerated power,
and “proper” if they are not otherwise “prohibited” by the
Constitution and not “[in]consistent” with its “letter and
spirit.” Ibid.
Critically, however, McCulloch underscores the linear
relationship the Clause establishes between the two in
quiries: Unless the end itself is “legitimate,” the fit be
tween means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no
matter how “necessary” or “proper” an Act of Congress
may be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legis
late if the objective is anything other than “carrying into
Execution” one or more of the Federal Government’s enu
merated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18.
This limitation was of utmost importance to the Fram
ers.
