Opinion of the Court

prisoners to receive medical care and educational training,
see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §§4005–4006; §4042(a)(3), and can
also ensure the safety of the prisoners, prison workers and
visitors, and those in surrounding communities by, for
example, creating further criminal laws governing entry,
exit, and smuggling, and by employing prison guards to
ensure discipline and security. See, e.g., §1791 (prohibit
ing smuggling contraband); §751 et seq. (prohibiting es

to Art. I analysis). A history of involvement, however, can
nonetheless be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a
congressional statutory scheme,” Gonzales, 545 U. S., at
21; Walz, supra, at 678, and, in particular, the reason
ableness of the relation between the new statute and pre
existing federal interests.
Here, Congress has long been involved in the delivery of
