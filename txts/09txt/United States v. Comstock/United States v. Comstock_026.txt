UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. GRAYDON 

EARL COMSTOCK, JR., ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[May 17, 2010] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in the judgment.
The Court is correct, in my view, to hold that the chal
lenged portions of 18 U. S. C. §4248 are necessary and
proper exercises of congressional authority.
Respondents argue that congressional authority under
the Necessary and Proper Clause can be no more than one
step removed from an enumerated power. This is incor
rect. When the inquiry is whether a federal law has suffi
cient links to an enumerated power to be within the scope
of federal authority, the analysis depends not on the num
ber of links in the congressional-power chain but on the
strength of the chain.
Concluding that a relation can be put into a verbal
formulation that fits somewhere along a causal chain of
federal powers is merely the beginning, not the end, of the
constitutional inquiry. See United States v. Lopez, 514
U. S. 549, 566–567 (1995). The inferences must be con
trolled by some limitations lest, as Thomas Jefferson
warned, congressional powers become completely un
bounded by linking one power to another ad infinitum in a
veritable game of “ ‘this is the house that Jack built.’ ”

30, 1800), 31 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 547 (B.
