THOMAS, J., dissenting

remote. But even in the event a State made such a deci
sion, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that
decision, and its consequences, to the state government
alone.
Next, the Court submits that §4248 does not upset the
balance of federalism or invade the States’ reserved pow
ers because it “requires accommodation of state interests”
by instructing the Attorney General to release a commit
ted person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried
if that State wishes to “ ‘assume . . . responsibility’ ” for
him. Ante, at 17 (quoting §4248(d)). This right of first
refusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (“It is
not the usual course that the State does take responsibil
ity”). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assur
ance that §4248 preserves the principle of dual sover
eignty—the “letter and spirit” of the Constitution—as the
Necessary and Proper Clause requires.16 McCulloch, 4

16 The Court describes my argument as a claim that “§4248 violates
the Tenth Amendment.” Ante, at 16. Yet, I agree entirely with the
Court that “ ‘it makes no difference whether one views the question at
issue [here] as one of ascertaining the limits of the power delegated to
the Federal Government under the affirmative provisions of the Consti
tution or one of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the
States under the Tenth Amendment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting New York v.
United States, 505 U. S. 144, 159 (1992)). Section 4248 is unconstitu
tional because it does not “carr[y] into Execution” an enumerated
power. Therefore, it necessarily intrudes upon the powers our Consti
tution reserves to the States and to the people.
