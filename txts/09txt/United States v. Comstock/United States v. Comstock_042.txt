THOMAS, J., dissenting

Government has never argued otherwise, see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 21–22.5
This Court, moreover, consistently has recognized that
the power to care for the mentally ill and, where neces
sary, the power “to protect the community from the dan
gerous tendencies of some” mentally ill persons, are
among the numerous powers that remain with the States.
Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 426 (1979). As a conse
quence, we have held that States may “take measures to
restrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill”—
including those who are sexually dangerous—provided
that such commitments satisfy due process and other
constitutional requirements. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521
U. S. 346, 363 (1997).
Section 4248 closely resembles the involuntary civil
commitment laws that States have enacted under their
parens patriae and general police powers. Indeed, it is
clear, on the face of the Act and in the Government’s
arguments urging its constitutionality, that §4248 is
aimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence,
not toward “carrying into Execution” any enumerated
power or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam
Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat.
587 (entitled “[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual
exploitation and violent crime”), §102, id., at 590 (state
ment of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated
“to protect the public from sex offenders”); Brief for United
States 38–39 (asserting the Federal Government’s power
to “protect the public from harm that might result upon
these prisoners’ release, even when that harm might arise
from conduct that is otherwise beyond the general regula
tory powers of the federal government” (emphasis added)).
——————
5 For the reasons explained in Part III–A–2, infra, the enumerated
power that justifies a particular defendant’s criminal arrest or convic
tion cannot justify his subsequent civil detention under §4248.
