Opinion of the Court

And its reach is limited to individuals already “in the
custody of the” Federal Government. §4248(a); Tr. of Oral
Arg. 7 (“[Federal authority for §4248] has always de
pended on the fact of Federal custody, on the fact that this
person has entered the criminal justice system . . .”).
Indeed, the Solicitor General argues that “the Federal
Government would not have . . . the power to commit a
person who . . . has been released from prison and whose
period of supervised release is also completed.” Id., at 9.
Thus, far from a “general police power,” §4248 is a rea
sonably adapted and narrowly tailored means of pursuing
the Government’s legitimate interest as a federal custo
dian in the responsible administration of its prison
system.
To be sure, as we have previously acknowledged,
“The Federal Government undertakes activities today
that would have been unimaginable to the Framers in
two senses; first, because the Framers would not have
conceived that any government would conduct such
activities; and second, because the Framers would not
have believed that the Federal Government, rather
than the States, would assume such responsibilities.
Yet the powers conferred upon the Federal Govern
ment by the Constitution were phrased in language
broad enough to allow for the expansion of the Federal
Government’s role.” New York, 505 U. S., at 157.
The Framers demonstrated considerable foresight in
drafting a Constitution capable of such resilience through
time. As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly 200 years
ago, the Necessary and Proper Clause is part of “a consti
tution intended to endure for ages to come, and, conse
quently, to be adapted to the various crises of human
affairs.” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415 (emphasis deleted).
