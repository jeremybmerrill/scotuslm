Committee Report 11, App. 73; see also Report of the
Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges 13 (1945).
Between 1948 and 1949, following its receipt of the
Judicial Conference report, Congress modified the law.
See Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 855, 18 U. S. C. §§4241–

the property, or other interests of the United States,
and that suitable arrangements for the custody and
