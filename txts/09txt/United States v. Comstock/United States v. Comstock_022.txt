Opinion of the Court

from one post office to another.
And, from
this implied power, has again been inferred the right
to punish those who steal letters from the post office,
or rob the mail.” 4 Wheat., at 417 (emphasis added).
And, as we have explained, from the implied power to
punish we have further inferred both the power to im
prison, see supra, at 8–9, and, in Greenwood, the federal
civil-commitment power.
Our necessary and proper jurisprudence contains multi
ple examples of similar reasoning. For example, in Sabri
we observed that “Congress has authority under the
Spending Clause to appropriate federal moneys” and that
it therefore “has corresponding authority under the Neces
sary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars”
are not “siphoned off” by “corrupt public officers.” 541
U. S., at 605 (citation omitted). We then further held that,
in aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of “tax
payer dollars,” Congress has the additional prophylactic
power to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the
stolen funds have not been “traceably skimmed from
specific federal payments.” Ibid. Similarly, in United
States v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343 (1879), we held that the Neces
sary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in
furtherance of Art. I, §8, cls. 11–13, to award “pensions to
the wounded and disabled” soldiers of the armed forces
and their dependents, 98 U. S. at 351; and from that im
plied power we further inferred the “[i]mplied power” “to
pass laws to . . . punish” anyone who fraudulently appro
priated such pensions, id., at 346. See also Stewart v.
Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 506–507 (1871).
Indeed even the dissent acknowledges that Congress
has the implied power to criminalize any conduct that
might interfere with the exercise of an enumerated power,
and also the additional power to imprison people who
violate those (inferentially authorized) laws, and the
