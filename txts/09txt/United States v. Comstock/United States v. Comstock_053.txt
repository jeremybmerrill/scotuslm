UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
THOMAS, J., dissenting

District of Columbia. Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682.
But Congress was acting pursuant to enumerated powers
when it took this step. See Art. I, §8, cl. 17 (granting
Congress plenary authority over the District of Columbia);
Art. I, §8, cl. 14 (authorizing Congress to “make Rules for
the Government and Regulation of the land and naval
Forces”). This enactment therefore provides no support
for Congress’ claimed power to detain sexually dangerous
persons without an otherwise valid basis for jurisdiction.
Later, Congress provided for the federal civil commit
ment of “insane” persons charged with or convicted of a
federal crime. Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11 Stat. 158; see
17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881); Act of June 23,
1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251; Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat.
330. As the Court explains, however, these statutes did
not authorize federal custody beyond the completion of the
“term” of federal “imprisonment,” §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252; see
35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569,
570–571 (1916); Act of May 13, 1930, ch. 254, §6, 46 Stat.
271, and thus shed no light on the question presented
here.
In 1949, Congress enacted a more comprehensive re
gime, authorizing the civil commitment of mentally ill
persons in BOP custody. See 18 U. S. C. §§4246, 4247
(1952 ed.). This Court addressed that regime in Green
wood, but never endorsed the proposition that the Federal
Government could rely on that statute to detain a person
in the absence of a pending criminal charge or ongoing
criminal sentence.14

14 In addition, at least some courts questioned the Federal Govern
ment’s power to detain a person in such circumstances. See Dixon v.
Steele, 104 F. Supp. 904, 908 (WD Mo. 1952) (holding that the Federal
Government lacked authority to detain an individual declared mentally
unfit to stand trial once it was determined that he was unlikely to
recover in time to be prosecuted); Higgins v. United States, 205 F. 2d
650, 653 (CA9 1953) (avoiding this constitutional question by interpret
