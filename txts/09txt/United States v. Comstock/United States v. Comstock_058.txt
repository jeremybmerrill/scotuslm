THOMAS, J., dissenting

mediate and visible guardian” of those liberties because
federal powers extend no further than those enumerated
in the Constitution. The Federalist No. 17, at 169 (A.
Hamilton). The Constitution gives States no more power
to decline this responsibility than it gives them to infringe
upon those liberties in the first instance. FTC v. Ticor
Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 636 (1992) (“Federalism
serves to assign political responsibility, not to obscure it”).
Absent congressional action that is in accordance with,
or necessary and proper to, an enumerated power, the
duty to protect citizens from violent crime, including acts
of sexual violence, belongs solely to the States. Morrison,
529 U. S., at 618 (“[W]e can think of no better example of
the police power, which the Founders denied the National
Government and reposed in the States, than the suppres
sion of violent crime”); see Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat.
264, 426 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (stating that Congress
has “no general right to punish murder committed within
any of the States”).

Not long ago, this Court described the Necessary and
Proper Clause as “the last, best hope of those who defend
ultra vires congressional action.” Printz, supra, at 923.
Regrettably, today’s opinion breathes new life into that
Clause, and—the Court’s protestations to the contrary
notwithstanding, see ante, at 18—comes perilously close to
transforming the Necessary and Proper Clause into a
basis for the federal police power that “we always have
rejected,” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 584 (THOMAS, J., concur
ring) (citing Gregory, supra, at 457; Wirtz, 392 U. S., at
196; Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S., at 37). In so
doing, the Court endorses the precise abuse of power
Article I is designed to prevent—the use of a limited grant
of authority as a “pretext . . . for the accomplishment of
objects not intrusted to the government.” McCulloch,
supra, at 423.
I respectfully dissent.
