Syllabus
typically left to state control is rejected. That Amendment does not
“reserve to the States” those powers that are “delegated to the United
States by the Constitution,” including the powers delegated by the
Necessary and Proper Clause. See, e.g., New York v. United States,
505 U. S. 144, 159. And §4248 does not “invade” state sovereignty,
but rather requires accommodation of state interests: Among other
things, it directs the Attorney General to inform the States where the
federal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” of his detention, §4248(d),
and gives either State the right, at any time, to assert its authority
over the individual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate
transfer to State custody, §4248(d)(1). In Greenwood v. United
States, 350 U. S. 366, 375–376, the Court rejected a similar challenge
to §4248’s predecessor, the 1949 statute described above. Because
the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less protective of
state interests than §4248, a fortiori, the current statute does not in
vade state interests. Pp. 16–18.
(5) Section 4248 is narrow in scope. The Court rejects respondents’
argument that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and
Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more than one step re
moved from a specifically enumerated power. See, e.g., McCulloch,
supra, at 417. Nor will the Court’s holding today confer on Congress
a general “police power, which the Founders denied the National
Government and reposed in the States.” United States v. Morrison,
529 U. S. 598, 618. Section §4248 has been applied to only a small
fraction of federal prisoners, and its reach is limited to individuals al
ready “in the custody of the” Federal Government, §4248(a). Thus,
far from a “general police power,” §4248 is a reasonably adapted and
narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government’s legitimate in
terest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its
prison system. See New York, supra, at 157. Pp. 18–22.
The Court does not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its
application denies equal protection, procedural or substantive due
process, or any other constitutional rights. Respondents are free to
pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have preserved.
