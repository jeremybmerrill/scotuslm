UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Wheat., at 421; Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898,
923–924 (1997). For once it is determined that Congress
has the authority to provide for the civil detention of
sexually dangerous persons, Congress “is acting within the
powers granted it under the Constitution,” and “may
impose its will on the States.” Gregory, 501 U. S., at 460;
see Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 4248’s right of first refusal is
thus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of
legislative grace.
Nevertheless, 29 States appear as amici and argue that
§4248 is constitutional. They tell us that they do not
object to Congress retaining custody of “sexually danger

the cost of detaining such persons is “expensive”—
approximately $64,000 per year—and these States would
rather the Federal Government bear this expense. Brief
for Kansas et al. 2; ibid. (“[S]ex offender civil commitment
programs are expensive to operate”); id., at 4 (“these pro
grams are expensive”); id., at 8 (“[T]here are very practical
reasons to prefer a system that includes a federal sex
offender civil commitment program . . . . One such reason
is the significant cost”).
Congress’ power, however, is fixed by the Constitution;
it does not expand merely to suit the States’ policy prefer
ences, or to allow State officials to avoid difficult choices
regarding the allocation of state funds. By assigning the
Federal Government power over “certain enumerated
objects only,” the Constitution “leaves to the several States
a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other ob
jects.” The Federalist No. 39, at 285 (J. Madison). The
purpose of this design is to preserve the “balance of power
between the States and the Federal Government . . . [that]
protect[s] our fundamental liberties.” Garcia v. San Anto
nio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 572
(1985) (Powell, J., dissenting); New York v. United States,
505 U. S., at 181. It is the States’ duty to act as the “im
