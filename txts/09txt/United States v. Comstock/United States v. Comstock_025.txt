UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
Opinion of the Court

*
*
*
We take these five considerations together. They in
clude: (1) the breadth of the Necessary and Proper Clause,
(2) the long history of federal involvement in this arena,
(3) the sound reasons for the statute’s enactment in light
of the Government’s custodial interest in safeguarding the
public from dangers posed by those in federal custody, (4)
the statute’s accommodation of state interests, and (5) the
statute’s narrow scope. Taken together, these considera
tions lead us to conclude that the statute is a “necessary
and proper” means of exercising the federal authority that
permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to pun
ish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appro
priately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security
of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected
by the federal imprisonment of others. The Constitution
consequently authorizes Congress to enact the statute.
We do not reach or decide any claim that the statute or
its application denies equal protection of the laws, proce
dural or substantive due process, or any other rights
guaranteed by the Constitution. Respondents are free to
pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have
preserved.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit with respect to Congress’ power to enact this stat
ute is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
