KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment

letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional”). It
is of fundamental importance to consider whether essen
tial attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the
assertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper
Clause; if so, that is a factor suggesting that the power is
not one properly within the reach of federal power.
The opinion of the Court should not be interpreted to
hold that the only, or even the principal, constraints on
the exercise of congressional power are the Constitution’s
express prohibitions. The Court’s discussion of the Tenth
Amendment invites the inference that restrictions flowing
from the federal system are of no import when defining
the limits of the National Government’s power, as it pro
ceeds by first asking whether the power is within the
National Government’s reach, and if so it discards federal
ism concerns entirely.
These remarks explain why the Court ignores important
limitations stemming from federalism principles. Those
principles are essential to an understanding of the func
tion and province of the States in our constitutional
structure.
II
As stated at the outset, in this case Congress has acted
within its powers to ensure that an abrupt end to the
federal detention of prisoners does not endanger third
parties. Federal prisoners often lack a single home State
to take charge of them due to their lengthy prison stays, so
it is incumbent on the National Government to act. This
obligation, parallel in some respects to duties defined in
tort law, is not to put in motion a particular force (here an
unstable and dangerous person) that endangers others.
Having acted within its constitutional authority to detain
the person, the National Government can acknowledge a
duty to ensure that an abrupt end to the detention does
not prejudice the States and their citizens.
