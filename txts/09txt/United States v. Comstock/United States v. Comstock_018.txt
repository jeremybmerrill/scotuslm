Opinion of the Court

to release that individual among the general public, where
he might infect others (even if not threatening an inter
state epidemic, cf. Art. I, §8, cl. 3). And if confinement of
such an individual is a “necessary and proper” thing to do,
then how could it not be similarly “necessary and proper”
to confine an individual whose mental illness threatens
others to the same degree?
Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably adapted,” Darby, 312
U. S., at 121, to Congress’ power to act as a responsible
federal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal
criminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement
constitutionally enumerated authority, see supra, at 7–8).
Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal
inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them
to “have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually
violent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially
high danger to the public if released. Cf. H. R. Rep. No.
109–218, at 22–23. And Congress could also have rea
sonably concluded (as detailed in the Judicial Conference’s
report) that a reasonable number of such individuals
would likely not be detained by the States if released from
federal custody, in part because the Federal Government
itself severed their claim to “legal residence in any State”
by incarcerating them in remote federal prisons. H. R.
Rep. No. 1319, at 2; Committee Report 7–11, App. 69–75;
cf. post, at 6 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Here
Congress’ desire to address the specific challenges identi
fied in the Reports cited above, taken together with its
responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the con
clusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end ration
ality,” i.e., that it satisfies the Constitution’s insistence
that a federal statute represent a rational means for im
plementing a constitutional grant of legislative authority.
