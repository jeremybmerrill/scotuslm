UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment

This separate writing serves two purposes. The first is
to withhold assent from certain statements and proposi

for reviewing legislation in all the Court’s precedents, the
Court has said: “But the law need not be in every respect

that it might be thought that the particular legislative
measure was a rational way to correct it.” Williamson v.
Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487–488 (1955).
This formulation was in a case presenting a due process
challenge and a challenge to a State’s exercise of its own
powers, powers not confined by the principles that control
the limited nature of our National Government. The
phrase, then, should not be extended uncritically to the
