Opinion of the Court

In 1945 the Judicial Conference of the United States
proposed legislative reforms of the federal civil
commitment system. The Judicial Conference based its
proposals upon what this Court has described as a “long
study by a conspicuously able committee” (chaired by
Judge Calvert Magruder and whose members included
Judge Learned Hand), involving consultation “with federal
district and circuit judges” across the country as well as
with the Department of Justice. Greenwood v. United
States, 350 U. S. 366, 373 (1956); Greenwood v. United
States, 219 F. 2d 376, 380–384 (CA8 1955) (describing the
committee’s work). The committee studied, among other
things, the “serious problem faced by the Bureau of Pris

expiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be
dangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no
state will assume responsibility for their custody.” Judi
cial Conference, Report of Committee to Study Treatment
Accorded by Federal Courts to Insane Persons Charged
with Crime 11 (1945) (hereinafter Committee Report),
App. 73. The committee provided examples of instances in
which the Bureau of Prisons had struggled with the prob
lem of “ ‘paranoid’ ” and “ ‘threatening’ ” individuals whom
no State would accept. Id., at 9, App. 71. And it noted
that, in the Bureau’s “[e]xperience,” States would not
accept an “appreciable number” of “mental[ly] incompe
tent” individuals “nearing expiration” of their prison
terms, because of their “lack of legal residence in any
State,” even though those individuals “ought not . . . be at
large because they constitute a menace to public safety.”

Bennett to Judge Magruder, attachment to Committee

Conference, therefore recommended that Congress enact
“some provision of law authorizing the continued confine
