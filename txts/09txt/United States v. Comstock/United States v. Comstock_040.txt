THOMAS, J., dissenting

Roughly 30 years after the Constitution’s ratification,
McCulloch firmly established this understanding in our
constitutional jurisprudence. 4 Wheat., at 421, 423. Since
then, our precedents uniformly have maintained that the
Necessary and Proper Clause is not an independent fount
of congressional authority, but rather “a caveat that Con
gress possesses all the means necessary to carry out the
specifically granted ‘foregoing’ powers of §8 ‘and all other
Powers vested by this Constitution.’ ” Kinsella v. United
States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 247 (1960); Carter
v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 291 (1936); see Alden v.
Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 739 (1999); Martin v. Hunter’s Les
see, 1 Wheat. 304, 326 (1816); see also Gonzales v. Raich,
545 U. S. 1, 39 (2005) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)
(stating that, although the Clause “empowers Congress to
enact laws . . . that are not within its authority to enact in
isolation,” those laws must be “in effectuation of [Con
gress’] enumerated powers” (citing McCulloch, supra, at
421–422)).

pretation of the Sweeping Clause, 43 Duke L. J. 267, 274–275, and

3 The statute authorizes the Attorney General to petition a federal
court to order the commitment of a person in BOP custody (1) who has
been convicted of a federal crime and is serving a federal prison sen
tence therefor, (2) who has been found mentally incompetent to stand
trial, or (3) “against whom all federal criminal charges have been
dismissed solely for reasons related to his mental condition.” 18
