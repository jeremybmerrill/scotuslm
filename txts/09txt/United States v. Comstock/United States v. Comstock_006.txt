Opinion of the Court

State. §4248(d). But if, “notwithstanding such efforts,
neither such State will assume such responsibility,” then
“the Attorney General shall place the person for treatment
in a suitable [federal] facility.” Ibid.; cf. §4247(i)(A).
Confinement in the federal facility will last until either
(1) the person’s mental condition improves to the point
where he is no longer dangerous (with or without appro
priate ongoing treatment), in which case he will be re
leased; or (2) a State assumes responsibility for his cus
tody, care, and treatment, in which case he will be
transferred to the custody of that State. §§4248(d)(1)–(2).
The statute establishes a system for ongoing psychiatric
and judicial review of the individual’s case, including
judicial hearings at the request of the confined person at
six-month intervals. §§4247(e)(1)(B), (h).
In November and December 2006, the Government
instituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the
Eastern District of North Carolina against the five re
spondents in this case. Three of the five had previously
pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child por
nography, see 507 F. Supp. 2d 522, 526, and n. 2 (2007);
§2252A(a), and the fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual
abuse of a minor, see United States v. Vigil, No.
1:99CR00509–001 (D NM, Jan. 26, 2000); §§1153, 2243(a).
With respect to each of them, the Government claimed
that the respondent was about to be released from federal
prison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or
child molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a
mental illness that made him sexually dangerous to oth
ers. App. 38–40, 44–52. During that same time period,
the Government instituted similar proceedings against the
fifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court
with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found
mentally incompetent to stand trial. See id., at 41–43;
United States v. Catron, No. 04–778 (D Ariz., Mar. 27,
2006); §4241(d).
