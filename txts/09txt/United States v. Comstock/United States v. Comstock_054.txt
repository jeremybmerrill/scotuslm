THOMAS, J., dissenting

As already noted, Greenwood upheld the commitment of
a federal defendant declared unfit to stand trial on the
narrow ground that the Government’s criminal jurisdic
tion over the defendant—its “power to prosecute for fed
eral offenses—[wa]s not exhausted,” but rather “per
sist[ed]” in the form of a “pending indictment.” 350 U. S.,
at 375; see supra, at 16. The Court was careful to state
that “[t]his commitment, and therefore the legislation
authorizing commitment in the context of this case, in
volve[d] an assertion of authority” within “congressional
power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.” Green
wood, 350 U. S., at 375 (emphasis added). But it painstak
ingly limited its holding to “the narrow constitutional
issue raised by th[at] order of commitment.” Ibid.
The historical record thus supports the Federal Gov
ernment’s authority to detain a mentally ill person against
whom it has the authority to enforce a criminal law. But
it provides no justification whatsoever for reading the
Necessary and Proper Clause to grant Congress the power
to authorize the detention of persons without a basis for
federal criminal jurisdiction.

Finally, the Court offers two arguments regarding
§4248’s impact on the relationship between the Federal
Government and the States. First, the Court and both
concurrences suggest that Congress must have had the
power to enact §4248 because a long period of federal
incarceration might “seve[r]” a sexually dangerous pris
oner’s “claim to ‘legal residence’ ” in any particular State,
ante, at 15 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the pris
oner without any “home State to take charge” of him upon
release, ante, at 5 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment);
——————
ing the statute to permit federal civil detention only for a period rea
sonably related to a criminal prosecution); Wells v. Attorney General of
United States, 201 F. 2d 556, 560 (CA10 1953) (same).
