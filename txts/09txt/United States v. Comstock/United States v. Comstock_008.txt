Opinion of the Court

United States v. Tom, 565 F. 3d 497 (CA8 2009).
II
The question presented is whether the Necessary and
Proper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, grants Congress authority
sufficient to enact the statute before us. In resolving that
question, we assume, but we do not decide, that other
provisions of the Constitution—such as the Due Process
Clause—do not prohibit civil commitment in these circum
stances. Cf. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346; Addington v. Texas,
441 U. S. 418 (1979). In other words, we assume for ar
gument’s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit
a State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether
the Federal Government, exercising its enumerated pow
ers, may enact such a statute as well. On that assump
tion, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress
legislative power sufficient to enact §4248. We base this
conclusion on five considerations, taken together.
First, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress
broad authority to enact federal legislation. Nearly 200
years ago, this Court stated that the Federal “[G]overn
ment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated
powers,” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 405, which means that
“[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or
more of” those powers, United States v. Morrison, 529
U. S. 598, 607 (2000). But, at the same time, “a govern
ment, entrusted with such” powers “must also be en
trusted with ample means for their execution.”
McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 408. Accordingly, the Necessary
and Proper Clause makes clear that the Constitution’s
grants of specific federal legislative authority are accom
panied by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient,
or useful” or “conducive” to the authority’s “beneficial
exercise.” Id., at 413, 418; see also id., at 421 (“[Congress
can] legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which
must be involved in the constitution . . .”). Chief Justice
