MOUNT SOLEDAD MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION v.

TRUNK

Statement of ALITO, J. 


This Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence is undoubtedly in need of clarity, see Utah Highway Patrol
Assn. v. American Atheists, Inc., 565 U. S. __, __ (2011)
(THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op.,
at 17), and the constitutionality of the Mount Soledad
Veterans Memorial is a question of substantial importance. We considered a related question two Terms ago
in Salazar v. Buono, 559 U. S. __ (2010), which concerned
a large white cross that was originally erected on public
land. Although “[t]he cross is of course the preeminent
symbol of Christianity,” id., at __ (ALITO, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3), we noted
that “[t]he goal of avoiding governmental endorsement
[of religion] does not require eradication of all religious
symbols in the public realm. . . . The Constitution does not
oblige government to avoid any public acknowledgment of
religion’s role in society,” id., at ____ (plurality opinion of
KENNEDY, J., joined in full by ROBERTS, C. J., and in part
by ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 1415). The demolition of the
cross at issue in that case would have been “interpreted by
some as an arresting symbol of a Government that is not
neutral but hostile on matters of religion and is bent on
eliminating from all public places and symbols any trace
of our country’s religious heritage.” Id., at __ (opinion of
ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 4).
In that case, we were not required to decide whether the
Establishment Clause would have required the demolition
of the cross if the land on which it was built had remained
in government hands. Instead, Congress was ultimately
able to devise a solution that was “true to the spirit of
practical accommodation that has made the United States
a Nation of unparalleled pluralism and religious tolerance.” Id., at __ (slip op., at 1).
The current petitions come to us in an interlocutory
posture. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the
District Court to fashion an appropriate remedy, and, in
