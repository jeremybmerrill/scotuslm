v.
STEVE TRUNK ET AL.

ON PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

Nos. 11–998 and 11–1115.

Decided June 25, 2012


The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
Statement of JUSTICE ALITO respecting the denial of the
petitions for writs of certiorari.
A large white cross has stood atop Mount Soledad in
San Diego, California, since 1954 as a memorial to our
Nation’s war veterans. The city of San Diego was previously enjoined under the California Constitution from
displaying the cross or transferring, for the purpose of
protecting the cross, the property on which the Mount
Soledad Veterans Memorial stands. See Trunk v. San
Diego, 629 F. 3d 1099, 11031104 (CA9 2011) (describing prior litigation); see also San Diegans for Mt. Soledad
Nat. War Memorial v. Paulson, 548 U. S. 1301, 1302 (2006)
(KENNEDY, J., in chambers) (same). In 2006, Congress
exercised its power of eminent domain and took title to the
property in order to “preserve a historically significant
war memorial.” Act of Aug. 14, §2(a), 120 Stat. 770. After
the Federal Government took possession, the Ninth Circuit held in the decision below that “the Memorial, presently configured and as a whole, primarily conveys a
message of government endorsement of religion that violates the Establishment Clause.” 629 F. 3d, at 1125.
