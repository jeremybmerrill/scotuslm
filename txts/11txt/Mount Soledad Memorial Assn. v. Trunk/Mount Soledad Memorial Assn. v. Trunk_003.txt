Statement of ALITO, J.

doing so, the Court of Appeals emphasized that its decision “d[id] not mean that the Memorial could not be modified to pass constitutional muster [or] that no cross can be
part of [the Memorial].” 629 F. 3d, at 1125. Because no
final judgment has been rendered and it remains unclear
precisely what action the Federal Government will be
required to take, I agree with the Court’s decision to deny
the petitions for certiorari. See, e.g., Locomotive Firemen
v. Bangor & Aroostook R. Co., 389 U. S. 327, 328 (1967)
(per curiam) (denying petition for certiorari because “the
Court of Appeals [had] remanded the case” and thus it was
“not yet ripe for review by this Court”); see also E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett,
Supreme Court Practice 280 (9th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Stern & Gressman). Our denial, of course, does not
amount to a ruling on the merits, and the Federal Government is free to raise the same issue in a later petition
following entry of a final judgment. See, e.g., Hughes Tool
Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U. S. 363, 365366,
n. 1 (1973); see also Stern & Gressman 283.
