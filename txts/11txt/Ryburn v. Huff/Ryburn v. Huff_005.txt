Judge Rawlinson’s analysis of the qualified immunity
issue was correct. No decision of this Court has found a
Fourth Amendment violation on facts even roughly comparable to those present in this case. On the contrary,
some of our opinions may be read as pointing in the opposite direction.
In Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 400 (2006), we
held that officers may enter a residence without a warrant
when they have “an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is . . . imminently threatened with
[serious injury].” We explained that “ ‘[t]he need to protect
or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification
for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or
emergency.’ ” Id., at 403 (quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437
U. S. 385, 392 (1978)). In addition, in Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 118 (2006), the Court stated that “it
would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a
tort by entering [a residence] . . . to determine whether
violence . . . is about to (or soon will) occur.”
A reasonable police officer could read these decisions to
mean that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to enter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for
concluding that there is an imminent threat of violence.
In this case, the District Court concluded that petitioners
had such an objectively reasonable basis for reaching such
a conclusion. The District Court wrote:
“[T]he officers testified that a number of factors led
them to be concerned for their own safety and for the
safety of other persons in the residence: the unusual
behavior of the parents in not answering the door or
the telephone; the fact that Mrs. Huff did not inquire
