RYBURN v. HUFF
Per Curiam

about the reason for their visit or express concern that
they were investigating her son; the fact that she
hung up the telephone on the officer; the fact that
she refused to tell them whether there were guns in
the house; and finally, the fact that she ran back into
the house while being questioned. That behavior,
combined with the information obtained at the
school—that Vincent was a student who was a victim
of bullying, who had been absent from school for two
days, and who had threatened to ‘shoot up’ the
school—led the officers to believe that there could be
weapons inside the house, and that family members
or the officers themselves were in danger.” App. to
Pet. for Cert. 6.
This belief, the District Court held, was “objectively reasonable,” particularly since the situation was “rapidly
evolving” and the officers had to make quick decisions.
Id., at 6–7.
The panel majority—far removed from the scene and
with the opportunity to dissect the elements of the situation—confidently concluded that the officers really had no
reason to fear for their safety or that of anyone else. As
the panel majority saw things, it was irrelevant that the
Huffs did not respond when the officers knocked on the
door and announced their presence and when they called
the home phone because the Huffs had no legal obligation
to respond to a knock on the door or to answer the phone.
The majority attributed no significance to the fact that,
when the officers finally reached Mrs. Huff on her cell
phone, she abruptly hung up in the middle of their conversation. And, according to the majority, the officers should
not have been concerned by Mrs. Huff’s reaction when
they asked her if there were any guns in the house because Mrs. Huff “merely asserted her right to end her
conversation with the officers and returned to her home.”
