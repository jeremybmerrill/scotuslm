Per Curiam

Id., at 25.
Confronted with the facts found by the District Court,
reasonable officers in the position of petitioners could have
come to the conclusion that there was an imminent threat
to their safety and to the safety of others. The Ninth
Circuit’s contrary conclusion was flawed for numerous
reasons.

the findings of the District Court, it changed those findings in several key respects. As Judge Rawlinson correctly

31. The District Court’s finding that Mrs. Huff “immediately turned around and ran into the house” implicitly
rejected Mrs. Huff’s contrary testimony that she walked
into the house after telling the officers that she was going
to get her husband. Id., at 3. The panel majority upheld
the District Court’s findings of fact and acknowledged that
it could not reverse the District Court simply because it
“may have weighed the testimony of the witnesses and

panel majority’s determination that petitioners were not
entitled to qualified immunity rested on an account of
the facts that differed markedly from the District Court’s
finding. According to the panel majority, Mrs. Huff “merely asserted her right to end her conversation with the
officers and returned to her home” after telling the officers
“that she would go get her husband.” Id., at 12, 25.
Second, the panel majority appears to have taken the

whether there were any guns in the house (immediately
turning around and running inside) was not a reason for
alarm because she was under no legal obligation to con-
