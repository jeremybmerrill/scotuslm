RYBURN v. HUFF
Per Curiam

Burbank Police Department. No one answered the door or
otherwise responded to Officer Zepeda’s knocks. Sergeant
Ryburn then called the home telephone. The officers could
hear the phone ringing inside the house, but no one answered. Id., at 2.
Sergeant Ryburn next tried calling the cell phone of

After Mrs. Huff declined Sergeant Ryburn’s request to
