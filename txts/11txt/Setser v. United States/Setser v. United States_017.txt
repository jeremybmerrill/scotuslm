18 U. S. C. §3584

“Multiple sentences of imprisonment
“(a) IMPOSITION OF CONCURRENT OR CONSECUTIVE
TERMS.—If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed
on a defendant at the same time, or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to
an undischarged term of imprisonment, the terms may
run concurrently or consecutively, except that the terms
may not run consecutively for an attempt and for another
offense that was the sole objective of the attempt. Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time run
concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively. Multiple
terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run
consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to
run concurrently.
“(b) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING
CONCURRENT OR CONSECUTIVE TERMS.—The court, in
determining whether the terms imposed are to be ordered
to run concurrently or consecutively, shall consider, as to
each offense for which a term of imprisonment is being
imposed, the factors set forth in section 3553(a).
“(c) TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE SENTENCE AS AN
AGGREGATE.—Multiple terms of imprisonment ordered to
run consecutively or concurrently shall be treated for
administrative purposes as a single, aggregate term of
imprisonment.”
