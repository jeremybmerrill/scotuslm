SETSER v. UNITED STATES

12

Opinion of the Court

sidering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the
extent that they are applicable, if it finds that . . . extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a
reduction [or that the defendant meets other criteria
for relief].”
IV
Setser argues that, even if the District Court’s consecutive order was consistent with §3584(a), it made his sentence impossible to implement and therefore unreasonable
under the Act, see United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220,
261–262 (2005),7 in light of the State’s decision to make
his sentences concurrent. We think not. There is nothing
unreasonable—let alone inherently impossible—about the
sentence itself. Setser is ordered to serve a 151-month
term in federal custody, and that sentence should run
concurrently with one state sentence and consecutively
with another.
The difficulty arises not from the sentence, but from the
state court’s decision to make both state sentences concurrent. Which of the District Court’s dispositions should
prevail: that his federal sentence run consecutively to the
state sentence on the parole revocation charge, or that his
federal sentence run concurrently with the state sentence
on the new drug charge? If the federal sentence is added
to the state sentence it will not be concurrent with the new
drug charge, and if it is merged in the state sentence it
will not be consecutive to the parole revocation charge.

7 We

have never had occasion to decide whether reasonableness review under Booker applies to a court’s decision that a federal sentence
should run concurrently with or consecutively to another sentence. The
Courts of Appeals, however, generally seem to agree that such review
applies. See, e.g., United States v. Padilla, 618 F. 3d 643, 647 (CA7
2010) (per curiam); United States v. Matera, 489 F. 3d 115, 123–124
(CA2 2007). For purpose of the present case we assume, without
deciding, that it does.
