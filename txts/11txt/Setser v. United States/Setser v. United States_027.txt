SETSER v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

sition or from the date of entry into federal custody);
United States v. Kanton, 362 F. 2d 178, 179–180 (CA7
1966) (per curiam) (same); United States ex rel. Lester v.
Parker, 404 F. 2d 40, 41 (CA3 1968) (per curiam) (addressing the question whether a sentence was insufficiently certain for purposes of due process). The fourth case, Salley v.
United States, 786 F. 2d 546, 548 (CA2 1986), discusses the
issue directly and takes the Court’s position. But, like the
other three cases, it was decided before the Guidelines took
effect (i.e., when the reasons for denying the authority
were less strong). And, one judge on the panel disagreed
in a separate opinion, and in my view has the better of the
argument. See id., at 548–550 (Newman, J., concurring in
result); see also United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315,
1317 (CA9 1985) (holding that a judge lacks the hererelevant sentencing power). In any event, these instances
are too few to constitute a “tradition.”
In fact the Senate Committee Report accompanying the
SRA provides strong evidence that there was no such
tradition. S. Rep. No. 98–225 (1983). That Report thoroughly surveyed prior law. It says that the SRA is a
“comprehensive statement of the Federal law of sentencing,” that it “describes in detail the kinds of sentences that
may be imposed,” and that §3584 “provides the rules for
determining the length of a term of imprisonment for a
person convicted of more than one offense.” Id., at 50,
125–126. It further states that “[e]xisting law permits the
imposition of either concurrent or consecutive sentences,”
which practice it then describes as limited to two scenarios:
“[t]erms of imprisonment imposed at the same time,” and
those “imposed on a person already serving a prison term.”
Id., at 126. It says the same when describing how §3584 is
supposed to work. In neither place does it refer to a practice of, or any authority for, imposing a prison term that
runs consecutively with a future term not yet imposed.
In addition, a grant of such authority risks at least
