SETSER v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

and state sentences and is well situated to take into account both the intent of the first sentencing judge and
the specific facts developed in the second sentencing. The
relevant statute provides that “[t]he Bureau may designate any available penal or correctional facility . . . ,
whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §3621(b). And in reliance on this
authority, the Bureau has concluded that it has the power
to “designat[e] . . . a state institution for concurrent service of a federal sentence.” Program Statement 5160.05,
at 1. The Program Statement further provides that exercise of this power will be guided by, in part, “the intent of
the federal sentencing court” in addition to “any other
pertinent information regarding the inmate.” Id., at 4.
The Court’s only criticism of this system is that it is
less “natural” to read the statute “as giving the Bureau
of Prisons what amounts to sentencing authority.” Ante,
at 8. But what is unnatural about giving the Bureau that
authority? The sentencing process has long involved
cooperation among the three branches of Government.
Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 364. And until the Guidelines
the BOP itself decided, within broad limits, precisely how
much prison time every typical offender would serve.
Even today, it still decides that question within certain
limits. 18 U. S. C. §3624 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV) (delegating to the BOP authority to calculate “good time credit,”
which in effect reduces a prisoner’s term of incarceration);
see also Barber, 560 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 1). Although
Congress limited the Bureau’s authority in this respect,
there is nothing unnatural about leaving the Bureau with
a small portion of that authority—particularly where
doing so helps significantly to alleviate a small, but important, technical problem in the application of the SRA’s
sentencing system.
