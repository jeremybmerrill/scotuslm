Opinion of the Court

This is indeed a problem, but not, we think, one that
shows the District Court’s sentence to be unlawful. The
reasonableness standard we apply in reviewing federal
sentences asks whether the district court abused its discretion. See Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 46 (2007).
Setser identifies no flaw in the District Court’s decisionmaking process, nor anything available at the time of
sentencing that the District Court failed to consider. That
a sentence is thwarted does not mean that it was unreasonable. If a district court ordered, as a term of supervised release, that a defendant maintain a steady job, but
a subsequent disability rendered gainful employment
infeasible, we doubt that one would call the original sentence an abuse of discretion. There will often be late-onset
facts that materially alter a prisoner’s position and that
make it difficult, or even impossible, to implement his
sentence.
This is where the Bureau of Prisons comes in—which
ultimately has to determine how long the District Court’s
sentence authorizes it to continue Setser’s confinement.
Setser is free to urge the Bureau to credit his time served
in state court based on the District Court’s judgment that
the federal sentence run concurrently with the state sentence for the new drug charges. If the Bureau initially
declines to do so, he may raise his claim through the Bureau’s Administrative Remedy Program. See 28 CFR
§542.10 et seq. (2011). And if that does not work, he may
seek a writ of habeas corpus. See 28 U. S. C. §2241. We
express no view on whether those proceedings would be
successful.

Because it was within the District Court’s discretion to
order that Setser’s sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence in the probation revocation proceeding; and because the state court’s subsequent decision to
