SETSER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

United States v. Brown, 920 F. 2d 1212 (1991) (per curiam),
he indicated that the District Court had discretion to make
Setser’s sentence either concurrent with or consecutive to
any sentence anticipated in the separate state-court proceedings. Setser objected, arguing that the District Court
lacked such authority. The court nevertheless made the
sentence of 151 months that it imposed consecutive to any
state sentence imposed for probation violation, but concurrent with any state sentence imposed on the new drug
charge. Setser appealed.
While Setser’s appeal was pending, the state court
sentenced him to a prison term of 5 years for probation
violation and 10 years on the new drug charge. It ordered
that these sentences be served concurrently. Setser then
made before the Court of Appeals, in addition to the argument that the District Court had no authority to order a
consecutive sentence, the argument that his federal sentence was unreasonable because it was impossible to
implement in light of the concurrent state sentences.
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 607
F. 3d 128 (2010). Following its earlier Brown decision, the
court held that the District Court did have authority to
order a consecutive sentence. 607 F. 3d, at 131–132. It
also held that Setser’s sentence was reasonable, even if it
was “ ‘partially foiled’ ” by the state court’s decision. Id., at
132–133. We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and
appointed an amicus curiae to brief and argue this case in
support of the judgment below, 564 U. S. ___ (2011).

Before proceeding further, it is important to be clear
about what is at issue. Setser does not contend that his
federal sentence must run concurrently with both state
sentences imposed after his federal sentencing hearing.
He acknowledges that someone must answer “the consecutive versus concurrent question,” Brief for Petitioner 27,
