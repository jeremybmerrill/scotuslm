Opinion of the Court

rent and consecutive sentences. Put to the choice, we
believe it is much more natural to read §3584(a) as not
containing an implied “only,” leaving room for the exercise
of judicial discretion in the situations not covered, than it
is to read §3621(b) as giving the Bureau of Prisons what
amounts to sentencing authority.

None of the other objections to this approach raised by
Setser and the Government require a different result.
Our decision today follows the interpretive rule they
invoke, that we must “give effect . . . to every clause and

528, 538–539 (1955) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The first sentence in §3584(a) addresses the most common
situations in which the decision between concurrent and
consecutive sentences must be made: where two sentences
are imposed at the same time, and where a sentence is
imposed subsequent to a prior sentence that has not yet
been fully served. It says that the district court has discretion whether to make the sentences concurrent or
consecutive, except that it may not make consecutive a
sentence for “an attempt” and a sentence for an “offense
that was the sole objective of the attempt.” And the last
two sentences of §3584(a) say what will be assumed in
those two common situations if the court does not specify
that the sentence is concurrent or consecutive. Giving
those dispositions full effect does not demand that we
regard them as eliminating sentencing discretion in other
situations.
Setser and the Government both suggest that, because
§3584(b) directs courts to consider the sentencing factors
in §3553(a) in making these decisions, and because some
of those factors will be difficult to apply with respect to
anticipated sentences, the Act cannot be read to allow
judicial discretion in these circumstances. One cannot be
