Opinion of the Court

Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 (CA9 1985)2. We find
nothing in the Sentencing Reform Act, or in any other
provision of law, to show that Congress foreclosed the
exercise of district courts’ sentencing discretion in these
circumstances.
Setser’s main contention is that §3584(a) has this effect.
But that provision cannot sustain the weight that Setser
asks it to bear. In essence, he reads the first sentence in
§3584(a) to say that “terms [of imprisonment] may run
concurrently or consecutively” only “[i]f multiple terms of
imprisonment are imposed . . . at the same time, or if a
term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is

dissent is incorrect to say, post, at 7–8 (opinion of BREYER, J.),
that only the Second Circuit, in Salley held to that effect. So did the
Seventh Circuit in Kanton and the Tenth Circuit in Anderson. The
dissent says that Anderson addressed only the question “whether a
federal sentence runs from the date of its imposition or from the date of
entry into federal custody,” post, at 7–8. That is true enough (and it is
true of Kanton as well); but answering that question in a manner that
upheld the consecutive federal sentence (i.e., it runs from the date of
entry into federal custody) necessarily upheld the sentencing court’s
authority to impose the consecutive federal sentence. In fact, Anderson confronted and specifically rejected the defendant’s argument that
“ ‘[n]o court has the authority to impose a sentence consecutive to
something that does not exist,’ ” 405 F. 2d, at 493. And, finally, so did
the Third Circuit in Lester. The dissent says that Lester addressed only
the question “whether a sentence was insufficiently certain for purposes of due process,” post, at 8. But that was the defendant’s principal reason (as it appears also to be the dissent’s principal reason) for
asserting that the sentencing court had no authority to impose a
consecutive sentence. And the Third Circuit rejected not only that
reason but “[o]ther arguments advanced by [the defendant] ” attacking
the consecutive sentence, 404 F. 2d, at 42.
The only contrary federal appellate decision rendered before the Sentencing Reform Act took effect relied upon 18 U. S. C. §4082 (1982 ed.)
(the predecessor of §3621) and §3568 (1982 ed.) (repealed by 98 Stat.
1987), which provided that a federal sentence “shall commence to run
from the date on which such person is received” into federal custody.
See United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 (CA9 1985).
