SETSER v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

the consecutive/concurrent decision after considering,
among other things, “any statement by the court that
imposed the sentence,” including statements “concerning
the purposes for which the sentence to imprisonment was
determined to be warranted.” 18 U. S. C. §3621(b)(4)(A).
And its program statement provides that it will review

sentence as the place where he will serve his federal sentence. 18 U. S. C. §3621(b).
This exercise of authority by the Executive Branch is

Constitution to the exclusive jurisdiction of any one of the
three Branches of Government.” Mistretta, 488 U. S., at
364. And, until fairly recently the federal BOP decided
(via parole) the far more global question of just how long
(within broad limits) each imprisoned offender would
serve. See id., at 367. Thus, the present Bureau involvement represents a further practical accommodation to a
fact about the world, namely that the initial sentencing
judge typically lacks important sentencing-related information about a second sentence that has not yet been

Given the purposes and the mechanics of the SRA’s
sentencing system, just described, the better reading of
the “multiple sentences” provision is a reading that denies
a sentencing judge the authority to “order that the federal
