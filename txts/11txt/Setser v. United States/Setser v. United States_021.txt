SETSER v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

state sentence that has not yet been imposed.” Ante, at 1.

The Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) has two overall objectives. See Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip
op., at 7); see also United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual §1A3, p. 1.2 (Nov. 1987) (USSG) (addressing statutory objectives). First, it seeks greater
honesty in sentencing. Instead of a parole commission and
a judge trying to second-guess each other about the time
an offender will actually serve in prison, the SRA tries to
create a sentencing system that will require the offender
actually to serve most of the sentence the judge imposes.
See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989)
(“[The SRA] makes all sentences basically determinate”).
Second, the Act seeks greater fairness in sentencing
through the creation of Guidelines that will increase the
likelihood that two offenders who engage in roughly similar criminal behavior will receive roughly similar sentences. See Barber, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (noting
that Congress sought to achieve, in part, “increased sentencing uniformity”).
To implement these reforms, the SRA instructs the
Commission to write Guidelines that inevitably move in
the direction of increased “real offense” sentencing. See
USSG §1A2, p. 1.1. (describing how statute, e.g., by insisting upon categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics, leads to this result). In principle, real offense
sentencing would impose the same sentence upon different
offenders who engage in the same real conduct irrespective
of the statutes under which they are charged. Real offense
sentencing, for example, would mean that two individuals,
both of whom rob a bank and injure a teller, would receive
the same sentence even if the Government charges one of
them under a bank robbery statute and the other under an
assault statute. See, e.g., USSG App. A (listing federal
