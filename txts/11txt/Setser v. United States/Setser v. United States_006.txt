SETSER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

a federal sentence is serving a state sentence, the Bureau
may designate the state prison as the place of imprisonment for the federal sentence—effectively making the
two sentences concurrent—or decline to do so—effectively making them consecutive.1 Based on §§3584(a)
and 3621(b), Setser and the Government argue that the
concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, under the circumstances presented here, is committed exclusively to the
Bureau of Prisons.
It is fundamental that we construe statutes governing
the jurisdiction of the federal courts in light of “the
common-law background against which the statutes . . .
were enacted,” New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council
of City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 359 (1989), and the
same approach is appropriate here, where the issue concerns a matter of discretion traditionally committed to the
Judiciary. Judges have long been understood to have
discretion to select whether the sentences they impose will
run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other
sentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in
other proceedings, including state proceedings. See Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 168–169 (2009). And a large
majority of the federal appellate courts addressing the
question have recognized a similar authority in the context here, where a federal judge anticipates a state sentence that has not yet been imposed. See Salley v. United
States, 786 F. 2d 546, 547 (CA2 1986); Anderson v. United
States, 405 F. 2d 492, 493 (CA10 1969) (per curiam); United
States ex rel. Lester v. Parker, 404 F. 2d 40, 41–42 (CA3
1968) (per curiam); United States v. Kanton, 362 F. 2d 178,
179–180 (CA7 1966) (per curiam); but see United States v.

1 The Bureau of Prisons sometimes makes this designation while the
prisoner is in state custody and sometimes makes a nunc pro tunc
designation once the prisoner enters federal custody.
