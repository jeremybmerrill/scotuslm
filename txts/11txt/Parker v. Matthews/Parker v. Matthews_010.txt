PARKER v. MATTHEWS
Per Curiam

the prosecutor’s statement that immediately followed the
quoted portion and expressly disavowed any suggestion of
collusion:
“And that’s not to say that Mr. Busse is unethical.
Not at all. He is entitled to the best defense he can
get, but that’s the only defense he has, what the doctor has to say, and that’s not to say that the doctor
gets on the stand and perjures himself. He’s telling
you the truth. He wouldn’t perjure himself for anything. He’s telling you the truth, Ladies and Gentlemen.” 7 Record 674.
With the prosecutor’s immediate clarification that he was
not alleging collusion in view, the Sixth Circuit’s conclusion that this feature of the closing argument clearly
violated due process is unsupportable. Nor does the prosecutor’s suggestion that Matthews had “enhance[d] his
story to Doctor Chutkow,” ibid., suffice to justify the Sixth
Circuit’s grant of habeas relief. In context, that statement
is clearly a part of a broader argument that Matthews
had a motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance in
his meetings with Dr. Chutkow. Shortly after the quoted
statement, the prosecutor continued with a series of rhetorical questions:
“Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about
his wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things
——————
on? He’s competent. He can work with his attorney, and he enhances
his story to Doctor Chutkow. Yeah, I was drinking. I was drinking a
lot. I was taking a lot of pills, too, and let me tell you about the pills I
was taking.
“Don’t you think he has a purpose in enhancing his story to the
psychiatrist? Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about his
wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things about what other
people might be doing to his mother? Don’t you think he would overstate the extent of his intoxication to his psychiatrist? It’s the defense
of last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen. He has no excuse for his conduct,
but that’s his only way out.” 7 Record 673–674.
