PARKER v. MATTHEWS
Per Curiam

sumption of correctness, and it was not unreasonable
to conclude that the jurors were entitled to consider the
tension between Dr. Chutkow’s testimony and their own
common-sense understanding of emotional disturbance.
In resolving the conflict in favor of Dr. Chutkow’s testimony, the Sixth Circuit overstepped the proper limits of its
authority. See Jackson, supra, at 326.
More fundamentally, the Sixth Circuit did not appear to
consider the possibility that the jury could have found the
symptoms described by Dr. Chutkow inadequate to establish what is required to reduce murder to manslaughter
under Kentucky law: that Matthews “acted under the
influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which
there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint
of a person in the defendant’s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.” Ky. Rev.
Stat. Ann. §507.020(1)(a). Dr. Chutkow himself agreed
that many people face tension and anxiety—two symptoms
he attributed to Matthews. 6 Record 579–580. And he
agreed that many people suffer from adjustment disorders. Id., at 592. But of course very few people commit
murders. In light of these points, which bear on the
proper characterization of Matthews’ mental condition and
the reasonableness of his conduct, the Kentucky Supreme
Court made no objectively unreasonable error in concluding that the question of extreme emotional disturbance
was properly committed to the jury for resolution.
B
As a second ground for its decision, the Sixth Circuit
held that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during
his closing argument constituted a denial of due process.
This claim was rejected on the merits by the Kentucky
Supreme Court (albeit without analysis) and therefore
receives deferential review under the AEDPA standard.
