PARKER v. MATTHEWS
Per Curiam

625, 628–629. The case had been submitted to the jury
with the burden assigned to the Commonwealth, the jury
had found that burden carried, and the Kentucky Supreme Court found the evidence adequate to sustain that
finding. That ground was sufficient to reject Matthews’
claim, so it is irrelevant that the court also invoked a
ground of questionable validity. See Wetzel v. Lambert,
565 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at
4–5).1
The Sixth Circuit’s opinion also challenges the conclusion that the evidence supported a finding of no extreme
emotional disturbance. We have said that “it is the
responsibility of the jury—not the court—to decide what

1 An ambiguously worded footnote in the Sixth Circuit’s opinion, see
651 F. 3d 489, 504, n. 5 (2011), suggests that the court may have found
an additional due process violation. The court referred to a statement
in the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision in Gall v. Commonwealth
607 S. W. 2d 97, 109 (1980), that “[u]nless the evidence raising the
issue [of extreme emotional disturbance] is of such probative force that
otherwise the defendant would be entitled as a matter of law to an
acquittal on the higher charge (murder), the prosecution is not required
to come forth with negating evidence in order to sustain its burden of
proof.” Relying on its own opinion in Gall’s federal habeas proceeding,
Gall v. Parker, 231 F. 3d 265 (CA6 2000) (Gall II), the Sixth Circuit
suggested that the quoted statement “require[d] a defendant to bear the
heavy burden of disproving an element of a crime beyond a reasonable
doubt,” 651 F. 3d, at 504, n. 5, in violation of this Court’s decision in
Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975). That is not so. The statement explicitly acknowledges that the burden of proof rests with the
prosecution, but merely asserts that when the burden of production is
assigned to the defendant the jury may find the prosecution’s burden of
proof satisfied without introduction of negating evidence, unless the
defendant’s evidence is so probative as to establish reasonable doubt as
a matter of law. That seems to us a truism. See 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §338, pp. 419–420 (5th ed. 1999). Our opinion in
Mullaney addressed a situation in which the burden of persuasion was
shifted to the defendant, see 421 U. S., at 702, and n. 31; it does not
remotely show that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s truism contravened
clearly established federal law.
