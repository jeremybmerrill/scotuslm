PARKER v. MATTHEWS
Per Curiam

664 (2004)), the Sixth Circuit had no warrant to set aside
the Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion.
The Sixth Circuit also erred by consulting its own precedents, rather than those of this Court, in assessing the
reasonableness of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision.
After quoting the governing standard from our decision in
Darden, the Sixth Circuit added that it would “engag[e] in
a two step inquiry to determine whether the prosecutorial
misconduct rises to the level of unconstitutionality. ‘To
satisfy the standard . . . , the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.’ ” 651 F. 3d, at 505 (quoting Broom v.
Mitchell, 441 F. 3d 392, 412 (CA6 2006)). It went on to
evaluate the flagrancy step of that inquiry in light of four
factors derived from its own precedent: “ ‘(1) the likelihood
that the remarks . . . tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated
or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or
accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against [Matthews].’ ” 651 F. 3d, at 506 (quoting
Broom, supra, at 412). And it stated that “the prosecutor’s
comments in this case were sufficiently similar to” certain
comments held unconstitutional in its prior decision in
Gall II, 231 F. 3d 265 (CA6 2000), “that they rise to the
level of impropriety.” 651 F. 3d, at 506.
As we explained in correcting an identical error by the
Sixth Circuit two Terms ago, see Renico, 559 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 11–12), circuit precedent does not constitute
“clearly established Federal law, as determined by the
Supreme Court,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). It therefore
cannot form the basis for habeas relief under AEDPA. Nor
can the Sixth Circuit’s reliance on its own precedents be
defended in this case on the ground that they merely
reflect what has been “clearly established” by our cases.
The highly generalized standard for evaluating claims of
prosecutorial misconduct set forth in Darden bears scant
resemblance to the elaborate, multistep test employed by
