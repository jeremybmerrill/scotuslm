COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD
Opinion of the Court

“court” in the description of damages recoverable, is
unlikely.
*
*
*
Because the CROA is silent on whether claims under
the Act can proceed in an arbitrable forum, the FAA requires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according
to its terms. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
