COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

dispute-resolution mechanism. The “right to sue,” the
Court explains, merely connotes the vindication of legal
rights, whether in court or before an arbitrator. That
reading may be comprehensible to one trained to “think
like a lawyer.” But Congress enacted the CROA with
vulnerable consumers in mind—consumers likely to read
the words “right to sue” to mean the right to litigate in
court, not the obligation to submit disputes to binding
arbitration.
In accord with the Ninth Circuit, I would hold that
Congress, in an Act meant to curb deceptive practices, did
not authorize credit repair organizations to make a false
or misleading disclosure—telling consumers of a right they
do not, in fact, possess. If the Act affords consumers a
nonwaivable right to sue in court, as I believe it does, a
credit repair organization cannot retract that right by
making arbitration the consumer’s sole recourse.

CompuCredit marketed a credit card to consumers with
weak credit ratings. It did so through massive direct-mail
and Internet solicitations, urging recipients to acquire a
card under the brand name Aspire Visa, and thereby
“rebuild poor credit” and “improve [their] credit rating.”
App. 40, Complaint ¶11 (internal quotation marks omit­
ted). Plaintiffs, individuals who applied for and received
CompuCredit’s card, sought redress for multiple violations
of the CROA.
Their complaint alleged that CompuCredit’s promotion­
al materials told potential customers that no deposit
would be required, and that cardholders would receive,
upfront, a credit line of $300. In fact, plaintiffs asserted,
they were charged an initial finance fee of $29, a monthly
fee of $6.50, and an annual fee of $150, assessed immedi­
ately against the $300 limit. In the aggregate, plaintiffs
calculated, fees charged the first year amounted to $257.
