COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD
Syllabus
flawed. The disclosure provision creates only a right for consumers to
receive a specific statement describing the consumer protections that
the law elsewhere provides, one of which is the right to enforce a
credit repair organization’s “liab[ility]” for “fail[ure] to comply with
[the Act].” §1679g(a). That provision does not override the FAA’s
mandate. Its mere contemplation of judicial enforcement does not
demonstrate that the Act provides consumers with a “right” to initial
judicial enforcement. Pp. 3–8.
(c) At the time of the CROA’s enactment in 1996, arbitration clauses such as the one at issue were no rarity in consumer contracts generally, or in financial services contracts in particular. Had Congress
meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the CROA, it
would have done so in a manner less obtuse than what respondents
suggest. Pp. 8–9.

615 F. 3d 1204, reversed and remanded.
SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,
C. J., and KENNEDY, THOMAS, BREYER, and ALITO, JJ., joined. SOTOMAYOR, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which KAGAN, J., joined. GINSBURG, J., filed a dissenting opinion.
