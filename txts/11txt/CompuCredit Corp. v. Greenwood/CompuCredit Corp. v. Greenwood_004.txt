COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD
Opinion of the Court

claims largely involved the defendants’ allegedly misleading representation that the credit card could be used to
rebuild poor credit and their assessment of multiple fees
upon opening of the accounts, which greatly reduced the
advertised credit limit.
The District Court denied the defendants’ motion to
compel arbitration of the claims, concluding that “Congress intended claims under the CROA to be nonarbitrable.” 617 F. Supp. 2d 980, 988 (2009). A panel of
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed, Judge Tashima dissenting. 615 F. 3d 1204

Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., enacted in 1925 as a response to judicial hostility to arbitration.
AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___, ___
(2011) (slip op., at 4). As relevant here, the FAA provides:
“A written provision in any maritime transaction or

arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be
valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such
grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation
of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2.
This provision establishes “a liberal federal policy favoring
arbitration agreements.” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983). See
also, e.g., Concepcion, supra, at __ (slip op., at 4); Gilmer v.
Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 25 (1991). It
requires courts to enforce agreements to arbitrate according to their terms. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,
470 U. S. 213, 221 (1985). That is the case even when
the claims at issue are federal statutory claims, unless the
