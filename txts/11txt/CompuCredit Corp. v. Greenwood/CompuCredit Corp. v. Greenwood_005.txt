Opinion of the Court

FAA’s mandate has been “overridden by a contrary congressional command.” Shearson/American Express Inc. v.
McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226 (1987). See also Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.
614, 628 (1985). Respondents contend that the CROA

organizations, defined as certain entities that offer services for the purpose of “(i) improving any consumer’s

Enforcement is achieved through the Act’s provision of a

contract is executed. §1679c(a). One sentence of that
required statement reads, “ ‘You have a right to sue a
credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair
Organization Act.’ ” The Act’s nonwaiver provision states,

District Court said that petitioners do not dispute that they
come within this definition. See 617 F. Supp. 980, 984, n. 2 (ND Cal.
2009). The Ninth Circuit did not address that issue, see 615 F. 3d
1204, 1207, n. 3 (2010), nor do we.
