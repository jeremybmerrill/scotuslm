GINSBURG, J., dissenting

necessary to proscribe the arbitration clause CompuCredit
seeks to enforce.

The CROA mandates that potential customers shall be
told of their “right to sue a credit repair organization” for
damages arising from deceptive practices. 15 U. S. C.
§1679c(a). But CompuCredit’s adhesion contract provided
that consumers would “not have the right to go to court.”
App. 61 (capitalization omitted). Congress’ direction must
prevail over CompuCredit’s opposing declaration. Accord­
ingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit.
