COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

sue,” §1679c(a), with the extremely limited judicial review
given to an arbitrator’s award, see, e.g., Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576, 586–589
(2008).
The Court discounts the references to “action,” “class
action,” and “court” in §1679g, the provision that “cre­
ate[s]” the consumers’ claim for relief. See ante, at 5.
Despite similar statutory language, the Court observes, we
have enforced arbitration agreements to settle disputes
arising under other Acts of Congress. The CROA, however, is distinguished by its disclosure requirements,
prime among them, the obligation imposed on the credit
repair organization to inform potential customers they
“have a right to sue” an organization that violates the Act.
§1679c(a). Yet the Court refuses to read this language in
concert with §1679g, notwithstanding our frequent ac­
knowledgment that “a statute is to be read as a whole,
since the meaning of statutory language . . . depends on
context.” King v. St. Vincent’s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221
(1991) (citation omitted). As just explained, I believe
Congress meant what an ordinary reader of the disclosure
requirement would likely comprehend: A credit repair
organization that engages in deceptive practices may be
sued in court.
Reducing the required disclosure to insignificance, see
ante, at 4–5, the Court’s construction of the CROA scarcely
advances the Act’s goals. Congress aimed to ensure pro­
spective customers “are provided with the information
necessary to make an informed decision,” and also to
“protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising
and business practices.” 15 U. S. C. §1679(b). The Court’s
interpretation, however, enables the very deception Con­
gress sought to suppress. Today’s decision permits credit
repair organizations to deny consumers, through fine print
in a contract, an important right whose disclosure is de­
creed in the U. S. Code.
