ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[March 20, 2012]


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.
I

A

Let me get this straight: Out of concern for the values of
federalism; to preserve the ability of our States to provide
prompt justice; and in light of our longstanding jurisprudence holding that there is no constitutional right to
counsel in state collateral review; the Court, in what it
portrays as an admirable exercise of judicial restraint,
abstains from holding that there is a constitutional right
to counsel in initial-review state habeas. After all, that
would have meant, in a case such as the one before us,
that failing to provide assistance of counsel, or providing
assistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland
standard, would constitute cause for excusing procedural
default. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668
(1984). Instead of taking that radical step, the Court
holds that, for equitable reasons, in a case such as the one
before us, failing to provide assistance of counsel, or
providing assistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland standard, constitutes cause for excusing procedural
default. The result, of course, is precisely the same.
