MARTINEZ v. RYAN
SCALIA, J., dissenting

prohibited by state law from raising on direct appeal
any claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, but
who has a state-law right to raise such a claim in a
first post-conviction proceeding, has a federal constitutional right to effective assistance of first postconviction counsel specifically with respect to his
ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.” Pet. for
Cert. i.
While the Court’s decision not to answer the question did
not avoid the costs a constitutional holding would have
imposed on States, it did avoid the Court’s need to confront the established rule that there is no right to counsel
in collateral proceedings. To avoid his procedural default,
Martinez advocates in favor of an exception to this rule
where the prisoner seeks the right to counsel in an initialreview collateral proceeding—an argument we have previously declined to address. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 755.
The argument is quite clearly foreclosed by our precedent. In Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551 (1987), and
Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989), we stated unequivocally that prisoners do not “have a constitutional
right to counsel when mounting collateral attacks upon
their convictions.” Finley, supra, at 555. See also Giarratano, 492 U. S., at 10 (plurality opinion) (“[T]he rule
of Pennsylvania v. Finley should apply no differently
in capital cases than in noncapital cases”); id., at 14
(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (indicating that
the Constitution does not categorically require States to
provide counsel to death-row inmates seeking state habeas
review). Though Finley may have involved only claims
that could have been raised on direct review, see 481 U. S.,
at 553; Giarratano, supra, at 24 (Stevens, J., dissenting),
the Court was no doubt aware that States often limit “the
collateral review process [to] issues that have not previously been litigated or argued on the direct appeal.” Brief
