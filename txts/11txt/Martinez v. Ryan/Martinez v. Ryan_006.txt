Opinion of the Court

ney began a state collateral proceeding by filing a “Notice
of Post-Conviction Relief.” Martinez v. Schriro, 623 F. 3d
731, 733–734 (CA9 2010); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.4(a)
(2011). Despite initiating this proceeding, counsel made
no claim trial counsel was ineffective and later filed a
statement asserting she could find no colorable claims at
all. 623 F. 3d, at 734. Cf. State v. Smith, 184 Ariz. 456,
459, 910 P. 2d 1, 4 (1996).
The state trial court hearing the collateral proceeding
gave Martinez 45 days to file a pro se petition in support of
postconviction relief and to raise any claims he believed
his counsel overlooked. 623 F. 3d, at 734; see Smith,
supra, at 459, 910 P. 2d, at 4. Martinez did not respond.
He later alleged that he was unaware of the ongoing col­
lateral proceedings and that counsel failed to advise him
of the need to file a pro se petition to preserve his rights.
The state trial court dismissed the action for postconvic­
tion relief, in effect affirming counsel’s determination that
Martinez had no meritorious claims. 623 F. 3d, at 734.
The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed Martinez’s convic­
tion, and the Arizona Supreme Court denied review. Id.,
at 733.
About a year and a half later, Martinez, now represent­
ed by new counsel, filed a second notice of postconviction
relief in the Arizona trial court. Id., at 734. Martinez
claimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to
challenge the prosecution’s evidence. He argued, for ex­
ample, that his trial counsel should have objected to the
expert testimony explaining the victim’s recantations or
should have called an expert witness in rebuttal. Mar­
tinez also faulted trial counsel for not pursuing an excul­
patory explanation for the DNA on the nightgown. App. to
Brief in Opposition B–6 to B–12. Martinez’s petition was
dismissed, in part in reliance on an Arizona Rule barring
relief on a claim that could have been raised in a previous
collateral proceeding. Id., at B–27; see Ariz. Rule Crim.
