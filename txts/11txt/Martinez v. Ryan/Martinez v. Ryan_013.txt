MARTINEZ v. RYAN
Opinion of the Court

ety by reserving the claim of ineffective assistance for a
collateral proceeding. See Massaro v. United States, 538
U. S. 500, 505 (2003). Ineffective-assistance claims often
depend on evidence outside the trial record. Direct ap­
peals, without evidentiary hearings, may not be as effec­
tive as other proceedings for developing the factual basis
for the claim. Ibid. Abbreviated deadlines to expand the
record on direct appeal may not allow adequate time for
an attorney to investigate the ineffective-assistance claim.
See Primus, Structural Reform in Criminal Defense, 92
Cornell L. Rev. 679, 689, and n. 57 (2004) (most rules give
between 5 and 30 days from the time of conviction to file a
request to expand the record on appeal). Thus, there are
sound reasons for deferring consideration of ineffective­
assistance-of-trial-counsel claims until the collateral­
review stage, but this decision is not without consequences
for the State’s ability to assert a procedural default in
later proceedings. By deliberately choosing to move trial­
ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process,
where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed, the State
significantly diminishes prisoners’ ability to file such
claims. It is within the context of this state procedural
framework that counsel’s ineffectiveness in an initial­
review collateral proceeding qualifies as cause for a proce­
dural default.
The rules for when a prisoner may establish cause to
excuse a procedural default are elaborated in the exercise
of the Court’s discretion. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.
467, 490 (1991); see also Coleman, supra, at 730–731;
Sykes, 433 U. S., at 83; Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 9 (1984);
Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 430 (1963), overruled in part
by Sykes, supra. These rules reflect an equitable judg­
ment that only where a prisoner is impeded or obstructed
in complying with the State’s established procedures will a
federal habeas court excuse the prisoner from the usual
sanction of default. See, e.g., Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S.
