MARTINEZ v. RYAN
Opinion of the Court

an ineffective-assistance claim when the claim was not
properly presented in state court due to an attorney’s
errors in an initial-review collateral proceeding.
I
A jury convicted petitioner, Luis Mariano Martinez, of
two counts of sexual conduct with a minor under the age
of 15. The prosecution introduced a videotaped forensic
interview with the victim, Martinez’s 11-year-old step­
daughter. It also put in evidence the victim’s nightgown,
with traces of Martinez’s DNA. As part of his defense,
Martinez introduced evidence of the victim’s recantations,
including testimony from the victim’s grandmother and
mother and a second videotaped interview in which the
victim denied any abuse. The victim also denied any
abuse when she testified at trial. App. to Pet. for Cert.
38a–39a. To explain the inconsistencies, a prosecution
expert testified that recantations of child-abuse accusa­
tions are caused often by reluctance on the part of the
victim’s mother to lend support to the child’s claims. Pet.
for Cert. 3. After considering the conflicting evidence, the
jury convicted Martinez. He was sentenced to two consec­
utive terms of life imprisonment with no possibility of
parole for 35 years. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.
The State appointed a new attorney to represent Mar­
tinez in his direct appeal. Ibid.; Pet. for Cert. 4. She
made numerous arguments on Martinez’s behalf, includ­
ing a claim that the evidence was insufficient and that
newly discovered evidence warranted a new trial. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 39a. Arizona law, however, did not permit
her to argue on direct appeal that trial counsel was inef­
fective. State v. Spreitz, 202 Ariz. 1, 3, 39 P. 3d 525, 527
(2002). Arizona instead requires claims of ineffective
assistance at trial to be reserved for state collateral
proceedings.
While Martinez’s direct appeal was pending, the attor­
