Opinion of the Court

Coleman, noted the general rule that there is no constitu­
tional right to counsel in collateral proceedings. 623 F. 3d,
at 736. The Court of Appeals recognized that Coleman
reserved ruling on whether there is “an exception” to this
rule in those cases “where ‘state collateral review is the
first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his convic­
tion.’ ” 623 F. 3d, at 736 (quoting Coleman, supra, at 755).
It concluded, nevertheless, that the controlling cases
established no basis for the exception. Certiorari was
granted. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).

Coleman v. Thompson, supra, left open, and the Court of
Appeals in this case addressed, a question of constitution­
al law: whether a prisoner has a right to effective counsel
in collateral proceedings which provide the first occasion
to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial. These
proceedings can be called, for purposes of this opinion,
“initial-review collateral proceedings.” Coleman had suggested, though without holding, that the Constitution
may require States to provide counsel in initial-review
collateral proceedings because “in [these] cases . . . state
collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a
challenge to his conviction.” Id., at 755. As Coleman
noted, this makes the initial-review collateral proceeding a
prisoner’s “one and only appeal” as to an ineffective­
assistance claim, id., at 756 (emphasis deleted; internal
quotation marks omitted), and this may justify an excep­
tion to the constitutional rule that there is no right to
counsel in collateral proceedings. See id., at 755; Douglas
v. California, 372 U. S. 353, 357 (1963) (holding States
must appoint counsel on a prisoner’s first appeal).
This is not the case, however, to resolve whether that
exception exists as a constitutional matter. The precise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an
initial-review collateral proceeding on a claim of ineffective
