MARTINEZ v. RYAN
Opinion of the Court

an evidentiary hearing, as claims of ineffective assistance
often do. See, e.g., Ky. Rule Crim. Proc. 11.42(5) (2011);
La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 930.7(C) (West 2008);
Mich. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.505(A) (2011); S. C. Rule Civ.
Proc. 71.1(d) (2011). Other States appoint counsel if the
claims have some merit to them or the state habeas trial
court deems the record worthy of further development.
See, e.g., Ark. Rule Crim. Proc. 37.3(b) (2011); Colo. Rule
Crim. Proc. 35(b) (2011); Del. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc.
61(e)(1) (2011); Indiana Rule Post-Conviction Remedies
Proc. 1, §9(a) (rev. 2011); Kan. Stat. Ann. §22–4506 (2007);
N. M. Dist. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 5–802 (2011); Hust v.
State, 147 Idaho 682, 683–684, 214 P. 3d 668, 669–670
(2009); Hardin v. Arkansas, 350 Ark. 299, 301, 86 S. W. 3d
384, 385 (2007) (per curiam); Jensen v. State, 2004 ND
200, ¶13, 688 N. W. 2d 374, 378; Wu v. United States, 798
A. 2d 1083, 1089 (D. C. 2002); Kostal v. People, 167 Colo.
317, 447 P. 2d 536 (1968). It is likely that most of the
attorneys appointed by the courts are qualified to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing professional
norms; and, where that is so, the States may enforce a
procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.

This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate
the usual concerns with upsetting reliance interests pro­
tected by stare decisis principles. Cf., e.g., Montejo v.
Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792–793 (2009). Coleman held
that an attorney’s negligence in a postconviction proceed­
ing does not establish cause, and this remains true except
as to initial-review collateral proceedings for claims of
ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Coleman itself
did not involve an occasion when an attorney erred in an
initial-review collateral proceeding with respect to a claim
of ineffective trial counsel; and in the 20 years since Coleman was decided, we have not held Coleman applies in
