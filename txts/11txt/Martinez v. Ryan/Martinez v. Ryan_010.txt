Opinion of the Court

federal law. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 750. There is no
dispute that Arizona’s procedural bar on successive peti­
tions is an independent and adequate state ground. Thus,
a federal court can hear Martinez’s ineffective-assistance
claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the proce­
dural default.
Coleman held that “[n]egligence on the part of a prison­
er’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as ‘cause.’ ”
Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at
12). Coleman reasoned that “because the attorney is the
prisoner’s agent . . . under ‘well-settled principles of agen­
cy law,’ the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on
the part of his agent.” Maples, supra, at ___ (slip op., at
12).
Coleman, however, did not present the occasion to apply
this principle to determine whether attorney errors in
initial-review collateral proceedings may qualify as cause
for a procedural default. The alleged failure of counsel in
Coleman was on appeal from an initial-review collateral
proceeding, and in that proceeding the prisoner’s claims
had been addressed by the state habeas trial court. See
501 U. S., at 755.
As Coleman recognized, this marks a key difference
between initial-review collateral proceedings and other
kinds of collateral proceedings. When an attorney errs in
initial-review collateral proceedings, it is likely that no
state court at any level will hear the prisoner’s claim.
This Court on direct review of the state proceeding could
not consider or adjudicate the claim. See, e.g., Fox Film
Corp. v. Muller, 296 U. S. 207 (1935); Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590 (1875); cf. Coleman, supra, at 730–731.
And if counsel’s errors in an initial-review collateral pro­
ceeding do not establish cause to excuse the procedural
default in a federal habeas proceeding, no court will re­
view the prisoner’s claims.
The same is not true when counsel errs in other kinds of
