MARTINEZ v. RYAN
SCALIA, J., dissenting

a timely fashion. The balance it strikes between the finality of criminal judgments and the need to provide for
review of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of trial
counsel grossly underestimates both the frequency of such
claims in federal habeas, and the incentives to argue
(since it is a free pass to federal habeas) that appointed
counsel was ineffective in failing to raise such claims. The
balance might have been close (though it would disregard
our established jurisprudence) if the Court merely held
that uncounseled failure to raise ineffective assistance of
trial counsel would not constitute default. But in adding
to that the rule that counseled failure to raise it may also
provide an excuse, the Court creates a monstrosity. For
these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
