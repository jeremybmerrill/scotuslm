SCALIA, J., dissenting

v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 127 (1995) (THOMAS, J.,
concurring)).
Noticeably absent from the Court’s equitable analysis,
moreover, is any consideration of the very reason for a
procedural-default rule: the comity and respect that federal courts must accord state-court judgments.
See
Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U. S. 446, 451 (2000). The

Coleman, supra, at 731). Unlike today’s decision, Carrier
and Coleman took account of the significant costs federal
habeas review imposes on States, including the “reduction
in the finality of litigation and the frustration of ‘both the
States’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their
good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.’ ” Carrier, supra, at 487 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107,
128 (1982)). Criminal conviction ought to be final before
society has forgotten the crime that justifies it. When a
case arrives at federal habeas, the state conviction and
sentence at issue (never mind the underlying crime) are
already a dim memory, on average more than 6 years old
(7 years for capital cases).5 I would adhere to the precedents that prevent a bad situation from becoming worse.

their arguments to, the following question:
