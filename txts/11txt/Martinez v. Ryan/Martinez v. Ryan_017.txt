MARTINEZ v. RYAN
Opinion of the Court

a claim of ineffective assistance at trial, even though that
initial-review collateral proceeding may be deficient for
other reasons.
In addition, the limited nature of the qualification to
Coleman adopted here reflects the importance of the right
to the effective assistance of trial counsel and Arizona’s
decision to bar defendants from raising ineffective­
assistance claims on direct appeal. Our holding here
addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this
case, where the State barred the defendant from raising
the claims on direct appeal.
Arizona contends that the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254,
bars Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for
a procedural default. AEDPA refers to attorney error in
collateral proceedings, but it does not speak to the ques­
tion presented in this case. Section 2254(i) provides that
“the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during
Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings
shall not be a ground for relief.” “Cause,” however, is not
synonymous with “a ground for relief.” A finding of cause
and prejudice does not entitle the prisoner to habeas relief.
It merely allows a federal court to consider the merits of
a claim that otherwise would have been procedurally de­
faulted. In this case, for example, Martinez’s “ground for
relief ” is his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, a
claim that AEDPA does not bar. Martinez relies on the
ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney to excuse his
failure to comply with Arizona’s procedural rules, not as
an independent basis for overturning his conviction. In
short, while §2254(i) precludes Martinez from relying on
the ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney as a
“ground for relief,” it does not stop Martinez from using it
to establish “cause.” Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___
