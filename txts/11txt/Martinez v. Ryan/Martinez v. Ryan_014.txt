Opinion of the Court

263, 289 (1999); Reed, supra, at 16. Allowing a federal
habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance of
trial counsel when an attorney’s errors (or the absence of
an attorney) caused a procedural default in an initial­
review collateral proceeding acknowledges, as an equitable
matter, that the initial-review collateral proceeding, if
undertaken without counsel or with ineffective counsel,
may not have been sufficient to ensure that proper consid­
eration was given to a substantial claim. From this it
follows that, when a State requires a prisoner to raise an
ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in a collateral
proceeding, a prisoner may establish cause for a default of
an ineffective-assistance claim in two circumstances. The
first is where the state courts did not appoint counsel in
the initial-review collateral proceeding for a claim of inef­
fective assistance at trial. The second is where appointed
counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding, where
the claim should have been raised, was ineffective under
the standards of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668
(1984). To overcome the default, a prisoner must also
demonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-of­
trial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say
that the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has
some merit. Cf. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 (2003)
(describing standards for certificates of appealability to
issue).
Most jurisdictions have in place procedures to ensure
counsel is appointed for substantial ineffective-assistance
claims. Some States, including Arizona, appoint counsel
in every first collateral proceeding. See, e.g., Alaska Stat.
18.85.100(c) (2010); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.4(c)(2)
(2011); Conn. Gen. Stat. §51–296(a) (2011); Me. Rules
Crim. Proc. 69, 70(c) (2010); N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §7A–
451(a)(2) (2009); N. J. Ct. Rule 3:22–6(b) (2012); R. I. Gen.
Laws §10–9.1–5 (Lexis 1997); Tenn. Code Ann. §8–14–205
(2011). Some States appoint counsel if the claims require
