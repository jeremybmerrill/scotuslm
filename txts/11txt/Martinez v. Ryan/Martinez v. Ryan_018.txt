Opinion of the Court

III
Where, under state law, claims of ineffective assistance
of trial counsel must be raised in an initial-review collat­
eral proceeding, a procedural default will not bar a federal
habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffec­
tive assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral
proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that pro­
ceeding was ineffective.
In this case Martinez’s attorney in the initial-review
collateral proceeding filed a notice akin to an Anders brief,
in effect conceding that Martinez lacked any meritorious
claim, including his claim of ineffective assistance at trial.
See Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738 (1967). Martinez
argued before the federal habeas court that filing the
Anders brief constituted ineffective assistance. The Court
of Appeals did not decide whether that was so. Rather, it
held that because Martinez did not have a right to an
attorney in the initial-review collateral proceeding, the
attorney’s errors in the initial-review collateral proceeding
could not establish cause for the failure to comply with the
State’s rules. Thus, the Court of Appeals did not deter­
mine whether Martinez’s attorney in his first collateral
proceeding was ineffective or whether his claim of ineffec­
tive assistance of trial counsel is substantial. And the
court did not address the question of prejudice. These
issues remain open for a decision on remand.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
