SCALIA, J., dissenting

for Respondent in Finley, O. T. 1986, No. 85–2099, p. 11,
n. 5. And Giarratano, which involved a class action filed
under 42 U. S. C. §1983, addressed the general assertion
that the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel
for collateral attacks on capital convictions. See 492 U. S.,
at 3–4 (plurality opinion). The Court rejected that assertion without qualification. The dissenting opinion, moreover, made the precise argument Martinez now asserts:
under state law “some claims [including ineffective assistance of trial counsel] ordinarily heard on direct review
will be relegated to postconviction proceedings.” Id., at 24
(Stevens, J., dissenting). See also Brief for Respondents in
Giarratano, O. T. 1988, No. 88–411, p. 29, n. 8 (“In [Virginia capital habeas] proceedings, Death Row inmates
seek to assert claims that have not been, and could not
have been addressed on direct appeal . . . ”). Thus, in
announcing a categorical rule in Finley, see Giarratano,
supra, at 12 (plurality opinion), and then reaffirming it in
Giarratano, the Court knew full well that a collateral
proceeding may present the first opportunity for a prisoner to raise a constitutional claim. I would follow that rule
in this case and reject Martinez’s argument that there is a
constitutional right to counsel in initial-review collateral
proceedings.

Far from avoiding the consequences a constitutional
holding would have imposed on the States, today’s holding
as a practical matter requires States to appoint counsel in
initial-review collateral proceedings—and, to boot, eliminates the pre-existing assurance of escaping federalhabeas review for claims that appointed counsel fails to
present. Despite the Court’s protestations to the contrary,
the decision is a radical alteration of our habeas jurisprudence that will impose considerable economic costs on the
States and further impair their ability to provide justice in
