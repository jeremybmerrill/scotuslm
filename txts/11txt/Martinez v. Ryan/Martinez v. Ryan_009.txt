MARTINEZ v. RYAN
Opinion of the Court

assistance at trial may provide cause for a procedural
default in a federal habeas proceeding. To protect prison­
ers with a potentially legitimate claim of ineffective assis­
tance of trial counsel, it is necessary to modify the unqual­
ified statement in Coleman that an attorney’s ignorance
or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not
qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default. This
opinion qualifies Coleman by recognizing a narrow excep­
tion: Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review
collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner’s
procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at
trial.
A
Federal habeas courts reviewing the constitutionality of
a state prisoner’s conviction and sentence are guided by
rules designed to ensure that state-court judgments are
accorded the finality and respect necessary to preserve the
integrity of legal proceedings within our system of federal­
ism. These rules include the doctrine of procedural de­
fault, under which a federal court will not review the
merits of claims, including constitutional claims, that a
state court declined to hear because the prisoner failed to
abide by a state procedural rule. See, e.g., Coleman, supra, at 747–748; Sykes, supra, at 84–85. A state court’s
invocation of a procedural rule to deny a prisoner’s claims
precludes federal review of the claims if, among other
requisites, the state procedural rule is a nonfederal
ground adequate to support the judgment and the rule is
firmly established and consistently followed. See, e.g.,
Walker v. Martin, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7–
8); Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at
7). The doctrine barring procedurally defaulted claims
from being heard is not without exceptions. A prisoner
may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing
cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of
