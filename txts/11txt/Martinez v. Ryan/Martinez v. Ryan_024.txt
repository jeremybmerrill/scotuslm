MARTINEZ v. RYAN
SCALIA, J., dissenting

counsel appointed for state collateral review raises the
ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim or not, federal
habeas review will proceed. In practical effect, that may
not make much difference in noncapital cases (except for
the squandering of state taxpayers’ money): The defendant
will stay in prison, continuing to serve his sentence, while
federal habeas review grinds on. But in capital cases, it will
effectively reduce the sentence, giving the defendant as
many more years to live, beyond the lives of the innocent
victims whose life he snuffed out, as the process of federal
habeas may consume. I guarantee that an assertion of
ineffective assistance of trial counsel will be made in all
capital cases from this date on, causing (because of today’s
holding) execution of the sentence to be deferred until
either that claim, or the claim that appointed counsel was
ineffective in failing to make that claim, has worked its
way through the federal system.
B
The Court would have us believe that today’s holding
is no more than a “limited qualification” to Coleman v.
Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). Ante, at 12. It is much
more than that: a repudiation of the longstanding principle governing procedural default, which Coleman and
other cases consistently applied. Coleman itself involved a
habeas petitioner’s contention that his attorney’s failure to
file a timely notice of appeal in his state habeas proceeding, which resulted in procedural default of the claims
raised in that proceeding, was cause to excuse that default
in federal habeas. 501 U. S., at 752. The petitioner in
that case contended that whether a violation of his constitutional right to effective counsel had occurred was of no
consequence, so long as the attorney’s conduct fell short of
the effectiveness standard set forth in Strickland. See 501
