Opinion of the Court

instance, U. S. libraries that attempt to catalogue U. S.
books. See post, at 12. See also Brief for American Library Association et al. as Amici Curiae 22 (Section 514
“exacerbated,” but did not create, the problem of orphan
works); U. S. Copyright Office, supra, at 41–44 (tracing
orphan-works problem to Congress’ elimination of formalities, commencing with the 1976 Copyright Act).36
Nor is this a matter appropriate for judicial, as opposed
to legislative, resolution. Cf. Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.,
770 F. Supp. 2d 666, 677–678 (SDNY 2011) (rejecting
proposed “Google Books” class settlement because, inter
alia, “the establishment of a mechanism for exploiting
unclaimed books is a matter more suited for Congress
than this Court” (citing Eldred, 537 U. S., at 212)). Indeed, the host of policy and logistical questions identified
by the dissent speak for themselves. Post, at 12. Despite
“longstanding efforts,” see Authors Guild, 770 F. Supp. 2d,
at 678 (quoting statement of Marybeth Peters), Congress
has not yet passed ameliorative orphan-works legislation
of the sort enacted by other Berne members, see, e.g.,
Canada Copyright Act, R. S. C., 1985, c. C–42, §77 (authorizing Copyright Board to license use of orphan works
by persons unable, after making reasonable efforts, to
locate the copyright owner). Heretofore, no one has suggested that the orphan-works issue should be addressed
through our implementation of Berne, rather than
through overarching legislation of the sort proposed in
Congress and cited by the dissent. See post, at 23–24;
U. S. Copyright Office, Legal Issues in Mass Digitization
25–29 (2011) (discussing recent legislative efforts). Our
unstinting adherence to Berne may add impetus to calls

public domain.
