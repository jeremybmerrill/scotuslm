GOLAN v. HOLDER
BREYER, J., dissenting

‘learned Men to compose and write useful Books’ the state
would provide a guaranteed, if temporally limited, right
to print and reprint those works.” Deazley, The Myth of
Copyright at Common Law, 62 Camb. L. J. 106, 108
(2003). At first, in their attempts to minimize their losses,
the booksellers argued that authors had a perpetual com­
mon-law copyright in their works deriving from their
natural rights as creators. But the House of Lords ulti­
mately held in Donaldson v. Beckett, 1 Eng. Rep. 837
(1774), that the Statute of Anne had transformed any such
perpetual common-law copyright into a copyright of a
limited term designed to serve the public interest. Patter­
son 15–16, 153, 158–179; Deazley, supra, at 114–126.
Many early colonial copyright statutes, patterned after
the Statute of Anne, also stated that copyright’s objective
was to encourage authors to produce new works and
thereby improve learning. See U. S. Copyright Office,
Copyright Enactments, Bulletin No. 3, pp. 1, 6, 10, 11, 17,
19 (rev. 1963) (statutes of Connecticut, New Jersey, Penn­
sylvania, South Carolina, Georgia, and New York); Wal­
terscheid 74–75; Bracha, The Adventures of the Statute of
Anne in the Land of Unlimited Possibilities: The Life of a
Legal Transplant, 25 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 1427, 1444–
1450 (2010).
At least, that was the predominant view expressed to,
or by, the Founders. Patterson 93. Thomas Jefferson, for
example, initially expressed great uncertainty as to
whether the Constitution should authorize the grant of
copyrights and patents at all, writing that “the benefit
even of limited monopolies is too doubtful” to warrant
anything other than their “suppression.” Letter from
Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13
Papers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 443 (J. Boyd ed. 1956).
James Madison also thought that “Monopolies . . . are
justly classed among the greatest nu[i]sances in Govern­
ment.” Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson
