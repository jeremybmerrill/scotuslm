Opinion of the Court

Berne, however, did not provide a potent enforcement
mechanism. The Convention contemplates dispute resolution before the International Court of Justice. Art. 33(1).
But it specifies no sanctions for noncompliance and allows
parties, at any time, to declare themselves “not . . . bound”
by the Convention’s dispute resolution provision. Art.

articles. TRIPS, Art. 9.1, 33 I. L. M. 1197, 1201 (requiring
adherence to all but the “moral rights” provisions of Article 6bis). The WTO gave teeth to the Convention’s requirements: Noncompliance with a WTO ruling could

parties calls into question the dissent’s assertion that, despite the 1988
Act’s minimalist approach, “[t]he United States obtained the benefits of
Berne for many years.” Post, at 22–23. During this six-year period,
Congress had reason to doubt that U. S. authors enjoyed the full
benefits of Berne membership.
