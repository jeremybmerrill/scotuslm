This statute does not serve copyright’s traditional public
ends, namely the creation of monetary awards that “moti­
vate the creative activity of authors,” Sony, 464 U. S.,
at 429, “encourag[e] individual effort,” Mazer, 347 U. S.,
at 219, and thereby “serve the cause of promoting broad
public availability of literature, music, and the other arts,”
Twentieth Century Music, 422 U. S., at 156. The statute
grants its “restored copyright[s]” only to works already
produced. It provides no monetary incentive to produce
anything new. Unlike other American copyright statutes
from the time of the Founders onwards, including the
statute at issue in Eldred, it lacks any significant copy­
right-related quid pro quo.
The majority seeks to avoid this awkward fact by refer­
ring to past congressional practice that mostly suggests
that Congress may provide new or increased protection
both to newly created and to previously created, works.
Ante, at 16, 18; Act of May 31, 1790, §1, 1 Stat. 124 (con­
ferring its new federal copyright on new works as well as
old); Act of July 3, 1832, §3, 4 Stat. 559 (authorizing new
patents for past and future inventors who inadvertently
failed to comply with applicable statutory formalities);
McClurg v. Kingsland, 1 How. 202 (1843) (applying an act
deeming a past or future inventor’s patent valid despite it
being briefly used by, for example, the inventor’s employ­
er). I do not dispute that copyright power. Insofar as such
a statute does the former, i.e., extends protection to newly
created material, it embodies copyright’s traditional justi­
fication—eliciting new production. And I do not doubt
that Congress may then also include existing works within
the scope of, say, increased protection for equitable and
administrative reasons. See Eldred, 537 U. S. at 204,
