Opinion of the Court

had no right to exclusivity in the United States for any
of three reasons: lack of copyright relations between the
country of origin and the United States at the time of
publication; lack of subject-matter protection for sound
recordings fixed before 1972; and failure to comply with
U. S. statutory formalities (e.g., failure to provide notice of
copyright status, or to register and renew a copyright).

11 From the first Copyright Act until late in the 20th century, Congress conditioned copyright protection on compliance with certain
statutory formalities. The most notable required an author to register
her work, renew that registration, and affix to published copies notice
of copyrighted status. The formalities drew criticism as a trap for the
unwary. See, e.g., 2 Nimmer §7.01[A], p. 7–8; Doyle, Cary, McCannon,
& Ringer, Notice of Copyright, Study No. 7, p. 46 (1957), reprinted in
1 Studies on Copyright 229, 272 (1963).
In 1976, Congress eliminated the registration renewal requirement
for future works. Copyright Act of 1976, §302, 408, 90 Stat. 2572, 2580.
In 1988, it repealed the mandatory notice prerequisite. BCIA §7, 102
Stat. 2857. And in 1992, Congress made renewal automatic for works
still in their first term of protection. Copyright Amendments Act of
1992, 106 Stat. 264–266. The Copyright Act retains, however, incentives for authors to register their works and provide notice of the works’
copyrighted status. See, e.g., 17 U. S. C. §405(b) (precluding actual and
statutory damages against “innocent infringers” of a work that lacked
notice of copyrighted status); §411(a) (requiring registration of U. S.
“work[s],” but not foreign works, before an owner may sue for infringement). The revisions successively made accord with Berne Convention
Article 5(2), which proscribes application of copyright formalities to
foreign authors. Berne, however, affords domestic authors no escape
from domestic formalities. See Art. 5(3) (protection within country of
origin is a matter of domestic law).
