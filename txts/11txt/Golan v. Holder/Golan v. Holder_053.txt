GOLAN v. HOLDER
BREYER, J., dissenting

U. S., at 222. But does the Clause empower Congress to
enact a statute that withdraws works from the public
domain, brings about higher prices and costs, and in doing
so seriously restricts dissemination, particularly to those
who need it for scholarly, educational, or cultural purposes—all without providing any additional incentive for
the production of new material? That is the question
before us. And, as I have said, I believe the answer is no.
Congress in this statute has exceeded what are, under any
plausible reading of the Copyright Clause, its permissible
limits.
II
The Act before us says that it “restores” American copy­
right to a set of works, which, for the most part, did not
previously enjoy American copyright protection. These
works had fallen into America’s public domain, but as of
the “restoration” date, they had not yet fallen into the pub­
lic domain of the foreign country where they originated.
The statute covers works originating almost anywhere
outside the United States. See 17 U. S. C. §104A(h)(3)
(setting out eligibility criteria); U. S. Copyright Office,
Circular No. 38A: International Copyright Relations of the
United States (2010). The relevant set of works consists
primarily of works originating abroad that did not obtain,
or at some point lost, American copyright protection be­
cause (1) the author failed to comply with applicable
American copyright formalities (such as notice or renew­
al), or (2) the nation in which they were first published
then lacked copyright relations with the United States, or
(3) they are sound recordings fixed before February 15,
1972. §104A(h)(6)(C). A work must also satisfy other
technical requirements: It must have had a rightholder
who was a national or resident of an eligible country on
the day it was created; and it cannot have been published
in the United States within 30 days of its first publication.
