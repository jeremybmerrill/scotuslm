BREYER, J., dissenting

(Oct. 17, 1788), in 14 id., at 16, 21 (J. Boyd ed. 1958). But
he argued that “in certain cases” such as copyright, mo­
nopolies should “be granted” (“with caution, and guarded
with strictness agst abuse”) to serve as “compensation
for a benefit actually gained to the community . . . which
the owner might otherwise withhold from public use.” Mo­
nopolies. Perpetuities. Corporations. Ecclesiastical En­
dowments. in J. Madison, Writings 756 (J. Rakove ed.
1999) (emphasis added). Jefferson eventually came to
agree with Madison, supporting a limited conferral of
monopoly rights but only “as an encouragement to men to
pursue ideas which may produce utility.” Letter from
Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13, 1813), in 6
Papers of Thomas Jefferson, at 379, 383 (J. Looney ed.
2009) (emphasis added).
This utilitarian view of copyrights and patents, em­

“natural rights” view underlying much of continental
European copyright law—a view that the English

following the enactment of the Statute of Anne and that in
part motivated the enactment of some of the colonial
statutes. Patterson 158–179, 183–192. Premised on the

the fruits of his labor, it mythically stems from a legend­
ary 6th-century statement of King Diarmed “ ‘to every cow
her calf, and accordingly to every book its copy.’ ” A.
Birrell, Seven Lectures on the Law and History of Copy­
right in Books 42 (1899). That view, though perhaps
reflected in the Court’s opinion, ante, at 30, runs contrary
to the more utilitarian views that influenced the writing of
our own Constitution’s Copyright Clause. See S. Rick­
etson, The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary
and Artistic Works: 1886–1986, pp. 5–6 (1987) (The first
French copyright laws “placed authors’ rights on a more
elevated basis than the Act of Anne had done,” on the
