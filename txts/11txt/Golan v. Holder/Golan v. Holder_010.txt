GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

ations were ongoing over the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), Mexican authorities complained
about the United States’ refusal to grant protection, in
accord with Article 18, to Mexican works that remained
under copyright domestically. See Intellectual Property
and International Issues, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration,
House Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 1st Sess.,
168 (1991) (statement of Ralph Oman, U. S. Register of
Copyrights).5 The Register of Copyrights also reported
“questions” from Turkey, Egypt, and Austria. Ibid. Thailand and Russia balked at protecting U. S. works, copyrighted here but in those countries’ public domains, until
the United States reciprocated with respect to their authors’ works. URAA Joint Hearing 137 (statement of Ira
S. Shapiro, General Counsel, Office of the U. S. Trade
Representative (USTR)); id., at 208 (statement of Professor Shira Perlmutter); id., at 291 (statement of Jason S.
Berman, Recording Industry Association of America
(RIAA)).6

(“There is no basis on which [protection of existing works under Article
18] can be completely denied. The conditions and reservations,” authorized by Article 18(3) [and stressed by the dissent, post, at 23–24]
are of “limited” and “transitional” duration and “would not be permitted
to deny [protection] altogether in relation to a particular class . . . of
works.”).
5 NAFTA ultimately included a limited retroactivity provision—a
precursor to §514 of the URAA—granting U. S. copyright protection to
certain Mexican and Canadian films. These films had fallen into the
public domain, between 1978 and 1988, for failure to meet U. S. notice
requirements. See North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, §334, 107 Stat. 2115; Brief for Franklin Pierce Center for
Intellectual Property as Amicus Curiae 14–16. One year later, Congress replaced this provision with the version of 17 U. S. C. §104A at
issue here. See 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright §9A.03, 9A.04,
pp. 9A–17, 9A–22 (2011) (hereinafter Nimmer).
