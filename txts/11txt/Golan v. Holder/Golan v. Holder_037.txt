APPENDIX

Title 17 U. S. C. §104A provides:
“(a) AUTOMATIC PROTECTION AND TERM.—
“(1) TERM.—
“(A) Copyright subsists, in accordance with this section, in restored works, and vests automatically on the
date of restoration.
“(B) Any work in which copyright is restored under
this section shall subsist for the remainder of the term of
copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted in the United States if the work never entered the
public domain in the United States.
“(2) EXCEPTION.—Any work in which the copyright was
ever owned or administered by the Alien Property Custodian and in which the restored copyright would be owned
by a government or instrumentality thereof, is not a restored work.
“(b) OWNERSHIP OF RESTORED COPYRIGHT.—A restored
work vests initially in the author or initial rightholder of
the work as determined by the law of the source country of
the work.
“(c) FILING OF NOTICE OF INTENT TO ENFORCE RESTORED
COPYRIGHT AGAINST RELIANCE PARTIES.—On or after the
date of restoration, any person who owns a copyright in a
restored work or an exclusive right therein may file with
the Copyright Office a notice of intent to enforce that
person’s copyright or exclusive right or may serve such a
notice directly on a reliance party. Acceptance of a notice
by the Copyright Office is effective as to any reliance
parties but shall not create a presumption of the validity
of any of the facts stated therein. Service on a reliance
party is effective as to that reliance party and any other
reliance parties with actual knowledge of such service and
of the contents of that notice.
“(d) REMEDIES FOR INFRINGEMENT OF RESTORED
COPYRIGHTS.—
