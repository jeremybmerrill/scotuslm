Opinion of the Court

Clause led Congress to include additional protections for
“reliance parties”—those who had, before the URAA’s
enactment, used or acquired a foreign work then in the
public domain. See §104A(h)(3)–(4).14 Reliance parties
may continue to exploit a restored work until the owner of
the restored copyright gives notice of intent to enforce—
either by filing with the U. S. Copyright Office within two
years of restoration, or by actually notifying the reliance
party. §104A(c), (d)(2)(A)(i), and (B)(i). After that, reliance parties may continue to exploit existing copies for a
grace period of one year. §104A(d)(2)(A)(ii), and (B)(ii).
Finally, anyone who, before the URAA’s enactment, created a “derivative work” based on a restored work may
indefinitely exploit the derivation upon payment to the
copyright holder of “reasonable compensation,” to be set by
a district judge if the parties cannot agree. §104A(d)(3).

In 2001, petitioners filed this lawsuit challenging §514.
They maintain that Congress, when it passed the URAA,
exceeded its authority under the Copyright Clause and
transgressed First Amendment limitations.15 The District

14 A reliance party must have used the work in a manner that would
constitute infringement had a valid copyright been in effect. See
§104A(h)(4)(A). After restoration, the reliance party is limited to her
previous uses. A performer of a restored work, for example, cannot,
post-restoration, venture to sell copies of the script. See 3 Nimmer
§9A.04[C][1][a], at 9A–45 to 9A–46.
15 Petitioners’ complaint also challenged the constitutionality of the
Copyright Term Extension Act, 112 Stat. 2827, which added 20 years to
the duration of existing and future copyrights. After this Court rejected
a similar challenge in Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186 (2003), the
District Court dismissed this portion of petitioners’ suit on the pleadings, Golan v. Ashcroft, 310 F. Supp. 2d 1215 (D. Colo. 2004). The
Tenth Circuit affirmed, Golan v. Gonzales, 501 F. 3d 1179 (2007), and
petitioners do not attempt to revive that claim in this Court, Pet. for
Cert. 7, n. 2. Neither have petitioners challenged the District Court’s
