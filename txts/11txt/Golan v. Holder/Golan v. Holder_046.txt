LAWRENCE GOLAN, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. ERIC H.
HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT
[January 18, 2012]

JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins,
dissenting.
In order “[t]o promote the Progress of Science” (by which
term the Founders meant “learning” or “knowledge”),
the Constitution’s Copyright Clause grants Congress the

best way to advance public welfare through the talents of
authors and inventors.’ ” Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186,
212, n. 18 (2003) (quoting Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. S. 201,
219 (1954)). See T. Macaulay, Speeches on Copyright 25
(E. Miller ed. 1913); E. Walterscheid, The Nature of the
Intellectual Property Clause: A Study in Historical Per­
spective 125–126 (2002) (hereinafter Walterscheid).
The statute before us, however, does not encourage
anyone to produce a single new work. By definition, it
bestows monetary rewards only on owners of old works—
