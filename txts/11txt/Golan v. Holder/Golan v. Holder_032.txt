GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

might sound exactly backwards: Rights typically vest at
the outset of copyright protection, in an author or
rightholder. See, e.g., 17 U. S. C. §201(a) (“Copyright in a
work protected . . . vests initially in the author . . . .”).
Once the term of protection ends, the works do not revest
in any rightholder. Instead, the works simply lapse into
the public domain. See, e.g., Berne, Art. 18(1), 828
U. N. T. S., at 251 (“This Convention shall apply to all
works which . . . have not yet fallen into the public domain . . . .”). Anyone has free access to the public domain,
but no one, after the copyright term has expired, acquires
ownership rights in the once-protected works.
Congress recurrently adjusts copyright law to protect
categories of works once outside the law’s compass. For
example, Congress broke new ground when it extended
copyright protection to foreign works in 1891, Act of Mar.
3, §13, 26 Stat. 1110; to dramatic works in 1856, Act of
Aug. 18, 11 Stat. 138; to photographs and photographic
negatives in 1865, Act of Mar. 3, §1, 13 Stat. 540; to motion pictures in 1912, Act of Aug. 24, 37 Stat. 488; to fixed
sound recordings in 1972, Act of Oct. 15, 1971, 85 Stat.
391; and to architectural works in 1990, Architectural
Works Copyright Protection Act, 104 Stat. 5133. And on
several occasions, as recounted above, Congress protected
works previously in the public domain, hence freely usable
by the public. See supra, at 15–19. If Congress could
grant protection to these works without hazarding heightened First Amendment scrutiny, then what free speech
principle disarms it from protecting works prematurely
cast into the public domain for reasons antithetical to the
Berne Convention? 33

33 It was the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause—not the First
Amendment—that Congress apparently perceived to be a potential
check on its authority to protect works then freely available to the
