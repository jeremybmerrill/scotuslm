Opinion of the Court

was that limited term for foreign works once excluded
from U. S. copyright protection? Exactly “zero,” petitioners respond. Brief for Petitioners 22 (works in question
“received a specific term of protection . . . sometimes expressly set to zero”; “at the end of that period,” they “entered the public domain”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (by “refusing
to provide any protection for a work,” Congress “set[s] the
term at zero,” and thereby “tell[s] us when the end has
come”). We find scant sense in this argument, for surely a
“limited time” of exclusivity must begin before it may

Government’s position would allow Congress to institute a
second “limited” term after the first expires, a third after
that, and so on. Thus, as long as Congress legislated in
installments, perpetual copyright terms would be achievable. As in Eldred, the hypothetical legislative misbehavior
petitioners posit is far afield from the case before us. See
537 U. S., at 198–200, 209–210. In aligning the United
States with other nations bound by the Berne Convention,
and thereby according equitable treatment to once disfavored foreign authors, Congress can hardly be charged
with a design to move stealthily toward a regime of perpetual copyrights.

Undoubtedly, federal copyright legislation generally has
not affected works in the public domain. Section 514’s
disturbance of that domain, petitioners argue, distin——————

language of the Berne Convention past the breaking point to posit
that following ‘expiry of the zero term’ the . . . work need not be
resurrected.”).
