GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

constructed between the patent’s expiration and the bill’s
passage. Id., at 202. See also Blanchard v. Sprague, 3
F. Cas. 648, 650 (No. 1,518) (CC Mass. 1839) (Story, J.) (“I
never have entertained any doubt of the constitutional
authority of congress” to “give a patent for an invention,
which . . . was in public use and enjoyed by the community
at the time of the passage of the act.”).
This Court again upheld Congress’ restoration of an
invention to protected status in McClurg v. Kingsland, 1
How. 202 (1843). There we enforced an 1839 amendment
that recognized a patent on an invention despite its prior
use by the inventor’s employer. Absent such dispensation,
the employer’s use would have rendered the invention
unpatentable, and therefore open to exploitation without
the inventor’s leave. Id., at 206–209.
Congress has also passed generally applicable legislation granting patents and copyrights to inventions and
works that had lost protection. An 1832 statute authorized a new patent for any inventor whose failure, “by
inadvertence, accident, or mistake,” to comply with statutory formalities rendered the original patent “invalid or
inoperative.” Act of July 3, §3, 4 Stat. 559. An 1893
measure similarly allowed authors who had not timely
deposited their work to receive “all the rights and privileges” the Copyright Act affords, if they made the required
deposit by March 1, 1893. Act of Mar. 3, ch. 215, 27 Stat.
743.23 And in 1919 and 1941, Congress authorized the
President to issue proclamations granting protection to
foreign works that had fallen into the public domain during World Wars I and II. See Act of Dec. 18, 1919, ch. 11,

23 Section

514 is in line with these measures; like them, it accords
protection to works that had lapsed into the public domain because of
failure to comply with U. S. statutory formalities. See supra, at 9, and
n. 11.
