Opinion of the Court

111 U. S. 53, 57 (1884).21
Subsequent actions confirm that Congress has not understood the Copyright Clause to preclude protection for
existing works. Several private bills restored the copyrights of works that previously had been in the public
domain. See Act of Feb. 19, 1849 (Corson Act), ch. 57, 9
Stat. 763; Act of June 23, 1874 (Helmuth Act), ch. 534, 18
Stat. 618; Act of Feb. 17, 1898 (Jones Act), ch. 29, 30 Stat.
1396. These bills were unchallenged in court.
Analogous patent statutes, however, were upheld in
litigation.22 In 1808, Congress passed a private bill restoring patent protection to Oliver Evans’ flour mill. When
Evans sued for infringement, first Chief Justice Marshall
in the Circuit Court, Evans v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872 (No.
4,564) (Va. 1813), and then Justice Bushrod Washington
for this Court, Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch 199 (1815),
upheld the restored patent’s validity. After the patent’s
expiration, the Court said, “a general right to use [Evans’]
discovery was not so vested in the public” as to allow the
defendant to continue using the machinery, which he had

21 The parties debate the extent to which the First Congress removed
works from the public domain. We have held, however, that at least
some works protected by the 1790 Act previously lacked protection. In
Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834), the Court ruled that before enactment of the 1790 Act, common-law copyright protection expired upon
first publication. Id., at 657, 663. Thus published works covered by the
1790 Act previously would have been in the public domain unless
protected by state statute. Had the founding generation perceived the
constitutional boundary petitioners advance today, the First Congress
could have designed a prospective scheme that left the public domain
undisturbed. Accord Luck’s Music Library, Inc. v. Gonzales, 407 F. 3d
1262, 1265 (CADC 2005) (Section 514 does not offend the Copyright
Clause because, inter alia, “evidence from the First Congress,” as
confirmed by Wheaton, “points toward constitutionality.”).
22 Here, as in Eldred, “[b]ecause the Clause empowering Congress to
confer copyrights also authorizes patents, congressional practice with
respect to patents informs our inquiry.” 537 U. S., at 201.
