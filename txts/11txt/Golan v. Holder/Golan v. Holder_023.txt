Opinion of the Court

41 Stat. 368; Act of Sept. 25, 1941, ch. 421, 55 Stat. 732.24
Pointing to dictum in Graham v. John Deere Co. of
Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1 (1966), petitioners would have us
look past this history. In Graham, we stated that “Congress may not authorize the issuance of patents whose
effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public
domain, or to restrict free access to materials already
available.” Id., at 6; post, at 15. But as we explained in
Eldred, this passage did not speak to the constitutional
limits on Congress’ copyright and patent authority. Rather, it “addressed an invention’s very eligibility for patent
protection.” 537 U. S., at 202, n. 7.
Installing a federal copyright system and ameliorating
the interruptions of global war, it is true, presented Congress with extraordinary situations. Yet the TRIPS accord, leading the United States to comply in full measure
with Berne, was also a signal event. See supra, at 7–8; cf.
Eldred, 537 U. S., at 259, 264–265 (BREYER, J., dissenting)
(acknowledging importance of international uniformity
advanced by U. S. efforts to conform to the Berne Convention). Given the authority we hold Congress has, we will
not second-guess the political choice Congress made between leaving the public domain untouched and embracing Berne unstintingly. Cf. id., at 212–213.

24 Legislation of this order, petitioners argue, is best understood as an
exercise of Congress’ power to remedy excusable neglect. Even so, the
remedy sheltered creations that, absent congressional action, would
have been open to free exploitation. Such action, according to petitioners’ dominant argument, see supra, at 13–14, is ever and always
impermissible. Accord Luck’s Music Library, 407 F. 3d, at 1265–1266
(“Plaintiffs urge that [the 1790 Act and the wartime legislation] simply
extended the time limits for filing and [did] not purport to modify the
prohibition on removing works from the public domain. But to the
extent that potential copyright holders failed to satisfy procedural
requirements, such works”—like those protected by §514—“would
necessarily have already entered the public domain . . . .”).
