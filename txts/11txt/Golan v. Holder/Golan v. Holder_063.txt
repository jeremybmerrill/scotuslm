GOLAN v. HOLDER
BREYER, J., dissenting

214–215 (describing equitable reasons for applying newly
extended copyright terms to future and existing copyrights
alike). The statute before us, however, does not directly
elicit any new production. Compare id., at 204–208; (ma­
jority opinion) (noting that statute’s extended term would
apply to newly created material, and finding that the
determination of the likelihood of its eliciting new produc­
tion in practice was a matter for Congress to determine),
with id., at 243–267 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (expressing
the view that there is little likelihood, in practice, that the
statute would elicit new material). See also Walterscheid
219 (the 1790 Congress likely thought it was substituting
federal protection for preexisting state common-law pro­
tections); Maher, Copyright Term, Retrospective Exten­
sion, and the Copyright Law of 1790 in Historical Context,
49 J. Copyright Soc. USA 1021, 1023–1024, and n. 8
(2002) (numerical estimate suggesting that 1790 Act
removed only a small number of books from public
domain).
The other statutes to which the majority refers are
private bills, statutes retroactively granting protection in
wartime, or the like. Ante, at 16–19; Act of Feb. 19, 1849,
ch. 57, 9 Stat. 763 (Levi Corson); Act of June 23, 1874, ch.
534, 18 Stat., pt. 3, p. 618 (Tod Helmuth); Act of Feb. 17,
1898, ch. 29, 30 Stat. 1396 (Judson Jones); Act of Dec. 18,
1919, ch. 11, 41 Stat. 368; Act of Sept. 25, 1941, ch. 421, 55
Stat. 732; see also Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch 199 (1815)
(upholding a private bill restoring patent protection to a
flour mill). But special circumstances, like wars, hurri­
canes, earthquakes, and other disasters, prevent the
realization in practice of a reasonable expectation of secur­
ing or maintaining a preexisting right. Private bills are
designed to provide special exceptions for comparable
equitable reasons. See also Act of Mar. 3, 1893, ch. 215,
27 Stat. 743 (similar, as far as I can tell). To find in these
laws an important analogy to the present law, which for
