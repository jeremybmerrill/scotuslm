GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

for the enactment of such legislation. But resistance to
Berne’s prescriptions surely is not a necessary or proper
response to the pervasive question, what should Congress
do about orphan works.
IV
Congress determined that U. S. interests were best
served by our full participation in the dominant system of
international copyright protection. Those interests include ensuring exemplary compliance with our international obligations, securing greater protection for U. S.
authors abroad, and remedying unequal treatment of
foreign authors. The judgment §514 expresses lies well
within the ken of the political branches. It is our obligation, of course, to determine whether the action Congress
took, wise or not, encounters any constitutional shoal. For
the reasons stated, we are satisfied it does not. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is
therefore
Affirmed.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
