BREYER, J., dissenting

1892 House Report states:
“The object to be attained and the reason for the con­
stitutional grant of power are imbedded in the grant
itself. They are ‘to promote the progress of science
and the useful arts.’ . . . [The Clause says] nothing . . .
about any desire or purpose to secure to the author or
inventor his ‘natural right to his property.’ ” H. R.
Rep. No. 1494, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 2.
Similarly, the congressional authors of the landmark 1909
Copyright Act wrote:
“The Constitution . . . provides that Congress shall
have the power to grant [copyrights] . . . [n]ot primari­
ly for the benefit of the author, . . . but because the
policy is believed to be for the benefit of the great body
of people, in that it will stimulate writing and invention, to give some bonus to authors and inventors.”
H. R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1909).
And they went on to say:
“Congress must consider . . . two questions: First, how
much will the legislation stimulate the producer and
so benefit the public; and, second, how much will the
monopoly granted be detrimental to the public? The
granting of such exclusive rights, under the proper
terms and conditions, confers a benefit upon the pub­
lic that outweighs the evils of the temporary monop­
oly.” Ibid.
The upshot is that text, history, and precedent demon­
strate that the Copyright Clause places great value on the
power of copyright to elicit new production. Congress in
particular cases may determine that copyright’s ability to
do so outweighs any concomitant high prices, administra­
tive costs, and restrictions on dissemination. And when it
does so, we must respect its judgment. See Eldred, 537
