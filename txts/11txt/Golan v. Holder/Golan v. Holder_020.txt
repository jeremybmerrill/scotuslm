GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

guishes their suit from Eldred’s. In adopting the CTEA,
petitioners note, Congress acted in accord with “an unbroken congressional practice” of granting pre-expiration
term extensions, 537 U. S., at 200. No comparable practice, they maintain, supports §514.
On occasion, however, Congress has seen fit to protect
works once freely available. Notably, the Copyright Act of
1790 granted protection to many works previously in the
public domain. Act of May 31, 1790 (1790 Act), §1, 1 Stat.
124 (covering “any map, chart, book, or books already
printed within these United States”). Before the Act
launched a uniform national system, three States provided
no statutory copyright protection at all.17 Of those that
did afford some protection, seven failed to protect maps;18
eight did not cover previously published books;19 and all
ten denied protection to works that failed to comply with
formalities.20 The First Congress, it thus appears, did not
view the public domain as inviolate. As we have recognized, the “construction placed upon the Constitution by
[the drafters of] the first [copyright] act of 1790 and the
act of 1802 . . . men who were contemporary with [the
Constitution’s] formation, many of whom were members of
the convention which framed it, is of itself entitled to very
great weight.” Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony,
