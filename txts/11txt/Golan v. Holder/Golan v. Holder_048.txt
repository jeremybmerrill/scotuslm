BREYER, J., dissenting

R. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Proper­
ty Law 68–70, 213–214 (2003). Consequently, the original
British copyright statute, the Constitution’s Framers, and
our case law all have recognized copyright’s resulting
and necessary call for balance.
At the time the Framers wrote the Constitution, they
were well aware of Britain’s 18th-century copyright stat­
ute, the Statute of Anne, 8 Anne, ch. 19 (1710), and they
were aware of the legal struggles that produced it. That
statute sought in part to control, and to limit, preexisting
monopolies that had emerged in the book trade as a result
of the Crown’s having previously granted special privileg­
es to royal favorites. The Crown, for example, had char­
tered the Stationers’ Company, permitting it to regulate
and to censor works on the government’s behalf. The
Stationers had thereby acquired control over the disposi­
tion of copies of published works, from which emerged
the Stationers’ copyright—a right conferred on company
members, not authors, that was deemed to exist in perpe­
tuity. See L. Patterson, Copyright in Historical Perspec­

scheid 59–65; Gómez-Arostegui, The Untold Story of the
First Copyright Suit Under the Statute of Anne in 1710,

To prevent the continuation of the booksellers’ monopoly
and to encourage authors to write new books, Parliament
enacted the Statute of Anne. It bore the title: “An Act for
the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of
printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Cop­
ies, during the Times therein mentioned.” And it granted
authors (not publishers) and their assignees the “sole
Right and Liberty of printing” their works for limited
periods of time in order to encourage them “to compose and
write useful Books.” 8 Anne, ch. 19, §1 (emphasis added).
As one historian has put it, “[t]he central plank of the . . .
Act was . . . a cultural quid pro quo. To encourage
