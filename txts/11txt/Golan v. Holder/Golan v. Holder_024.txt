GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court 


C

Petitioners’ ultimate argument as to the Copyright and
Patent Clause concerns its initial words. Congress is
empowered to “promote the Progress of Science and useful
Arts” by enacting systems of copyright and patent protection. U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Perhaps counterintuitively for the contemporary reader, Congress’ copyright
authority is tied to the progress of science; its patent
authority, to the progress of the useful arts. See Graham,
383 U. S., at 5, and n. 1; Evans, 8 F. Cas., at 873
(Marshall, J.).
The “Progress of Science,” petitioners acknowledge,
refers broadly to “the creation and spread of knowledge
and learning.” Brief for Petitioners 21; accord post, at 1.
They nevertheless argue that federal legislation cannot
serve the Clause’s aim unless the legislation “spur[s] the
creation of . . . new works.” Brief for Petitioners 24; accord
post, at 1–2, 8, 17. Because §514 deals solely with works
already created, petitioners urge, it “provides no plausible
incentive to create new works” and is therefore invalid.
Reply Brief 4.25
The creation of at least one new work, however, is not
the sole way Congress may promote knowledge and learning. In Eldred, we rejected an argument nearly identical
to the one petitioners rehearse. The Eldred petitioners
urged that the “CTEA’s extension of existing copyrights
categorically fails to ‘promote the Progress of Science,’ . . .
because it does not stimulate the creation of new works.”

Curiae 27 (observing that income from existing works can finance the
creation and publication of new works); Eldred, 537 U. S., at 208, n. 15
(noting that Noah Webster “supported his entire family from the
earnings on his speller and grammar during the twenty years he took
to complete his dictionary” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
