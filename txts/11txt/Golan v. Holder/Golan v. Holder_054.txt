BREYER, J., dissenting

§104A(h)(6)(D). The Act grants these works a copyright
that expires at the time it would have expired had the
author obtained a full American copyright term starting
from the date on which the work was first published (in
the foreign country). §104A(a)(1)(B).
The Act mainly applies to works first published abroad
between 1923 and 1989. It does not apply significantly to
earlier works because any work published before 1921
would have fallen into the public domain before 1977 had
it received a full American copyright term, while works
published between 1921 and 1923 obtained a “restored”
copyright that expired before the 1998 Sonny Bono Copy­
right Term Extension Act, and so could have lasted two
years at most. See Tit. I, §101, 90 Stat. 2574 (extending
the copyright term of works still under copyright in 1977
to 75 years); 17 U. S. C. §304(b) (extending the copyright
term of works still under copyright in 1998 to 95 years). It
has less impact on more recent works because in 1989
the United States became a Berne member, abolished the
copyright notice requirement, and thenceforth provided
prospective copyright protection throughout the Berne
Union. See R. Schechter & J. Thomas, Intellectual Prop­
erty: The Law of Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks 75–
77 (2003); §7, 102 Stat. 2857–2858 (codified as amended at
17 U. S. C. §§401–406).
Despite these temporal limitations, the Act covers vast
numbers of works. The first category includes works
published in countries that had copyright relations with
the United States during this time period, such as most of
Western Europe and Latin America, Australia, and Japan,
see Circular No. 38A, supra, at 2–10, whose authors did
not satisfy American copyright formalities, perhaps be­
cause the author, who may not have sought an American
copyright, published the book abroad without proper
American notice, or perhaps because the author obtained a
valid American copyright but failed to renew it.
