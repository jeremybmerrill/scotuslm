GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

Court granted the Attorney General’s motion for summary
judgment. Golan v. Gonzales, No. Civ. 01–B–1854, 2005
WL 914754 (D. Colo., Apr. 20, 2005). In rejecting petitioners’ Copyright Clause argument, the court stated that
Congress “has historically demonstrated little compunction about removing copyrightable materials from the
public domain.” Id., at *14. The court next declined to
part from “the settled rule that private censorship via
copyright enforcement does not implicate First Amendment concerns.” Id., at *17.
The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed in
part. Golan v. Gonzales, 501 F. 3d 1179 (2007). The
public domain, it agreed, was not a “threshold that Congress” was powerless to “traverse in both directions.” Id.,
at 1187 (internal quotations marks omitted). But §514, as
the Court of Appeals read our decision in Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186 (2003), required further First Amendment inspection, 501 F. 3d, at 1187. The measure “ ‘altered the traditional contours of copyright protection,’ ” the
court said—specifically, the “bedrock principle” that once
works enter the public domain, they do not leave. Ibid.
(quoting Eldred, 537 U. S., at 221). The case was remanded with an instruction to the District Court to address the
First Amendment claim in light of the Tenth Circuit’s
opinion.
On remand, the District Court’s starting premise was
uncontested: Section 514 does not regulate speech on the
basis of its content; therefore the law would be upheld if
“narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest.” 611 F. Supp. 2d 1165, 1170–1171 (Colo. 2009) (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791
(1989)). Summary judgment was due petitioners, the
—————— 

entry of summary judgment for the Government on the claim that §514

violates the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.
