GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

ed in the United States. See Act of Mar. 3, 1891, §3, 13, 26
Stat. 1107, 1110; Patry, The United States and International Copyright Law, 40 Houston L. Rev. 749, 750
(2003).2 For domestic and foreign authors alike, protection
hinged on compliance with notice, registration, and renewal formalities.
The United States became party to Berne’s multilateral,
formality-free copyright regime in 1989. Initially, Congress adopted a “minimalist approach” to compliance with
the Convention. H. R. Rep. No. 100–609, p. 7 (1988) (hereinafter BCIA House Report). The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (BCIA), 102 Stat. 2853, made
“only those changes to American copyright law that [were]
clearly required under the treaty’s provisions,” BCIA
House Report, at 7. Despite Berne’s instruction that
member countries—including “new accessions to the Union”—
protect foreign works under copyright in the country
of origin, Art. 18(1) and (4), 828 U. N. T. S., at 251, the
BCIA accorded no protection for “any work that is in the
public domain in the United States,” §12, 102 Stat. 2860.
Protection of future foreign works, the BCIA indicated,
satisfied Article 18. See §2(3), 102 Stat. 2853 (“The
amendments made by this Act, together with the law as it
exists on the date of the enactment of this Act, satisfy the
obligations of the United States in adhering to the Berne
Convention . . . .”). Congress indicated, however, that it

2 As noted by the Government’s amici, the United States excluded
foreign works from copyright not to swell the number of unprotected
works available to the consuming public, but to favor domestic publishing interests that escaped paying royalties to foreign authors. See Brief
for International Publishers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 8–15.
This free-riding, according to Senator Jonathan Chace, champion of the
1891 Act, made the United States “the Barbary coast of literature” and
its people “the buccaneers of books.” S. Rep. No. 622, 50th Cong., 1st
Sess., p. 2 (1888).
