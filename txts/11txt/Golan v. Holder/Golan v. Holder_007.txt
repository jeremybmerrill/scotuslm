Opinion of the Court

Berne Convention, Sept. 9, 1886, as revised at Stockholm
on July 14, 1967, Art. 1, 5(1), 828 U. N. T. S. 221, 225,
231–233. Nationals of a member country, as well as any
author who publishes in one of Berne’s 164 member states,
thus enjoy copyright protection in nations across the globe.
Art. 2(6), 3. Each country, moreover, must afford at least
the minimum level of protection specified by Berne. The
copyright term must span the author’s lifetime, plus at
least 50 additional years, whether or not the author has
complied with a member state’s legal formalities. Art.
5(2), 7(1). And, as relevant here, a work must be protected
abroad unless its copyright term has expired in either the
country where protection is claimed or the country of
origin. Art. 18(1)–(2).1
A different system of transnational copyright protection
long prevailed in this country. Until 1891, foreign works
were categorically excluded from Copyright Act protection.
Throughout most of the 20th century, the only eligible
foreign authors were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights to U. S. authors and whose works were print

1 Article

18 of the Berne Convention provides:
“(1) This Convention shall apply to all works which, at the moment of
its coming into force, have not yet fallen into the public domain in the
country of origin through the expiry of the term of protection.
“(2) If, however, through the expiry of the term of protection which
was previously granted, a work has fallen into the public domain of the
country where protection is claimed, that work shall not be protected
anew.
“(3) The application of this principle shall be subject to any provisions
contained in special conventions to that effect existing or to be concluded between countries of the Union. In the absence of such provisions,
the respective countries shall determine, each in so far as it is concerned, the conditions of application of this principle.
“(4) The preceding provisions shall also apply in the case of new
accessions to the Union and to cases in which protection is extended by
the application of Article 7 or by the abandonment of reservations.”
828 U. N. T. S. 251.
