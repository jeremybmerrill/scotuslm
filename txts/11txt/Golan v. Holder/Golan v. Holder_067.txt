GOLAN v. HOLDER
BREYER, J., dissenting

Moviecraft Inc.) (testifying against restoration on grounds
similar to those set out, supra, at 10–13).
This argument, whatever its intrinsic merits, is an ar­
gument that directly concerns a private benefit: how to
obtain more money from the sales of existing products. It
is not an argument about a public benefit, such as how to
promote or to protect the creative process.
Third, the majority points out that the statute “gives
[authors] nothing more than the benefit of their labors
during whatever time remains before the normal copyright
term expires.” Ante, at 30. But insofar as it suggests that
copyright should in general help authors obtain greater
monetary rewards than needed to elicit new works, it rests
upon primarily European, but not American, copyright
concepts. See supra, at 5–6.
Fourth, the majority argues that this statutory provi­
sion is necessary to fulfill our Berne Convention obliga­

the “Convention shall apply to all works which, at the
moment of its coming into force [i.e., 1989 in the case of
the United States] have not yet fallen into the public
domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the
term of protection.” Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works, Art. 18(1), Sept. 9, 1886, as
revised at Stockholm on July 14, 1967, 828 U. N. T. S. 221,
251. The majority and Government say that this means
we must protect the foreign works at issue here. And
since the Berne Convention, taken as a whole, provides
incentives for the creation of new works, I am willing to
speculate, for argument’s sake, that the statute might
indirectly encourage production of new works by making
the United States’ place in the international copyright
regime more secure.
Still, I cannot find this argument sufficient to save the
statute. For one thing, this is a dilemma of the Govern­
ment’s own making. The United States obtained the
