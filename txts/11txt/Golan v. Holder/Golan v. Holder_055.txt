GOLAN v. HOLDER
BREYER, J., dissenting

The second category (works that entered the public
domain due to a lack of copyright relations) includes,
among others, all works published in Russia and other
countries of the former Soviet Union before May 1973
(when the U. S. S. R. joined the Universal Copyright Con­

relations between the People’s Republic and the United
States were first established), all South Korean works
published before October 1987 (when South Korea joined
the UCC), and all Egyptian and Turkish works published
before March 1989 (when the United States joined Berne).

Apparently there are no precise figures about the num­

The provision before us takes works from the public
domain, at least as of January 1, 1996. See §104A(h)(2)(A)
(setting “restoration” dates). It then restricts the dissemi­
nation of those works in two ways.
First, “restored copyright” holders can now charge fees
for works that consumers previously used for free. The
price of a score of Shostakovich’s Preludes and Fugues Op.
87, for example, has risen by a multiple of seven. Brief for
