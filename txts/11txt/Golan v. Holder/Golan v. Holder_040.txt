Opinion of the Court
Appendix to opinion of the Court

the restored work from the reliance party’s continued
exploitation of the work, as well as compensation for the
relative contributions of expression of the author of the
restored work and the reliance party to the derivative
work.
“(4) COMMENCEMENT OF INFRINGEMENT FOR RELIANCE
PARTIES.—For purposes of section 412, in the case of reliance parties, infringement shall be deemed to have commenced before registration when acts which would have
constituted infringement had the restored work been
subject to copyright were commenced before the date of
restoration.
“(e) NOTICES OF INTENT TO ENFORCE A RESTORED
COPYRIGHT.—
“(1) NOTICES OF INTENT FILED WITH THE COPYRIGHT
OFFICE.—(A)(i) A notice of intent filed with the Copyright
Office to enforce a restored copyright shall be signed by
the owner of the restored copyright or the owner of an
exclusive right therein, who files the notice under subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as
the “owner”), or by the owner’s agent, shall identify the
title of the restored work, and shall include an English
translation of the title and any other alternative titles
known to the owner by which the restored work may be
identified, and an address and telephone number at which
the owner may be contacted. If the notice is signed by an
agent, the agency relationship must have been constituted
in a writing signed by the owner before the filing of the
notice. The Copyright Office may specifically require in
regulations other information to be included in the notice,
but failure to provide such other information shall not
invalidate the notice or be a basis for refusal to list the
restored work in the Federal Register.
“(ii) If a work in which copyright is restored has no
formal title, it shall be described in the notice of intent in
detail sufficient to identify it.
