GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

one’s expression, copyright supplies the economic incentive
to create and disseminate ideas.” Ibid. (quoting Harper &
Row, 471 U. S., at 558 (internal quotation marks omitted)); see id., at 546 (“rights conferred by copyright are
designed to assure contributors to the store of knowledge a
fair return for their labors”).
We then described the “traditional contours” of copyright protection, i.e., the “idea/expression dichotomy” and
the “fair use” defense.29 Both are recognized in our jurisprudence as “built-in First Amendment accommodations.”
Eldred, 537 U. S., at 219; see Harper & Row, 471 U. S., at

Copyright Act’s distinction between copyrightable expression and uncopyrightable facts and ideas,” and in the

author’s expression alone gains copyright protection.
Eldred, 537 U. S., at 219; see Harper & Row, 471 U. S., at

protecting an author’s expression” (internal quotation

here clarify.
