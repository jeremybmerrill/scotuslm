BREYER, J., dissenting

benefits of Berne for many years despite its failure to
enact a statute implementing Article 18. But in 1994, the
United States and other nations signed the Agreement on
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,
which enabled signatories to use World Trade Organiza­
tion dispute resolution mechanisms to complain about
other members’ Berne Convention violations. And at that
time the Government, although it successfully secured
reservations protecting other special features of American
copyright law, made no effort to secure a reservation
permitting the United States to keep some or all restored
works in the American public domain. Indeed, it made no
effort to do so despite the fact that Article 18 explicitly
authorizes countries to negotiate exceptions to the Arti­
cle’s retroactivity principle. See Art. 18(3), ibid. (“The
application of [the retroactivity] principle shall be subject
to any provisions contained in special conventions to that
effect existing or to be concluded between countries of the
Union” (emphasis added)); Gervais, Golan v. Holder: A
Look at the Constraints Imposed by the Berne Conven­
tion, 64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 147, 151–152 (2011); Gard,
64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc, at 206.
For another thing, the Convention does not require
Congress to enact a statute that causes so much damage
to public domain material. Article 18(3) also states that
“the respective countries shall determine, each in so far as
it is concerned, the conditions of application of this principle.” 18 U. N. T. S., at 251 (emphasis added). Congress
could have alleviated many of the costs that the statute
imposes by, for example, creating forms of compulsory
licensing, requiring “restored copyright” holders to provide
necessary administrative information as a condition of
protection, or insisting upon “reasonable royalties.” Cf.
S. 2913, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (legislation that
would have limited judicial remedies against users of
orphan works); H. R. 5889, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008)
