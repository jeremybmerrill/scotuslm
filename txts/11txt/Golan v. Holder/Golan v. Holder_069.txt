GOLAN v. HOLDER
BREYER, J., dissenting

(House version of same); American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, http://www.ascap.com/
licensing/termsdefined.aspx (society of music copyright
owners offering blanket licenses that give users the unlim­
ited right to perform any of its members’ songs for a fixed
fee, thus reducing negotiation and enforcement costs).
To say this is not to criticize the Convention or our
joining it. Rather, it is to argue that the other branches of
Government should have tried to follow the Convention
and in particular its provisions offering compliance flexi­
bility. The fact that the statute has significant First
Amendment costs is relevant in this respect, for that
Amendment ordinarily requires courts to evaluate less
restrictive, alternative possibilities. Doing so here, reveals
that neither Congress nor the Executive took advantage of
less-restrictive methods of compliance that the Convention
itself provides. And that fact means that the Convention
cannot provide the statute with a constitutionally suffi­
cient justification that is otherwise lacking.
III
The fact that, by withdrawing material from the public
domain, the statute inhibits an important preexisting flow
of information is sufficient, when combined with the other
features of the statute that I have discussed, to convince
me that the Copyright Clause, interpreted in the light of
the First Amendment, does not authorize Congress to
enact this statute.
I respectfully dissent from the Court’s contrary
conclusion.
