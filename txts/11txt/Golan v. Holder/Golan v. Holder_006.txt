GOLAN v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

its full copyright term has expired, causing it to fall into
the public domain, whether under the laws of the country
of origin or of this country. Works encompassed by §514
are granted the protection they would have enjoyed had
the United States maintained copyright relations with the
author’s country or removed formalities incompatible with
Berne. Foreign authors, however, gain no credit for the
protection they lacked in years prior to §514’s enactment.
They therefore enjoy fewer total years of exclusivity than
do their U. S. counterparts. As a consequence of the barriers to U. S. copyright protection prior to the enactment of
§514, foreign works “restored” to protection by the measure had entered the public domain in this country. To
cushion the impact of their placement in protected status,
Congress included in §514 ameliorating accommodations
for parties who had exploited affected works before the
URAA was enacted.
Petitioners include orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers, and others who formerly enjoyed free access to
works §514 removed from the public domain. They maintain that the Constitution’s Copyright and Patent Clause,
Art. I, §8, cl. 8, and First Amendment both decree the
invalidity of §514. Under those prescriptions of our highest law, petitioners assert, a work that has entered the
public domain, for whatever reason, must forever remain
there.
In accord with the judgment of the Tenth Circuit, we
conclude that §514 does not transgress constitutional
limitations on Congress’ authority. Neither the Copyright
and Patent Clause nor the First Amendment, we hold,
makes the public domain, in any and all cases, a territory
that works may never exit.

Members of the Berne Union agree to treat authors from
other member countries as well as they treat their own.
