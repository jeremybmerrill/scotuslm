Opinion of the Court

court concluded, because §514’s constriction of the public
domain was not justified by any of the asserted federal
interests: compliance with Berne, securing greater protection for U. S. authors abroad, or remediation of the inequitable treatment suffered by foreign authors whose works
lacked protection in the United States. 611 F. Supp. 2d, at
1172–1177.
The Tenth Circuit reversed. Deferring to Congress’
predictive judgments in matters relating to foreign affairs,
the appellate court held that §514 survived First Amendment scrutiny. Specifically, the court determined that the
law was narrowly tailored to fit the important government
aim of protecting U. S. copyright holders’ interests abroad.
609 F. 3d 1076 (2010).
We granted certiorari to consider petitioners’ challenge
to §514 under both the Copyright Clause and the First
Amendment, 562 U. S. ___ (2011), and now affirm.
II
We first address petitioners’ argument that Congress
lacked authority, under the Copyright Clause, to enact
§514. The Constitution states that “Congress shall have
Power . . . [t]o promote the Progress of Science . . . by
securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive
Right to their . . . Writings.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Petitioners
find in this grant of authority an impenetrable barrier to
the extension of copyright protection to authors whose
writings, for whatever reason, are in the public domain.
We see no such barrier in the text of the Copyright Clause,
historical practice, or our precedents.
