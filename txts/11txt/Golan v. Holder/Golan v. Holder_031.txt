Opinion of the Court

public domain.32 Neither this challenge nor that raised in
Eldred, we stress, allege Congress transgressed a generally applicable First Amendment prohibition; we are not
faced, for example, with copyright protection that hinges
on the author’s viewpoint.
The Tenth Circuit’s initial opinion determined that
petitioners marshaled a stronger First Amendment challenge than did their predecessors in Eldred, who never
“possessed unfettered access to any of the works at issue.”
501 F. 3d, at 1193. See also id., at 1194 (“[O]nce the works
at issue became free for anyone to copy, [petitioners] had
vested First Amendment interests in the expressions,
[thus] §514’s interference with [petitioners’] rights is
subject to First Amendment scrutiny.”). As petitioners put
it in this Court, Congress impermissibly revoked their
right to exploit foreign works that “belonged to them” once
the works were in the public domain. Brief for Petitioners
44–45.
To copyright lawyers, the “vested rights” formulation

32 “[R]equir[ing]

works that have already fallen into the public domain to stay there” might, as the dissent asserts, supply an “easily
administrable standard.” Post, at 14. However attractive this brightline rule might be, it is not a rule rooted in the constitutional text or
history. Nor can it fairly be gleaned from our case law. The dissent
cites three decisions to document its assertion that “this Court has
assumed the particular importance of public domain material in roughly analogous circumstances.” Post, at 15. The dictum in Graham v.
John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 6 (1966), noted earlier, did
not treat the public domain as a constitutional limit—certainly not
under the rubric of the First Amendment. See supra, at 19. The other
two decisions the dissent cites considered whether the federal Patent
Act preempted a state trade-secret law, Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron
Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 479–484 (1974), and whether the freedom of the
press shielded reporters from liability for publishing material drawn
from public court documents, Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S.
469, 495–497 (1975). Neither decision remotely ascribed constitutional
significance to a work’s public domain status.
