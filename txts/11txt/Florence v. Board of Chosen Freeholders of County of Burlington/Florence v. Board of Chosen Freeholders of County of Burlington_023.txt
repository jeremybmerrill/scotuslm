Opinion of the Court

before the Court, however, do not present the opportunity
to consider a narrow exception of the sort JUSTICE ALITO
describes, post, at 2–3 (concurring opinion), which might
restrict whether an arrestee whose detention has not yet
been reviewed by a magistrate or other judicial officer,
and who can be held in available facilities removed from
the general population, may be subjected to the types of
searches at issue here.
Petitioner’s amici raise concerns about instances of
officers engaging in intentional humiliation and other
abusive practices. See Brief for Sister Bernie Galvin et al.
as Amici Curiae; see also Hudson, 468 U. S., at 528
(“[I]ntentional harassment of even the most hardened
criminals cannot be tolerated by a civilized society”); Bell,
441 U. S., at 560. There also may be legitimate concerns
about the invasiveness of searches that involve the touching of detainees. These issues are not implicated on the
facts of this case, however, and it is unnecessary to consider them here.
V
Even assuming all the facts in favor of petitioner, the
search procedures at the Burlington County Detention
Center and the Essex County Correctional Facility struck
a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the
needs of the institutions. The Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments do not require adoption of the framework of
rules petitioner proposes.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
