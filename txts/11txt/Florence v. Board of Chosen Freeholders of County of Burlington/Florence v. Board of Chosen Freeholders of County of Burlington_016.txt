FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF
COUNTY OF BURLINGTON

Opinion of the Court 


in aggression toward officers or each other; and, even
apart from their use, the trade in these substances can
lead to violent confrontations. See PBA Brief 11.
There are many other kinds of contraband. The textbook definition of the term covers any unauthorized item.
See Prisons: Today and Tomorrow 237 (J. Pollock ed.
1997) (“Contraband is any item that is possessed in violation of prison rules. Contraband obviously includes drugs
or weapons, but it can also be money, cigarettes, or even
some types of clothing”). Everyday items can undermine
security if introduced into a detention facility:

assaults on correctional staff every year and many more
among themselves. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice
Statistics, J. Stephan & J. Karberg, Census of State and
Federal Correctional Facilities, 2000, p. v (2003).

brief term for a minor offense, at risk. Gangs do coerce
inmates who have access to the outside world, such as
