BREYER, J., dissenting

notes, the applicable standard is the Fourth Amendment
balancing inquiry announced regarding prison inmates in
Bell v. Wolfish, supra. The Court said:
“The test of reasonableness under the Fourth
Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against
the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.
Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is
conducted.” Id., at 559.
I have described in general terms, see supra, at 1–2, the
place, scope and manner of “the particular intrusion.”
Bell, 441 U. S., at 559. I now explain why I believe that
the “invasion of personal rights” here is very serious and
lacks need or justification, ibid.—at least as to the category of minor offenders at issue.
II
A strip search that involves a stranger peering without
consent at a naked individual, and in particular at the
most private portions of that person’s body, is a serious invasion of privacy. We have recently said, in respect to a
schoolchild (and a less intrusive search), that the “meaning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may
reasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category
of its own demanding its own specific suspicions.” Safford
Unified School Dist. #1 v. Redding, 557 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 11). The Courts of Appeals have more
directly described the privacy interests at stake, writing,
for example, that practices similar to those at issue here
are “demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating,
terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, [and] repulsive,
signifying degradation and submission.” Mary Beth G. v.
