Opinion of the Court

people serving their time on the weekends, to sneak things
into the jail. Id., at 10; see, e.g., Pugmire, Vegas Suspect
Has Term to Serve, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 23, 2005,
p. B1 (“Weekend-only jail sentences are a common punishment for people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes . . .”).
These inmates, who might be thought to pose the least
risk, have been caught smuggling prohibited items into
jail. See New Jersey Wardens Brief 10. Concealing contraband often takes little time and effort. It might be done

work at these institutions at even greater risk when he is
admitted to the general population.

process and that this will require at least some detainees
to lift their genitals or cough in a squatting position.
These procedures, similar to the ones upheld in Bell, are
designed to uncover contraband that can go undetected by
a patdown, metal detector, and other less invasive
searches. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23
(hereinafter United States Brief); New Jersey Wardens
Brief 19, n. 6. Petitioner maintains there is little benefit
to conducting these more invasive steps on a new detainee
who has not been arrested for a serious crime or for any
