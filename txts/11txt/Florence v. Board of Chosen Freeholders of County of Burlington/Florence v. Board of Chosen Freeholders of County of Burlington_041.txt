FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF
COUNTY OF BURLINGTON
BREYER, J., dissenting

has been reviewed by a judicial officer.” Ante, at 3. In my
view, it is highly questionable that officials would be
justified, for instance, in admitting to the dangerous world
of the general jail population and subjecting to a strip
search someone with no criminal background arrested for
jaywalking or another similarly minor crime, supra, at 5.
Indeed, that consideration likely underlies why the Federal Government and many States segregate such individuals even when admitted to jail, and several jurisdictions
provide that such individuals be released without detention in the ordinary case. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann.
§853.6 (West Supp. 2012).
In an appropriate case, therefore, it remains open for
the Court to consider whether it would be reasonable to
admit an arrestee for a minor offense to the general jail
population, and to subject her to the “humiliation of a strip
search,” prior to any review by a judicial officer. Ante, at 2
(ALITO, J., concurring).

For the reasons set forth, I cannot find justification for
the strip search policy at issue here—a policy that would
subject those arrested for minor offenses to serious invasions of their personal privacy. I consequently dissent.
