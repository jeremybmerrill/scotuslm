FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF
COUNTY OF BURLINGTON

Opinion of the Court 


has sufficient expertise and information in the record to
mandate, under the Constitution, the specific restrictions
and limitations sought by those who challenge the visual
search procedures at issue. In addressing this type of
constitutional claim courts must defer to the judgment of
correctional officials unless the record contains substantial
evidence showing their policies are an unnecessary or unjustified response to problems of jail security. That
necessary showing has not been made in this case.
I
In 1998, seven years before the incidents at issue, petitioner Albert Florence was arrested after fleeing from
police officers in Essex County, New Jersey. He was
charged with obstruction of justice and use of a deadly
weapon. Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to two lesser
offenses and was sentenced to pay a fine in monthly installments. In 2003, after he fell behind on his payments
and failed to appear at an enforcement hearing, a bench
warrant was issued for his arrest. He paid the outstanding balance less than a week later; but, for some unexplained reason, the warrant remained in a statewide
computer database.
Two years later, in Burlington County, New Jersey,
petitioner and his wife were stopped in their automobile
by a state trooper. Based on the outstanding warrant in
the computer system, the officer arrested petitioner and
took him to the Burlington County Detention Center. He
was held there for six days and then was transferred to
the Essex County Correctional Facility. It is not the arrest or confinement but the search process at each jail that
gives rise to the claims before the Court.
Burlington County jail procedures required every arrestee to shower with a delousing agent. Officers would
check arrestees for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as they disrobed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53aâ€“56a.
