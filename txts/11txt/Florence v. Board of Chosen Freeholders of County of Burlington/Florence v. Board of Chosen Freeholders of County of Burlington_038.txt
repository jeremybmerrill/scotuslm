BREYER, J., dissenting

735 F. 2d 391, 394 (CA10 1984). But see 621 F. 3d, at 311
(case below); Bull v. City and County of San Francisco,
595 F. 3d 964, 975 (CA9 2010) (en banc); Powell v. Barrett,
541 F. 3d 1298, 1307 (CA11 2008) (en banc). Respondents
have not presented convincing grounds to believe that
administration of these legal standards has increased the
smuggling of contraband into prison.
Indeed, neither the majority’s opinion nor the briefs set
forth any clear example of an instance in which contraband was smuggled into the general jail population during
intake that could not have been discovered if the jail was
employing a reasonable suspicion standard. The majority
does cite general examples from Atlantic County and
Washington State where contraband has been recovered
in correctional facilities from inmates arrested for driving
under the influence and disorderly conduct. Ante, at 15.
Similarly, the majority refers to information, provided by
San Francisco jail authorities, stating that they have
found handcuff keys, syringes, crack pipes, drugs, and
knives during body-cavity searches, including during
searches of minor offenders, including a man arrested for
illegally lodging (drugs), and a woman arrested for prostitution and public nuisance (“bindles of crack cocaine”).
Brief for City and County of San Francisco et al. as Amici
Curiae 7–13; Bull, supra, at 969; ante, at 15. And associated statistics indicate that the policy of conducting visual
cavity searches of all those admitted to the general population in San Francisco may account for the discovery of
contraband in approximately 15 instances per year. Bull,
supra, at 969.
But neither San Francisco nor the respondents tell us
whether reasonable suspicion was present or absent in any
of the 15 instances. Nor is there any showing by the
majority that the few unclear examples of contraband
recovered in Atlantic County, Washington State, or anywhere else could not have been discovered through a policy
