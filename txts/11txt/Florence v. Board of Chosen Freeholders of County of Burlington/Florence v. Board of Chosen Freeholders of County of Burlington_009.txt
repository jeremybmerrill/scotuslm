Opinion of the Court

cough in a squatting position. In the instant case, the
term does not include any touching of unclothed areas
by the inspecting officer. There are no allegations that
the detainees here were touched in any way as part of the
searches.
The Federal Courts of Appeals have come to differing
conclusions as to whether the Fourth Amendment requires
correctional officials to exempt some detainees who will be
admitted to a jail’s general population from the searches
here at issue. This Court granted certiorari to address the
question. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).

The difficulties of operating a detention center must not
be underestimated by the courts. Turner v. Safley, 482
U. S. 78, 84–85 (1987). Jails (in the stricter sense of

to the problems they face. The Court has confirmed the
importance of deference to correctional officials and explained that a regulation impinging on an inmate’s constitutional rights must be upheld “if it is reasonably related
to legitimate penological interests.” Turner, supra, at 89;
see Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 131–132 (2003).
But see Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 510–511
(2005) (applying strict scrutiny to racial classifications).
The Court’s opinion in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520
(1979), is the starting point for understanding how this
