FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF
COUNTY OF BURLINGTON

Opinion of the Court 


tion that some detainees must be exempt from the more
invasive search procedures at issue absent reasonable
suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband. The
Court has held that deference must be given to the officials in charge of the jail unless there is “substantial
evidence” demonstrating their response to the situation is
exaggerated. Block, 468 U. S., at 584–585 (internal quotation marks omitted). Petitioner has not met this standard,

Correctional officials have a significant interest in conducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake
process. The admission of inmates creates numerous risks
for facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and
for a new detainee himself or herself. The danger of introducing lice or contagious infections, for example, is well
documented. See, e.g., Deger & Quick, The Enduring
Menace of MRSA: Incidence, Treatment, and Prevention
in a County Jail, 15 J. Correctional Health Care 174, 174–
175, 177–178 (2009); Bick, Infection Control in Jails and
Prisons, 45 Healthcare Epidemiology 1047, 1049 (2007).
The Federal Bureau of Prisons recommends that staff
screen new detainees for these conditions. See Clinical
Practice Guidelines, Management of Methicillin-Resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Infections 2 (2011); Clinical Practice Guidelines, Lice and Scabies Protocol 1 (2011).
Persons just arrested may have wounds or other injuries
requiring immediate medical attention. It may be difficult
to identify and treat these problems until detainees remove their clothes for a visual inspection. See Prison and
Jail Administration: Practice and Theory 142 (P. Carlson
& G. Garrett eds., 2d ed. 2008) (hereinafter Carlson &
Garrett).
