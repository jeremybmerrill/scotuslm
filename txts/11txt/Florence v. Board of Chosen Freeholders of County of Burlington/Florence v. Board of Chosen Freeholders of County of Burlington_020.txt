Opinion of the Court

conduct admission searches on felons.” App. 381a. Exempting people arrested for minor offenses from a standard search protocol thus may put them at greater risk and
result in more contraband being brought into the detention facility. This is a substantial reason not to mandate
the exception petitioner seeks as a matter of constitutional
law.

It also may be difficult, as a practical matter, to classify
inmates by their current and prior offenses before the
intake search. Jails can be even more dangerous than
prisons because officials there know so little about the
people they admit at the outset. See New Jersey Wardens
Brief 11–14. An arrestee may be carrying a false ID or lie
about his identity. The officers who conduct an initial
search often do not have access to criminal history records.
See, e.g., App. 235a; New Jersey Wardens Brief 13. And
those records can be inaccurate or incomplete. See Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of

an example. It did not reflect his previous arrest for possession of a deadly weapon. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18–19. In
the absence of reliable information it would be illogical to
require officers to assume the arrestees in front of them do
not pose a risk of smuggling something into the facility.
The laborious administration of prisons would become
less effective, and likely less fair and evenhanded, were
the practical problems inevitable from the rules suggested
by petitioner to be imposed as a constitutional mandate.
Even if they had accurate information about a detainee’s
current and prior arrests, officers, under petitioner’s proposed regime, would encounter serious implementation
difficulties. They would be required, in a few minutes, to
determine whether any of the underlying offenses were
