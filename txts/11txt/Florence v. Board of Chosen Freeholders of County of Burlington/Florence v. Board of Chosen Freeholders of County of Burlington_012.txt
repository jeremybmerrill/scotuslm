FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF
COUNTY OF BURLINGTON

Opinion of the Court 


ests is “peculiarly within the province and professional
expertise of corrections officials.” Id., at 548. This Court
has repeated the admonition that, “ ‘in the absence of
substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the
officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert
judgment in such matters.’ ” Block, supra, at 584–585;
Bell, supra, at 548.
In many jails officials seek to improve security by requiring some kind of strip search of everyone who is to be
detained. These procedures have been used in different
places throughout the country, from Cranston, Rhode
Island, to Sapulpa, Oklahoma, to Idaho Falls, Idaho. See
Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F. 3d 107, 108–109 (CA1
2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F. 2d 393, 394 (CA10
1993); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F. 2d 614, 615 (CA9 1984)
(per curiam); see also, e.g., Bull v. City and Cty. of San

2008) (en banc) (Fulton Cty., Ga.); Masters v. Crouch, 872
F. 2d 1248, 1251 (CA6 1989) (Jefferson Cty., Ky.); Weber v.
Dell, 804 F. 2d 796, 797–798 (CA2 1986) (Monroe Cty.,
N. Y.); Stewart v. Lubbock Cty., 767 F. 2d 153, 154 (CA5
1985) (Lubbock Cty., Tex.).
Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the
detainees processed at these facilities. This is, in part, a
consequence of the exercise of state authority that was the
subject of Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318 (2001).
Atwater addressed the perhaps more fundamental question of who may be deprived of liberty and taken to jail in
the first place. The case involved a woman who was arrested after a police officer noticed neither she nor her
children were wearing their seatbelts. The arrestee argued the Fourth Amendment prohibited her custodial
