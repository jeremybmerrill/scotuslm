FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF 

COUNTY OF BURLINGTON

BREYER, J., dissenting 


Chicago, 723 F. 2d 1263, 1272 (CA7 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Blackburn v. Snow, 771
F. 2d 556, 564 (CA1 1985) (“ ‘[A]ll courts’ ” have recognized
the “ ‘ severe if not gross interference with a person’s privacy’ ” that accompany visual body cavity searches (quoting
Arruda v. Fair, 710 F. 2d 886, 887 (CA1 1983))). These
kinds of searches also gave this Court the “most pause” in
Bell, supra, at 558 (guards strip searched prisoners after
they received outside visits). Even when carried out in a
respectful manner, and even absent any physical touching,
see ante at 4–5, 19, such searches are inherently harmful,
humiliating, and degrading. And the harm to privacy
interests would seem particularly acute where the person
searched may well have no expectation of being subject
to such a search, say, because she had simply received a
traffic ticket for failing to buckle a seatbelt, because he
had not previously paid a civil fine, or because she had
been arrested for a minor trespass.
In Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 323–324 (2001),
for example, police arrested a mother driving with her two
children because their seat belts were not buckled. This
Court held that the Constitution did not forbid an arrest
for a minor seatbelt offense. Id., at 323. But, in doing so,
it pointed out that the woman was held for only an hour
(before being taken to a magistrate and released on bond)
and that the search—she had to remove her shoes, jewelry, and the contents of her pockets, id., at 355—was not
“ ‘unusually harmful to [her] privacy or . . . physical interests.’ ” Id., at 354 (quoting Whren v. United States, 517
U. S. 806, 818 (1996)). Would this Court have upheld the
arrest had the magistrate not been immediately available,
had the police housed her overnight in the jail, and had
they subjected her to a search of the kind at issue here?
Cf. County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 56
(1991) (presentment must be within 48 hours after arrest).
The petitioner, Albert W. Florence, states that his pre-
