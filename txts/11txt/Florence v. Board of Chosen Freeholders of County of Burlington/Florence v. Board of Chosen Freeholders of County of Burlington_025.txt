ALBERT W. FLORENCE, PETITIONER v. BOARD OF

CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF

BURLINGTON ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[April 2, 2012]


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court but emphasize the limits
of today’s holding. The Court holds that jail administrators may require all arrestees who are committed to
the general population of a jail to undergo visual strip
searches not involving physical contact by corrections
officers. To perform the searches, officers may direct the
arrestees to disrobe, shower, and submit to a visual inspection. As part of the inspection, the arrestees may be
required to manipulate their bodies.
Undergoing such an inspection is undoubtedly humiliating and deeply offensive to many, but there are reasonable grounds for strip searching arrestees before they are
admitted to the general population of a jail. As the Court
explains, there is a serious danger that some detainees
will attempt to smuggle weapons, drugs, or other contraband into the jail. Some detainees may have lice, which
can easily spread to others in the facility, and some detainees may have diseases or injuries for which the jail
is required to provide medical treatment. In addition, if a
detainee with gang-related tattoos is inadvertently housed
with detainees from a rival gang, violence may ensue.
Petitioner and the dissent would permit corrections
officers to conduct the visual strip search at issue here
