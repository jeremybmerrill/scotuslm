Opinion of the Court

ate detention. Id., at 346. The Court held that a Fourth
Amendment restriction on this power would put officers in
an “almost impossible spot.” Id., at 350. Their ability to
arrest a suspect would depend in some cases on the precise weight of drugs in his pocket, whether he was a repeat
offender, and the scope of what counted as a compelling
need to detain someone. Id., at 348–349. The Court rejected the proposition that the Fourth Amendment barred
custodial arrests in a set of these cases as a matter of
constitutional law. It ruled, based on established principles, that officers may make an arrest based upon probable cause to believe the person has committed a criminal
offense in their presence. See id., at 354. The Court
stated that “a responsible Fourth Amendment balance is
not well served by standards requiring sensitive, case-bycase determinations of government need, lest every discretionary judgment in the field be converted into an occasion
for constitutional review.” Id., at 347.
Atwater did not address whether the Constitution imposes special restrictions on the searches of offenders

that corrections officials may not conduct a strip search of
these detainees, even if no touching is involved, absent
reasonable suspicion of concealed contraband. 621 F. 3d,
at 303–304, and n. 4. The Courts of Appeals to address
this issue in the last decade, however, have come to the
opposite conclusion. See 621 F. 3d 296 (case below); Bame
v. Dillard, 637 F. 3d 380 (CADC 2011); Powell, supra;
Bull, supra. The current case is set against this precedent

Bell.

The question here is whether undoubted security imperatives involved in jail supervision override the asser-
