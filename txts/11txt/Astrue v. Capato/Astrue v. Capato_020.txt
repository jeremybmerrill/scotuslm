ASTRUE v. CAPATO
Opinion of the Court

ence under Chevron, 467 U. S. 837.
Chevron deference is appropriate “when it appears that
Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to
make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency
interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the
exercise of that authority.” United States v. Mead Corp.,
533 U. S. 218, 226–227 (2001). Here, as already noted, the
SSA’s longstanding interpretation is set forth in regulations published after notice-and-comment rulemaking.
See supra, at 6–7. Congress gave the Commissioner authority to promulgate rules “necessary or appropriate to
carry out” the Commissioner’s functions and the relevant
statutory provisions. See 42 U. S. C. §§405(a), 902(a)(5).
The Commissioner’s regulations are neither “arbitrary or
capricious in substance, [n]or manifestly contrary to the
statute.” Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research
v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7)
(internal quotation marks omitted). They thus warrant
the Court’s approbation. See Barnhart v. Walton, 535
U. S. 212, 217–222, 225 (2002) (deferring to the Commissioner’s “considerable authority” to interpret the Social
Security Act).
V
Tragic circumstances—Robert Capato’s death before he
and his wife could raise a family—gave rise to this case.
But the law Congress enacted calls for resolution of Karen
Capato’s application for child’s insurance benefits by
reference to state intestacy law. We cannot replace that
reference by creating a uniform federal rule the statute’s
text scarcely supports.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
