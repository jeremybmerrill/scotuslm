ASTRUE v. CAPATO
Opinion of the Court

need to determine a child’s family status? The answer
that the Third Circuit found plain: whenever the claimant
is “the biological child of a married couple.” Id., at 630.7
We point out, first, some conspicuous flaws in the Third
Circuit’s and respondent Karen Capato’s reading of the
Act’s provisions, and then explain why we find the SSA’s
interpretation persuasive.
A
Nothing in §416(e)’s tautological definition (“ ‘child’
means . . . the child . . . of an individual”) suggests that
Congress understood the word “child” to refer only to the
children of married parents. The dictionary definitions
offered by respondent are not so confined. See Webster’s
New International Dictionary 465 (2d ed. 1934) (defining
“child” as, inter alia, “[i]n Law, legitimate offspring; also,
sometimes, esp. in wills, an adopted child, or an illegitimate offspring, or any direct descendant, as a grandchild,
as the intention may appear”); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 214 (11th ed. 2003) (“child” means “son or
daughter,” or “descendant”). See also Restatement (Third)
of Property §2.5(1) (1998) (“[a]n individual is the child of
his or her genetic parents,” and that may be so “whether
or not [the parents] are married to each other”). Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited
the category of children covered to offspring of a marital
union. See §402(d)(3)(A) (referring to the “legitimate . . .
child” of an individual). Other contemporaneous statutes
similarly differentiate child of a marriage (“legitimate
child”) from the unmodified term “child.” See, e.g., Servicemen’s Dependents Allowance Act of 1942, ch. 443,

7 Because the Court of Appeals found the statutory language unambiguous, it had no occasion to “determine whether the [SSA’s] interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.” 631 F. 3d, at 631,
n. 5 (citing Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984)).
