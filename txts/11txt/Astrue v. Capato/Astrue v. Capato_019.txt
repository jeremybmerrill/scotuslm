Opinion of the Court

Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175
(1972)). No showing has been made that posthumously
conceived children share the characteristics that prompted
our skepticism of classifications disadvantaging children
of unwed parents. We therefore need not decide whether
heightened scrutiny would be appropriate were that the
case.10 Under rational-basis review, the regime Congress
adopted easily passes inspection. As the Ninth Circuit
held, that regime is “reasonably related to the government’s twin interests in [reserving] benefits [for] those
children who have lost a parent’s support, and in using
reasonable presumptions to minimize the administrative
burden of proving dependency on a case-by-case basis.”
Vernoff, 568 F. 3d, at 1112 (citing Mathews, 427 U. S., at
509).
IV
As we have explained, §416(e)(1)’s statement, “[t]he
term ‘child’ means . . . the child . . . of an individual,” is a
definition of scant utility without aid from neighboring
provisions. See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54. That aid is
supplied by §416(h)(2)(A), which completes the definition
of “child” “for purposes of th[e] subchapter” that includes
§416(e)(1). Under the completed definition, which the SSA
employs, §416(h)(2)(A) refers to state law to determine the
status of a posthumously conceived child. The SSA’s
interpretation of the relevant provisions, adhered to without deviation for many decades, is at least reasonable; the
agency’s reading is therefore entitled to this Court’s defer——————
10 Ironically, while drawing an analogy to the “illogical and unjust”
discrimination children born out of wedlock encounter, see Weber v.
Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175–176 (1972), respondent asks us to differentiate between children whose parents were
married and children whose parents’ liaisons were not blessed by clergy
or the State. She would eliminate the intestacy test only for biological
children of married parents.
