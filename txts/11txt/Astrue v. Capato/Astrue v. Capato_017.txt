Opinion of the Court

and the child’s conception and birth. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
36–37 (counsel for Karen Capato acknowledged that,
under the preemptive federal rule he advocated, and the
Third Circuit adopted, a child born four years after her
father’s death would be eligible for benefits).
The paths to receipt of benefits laid out in the Act and
regulations, we must not forget, proceed from Congress’
perception of the core purpose of the legislation. The aim
was not to create a program “generally benefiting needy
persons”; it was, more particularly, to “provide . . . dependent members of [a wage earner’s] family with protection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the
insured’s] earnings.” Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52
(1977). We have recognized that “where state intestacy
law provides that a child may take personal property from
a father’s estate, it may reasonably be thought that the
child will more likely be dependent during the parent’s life
and at his death.” Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514
(1976). Reliance on state intestacy law to determine who
is a “child” thus serves the Act’s driving objective. True,
the intestacy criterion yields benefits to some children
outside the Act’s central concern. Intestacy laws in a
number of States, as just noted, do provide for inheritance
by posthumously conceived children, see supra, at 12,9 and
under federal law, a child conceived shortly before her
father’s death may be eligible for benefits even though she
never actually received her father’s support. It was nonetheless Congress’ prerogative to legislate for the generality
of cases. It did so here by employing eligibility to inherit
