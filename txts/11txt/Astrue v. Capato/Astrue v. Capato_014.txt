ASTRUE v. CAPATO
Opinion of the Court

having the same meaning.”).
Finally, it is far from obvious that Karen Capato’s proposed definition—“biological child of married parents,” see
Brief for Respondent 9—would cover the posthumously
conceived Capato twins. Under Florida law, a marriage
ends upon the death of a spouse. See Price v. Price, 114
Fla. 233, 235, 153 So. 904, 905 (1934). If that law applies,
rather than a court-declared preemptive federal law, the
Capato twins, conceived after the death of their father,
would not qualify as “marital” children.8

Resisting the importation of words not found in
§416(e)—“child” means “the biological child of married
parents,” Brief for Respondent 9—the SSA finds a key
textual cue in §416(h)(2)(A)’s opening instruction: “In
determining whether an applicant is the child . . . of [an]
insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,” the
Commissioner shall apply state intestacy law. (Emphasis
added.) Respondent notes the absence of any crossreference in §416(e) to §416(h). Brief for Respondent 18.
She overlooks, however, that §416(h) provides the crucial
link. The “subchapter” to which §416(h) refers is Subchapter II of the Act, which spans §§401 through 434.
Section 416(h)’s reference to “this subchapter” thus includes both §§402(d) and 416(e). Having explicitly complemented §416(e) by the definitional provisions contained
in §416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant
cross-reference in §416(e). See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54

8 Respondent urges that it would be bizarre to deny benefits to the
Capato twins when, under §416(h)(2)(B), they would have gained
benefits had their parents gone through a marriage ceremony that
would have been valid save for a legal impediment. Brief for Respondent 26, n. 10; see supra, at 5–6. Whether the Capatos’ marriage ceremony was flawed or flawless, the SSA counters, no marital union was
extant when the twins were conceived. Reply Brief 11.
