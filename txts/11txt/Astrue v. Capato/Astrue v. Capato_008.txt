ASTRUE v. CAPATO
Opinion of the Court

Schafer v. Astrue, 641 F. 3d 49, 54–63 (CA4 2011) (posthumously conceived child’s qualification for benefits depends on intestacy law of State in which wage earner was
domiciled). To resolve the conflict, we granted the Commissioner’s petition for a writ of certiorari. 565 U. S. ___
(2011).
II
Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1939 to
provide a monthly benefit for designated surviving family members of a deceased insured wage earner. “Child’s
insurance benefits” are among the Act’s family-protective
measures. 53 Stat. 1364, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §402(d).
An applicant qualifies for such benefits if she meets the
Act’s definition of “child,” is unmarried, is below specified
age limits (18 or 19) or is under a disability which began
prior to age 22, and was dependent on the insured at the
time of the insured’s death. §402(d)(1).3
To resolve this case, we must decide whether the Capato
twins rank as “child[ren]” under the Act’s definitional
provisions. Section 402(d) provides that “[e]very child (as
defined in section 416(e) of this title)” of a deceased insured individual “shall be entitled to a child’s insurance
benefit.” Section 416(e), in turn, states: “The term ‘child’
means (1) the child or legally adopted child of an individ——————
3 Applicants not in fact dependent on the insured individual may be
“deemed dependent” when the Act so provides. For example, a “legitimate” child, even if she is not living with or receiving support from
her parent, is ordinarily “deemed dependent” on that parent. 42 U. S. C.
§402(d)(3). Further, applicants “deemed” the child of an insured
individual under §416(h)(2)(B) or (h)(3) are also “deemed legitimate,”
hence dependent, even if not living with or receiving support from
the parent. §402(d)(3). See also Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 499,
n. 2 (1976) (deeming dependent any child who qualifies under
§416(h)(2)(A)); Tr. of Oral Arg. 13–14 (counsel for the SSA stated, in
response to the Court’s question, that statutory presumptions of dependency are irrebuttable).
