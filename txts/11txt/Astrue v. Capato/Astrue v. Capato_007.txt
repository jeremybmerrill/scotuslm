Opinion of the Court

Karen Capato claimed survivors insurance benefits on
behalf of the twins. The SSA denied her application, and
the U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey
affirmed the agency’s decision. See App. to Pet. for Cert.
33a (decision of the Administrative Law Judge); id., at
15a (District Court opinion). In accord with the SSA’s
construction of the statute, the District Court determined
that the twins would qualify for benefits only if, as
§416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law. Robert
Capato died domiciled in Florida, the court found. Under
that State’s law, the court noted, a child born posthumously may inherit through intestate succession only if
conceived during the decedent’s lifetime. Id., at 27a–28a.1
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.
Under §416(e), the appellate court concluded, “the undisputed biological children of a deceased wage earner and
his widow” qualify for survivors benefits without regard to
state intestacy law. 631 F. 3d 626, 631 (2011).2 Courts of
Appeals have divided on the statutory interpretation
question this case presents. Compare ibid. and GillettNetting v. Barnhart, 371 F. 3d 593, 596–597 (CA9 2004)
(biological but posthumously conceived child of insured
wage earner and his widow qualifies for benefits), with
Beeler v. Astrue, 651 F. 3d 954, 960–964 (CA8 2011), and
——————
1 The District Court observed that Fla. Stat. Ann. §732.106 (West
2010) defines “ ‘afterborn heirs’ ” as “ ‘heirs of the decedent conceived
before his or her death, but born thereafter.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert.
27a (emphasis added by District Court). The court also referred to
§742.17(4), which provides that a posthumously conceived child “ ‘shall
not be eligible for a claim against the decedent’s estate unless the child
has been provided for by the decedent’s will.’ ” Id., at 28a.
2 Because the Third Circuit held that posthumously conceived children qualify for survivors benefits as a matter of federal law, it did not
definitively determine “where [Robert] Capato was domiciled at his
death or . . . delve into the law of intestacy of that state.” 631 F. 3d, at
632, n. 6. These issues, if preserved, may be considered on remand.
