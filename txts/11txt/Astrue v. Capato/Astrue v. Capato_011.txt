As the SSA reads the statute, 42 U. S. C. §416(h) governs the meaning of “child” in §416(e)(1). In other words,
§416(h) is a gateway through which all applicants for insurance benefits as a “child” must pass. See Beeler, 651
F. 3d, at 960 (“The regulations make clear that the SSA
interprets the Act to mean that the provisions of §416(h)
are the exclusive means by which an applicant can establish ‘child’ status under §416(e) as a natural child.”).6

Karen Capato argues, and the Third Circuit held, that
§416(h), far from supplying the governing law, is irrelevant in this case. Instead, the Court of Appeals determined, §416(e) alone is dispositive of the controversy. 631
F. 3d, at 630–631. Under §416(e), “child” means “child of
an [insured] individual,” and the Capato twins, the Third
Circuit observed, clearly fit that definition: They are undeniably the children of Robert Capato, the insured wage
earner, and his widow, Karen Capato. Section 416(h)
comes into play, the court reasoned, only when “a claimant’s status as a deceased wage-earner’s child is in doubt.”
Id., at 631. That limitation, the court suggested, is evident from §416(h)’s caption: “Determination of family
status.” Here, “there is no family status to determine,” the
court said, id., at 630, so §416(h) has no role to play.
In short, while the SSA regards §416(h) as completing
§416(e)’s sparse definition of “child,” the Third Circuit
considered each subsection to control different situations:
§416(h) governs when a child’s family status needs to be
determined; §416(e), when it does not. When is there no
