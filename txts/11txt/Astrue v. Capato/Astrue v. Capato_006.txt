ASTRUE v. CAPATO
Opinion of the Court

(h)(3)(C), as critical, and reads them to entitle biological
children to benefits only if they qualify for inheritance
from the decedent under state intestacy law, or satisfy one
of the statutory alternatives to that requirement.
We conclude that the SSA’s reading is better attuned to
the statute’s text and its design to benefit primarily those
supported by the deceased wage earner in his or her lifetime. And even if the SSA’s longstanding interpretation is
not the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible
construction that garners the Court’s respect under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).
I
Karen Capato married Robert Capato in May 1999.
Shortly thereafter, Robert was diagnosed with esophageal
cancer and was told that the chemotherapy he required
might render him sterile. Because the couple wanted
children, Robert, before undergoing chemotherapy, deposited his semen in a sperm bank, where it was frozen and
stored. Despite Robert’s aggressive treatment regime,
Karen conceived naturally and gave birth to a son in
August 2001. The Capatos, however, wanted their son to
have a sibling.
Robert’s health deteriorated in late 2001, and he died in
Florida, where he and Karen then resided, in March 2002.
His will, executed in Florida, named as beneficiaries the
son born of his marriage to Karen and two children from
a previous marriage. The will made no provision for children conceived after Robert’s death, although the Capatos
had told their lawyer they wanted future offspring to be
placed on a par with existing children. Shortly after Robert’s death, Karen began in vitro fertilization using her
husband’s frozen sperm. She conceived in January 2003
and gave birth to twins in September 2003, 18 months
after Robert’s death.
