ASTRUE v. CAPATO
Opinion of the Court

under state intestacy law as a workable substitute for burdensome case-by-case determinations whether the child
was, in fact, dependent on her father’s earnings.
Respondent argues that on the SSA’s reading, natural
children alone must pass through a §416(h) gateway.
Adopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it is true, are defined in §416(e), and are
not further defined in §416(h). Respondent overlooks,
however, that although not touched by §416(h), beneficiaries described in §§416(e)(2) and (e)(3) must meet other
statutorily prescribed criteria. In short, the Act and regulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted
children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, see 20 CFR §§404.356–404.358, but it hardly follows
that applicants in those categories are treated more advantageously than are children who must meet a §416(h)
criterion.
The SSA’s construction of the Act, respondent charges,
raises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause. Brief for
Respondent 42; see Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S.
636, 638, n. 2 (1975). She alleges: “Under the government’s interpretation . . . , posthumously conceived children are treated as an inferior subset of natural children
who are ineligible for government benefits simply because
of their date of birth and method of conception.” Brief for
Respondent 42–43.
Even the Courts of Appeals that have accepted the
reading of the Act respondent advances have rejected this
argument. See 631 F. 3d, at 628, n. 1 (citing Vernoff
v. Astrue, 568 F. 3d 1102, 1112 (CA9 2009)). We have
applied an intermediate level of scrutiny to laws “burden[ing] illegitimate children for the sake of punishing the
illicit relations of their parents, because ‘visiting this
condemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and
unjust.’ ” Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S. 456, 461 (1988) (quoting
