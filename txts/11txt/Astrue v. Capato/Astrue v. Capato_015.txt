Opinion of the Court

(Congress, in §416(h)(2)(A), provided “plain and explicit
instruction on how the determination of child status
should be made”; on this point, the statute’s text “could
hardly be more clear.”).
The original version of today’s §416(h) was similarly
drafted. It provided that, “[i]n determining whether an
applicant is the . . . child . . . of [an] insured individual for
purposes of sections 401–409 of this title, the Board shall
apply [state intestacy law].” 42 U. S. C. §409(m) (1940 ed.)
(emphasis added). Sections 401–409 embraced §§402(c)
and 409(k), the statutory predecessors of 42 U. S. C.
§§402(d) and 416(e) (2006 ed.), respectively.
Reference to state law to determine an applicant’s status as a “child” is anything but anomalous. Quite the
opposite. The Act commonly refers to state law on matters
of family status. For example, the Act initially defines
“wife” as “the wife of an [insured] individual,” if certain
conditions are satisfied. §416(b). Like §416(e), §416(b)
is, at least in part, tautological (“ ‘wife’ means the [insured’s] wife”). One must read on, although there is no express cross-reference, to §416(h) (rules on “[d]etermination
of family status”) to complete the definition. Section
§416(h)(1)(A) directs that, “for purposes of this subchapter,” the law of the insured’s domicile determines whether
“[the] applicant and [the] insured individual were validly
married,” and if they were not, whether the applicant
would nevertheless have “the same status” as a wife under
the State’s intestacy law. (Emphasis added.) The Act
similarly defines the terms “widow,” “husband,” and “widower.” See §§416(c), (f), (g), (h)(1)(A).
Indeed, as originally enacted, a single provision mandated the use of state intestacy law for “determining
whether an applicant is the wife, widow, child, or parent of
[an] insured individual.” 42 U. S. C. §409(m) (1940 ed.).
All wife, widow, child, and parent applicants thus had to
satisfy the same criterion. To be sure, children born dur-
