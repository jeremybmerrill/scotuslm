Opinion of the Court

ual, (2) a stepchild [under certain circumstances], and (3)
. . . the grandchild or stepgrandchild of an individual or
his spouse [who meets certain conditions].”
The word “child,” we note, appears twice in §416(e)’s
opening sentence: initially in the prefatory phrase, “[t]he
term ‘child’ means . . . ,” and, immediately thereafter, in
subsection (e)(1) (“child or legally adopted child”), delineating the first of three beneficiary categories. Unlike
§§416(e)(2) and (3), which specify the circumstances under
which stepchildren and grandchildren qualify for benefits,
§416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration. Compare §416(e)(1)
(referring simply to “the child . . . of an individual”) with,
e.g., §416(e)(2) (applicant must have been a stepchild for at
least nine months before the insured individual’s death).
A subsequent definitional provision further addresses
the term “child.” Under the heading “Determination of
family status,” §416(h)(2)(A) provides: “In determining
whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured
individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of
the insured individual’s domiciliary State].”4
An applicant for child benefits who does not meet
§416(h)(2)(A)’s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless
qualify for benefits under one of several other criteria the
Act prescribes. First, an applicant who “is a son or daughter” of an insured individual, but is not determined to be a
“child” under the intestacy-law provision, nevertheless
——————
4 Section 416(h)(2)(A) also states that persons who, under the law of
the insured’s domicile, “would have the same status relative to taking
intestate personal property as a child or parent shall be deemed such.”
Asked about this prescription, counsel for the SSA responded that it
would apply to equitably adopted children. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8–9, 54; see
20 CFR §404.359 (2011) (an equitably adopted child may be eligible for
benefits if the agreement to adopt the child would be recognized under
state law as enabling the child to inherit upon the intestate death of
the adopting parent).
