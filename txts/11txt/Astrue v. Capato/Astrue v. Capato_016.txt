ASTRUE v. CAPATO
Opinion of the Court

ing their parents’ marriage would have readily qualified
under the 1939 formulation because of their eligibility
to inherit under state law. But requiring all “child” applicants to qualify under state intestacy law installed a
simple test, one that ensured benefits for persons plainly
within the legislators’ contemplation, while avoiding congressional entanglement in the traditional state-law
realm of family relations.
Just as the Act generally refers to state law to determine whether an applicant qualifies as a wife, widow,
husband, widower, 42 U. S. C. §416(h)(1) (2006 ed.), child
or parent, §416(h)(2)(A), so in several sections (§§416(b),
(c), (e)(2), (f), (g)), the Act sets duration-of-relationship
limitations. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777–
782 (1975) (discussing §416(e)(2)’s requirement that, as
a check against deathbed marriages, a parent-stepchild
relationship must exist “not less than nine months immediately preceding [insured’s death]”). Time limits also
qualify the statutes of several States that accord inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children. See Cal.
Prob. Code Ann. §249.5(c) (West Supp. 2012) (allowing
inheritance if child is in utero within two years of parent’s
death); Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. §15–11–120(11) (2011) (child
in utero within three years or born within 45 months);
Iowa Code Ann. §633.220A(1) (West Supp. 2012) (child
born within two years); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §9:391.1(A)
(West 2008) (child born within three years); N. D. Cent.
Code Ann. §30.1–04–19(11) (Lexis 2001) (child in utero
within three years or born within 45 months). See also
Uniform Probate Code §2–120(k), 8 U. L. A. 58 (Supp.
2011) (treating a posthumously conceived child as “in
gestation at the individual’s death,” but only if specified
time limits are met). No time constraints attend the Third
Circuit’s ruling in this case, under which the biological
child of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits,
no matter the length of time between the father’s death
