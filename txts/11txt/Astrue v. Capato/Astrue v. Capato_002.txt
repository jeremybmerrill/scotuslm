ASTRUE v. CAPATO
Syllabus
ceased insured individual “shall be entitled to a child’s insurance
benefit.” §402(d). Section 416(e), in turn, defines “child” to mean:
“(1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild
[under certain circumstances], and (3) . . . the grandchild or
stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain conditions].” Unlike §§416(e)(2) and (3), §416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of
the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits. Section
416(h)(2)(A), however, further addresses the term “child,” providing:
“In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an]
insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner
of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured individual’s domiciliary State].” An applicant who does not meet
§416(h)(2)(A)’s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for
benefits under other criteria set forth in §§416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but
respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria. Regulations promulgated by the SSA closely track §§416(h)(2) and (3) in
defining “[w]ho is the insured’s natural child,” 20 CFR §404.355. As
the SSA reads the statute, 42 U. S. C. §416(h) governs the meaning of
“child” in §416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all applicants for insurance benefits as a “child” must pass. Pp. 4–7.
(b) While the SSA regards §416(h) as completing §416(e)’s sparse
definition of “child,” the Third Circuit held, and respondent contends,
that §416(e) alone governs whenever the claimant is a married couple’s biological child. There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Circuit’s and respondent’s reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive
interpretation. Pp. 7–15.
(1) Nothing in §416(e)’s tautological definition suggests that
Congress understood the word “child” to refer only to the children of
married parents. The dictionary definitions offered by respondent
are not so confined. Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a marital union, see §402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly
distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term “child.”
Nor does §416(e) indicate that Congress intended “biological” parentage to be prerequisite to “child” status. A biological parent is not always a child’s parent under law. Furthermore, marriage does not
necessarily make a child’s parentage certain, nor does the absence of
marriage necessarily make a child’s parentage uncertain. Finally, it
is far from obvious that respondent’s proposed definition would cover
her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage
ends upon the death of a spouse. Pp. 8–10.
(2) The SSA finds a key textual cue in §416(h)(2)(A)’s opening instruction: “In determining whether an applicant is the child . . . of
[an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,” the Commis-
