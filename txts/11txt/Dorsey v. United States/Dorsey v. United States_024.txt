DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Guidelines within a few days—perhaps on August 3 itself.
At the same time, the Commission possesses ample authority to permit appropriate adjustments to be made in
the Guidelines sentences of those sentenced after August 3
but prior to the new Guidelines promulgation. See 28
U. S. C. §994(u) (power to make Guidelines reductions
retroactive); 76 Fed. Reg. 41333–41334 (2011) (amended
18-to-1 Guidelines made retroactive).
In any event,
courts, treating the Guidelines as advisory, possess authority to sentence in accordance with the new minimums.
For these reasons, if the Fair Sentencing Act’s new
minimums apply to all of those sentenced after August 3,
2010 (even if the new Guidelines were not yet ready), it is
possible to foresee a reasonably smooth transition. On the
other hand, it is difficult to foresee such a transition if
the new Act’s application is keyed to a later date, thereby
leaving the courts unable to take the new Act fully into
account, particularly when that circumstance might create
additional disparities and uncertainties that courts and
the Commission may be helpless to correct. We have no
reason to believe Congress would have wanted to impose
an unforeseeable, potentially complex application date.

We vacate the Court of Appeals’ judgments and remand
these cases for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
