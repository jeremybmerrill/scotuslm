SCALIA, J., dissenting

though the results of continuing to apply the pre-Act
statutory penalties are so senseless as to establish that
Congress must not have intended them. Retaining the old
mandatory minimums ensures at least rough equivalence
in sentences for defendants who committed their crimes at
the same time, but were sentenced at different times—
even as it leads to disparities for defendants who are sentenced at the same time, but committed their offenses
at different times. In light of this plausible basis for continuing to apply the prior law to pre-enactment offenders,
there is no reason to conclude that Congress necessarily
expected the new statutory penalties to apply.
B
Petitioners and the Government press a handful of additional arguments which require only brief discussion.
They first contend that an intention to apply the new
mandatory minimums to pre-enactment offenders can be
inferred from §10 of the Fair Sentencing Act, 124 Stat.
2375, which instructs the Commission to study the effects
of the new law and make a report to Congress within five
years. The suggestion is that, if the statutory penalties do
not apply to pre-enactment offenders, then the Act would
have no effect on many defendants sentenced during
the study period, which would in turn undermine Congress’s goal of compiling useful data. This is makeweight.
Whether or not the new mandatory minimums are held
applicable to pre-enactment offenders, they will be applied
to many post-enactment offenders during the study period,
and the Commission will have the opportunity to collect
useful data. The study provision simply has nothing to
say about the question at issue here.
The Government also notes that the Senate bill that
ultimately became the Fair Sentencing Act was based on
an earlier bill which contained a provision that would
have delayed the Act’s effective date until 180 days after
