DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

II

A

The considerations relied upon by the Court do not come
close to satisfying the demanding standard for repeal by
implication. As an initial matter, there is no persuasive
force whatever to the Court’s observation that continuing
to apply the prior mandatory minimums to pre-enactment
offenders would “involve imposing upon the pre-Act offender a pre-Act sentence at a time after Congress had
specifically found in the Fair Sentencing Act that such a
sentence was unfairly long.” Ante, at 15. That is true
whenever Congress reduces a criminal penalty, and so is a
consequence that Congress affirmatively embraced when it
said in §109 that ameliorative amendments to criminal
statutes do not apply to pre-enactment conduct. Nor does
it matter that Congress has instructed district courts,
when applying the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, to apply the version in force on the date of sentencing, with
the object of reducing disparities in sentences between
similar defendants who are sentenced for the same conduct at the same time. See 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).
The presumption against implied repeals requires us to
give effect, if possible, to both §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii) and §109.
“The courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among
congressional enactments, and when two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent
a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.” Morton v. Mancari, 417
U. S. 535, 551 (1974). We may readily do so here by holding that §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii) applies to Guidelines amendments, and §109 to statutory ones.
The Court also stresses that the Fair Sentencing Act
instructs the Sentencing Commission to promulgate “as
soon as practicable” (and not later than 90 days after
August 3, 2010) “such conforming amendments” to the
Sentencing Guidelines “as the Commission determines
