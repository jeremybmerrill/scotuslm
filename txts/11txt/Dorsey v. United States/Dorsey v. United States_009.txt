Opinion of the Court

supra, at 96–97. It did so by setting a base offense level
for a first-time drug offender that corresponded to the
lowest Guidelines range above the applicable mandatory
minimum. USSC, Report to the Congress: Mandatory
Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System 53–54 (Oct. 2011) (2011 Report). Thus, the first
Guidelines Drug Quantity Table associated 500 grams
of powder cocaine with an offense level of 26, which for a
first-time offender meant a sentencing range of 63 to 78
months (just above the 5-year minimum), and it associated
5,000 grams of powder cocaine with an offense level of 32,
which for a first-time offender meant a sentencing range
of 121 to 151 months (just above the 10-year minimum).
USSG §2D1.1 (Oct. 1987). Further reflecting the 1986
Drug Act’s 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio, the Table associated an offense level of 26 with 5 grams of crack and an
offense level of 32 with 50 grams of crack. Ibid.
In addition, the Drug Quantity Table set offense levels
for small drug amounts that did not trigger the 1986 Drug
Act’s mandatory minimums so that the resulting Guidelines sentences would remain proportionate to the sentences for amounts that did trigger these minimums. 2011
Report 54. Thus, the Table associated 400 grams of powder cocaine (an amount that fell just below the amount
triggering the 1986 Drug Act’s 5-year minimum) with an
offense level of 24, which for a first-time offender meant a
sentencing range of 51 to 63 months (the range just below
the 5-year minimum). USSG §2D1.1 (Oct. 1987). Following the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio, the Table associated
four grams of crack (an amount that also fell just below
the amount triggering the 1986 Drug Act’s 5-year minimum) with an offense level of 24. Ibid.
The Commission did this not because it necessarily
thought that those levels were most in keeping with past
sentencing practice or would independently have reflected
a fair set of sentences, but rather because the Commission
