DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

here trigger application of the general saving statute.
Enacted in 1871 to reverse the common-law rule that the
repeal or amendment of a criminal statute would abate all
nonfinal convictions under the repealed or amended statute, see Warden v. Marrero, 417 U. S. 653, 660 (1974), the
saving statute provides in relevant part:
“The repeal of any statute shall not have the effect
to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute
shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for
the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability.” 1 U. S. C. §109.
By reducing the statutory penalties for crack cocaine
offenses, the Fair Sentencing Act “repeal[ed]” the former
penalties; for defendants who committed their offenses
(and hence “incurred” the penalties) while the prior law
was in force, §109 directs that the prior law “shall be
treated as still remaining in force.”
Although §109 purports to require that subsequent
legislation opting out of its default rule must do so “expressly,” the Court correctly observes, ante, at 12, that
express-statement requirements of this sort are ineffective. See Lockhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 142, 147–
150 (2005) (SCALIA, J., concurring). Because “one legislature cannot abridge the powers of a succeeding legislature,” Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 135 (1810), a statute
is “alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it,”
Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). Consequently, the express-statement requirement of §109 is
itself subject to repeal on the same terms as any other
statute, which is to say that a repeal may be accomplished
by implication. See, e.g., Marrero, supra, at 659–660,
n. 10; Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U. S.
