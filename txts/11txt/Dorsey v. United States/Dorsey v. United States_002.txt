DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus
2007, but was not sentenced until December 2010. Sentencing him to
the 10-year minimum mandated by the 1986 Drug Act, the District
Judge ruled that the Fair Sentencing Act’s 5-year minimum for selling that amount of crack did not apply to those whose offenses were
committed before the Act’s effective date. In No. 11−5683, petitioner
Dorsey unlawfully sold 5.5 grams of crack in 2008. In September
2010, the District Judge sentenced him to the 1986 Drug Act’s 10year minimum, finding that it applied because Dorsey had a prior
drug conviction and declining to apply the Fair Sentencing Act, under
which there would be no mandated minimum term for an amount
less than 28 grams, because Dorsey’s offense predated that Act’s effective date. The Seventh Circuit affirmed in both cases.

Held: The Fair Sentencing Act’s new, lower mandatory minimums apply to the post-Act sentencing of pre-Act offenders. Pp. 10−20.
(a) Language in different statutes argues in opposite directions.
The general federal saving statute (1871 Act) provides that a new
criminal statute that “repeal[s]” an older criminal statute shall not
change the penalties “incurred” under that older statute “unless the
repealing Act shall so expressly provide.” 1 U. S. C. §109. The word
“repeal” applies when a new statute simply diminishes the penalties
that the older statute set forth, see Warden v. Marrero, 417 U. S. 653,
659−664, and penalties are “incurred” under the older statute when
an offender becomes subject to them, i.e., commits the underlying
conduct that makes the offender liable, see United States v.
Reisinger, 128 U. S. 398, 401. In contrast, the Sentencing Reform Act
says that, regardless of when the offender’s conduct occurs, the applicable sentencing guidelines are the ones “in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.” 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).
Six considerations, taken together, show that Congress intended
the Fair Sentencing Act’s more lenient penalties to apply to offenders
who committed crimes before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after that date. First, the 1871 saving statute permits Congress to apply a new Act’s more lenient penalties to pre-Act offenders without
expressly saying so in the new Act. The 1871 Act creates what is in
effect a less demanding interpretive requirement because the statute
“cannot justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested, either expressly or by necessary implication, in a subsequent enactment.” Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U. S. 452, 465.
Hence, this Court has treated the 1871 Act as setting forth an important background principle of interpretation that requires courts,
before interpreting a new criminal statute to apply its new penalties
to a set of pre-Act offenders, to assure themselves by the “plain import” or “fair implication” of the new statute that ordinary interpretive considerations point clearly in that direction. Second, the Sen-
