Opinion of the Court

398, 401 (1888); Great Northern R. Co. v. United States,
208 U. S. 452, 464–470 (1908).
On the other hand, the Sentencing Reform Act says
that, regardless of when the offender’s conduct occurs, the
applicable Guidelines are the ones “in effect on the date
the defendant is sentenced.” 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).
And the Fair Sentencing Act requires the Commission
to change the Guidelines in the wake of the Act’s new
minimums, making them consistent with “other guideline
provisions and applicable law.” §8(2), 124 Stat. 2374.
Courts that have held that they must apply the old,
higher 1986 Drug Act minimums to all pre-Act offenders,
including those sentenced after the Fair Sentencing Act
took effect, have emphasized that the 1871 Act requires
that result unless the Fair Sentencing Act either expressly
says or at least by fair implication implies the contrary.
See 635 F. 3d, at 339–340; Sidney, supra, at 906–908;
Tickles, supra, at 214–215; see also Holcomb, supra, at
446–448 (opinion of Easterbrook, J.). Courts that have
concluded that the Fair Sentencing Act’s more lenient
penalties apply have found in that Act, together with the
Sentencing Reform Act and other related circumstances,
indicia of a clear congressional intent to apply the new
Act’s minimums. See Douglas, supra, at 42–44; Dixon,
supra, at 199–203; see also Holcomb, 657 F. 3d, at 454–
457 (Williams, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en
banc); id., at 461–463 (Posner, J., dissenting from denial
of rehearing en banc). We too take the latter view. Six
considerations, taken together, convince us that Congress
intended the Fair Sentencing Act’s more lenient penalties
to apply to those offenders whose crimes preceded August
3, 2010, but who are sentenced after that date.
First, the 1871 saving statute permits Congress to apply
a new Act’s more lenient penalties to pre-Act offenders
without expressly saying so in the new Act. It is true
that the 1871 Act uses the words “expressly provide.” 1
