Opinion of the Court

Report). The Commission also asked Congress for new
legislation embodying a lower crack-to-powder ratio. 1995
Report 198–200; 1997 Report 9–10; 2002 Report 103–
107; 2007 Report 6–9. And the Commission recommended
that the legislation “include” an “emergency amendment”
allowing “the Commission to incorporate the statutory
changes” in the Guidelines while “minimiz[ing] the lag
between any statutory and guideline modifications for
cocaine offenders.” Id., at 9.
In 2010, Congress accepted the Commission’s recommendations, see 2002 Report 104; 2007 Report 8–9, and
n. 26, and enacted the Fair Sentencing Act into law. The
Act increased the drug amounts triggering mandatory
minimums for crack trafficking offenses from 5 grams to
28 grams in respect to the 5-year minimum and from 50
grams to 280 grams in respect to the 10-year minimum
(while leaving powder at 500 grams and 5,000 grams
respectively). §2(a), 124 Stat. 2372. The change had the
effect of lowering the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio to 18to-1. (The Act also eliminated the 5-year mandatory
minimum for simple possession of crack. §3, 124 Stat.
2372.)
Further, the Fair Sentencing Act instructed the Commission to “make such conforming amendments to the
Federal sentencing guidelines as the Commission determines necessary to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law.” §8(2), id., at 2374.
And it directed the Commission to “promulgate the guidelines, policy statements, or amendments provided for in
this Act as soon as practicable, and in any event not later
than 90 days” after the new Act took effect. §8(1), ibid.
The Fair Sentencing Act took effect on August 3,
2010. The Commission promulgated conforming emergency
Guidelines amendments that became effective on November 1, 2010. 75 Fed. Reg. 66188 (2010). A permanent
version of those Guidelines amendments took effect on
