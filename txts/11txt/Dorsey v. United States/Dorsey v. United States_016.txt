DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

U. S. C. §109. But the Court has long recognized that this
saving statute creates what is in effect a less demanding
interpretive requirement. That is because statutes enacted by one Congress cannot bind a later Congress,
which remains free to repeal the earlier statute, to exempt
the current statute from the earlier statute, to modify the
earlier statute, or to apply the earlier statute but as modified. See, e.g., Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 135 (1810);
Reichelderfer v. Quinn, 287 U. S. 315, 318 (1932). And
Congress remains free to express any such intention either
expressly or by implication as it chooses.
Thus, the Court has said that the 1871 Act “cannot
justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested
either expressly or by necessary implication in a subsequent enactment.” Great Northern R. Co., supra, at 465
(emphasis added). And in a comparable context the Court
has emphasized that the Administrative Procedure Act’s
use of the word “expressly” does not require Congress to
use any “magical passwords” to exempt a later statute
from the provision. Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U. S. 302,
310 (1955). Without requiring an “express” statement, the
Court has described the necessary indicia of congressional
intent by the terms “necessary implication,” “clear implication,” and “fair implication,” phrases it has used interchangeably. Great Northern R. Co., supra, at 465, 466;
Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, 218 (1910); Marrero,
supra, at 660, n. 10. One Member of the Court has said
we should determine whether “the plain import of a later
statute directly conflicts with an earlier statute,” and, if
so, “the later enactment governs, regardless of its compliance with any earlier-enacted requirement of an express
reference or other ‘magical password.’ ” Lockhart v. United
States, 546 U. S. 142, 149 (2005) (SCALIA, J., concurring).
Hence, the Court has treated the 1871 Act as setting
forth an important background principle of interpretation.
The Court has also assumed Congress is well aware of the
