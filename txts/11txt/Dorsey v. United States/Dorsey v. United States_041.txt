In the end, the mischief of the Court’s opinion is not the
result in this particular case, but rather the unpredictability it injects into the law for the future. The Court’s decision is based on “[s]ix considerations, taken together,”

considerations might have justified the Court’s result in
isolation, or even the relative importance of the various
considerations. One of them (the Commission’s emergency
authority to issue conforming amendments to the Guidelines) is a particular feature of the statute at issue in these

§109, as well as other provisions of the Dictionary Act, see

background interpretive principles. Because the Court’s
