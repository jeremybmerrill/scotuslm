DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

believed that doing so was the best way to keep similar
drug-trafficking sentences proportional, thereby satisfying
the Sentencing Reform Act’s basic “proportionality” objective. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 97; USSG §1A1.3 (Nov.
2011); 2011 Report 53–54, 349, and n. 845. For this reason, the Commission derived the Drug Quantity Table’s
entire set of crack and powder cocaine offense levels by
using the 1986 Drug Act’s two (5- and 10-year) minimum
amounts as reference points and then extrapolating from
those two amounts upward and downward to set proportional offense levels for other drug amounts. Ibid.
B
During the next two decades, the Commission and
others in the law enforcement community strongly criticized Congress’ decision to set the crack-to-powder mandatory minimum ratio at 100-to-1. The Commission issued
four separate reports telling Congress that the ratio was
too high and unjustified because, for example, research
showed the relative harm between crack and powder
cocaine less severe than 100-to-1, because sentences embodying that ratio could not achieve the Sentencing Reform Act’s “uniformity” goal of treating like offenders
alike, because they could not achieve the “proportionality”
goal of treating different offenders (e.g., major drug traffickers and low-level dealers) differently, and because the
public had come to understand sentences embodying the
100-to-1 ratio as reflecting unjustified race-based differences. Kimbrough, supra, at 97–98; see, e.g., USSC,
Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 197–198 (Feb. 1995) (1995 Report); USSC,
