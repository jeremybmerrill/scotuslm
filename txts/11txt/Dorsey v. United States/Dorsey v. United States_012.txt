DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

November 1, 2011. See 76 id., at 24960 (2011).
C
With this background in mind, we turn to the relevant
facts of the cases before us. Corey Hill, one of the petitioners, unlawfully sold 53 grams of crack in March 2007,
before the Fair Sentencing Act became law. App. in No.
11–5721, pp. 6, 83 (hereinafter Hill App.). Under the 1986
Drug Act, an offender who sold 53 grams of crack was
subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum. 21 U. S. C.
§841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2006 ed.). Hill was not sentenced, however, until December 2010, after the Fair Sentencing Act
became law and after the new Guidelines amendments
had become effective. Hill App. 83–94. Under the Fair
Sentencing Act, an offender who sold 53 grams of
crack was subject to a 5-year, not a 10-year, minimum.
§841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The sentencing
judge stated that, if he thought that the Fair Sentencing
Act applied, he would have sentenced Hill to that Act’s 5year minimum. Id., at 69. But he concluded that the Fair
Sentencing Act’s lower minimums apply only to those who
committed a drug crime after August 3, 2010—the Act’s
effective date. Id., at 65, 68. That is to say, he concluded
that the new Act’s more lenient sentences did not apply
to those who committed a crime before August 3, even if
they were sentenced after that date. Hence, the judge sentenced Hill to 10 years of imprisonment. Id., at 78. The
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 417
Fed. Appx. 560 (2011).
The second petitioner, Edward Dorsey (who had previously been convicted of a drug felony), unlawfully sold 5.5
grams of crack in August 2008, before the Fair Sentencing
Act took effect. App. in No. 5683, pp. 9, 48–49, 57–58
(hereinafter Dorsey App.). Under the 1986 Drug Act, an
offender such as Dorsey with a prior drug felony who sold
5.5 grams of crack was subject to a 10-year minimum.
