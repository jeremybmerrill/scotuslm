Opinion of the Court

new law changing sentences (unless Congress intends reopening sentencing proceedings concluded prior to a new
law’s effective date). We have explained how in federal
sentencing the ordinary practice is to apply new penalties
to defendants not yet sentenced, while withholding that
change from defendants already sentenced. Supra, at 13;
compare 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii) with §3582(c). And
we have explained how, here, continued application of
the old 1986 Drug Act minimums to those pre-Act offenders sentenced after August 3 would make matters worse.
Supra, at 16–18. We consequently conclude that this
particular new disparity (between those pre-Act offenders
already sentenced and those not yet sentenced as of
August 3) cannot make a critical difference.
For these reasons considered as a whole, we conclude
that Congress intended the Fair Sentencing Act’s new,
lower mandatory minimums to apply to the post-Act
sentencing of pre-Act offenders. That is the Act’s “plain
import” or “fair implication.”
B
We add one final point. Several arguments we have
discussed involve the language of statutes that determine
how new Guidelines take effect. Supra, at 13–14. What
about those who committed an offense prior to August 3
and were sentenced after August 3 but before November 1,
2010—a period after the new Act’s effective date but before
the new Guidelines first took effect? Do the Fair Sentencing Act’s new mandatory minimums apply to them?
In our view, the new Act’s lower minimums apply to
them as well. Our reason is that the statute simply instructs the Commission to promulgate new Guidelines “as
soon as practicable” (but no later than 90 days after the
Act took effect). §8(1), 124 Stat. 2374. As far as Congress
was concerned, the Commission might have (having
prepared new Guidelines in advance) promulgated those
