DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

offense level of 24, a level that would mean for a first-time
offender a prison term of 51 to 63 months. §2D1.1(c).
In 1986, Congress enacted a more specific, drug-related
sentencing statute, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986 Drug
Act), 100 Stat. 3207. That statute sets forth mandatory
minimum penalties of 5 and 10 years applicable to a drug
offender depending primarily upon the kind and amount of
drugs involved in the offense. See 21 U. S. C. §§841(b)(1)
(A)–(C) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). The minimum applicable
to an offender convicted of possessing with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of powder cocaine is 5 years,
and for 5,000 grams or more of powder the minimum is
10 years. §§841(b)(1)(A)(ii), (B)(ii). The 1986 Drug Act,
however, treated crack cocaine crimes as far more serious.
It applied its 5-year minimum to an offender convicted of
possessing with intent to distribute only 5 grams of crack
(as compared to 500 grams of powder) and its 10-year
minimum to one convicted of possessing with intent to
distribute only 50 grams of crack (as compared to 5,000
grams of powder), thus producing a 100-to-1 crack-topowder ratio. §§841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B)(iii) (2006 ed.).
The 1986 Drug Act, like other federal sentencing statutes, interacts with the Guidelines in an important way.
Like other sentencing statutes, it trumps the Guidelines.
Thus, ordinarily no matter what the Guidelines provide, a
judge cannot sentence an offender to a sentence beyond
the maximum contained in the federal statute setting
forth the crime of conviction. Similarly, ordinarily no
matter what range the Guidelines set forth, a sentencing
judge must sentence an offender to at least the minimum
prison term set forth in a statutory mandatory minimum.
See 28 U. S. C. §§994(a), (b)(1); USSG §5G1.1; Neal v.
United States, 516 U. S. 284, 289–290, 295 (1996).
Not surprisingly, the Sentencing Commission incorporated the 1986 Drug Act’s mandatory minimums into the
first version of the Guidelines themselves. Kimbrough,
