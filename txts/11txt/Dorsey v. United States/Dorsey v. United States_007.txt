Opinion of the Court

judges would use to determine sentences imposed upon
offenders convicted of committing federal crimes. 28
U. S. C. §§991, 994. Congress thereby sought to increase
transparency, uniformity, and proportionality in sentencing. United States Sentencing Commission (USSC or
Commission), Guidelines Manual §1A1.3, p. 2 (Nov. 2011)
(USSG); see 28 U. S. C. §§991(b)(1), 994(f).
The Sentencing Reform Act directed the Commission to
create in the Guidelines categories of offense behavior
(e.g., “ ‘bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken’ ”)
and offender characteristics (e.g., “one prior conviction”).
USSG §1A1.2, at 1; see 28 U. S. C. §§994(a)–(e). A sentencing judge determines a Guidelines range by (1) finding
the applicable offense level and offender category and then
(2) consulting a table that lists proportionate sentencing ranges (e.g., 18 to 24 months of imprisonment) at the
intersections of rows (marking offense levels) and columns
(marking offender categories). USSG ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table, §§5E1.2, 7B1.4; see also §1A1.4(h), at 11.
The Guidelines, after telling the judge how to determine the
applicable offense level and offender category, instruct the
judge to apply the intersection’s range in an ordinary case,
but they leave the judge free to depart from that range in
an unusual case. See 18 U. S. C. §3553(b); USSG §§1A1.2,
at 1–2, 1A1.4(b), at 6–7. This Court has held that the
Guidelines are now advisory. United States v. Booker, 543
U. S. 220, 245, 264 (2005); see Kimbrough v. United
States, 552 U. S. 85, 91 (2007).
The Guidelines determine most drug-crime offense levels in a special way. They set forth a Drug Quantity
Table (or Table) that lists amounts of various drugs and
associates different amounts with different “Base Offense
Levels” (to which a judge may add or subtract levels depending upon the “specific” characteristics of the offender’s
behavior). See USSG §2D1.1. The Table, for example,
associates 400 to 499 grams of powder cocaine with a base
