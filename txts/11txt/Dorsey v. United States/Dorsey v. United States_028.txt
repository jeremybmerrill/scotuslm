DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the of the
Appendix B to opinionCourt Court

for small differences in quantity. For another, because of
those “cliffs,” the scheme would create similar Guidelines
sentences for offenders who dealt in radically different
amounts of crack, e.g., 50 grams versus 500 grams.
To be sure, as amicus points out, Congress has provided
two mechanisms through which an offender may escape
an otherwise applicable mandatory minimum, diminishing
this problem for some offenders. First, an offender may
escape a minimum by providing substantial assistance
in the investigation or prosecution of another person. 18
U. S. C. §3553(e); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b); see also 28
U. S. C. §994(n); USSG §5K1.1. Second, under 18 U. S. C.
§3553(f), drug offenders who have little or no criminal
history and who satisfy other requirements in the provision may obtain “safety valve” relief. See also USSG §5C1.2.
And because of these mechanisms a substantial portion
of first-time offenders are relieved of application of a mandatory minimum. However, offenders with a criminal history category of II or higher are ineligible for “safety
valve” relief; they escape application of a minimum at a
much lower percentage. See 2011 Report 193 (Table 8–8).
