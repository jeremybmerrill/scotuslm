SCALIA, J., dissenting

452, 465 (1908).
Understanding the interpretive problem posed by these
cases as one of implied repeal helps to explain the Court’s
observation, ante, at 13, that what is required to override
§109’s default rule is a clear demonstration of congressional intent to do so. Admittedly, our cases have not
spoken with the utmost clarity on this point. In Marrero,
for example, we suggested that a “fair implication” from
a subsequently enacted statute would suffice, 417 U. S.,
at 660, n. 10, while in Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205
(1910), we used the phrase “clear implication,” id., at 218
(emphasis added); see also ibid. (“plain implication”). In
Great Northern R. Co., we split the difference, stating at
one point that §109 controls unless Congress expresses a
contrary intention “either expressly or by necessary implication in a subsequent enactment,” 208 U. S., at 465 (emphasis added), but suggesting at another point that a “fair
implication,” id., at 466, would do. In my view, the “fair
implication” formulation understates the burden properly
imposed on a defendant who would claim an implicit
exception from §109’s terms. Because the effect of such
an exception is to work a pro tanto repeal of §109’s application to the defendant’s case, the implication from the
subsequently enacted statute must be clear enough to
overcome our strong presumption against implied repeals.
See, e.g., Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516
U. S. 367, 381 (1996); Posadas v. National City Bank, 296
U. S. 497, 503 (1936). Thus, we should conclude that
Congress has deviated from §109 (or any similar statute
establishing a background interpretive principle) only
when the “plain import of a later statute directly conflicts”
with it. Lockhart, supra, at 149 (SCALIA, J., concurring)
(emphasis added).
