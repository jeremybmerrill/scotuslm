DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

many post-Act offenders might have been sentenced under
the outdated Guidelines, even though they were clearly
entitled to take advantage of the statutory amendments.
Because the emergency authority conferred on the Commission can reasonably be understood as directed at this
mismatch problem, it creates no clear implication that
Congress expected the new statutory penalties to apply to
pre-enactment offenders.
The Court’s last argument is that continuing to apply
the prior mandatory minimums to pre-enactment offenders would lead to anomalous, disproportionate sentencing
results. It is true enough, as the Court notes, ante, at 16–
18, that applying the prior mandatory minimums in tandem with the new Guidelines provisions—which track the
new, more lenient mandatory minimums—leads to a
series of “cliffs” at the mandatory minimum thresholds.
But this does not establish that Congress clearly meant
the new mandatory minimums to apply to pre-enactment
offenders. As noted above, supra, at 5–6, there is no reason to take the Guidelines amendments ultimately promulgated by the Commission as a given when evaluating
what Congress would have understood when the Fair
Sentencing Act was enacted. The Commission could have
promulgated amendments that ameliorated this problem
by retaining the old Guidelines ranges for pre-enactment
offenders.
Moreover, although the cliffs produced by the mismatch
between Guidelines and statutory penalties are admittedly
inconsistent with the premise of the Guidelines system
that sentences should vary in proportion to the gravity
of the offense and the culpability of the offender, see 18
U. S. C. §3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), the same objection can be
lodged against any mandatory minimum that trumps an
otherwise applicable Guidelines range. And it is not as
