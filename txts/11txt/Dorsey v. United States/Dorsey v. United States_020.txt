DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

indictment and sentencing for those offenses, and the
approximately 5,000 federal crack offenders convicted
each year, many pre-Act offenders were not (and will not
be) sentenced until after August 3, 2010, when the new,
more lenient mandatory minimums took effect. See 18
U. S. C. §3282(a); Administrative Office of United States
Courts, Judicial Business of the United States Courts,
p. 272 (2010) (Table D–10); 2011 Report 191.
Fifth, not to apply the Fair Sentencing Act would do
more than preserve a disproportionate status quo; it would
make matters worse. It would create new anomalies—new
sets of disproportionate sentences—not previously present.
That is because sentencing courts must apply new Guidelines (consistent with the Fair Sentencing Act’s new minimums) to pre-Act offenders, see supra, at 13–14, and the
1986 Drug Act’s old minimums would trump those new
Guidelines for some pre-Act offenders but not for all of
them—say, pre-Act offenders who possessed crack in small
amounts not directly the subject of mandatory minimums.
Consider, for example, a first-time offender convicted of
possessing with intent to distribute four grams of crack.
No mandatory sentence, under the 1986 Drug Act or the
Fair Sentencing Act, applies to an offender possessing so
small an amount. Yet under the old law, the Commission,
charged with creating proportionate sentences, had created
a Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months for such an offender, a sentence proportional to the 60 months that
the 1986 Drug Act required for one who trafficked five
grams of crack. See supra, at 5–6; USSG §2D1.1(c) (Nov.
2009).
The Fair Sentencing Act, however, requires the Commission to write new Guidelines consistent with the new
law. The Commission therefore wrote new Guidelines that
provide a sentencing range of 21 to 27 months—about
two years—for the first-time, 4-gram offender. See USSG
§2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2011). And the Sentencing Reform Act
