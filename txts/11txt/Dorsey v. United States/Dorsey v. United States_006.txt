DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

effect on August 3, 2010. The question here is whether
the Act’s more lenient penalty provisions apply to offenders who committed a crack cocaine crime before August 3,
2010, but were not sentenced until after August 3. We
hold that the new, more lenient mandatory minimum
provisions do apply to those pre-Act offenders.

The underlying question before us is one of congressional intent as revealed in the Fair Sentencing Act’s language, structure, and basic objectives. Did Congress
intend the Act’s more lenient penalties to apply to pre-Act
offenders sentenced after the Act took effect?
We recognize that, because of important background
principles of interpretation, we must assume that Congress did not intend those penalties to apply unless it
clearly indicated to the contrary. See infra, at 10–13. But
we find that clear indication here. We rest our conclusion primarily upon the fact that a contrary determination
would seriously undermine basic Federal Sentencing
Guidelines objectives such as uniformity and proportionality in sentencing. Indeed, seen from that perspective, a
contrary determination would (in respect to relevant
groups of drug offenders) produce sentences less uniform
and more disproportionate than if Congress had not enacted the Fair Sentencing Act at all. See infra, at 14–18.
Because our conclusion rests upon an analysis of the
Guidelines-based sentencing system Congress has established, we describe that system at the outset and include
an explanation of how the Guidelines interact with federal
statutes setting forth specific terms of imprisonment.

The Guidelines originate in the Sentencing Reform Act
of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987. That statute created a federal
Sentencing Commission instructed to write guidelines that
