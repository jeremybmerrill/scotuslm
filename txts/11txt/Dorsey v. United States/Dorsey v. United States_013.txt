Opinion of the Court

§841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2006 ed.). Dorsey was not sentenced,
however, until September 2010, after the new Fair Sentencing Act took effect. Id., at 84–95. Under the Fair
Sentencing Act, such an offender who sold 5.5 grams of
crack was not subject to a mandatory minimum at all, for
5.5 grams is less than the 28 grams that triggers the new
Act’s mandatory minimum provisions. §841(b)(1)(B)(iii)
(2006 ed., Supp. IV). Dorsey asked the judge to apply the
Fair Sentencing Act’s more lenient statutory penalties.
Id., at 54–55.
Moreover, as of Dorsey’s sentencing in September 2010,
the unrevised Guidelines (reflecting the 1986 Drug Act’s
old minimums) were still in effect. The Commission had
not yet finished revising the Guidelines to reflect the
new, lower statutory minimums. And the basic sentencing
statute, the Sentencing Reform Act, provides that a judge
shall apply the Guidelines that “are in effect on the date
the defendant is sentenced.” 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).
The sentencing judge, however, had the legal authority
not to apply the Guidelines at all (for they are advisory).
But he also knew that he could not ignore a minimum
sentence contained in the applicable statute. Dorsey App.
67–68. The judge noted that, even though he was sentencing Dorsey after the effective date of the Fair Sentencing
Act, Dorsey had committed the underlying crime prior to
that date. Id., at 69–70. And he concluded that the 1986
Drug Act’s old minimums, not the new Fair Sentencing
Act, applied in those circumstances. Ibid. He consequently
sentenced Dorsey to the 1986 Drug Act’s 10-year mandatory minimum term. Id., at 80. The Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, United States v. Fisher,
635 F. 3d 336 (2011), and denied rehearing en banc, 646
F. 3d 429 (2011) (per curiam); see also United States v.
Holcomb, 657 F. 3d 445 (CA7 2011).
The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclusions as to whether the Fair Sentencing Act’s more lenient
