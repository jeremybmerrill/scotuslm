DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

Commission would not make until several months later.1
Moreover, even if one takes it as given that the Commission’s new crack cocaine Guidelines would apply the
lower 18-to-1 ratio to all defendants sentenced after the
new Guidelines were put in place, it would not follow that
Congress necessarily expected the new mandatory minimums to apply to pre-enactment offenders. The directive
to update the Guidelines on an emergency basis is equally
consistent with Congress’s seeking to avoid a mismatch
between the Guidelines and the statutory penalties for
post-enactment offenders sentenced shortly after the Act’s
effective date.
Petitioners and the Government discount this explanation, noting that because of the lags associated with investigating and prosecuting drug offenses, most of the
defendants sentenced on the 91st day after the Fair
Sentencing Act’s enactment were sure to be pre-Act offenders. If Congress did not expect the new mandatory
minimums to apply to such offenders, they say, there
would have been no need to ensure that revised Guidelines
were in place so quickly. But most is not all, and it would
have been entirely sensible for Congress to worry that
some post-Act offenders—offenders clearly subject to the
new mandatory minimums—would nonetheless be sentenced under outdated Guidelines if the Guidelines were
not revised in short order.
The 11-month median time between indictment and

1 Congressional reliance on future Commission action might be plausible if the Commission had a settled practice of tying reductions in
statutory mandatory minimums to immediately applicable reductions
in Guidelines ranges, without any distinction based on the timing of
the defendant’s offense. But the Court does not cite any such settled
practice, and I am not aware of any. Presumably there has been no
occasion for a practice to develop either way, since congressional
legislation reducing criminal penalties is, in this day and age, very
rare.
