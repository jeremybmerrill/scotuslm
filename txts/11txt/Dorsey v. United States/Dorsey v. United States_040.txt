DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

passage, and specifically provided that “[t]here shall be no
retroactive application of any portion of this Act.” H. R.
265, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., §11 (2009). Even if one is
inclined to base inferences about statutory meaning on
unenacted versions of the relevant bill, but see Hamdan v.
Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 668 (2006) (SCALIA, J., dissenting), this argument from drafting history is unpersuasive.
That Congress considered and rejected a proposal that
would have delayed application of the Act until 180 days
after passage says nothing about whether the version
finally enacted applies to defendants whose criminal conduct pre-dated the Act. Moreover, the same bill would
have provided permissive authority for the Commission to
promulgate amended Guidelines on an emergency basis,
see §8(a), notwithstanding its delayed effective date provision. This point undercuts the argument that emergency
amendment authority and immediate application of the
new statutory penalties go hand-in-hand.
Petitioners finally appeal to the rule of lenity and the
canon of constitutional avoidance. But the rule of lenity
has no application here, because the background principle
supplied by §109 serves to remove the ambiguity that is a
necessary precondition to invocation of the rule. See Deal
v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 135 (1993). The canon
of constitutional avoidance also has no application here.
Although many observers viewed the 100-to-1 crack-topowder ratio under the prior law as having a racially
disparate impact, see, e.g., United States Sentencing
Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and
Federal Sentencing Policy 8 (Apr. 1997), only intentional
discrimination may violate the equal protection component
of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. See Ar­
lington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development
Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 264–265 (1977); Adarand Construc­
tors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 217 (1995). There is thus
no constitutional doubt triggered by application of the
