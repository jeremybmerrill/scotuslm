Opinion of the Court

enacted the Sentencing Reform Act and the Fair Sentencing Act to prevent. Two individuals with the same number
of prior offenses who each engaged in the same criminal
conduct involving the same amount of crack and were
sentenced at the same time would receive radically different sentences. For example, a first-time post-Act offender
with five grams of crack, subject to a Guidelines range of
21 to 27 months, could receive two years of imprisonment,
while an otherwise identical pre-Act offender would have
to receive the 5-year mandatory minimum. Compare
USSG §2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2011) with 21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(B)
(2006 ed.). A first-time post-Act 50-gram offender would
be subject to a Guidelines range of less than six years of
imprisonment, while his otherwise identical pre-Act counterpart would have to receive the 10-year mandatory
minimum. Compare USSG §2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2011) with 21
U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(A) (2006 ed.).
Moreover, unlike many prechange/postchange discrepancies, the imposition of these disparate sentences involves roughly contemporaneous sentencing, i.e., the same
time, the same place, and even the same judge, thereby
highlighting a kind of unfairness that modern sentencing statutes typically seek to combat. See, e.g., 28
U. S. C. §991(b)(1)(B) (purposes of Guidelines-based sentencing
include “avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities
among defendants with similar records who have been
found guilty of similar criminal conduct”); S. Rep. No. 98–
223, p. 74 (1983) (explaining rationale for using same,
current Guidelines for all roughly contemporaneous sentencings). Further, it would involve imposing upon the
pre-Act offender a pre-Act sentence at a time after Congress had specifically found in the Fair Sentencing Act
that such a sentence was unfairly long.
Finally, one cannot treat such problems as if they were
minor ones. Given the 5-year statute of limitations for
federal drug offenses, the 11-month median time between
