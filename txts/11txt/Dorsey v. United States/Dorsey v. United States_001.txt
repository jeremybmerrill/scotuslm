DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 11–5683. Argued April 17, 2012—Decided June 21, 2012*
Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986 Drug Act), the 5- and 10-year
mandatory minimum prison terms for federal drug crimes reflected a
100-to-1 disparity between the amounts of crack cocaine and powder
cocaine needed to trigger the minimums. Thus, the 5-year minimum
was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to distribute
5 grams of crack cocaine but 500 grams of powder, and the 10-year
minimum was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to
distribute 50 grams of crack but 5,000 grams of powder. The United
States Sentencing Commission—which is charged under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 with writing the Federal Sentencing Guidelines—incorporated the 1986 Drug Act’s 100-to-1 disparity into the
Guidelines because it believed that doing so was the best way to keep
similar drug-trafficking sentences proportional, thereby satisfying
the Sentencing Reform Act’s basic proportionality objective. The Fair
Sentencing Act, which took effect on August 3, 2010, reduced the disparity to 18-to-1, lowering the mandatory minimums applicable to
many crack offenders, by increasing the amount of crack needed to
trigger the 5-year minimum from 5 to 28 grams and the amount for
the 10-year minimum from 50 to 280 grams, while leaving the powder cocaine amounts intact. It also directed the Sentencing Commission to make conforming amendments to the Guidelines “as soon as
practicable” (but no later than 90 days after the Fair Sentencing Act’s
effective date). The new amendments became effective on November
1, 2010.
