DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

mandatory minimums apply to offenders whose unlawful
conduct took place before, but whose sentencing took place
after, the date that Act took effect, namely, August 3,
2010. Compare United States v. Douglas, 644 F. 3d 39,
42–44 (CA1 2011) (Act applies), and United States v.
Dixon, 648 F. 3d 195, 203 (CA3 2011) (same), with 635
F. 3d, at 339–340 (Act does not apply), United States v.
Sidney, 648 F. 3d 904, 910 (CA8 2011) (same), and
United States v. Tickles, 661 F. 3d 212, 215 (CA5 2011)
(per curiam) (same). In light of that disagreement, we
granted Hill’s and Dorsey’s petitions for certiorari. Since
petitioners and the Government both take the position
that the Fair Sentencing Act’s new minimums do apply
in these circumstances, we appointed as amicus curiae
Miguel Estrada to argue the contrary position. He has ably
discharged his responsibilities.

A

The timing issue before us is difficult in part because
relevant language in different statutes argues in opposite
directions. See Appendix A, infra. On the one hand, a
federal saving statute, Act of Feb. 25, 1871 (1871 Act), §4,
16 Stat. 432, phrased in general terms, provides that a
new criminal statute that “repeal[s]” an older criminal
statute shall not change the penalties “incurred” under
that older statute “unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide.” 1 U. S. C. §109. Case law makes clear
that the word “repeal” applies when a new statute simply
diminishes the penalties that the older statute set forth.
See Warden v. Marrero, 417 U. S. 653, 659–664 (1974); see
also United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 92 (1871). Case
law also makes clear that penalties are “incurred” under
the older statute when an offender becomes subject to
them, i.e., commits the underlying conduct that makes the
offender liable. See United States v. Reisinger, 128 U. S.
