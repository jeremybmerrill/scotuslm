DORSEY v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

more uniform, more proportionate sentences. Congress,
when enacting the Fair Sentencing Act, could not have
intended any such result.
Sixth, we have found no strong countervailing consideration. Amicus and the dissent argue that one might read
much of the statutory language we have discussed as
embodying exceptions, permitting the old 1986 Drug Act
minimums to apply to pre-Act offenders sentenced after
August 3, 2010, when the Fair Sentencing Act took effect.
The words “applicable law” in the new Act, for example,
could, linguistically speaking, encompass the 1986 Drug
Act minimums applied to those sentenced after August 3.
Post, at 4–6 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Moreover, Congress
could have insisted that the Commission write new Guidelines with special speed to assure itself that new, postAugust 3 offenders—but not old, pre-August 3 offenders—
would receive the benefit of the new Act. Post, at 6–8.
Further, amicus and the dissent note that to apply the
new Act’s minimums to the old, pre-August 3 offenders
will create a new disparity—one between pre-Act offenders
sentenced before August 3 and those sentenced after that
date. Post, at 9.
We do not believe that these arguments make a critical
difference. Even if the relevant statutory language can
be read as amicus and the dissent suggest and even if
Congress might have wanted Guidelines written speedily
simply in order to apply them quickly to new offenders,
there is scant indication that this is what Congress did
mean by the language in question nor that such was in
fact Congress’ motivation. The considerations we have set
forth, supra, at 13–17 and this page, strongly suggest the
contrary.
We also recognize that application of the new minimums
to pre-Act offenders sentenced after August 3 will create
a new set of disparities. But those disparities, reflecting a
line-drawing effort, will exist whenever Congress enacts a
