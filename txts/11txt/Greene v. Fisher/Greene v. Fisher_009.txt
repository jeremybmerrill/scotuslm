Opinion of the Court

habeas, he missed two opportunities to obtain relief under
Gray: After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed
his appeal, he did not file a petition for writ of certiorari
from this Court, which would almost certainly have produced a remand in light of the intervening Gray decision.
“Where intervening developments . . . reveal a reasonable
probability that the decision below rests upon a premise
that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity
for further consideration, and where it appears that such a
redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of
the litigation, [an order granting the petition, vacating the
judgment below, and remanding the case (GVR)] is, we
believe, potentially appropriate.” Lawrence v. Chater, 516
U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam). See, e.g., Stanbridge v.
New York, 395 U. S. 709 (1969) (per curiam) (GVR in light
of Bruton). Nor did Greene assert his Gray claim in a
petition for state postconviction relief. Having forgone two
obvious means of asserting his claim, Greene asks us to
provide him relief by interpreting AEDPA in a manner
contrary to both its text and our precedents. We decline to
do so, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
It is so ordered.
