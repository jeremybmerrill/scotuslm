GREENE v. FISHER
Opinion of the Court

reasonable determination of the facts in light of the
evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”
The issue here pertains to the first exception. We have
said that its standard of “contrary to, or involv[ing] an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal
law” is “difficult to meet,” because the purpose of AEDPA
is to ensure that federal habeas relief functions as a
“ ‘guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal
justice systems,’ ” and not as a means of error correction.
Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at
12–13) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332,
n. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)).
In light of that objective, and relying upon the text of
the provision, we held last Term, in Cullen v. Pinholster,
563 U. S. ___ (2011), that review under §2254(d)(1) is
limited to the record that was before the state court that
adjudicated the prisoner’s claim on the merits. We said
that the provision’s “backward-looking language requires
an examination of the state-court decision at the time it
was made.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). The reasoning of
Cullen determines the result here. As we explained,
§2254(d)(1) requires federal courts to “focu[s] on what a
state court knew and did,” and to measure state-court
decisions “against this Court’s precedents as of ‘the time
the state court renders its decision.’ ” Id., at __ (slip op., at
10) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71–72
(2003); emphasis added).
Greene resists that conclusion by appealing to our decision in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Teague held
that, with two exceptions not pertinent here, a prisoner
seeking federal habeas relief may rely on new constitutional rules of criminal procedure announced before the
prisoner’s conviction became final. Id., at 310 (plurality
opinion); see also Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313
(1989) (affirming and applying Teague rule). Finality
