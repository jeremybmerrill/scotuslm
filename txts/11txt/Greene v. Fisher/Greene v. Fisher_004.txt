GREENE v. FISHER
Opinion of the Court

hended, and two of them confessed to taking part in the
robbery. Greene did not confess, but he was implicated by
the others’ statements.
When the Commonwealth sought to try all of the coconspirators jointly, Greene sought severance, arguing,
inter alia, that the confessions of his nontestifying codefendants should not be introduced at his trial. The trial
court denied the motion to sever, but agreed to require
redaction of the confessions to eliminate proper names. As
redacted, the confessions replaced names with words like
“this guy,” “someone,” and “other guys,” or with the word
“blank,” or simply omitted the names without substitution.
A jury convicted Greene of second-degree murder, robbery, and conspiracy. He appealed to the Pennsylvania
Superior Court, arguing that severance of his trial was
demanded by the rule announced in Bruton v. United
States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), that the Confrontation Clause
forbids the prosecution to introduce a nontestifying codefendant’s confession implicating the defendant in the
crime. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the
conviction, holding that the redaction had cured any problem under Bruton.
Greene filed a petition for allowance of appeal to the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court, raising the same Bruton
claim. While that petition was pending, we held in Gray v.
Maryland, 523 U. S. 185, 195 (1998), that “considered as a
class, redactions that replace a proper name with an
obvious blank, the word ‘delete,’ a symbol, or similarly
notify the jury that a name has been deleted are similar
enough to Bruton’s unredacted confessions as to warrant
the same legal results.” The Pennsylvania Supreme Court
granted the petition for allowance of appeal, limited to the
question whether admission of the redacted confessions
violated Greene’s Sixth Amendment rights. After the
parties filed merits briefs, however, the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as improvidently
