Opinion of the Court

occurs when direct state appeals have been exhausted and
a petition for writ of certiorari from this Court has become
time barred or has been disposed of. Griffith v. Kentucky,
479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987). Greene contends that,
because finality marks the temporal cutoff for Teague
purposes, it must mark the temporal cutoff for “clearly
established Federal law” under AEDPA.
The analogy has been rejected by our cases. We have
explained that AEDPA did not codify Teague, and that
“the AEDPA and Teague inquiries are distinct.” Horn v.
Banks, 536 U. S. 266, 272 (2002) (per curiam). The retroactivity rules that govern federal habeas review on the
merits—which include Teague—are quite separate from
the relitigation bar imposed by AEDPA; neither abrogates
or qualifies the other. If §2254(d)(1) was, indeed, pegged
to Teague, it would authorize relief when a state-court
merits adjudication “resulted in a decision that became
contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly
established Federal law, before the conviction became
final.” The statute says no such thing, and we see no
reason why Teague should alter AEDPA’s plain meaning.*
Greene alternatively contends that the relevant “decision” to which the “clearly established Federal law” criterion must be applied is the decision of the state supreme
court that disposes of a direct appeal from a defendant’s
conviction or sentence, even when (as here) that decision
does not adjudicate the relevant claim on the merits. This
is an implausible reading of §2254(d)(1). The text, we
repeat, provides that habeas relief
——————
* Whether §2254(d)(1) would bar a federal habeas petitioner from
relying on a decision that came after the last state-court adjudication
on the merits, but fell within one of the exceptions recognized in
Teague, 489 U. S., at 311, is a question we need not address to resolve
this case.
