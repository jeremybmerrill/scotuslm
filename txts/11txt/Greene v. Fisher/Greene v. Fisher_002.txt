GREENE v. FISHER
Syllabus
Court’s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court adjudication on the merits. The Court’s decision last Term in Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, established that §2254(d)(1)’s “backwardlooking language requires an examination of the state-court decision
at the time it was made.” Id., at ___. As the Court explained in Cullen, §2254(d)(1) requires federal courts to measure state-court decisions “against this Court’s precedents as of ‘the time the state court
renders its decision.’ ” Id., at ___. That reasoning determines the result here. Pp. 3–6.
2. Because the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision—the last
state-court adjudication on the merits of Greene’s claim—predated
Gray by nearly three months, the Third Circuit correctly held that
Gray was not “clearly established Federal law” against which it could
measure the state-court decision. It therefore correctly concluded
that the state court’s decision neither was “contrary to,” nor “involved
an unreasonable application of,” any “clearly established Federal
law.” Pp. 6–7.

606 F. 3d 85, affirmed.
SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
