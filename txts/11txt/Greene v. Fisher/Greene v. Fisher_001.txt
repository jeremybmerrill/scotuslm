GREENE, AKA TRICE v. FISHER, SUPERINTENDENT,

STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT

SMITHFIELD, ET AL. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 10–637.

Argued October 11, 2011—Decided November 8, 2011

During petitioner Greene’s trial for murder, robbery, and conspiracy,
the prosecution introduced the redacted confessions of two of
Greene’s nontestifying codefendants. A jury convicted Greene. The
Pennsylvania Superior Court upheld the conviction, reasoning that
the rule announced in Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, did not
apply because the confessions were redacted to remove any specific

Supreme Court was pending, this Court announced in Gray v. Maryland, 523 U. S. 185, that Bruton does apply to some redacted confessions. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear Greene’s
appeal, and he then sought federal habeas relief. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal
court may not grant such relief to a state prisoner on any claim that
has been “adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings” unless that adjudication “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal
law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28
U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Here, the District Court concluded that, because
the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in Gray had not yet been
issued when the Pennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene’s
claim, the condition for granting habeas relief had not been met. The
Third Circuit affirmed.
Held:
1. Under §2254(d)(1), “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States” includes only this
