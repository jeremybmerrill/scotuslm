GREENE v. FISHER
Opinion of the Court

“shall not be granted with respect to any claim that
was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim . . . resulted
in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal
law . . . .” (Emphasis added.)
The words “the adjudication” in the “unless” clause obviously refer back to the “adjudicat[ion] on the merits,” and
the phrase “resulted in a decision” in the “unless” clause
obviously refers to the decision produced by that same
adjudication on the merits. A later affirmance of that
decision on alternative procedural grounds, for example,
would not be a decision resulting from the merits adjudication. And much less would be (what is at issue here)
a decision by the state supreme court not to hear the
appeal—that is, not to decide at all.

The Third Circuit held, and the parties do not dispute,
that the last state-court adjudication on the merits of
Greene’s Confrontation Clause claim occurred on direct

92, and n. 1. The Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision
predated our decision in Gray by nearly three months.
The Third Circuit thus correctly held that Gray was not
“clearly established Federal law” against which it could
measure the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision. 606
F. 3d, at 99. The panel then concluded (and the parties do
not dispute) that the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision neither was “contrary to,” nor “involved an unreasonable application of,” any “clearly established Federal law”
that existed at the time. Id., at 106. Consequently,
§2254(d)(1) bars the federal courts from granting Greene’s
application for a writ of habeas corpus.
We must observe that Greene’s predicament is an unusual one of his own creation. Before applying for federal
