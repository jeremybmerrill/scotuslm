granted.
Greene then filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, alleging, inter alia, that the introduction
of his nontestifying codefendants’ statements violated the
Confrontation Clause. Adopting the report and recommendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court denied the petition. It concluded that since our decision in

Pennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene’s Confrontation Clause claim, that court’s decision was not
“contrary to,” or “an unreasonable application of, clearly
established Federal law.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).
A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit affirmed. Greene v. Palakovich, 606
F. 3d 85 (2010). The majority held that the “clearly established Federal law” referred to in §2254(d)(1) is the law at
the time of the state-court adjudication on the merits. Id.,
at 99. The dissenting judge contended that it is the law at
the time the conviction becomes final. Id., at 108. We
granted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).

Court of the United States; or
