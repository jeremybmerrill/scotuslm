GINSBURG, J., dissenting

self-care provision—which men no doubt would use—
would counter employers’ impressions that the FMLA
would otherwise install female leave. Providing for selfcare would thus reduce employers’ corresponding incentive
to discriminate against women in hiring and promotion.
In other words, “[t]he availability of self-care leave to men
serves to blunt the force of stereotypes of women as primary caregivers by increasing the odds that men and women
will invoke the FMLA’s leave provisions in near-equal
numbers.” See Brief for National Partnership for Women
& Families et al. as Amici Curiae 26. As Judge Lipez
explained:
“If Congress had drawn a line at leave for caring for
other family members, there is greater likelihood that
the FMLA would have been perceived as further reason to avoid granting employment opportunities to
women. Heretofore, women have provided most of the
child and elder care, and legislation that focused on
these duties could have had a deleterious impact because of the prevalent notion that women take more
advantage of such leave policies. The inclusion of personal medical leave in the scheme, unrelated to any
need to care for another person, undermines the assumption that women are the only ones taking leave
because men, presumably, are as likely as women to
get sick.” Laro v. New Hampshire, 259 F. 3d 1, 21
(CA1 2001) (dissenting opinion).
Senator Barbara Boxer advanced a similar point. Responding to assertions that the FMLA would lead employers to discriminate against women, Senator Boxer stated:
“[T]o say that women will not be hired by business is a
specious argument . . . . Men also get sick. They get
cancer. They get heart disease. They have ailments. And
this bill applies to men and women.” 139 Cong. Rec. 1697
(1993). See also 1987 Senate Hearings, pt. 2, p. 536 (“I
