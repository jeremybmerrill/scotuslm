Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

ment of both the “ ‘evil’ or ‘wrong’ that Congress intended
to remedy,” ibid., and the means Congress adopted to
address that evil, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S.
507, 520 (1997). Legislation enacted under §5 must be
targeted at “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth
Amendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid,
supra, at 639; see Kimel, supra, at 88; City of Boerne,
521 U. S., at 525. And “[t]here must be a congruence
and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or
remedied and the means adopted to that end.” Id., at 520.
Under this analysis Hibbs permitted employees to recover damages from States for violations of subparagraph
(C). In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied upon evidence
of a well-documented pattern of sex-based discrimination
in family-leave policies. States had facially discriminatory
leave policies that granted longer periods of leave to women than to men. 538 U. S., at 730–731. States also administered facially neutral family-leave policies in genderbiased ways. Id., at 732. These practices reflected what
Congress found to be a “pervasive sex-role stereotype that
caring for family members is women’s work,” id., at 731,
a stereotype to which even this Court had succumbed in
earlier times, id., at 729. Faced with “the States’ record of
unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, genderbased discrimination in the administration of leave benefits,” Hibbs concluded that requiring state employers to
give all employees the opportunity to take family-care
leave was “narrowly targeted at the faultline between
work and family—precisely where sex-based overgeneralization has been and remains strongest.” Id., at 735, 738.
B
The same cannot be said for requiring the States to give
all employees the opportunity to take self-care leave.
Petitioner advances three arguments for allowing employees to recover damages from States that violate the
