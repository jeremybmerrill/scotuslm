COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

mon v. Texas, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5) (“A
State . . . may choose to waive its immunity in federal
court at its pleasure”). Discrimination against women is
contrary to the public policy of the State of Maryland, see,
e.g., Maryland’s Fair Employment Practices Act, Md. State
Govt. Code Ann. §20–606 (Lexis 2009), and the State has
conceded that the Act is good social policy, see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 35. If the State agrees with petitioner that damages
liability for violations of the self-care provision is necessary to combat discrimination against women, the State
may waive its immunity or create a parallel state law
cause of action.

As a consequence of our constitutional design, money
damages are the exception when sovereigns are defendants. See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.
Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 29 (1981). Subjecting States to
suits for damages pursuant to §5 requires more than a
theory for why abrogating the States’ immunity aids in, or
advances, a stated congressional purpose. To abrogate the
States’ immunity from suits for damages under §5, Congress must identify a pattern of constitutional violations
and tailor a remedy congruent and proportional to the
documented violations. It failed to do so when it allowed
employees to sue States for violations of the FMLA’s selfcare provision. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
affirmed.
It is so ordered.
