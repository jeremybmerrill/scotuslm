DANIEL COLEMAN, PETITIONER v. COURT OF

APPEALS OF MARYLAND ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[March 20, 2012]


JUSTICE KENNEDY announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE ALITO joined.
The question in this case is whether a state employee
is allowed to recover damages from the state entity that
employs him by invoking one of the provisions of a federal
statute that, in express terms, seeks to abrogate the
States’ immunity from suits for damages. The statute in
question is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107
Stat. 6, 29 U. S. C. §2601 et seq. The provision at issue
requires employers, including state employers, to grant
unpaid leave for self care for a serious medical condition,
provided other statutory requisites are met, particularly
requirements that the total amount of annual leave taken
under all the Act’s provisions does not exceed a stated
maximum. §2612(a)(1)(d). In agreement with every Court
of Appeals to have addressed this question, this Court now
holds that suits against States under this provision are
barred by the States’ immunity as sovereigns in our federal system. See 626 F. 3d 187 (CA4 2010) (case below);
Nelson v. University of Tex., 535 F. 3d 318 (CA5 2008);
