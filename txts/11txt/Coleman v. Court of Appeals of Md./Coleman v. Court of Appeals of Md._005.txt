A

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA or
Act) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 work
weeks of unpaid leave per year. An employee may take
leave under the FMLA for: (A) “the birth of a son or
daughter . . . in order to care for such son or daughter,” (B)
the adoption or foster-care placement of a child with the
employee, (C) the care of a “spouse . . . son, daughter, or
parent” with “a serious health condition,” and (D) the
employee’s own serious health condition when the condition interferes with the employee’s ability to perform at
work. 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1). The Act creates a private
right of action to seek both equitable relief and money
damages “against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction.” §2617(a)(2). As noted, subparagraph (D) is at issue
here.
This Court considered subparagraph (C) in Nevada
Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003).
Subparagraph (C), like (A) and (B), grants leave for reasons related to family care, and those three provisions are
referred to here as the family-care provisions. Hibbs held
that Congress could subject the States to suit for violations of subparagraph (C), §2612(a)(1)(C). That holding
rested on evidence that States had family-leave policies
that differentiated on the basis of sex and that States
administered even neutral family-leave policies in ways
