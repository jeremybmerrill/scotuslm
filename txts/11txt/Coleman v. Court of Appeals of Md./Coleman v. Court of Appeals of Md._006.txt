Petitioner Daniel Coleman was employed by the Court
of Appeals of the State of Maryland. When Coleman
requested sick leave, he was informed he would be terminated if he did not resign. Coleman then sued the state
court in the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland, alleging, inter alia, that his employer violated

any pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of
States. 626 F. 3d 187. Certiorari was granted. 564 U. S.
