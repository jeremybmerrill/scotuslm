GINSBURG, J., dissenting

pregnant women gives employers an economic incentive to
discriminate against women in hiring policies; legislation
helping all workers equally does not have this effect.”). In
view of this history, it is impossible to conclude that “nothing in particular about self-care leave . . . connects it to
gender discrimination.” Ante, at 10.

Boerne next asks “whether Congress had evidence of
a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the
States.” Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 729. See also Boerne, 521

2, supra, at 4, n. 2, the Act is fairly described as a necessary, but not a sufficient measure. FMLA hearings
conducted between 1986 and 1993 included illustrative testimony from women fired after becoming pregnant or giving

her return to work, a superior informed her that her job
had been eliminated. He stated: “Beverly, the best thing
for you to do is stay home and take care of your baby and
collect your unemployment.” Hearing on H. R. 770 before
the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations of the
House Committee on Education and Labor, 101st Cong.,
1st Sess., 12 (1989) (hereinafter 1989 House Hearing)
(statement of Beverly Wilkenson). See also S. Rep. No.
102–68, p. 27 (1991) (hereinafter 1991 Senate Report)
(describing Ms. Wilkenson’s testimony). Similarly, Linda
Pillsbury was notified that she no longer had a job three
