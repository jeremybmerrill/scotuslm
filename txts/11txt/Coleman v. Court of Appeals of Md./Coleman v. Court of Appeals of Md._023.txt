GINSBURG, J., dissenting

See Ross, Legal Aspects of Parental Leave, in Parental
Leave and Child Care 97 (J. Hyde & M. Essex eds. 1991)
(hereinafter Ross). Then-Congressman Berman met with
the Women’s Legal Defense Fund’s Donna Lenhoff, a
drafter of the first FMLA bill. Id., at 114–115, n. 27;
Wisensale 136.3 They agreed that any national bill would
focus not only on pregnancy, but on equal treatment for all
workers. Ross 114–115, n. 27. See also Kazmier v. Widmann, 225 F. 3d 519, 547 (CA5 2000) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (“Perceiving that enacting the PDA had not achieved

(2001). She was later named Vice Chair of the Commission on Leave,
created by the FMLA to study family and medical leave policies. See 29
U. S. C. §§2631–2632; U. S. Commission on Family and Medical Leave,
A Workable Balance: Report to Congress on Family and Medical Leave
Policies 210 (Apr. 30, 1996).
4 For example, in addition to mandating pregnancy leave, the California statute allowed employers to discriminate against pregnant workers. Employers could refuse to select a pregnant woman for a training
program if she would not finish the program at least three months
before giving birth. See 1978 Cal. Stats. ch. 1321, §1. The law limited
pregnancy disability leave to six weeks, §1, and provided that women
were to receive paid disability benefits for only three weeks after
childbirth, §2, even if a particular woman remained disabled beyond
the three-week period, and even if a man received paid disability
benefits throughout his disability. Finally, although it prohibited
