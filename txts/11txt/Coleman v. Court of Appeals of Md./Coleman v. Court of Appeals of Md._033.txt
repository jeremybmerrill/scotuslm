GINSBURG, J., dissenting

tion addressing the needs of pregnant women only
might encourage discriminatory hiring practices
against women of child bearing age. Legislation addressing the needs of all workers equally does not
have this effect. By addressing the serious leave
needs of all employees, the FMLA avoids providing
employers the temptation to discriminate [against
women].

“The legislation is [thus] based not only on the Commerce Clause, but also on the guarantees of equal protection . . . embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment.”
H. R. Rep. No. 102–135, pt. 1, pp. 27–28 (1991) (hereinafter 1991 House Report).
Congress’ concern was solidly grounded in workplace
realities. After this Court upheld California’s pregnancyonly leave policy in California Fed., Don Butler, President

women in hiring and hire males instead.” 1987 House
Hearing 36. Totenberg replied, “But that is illegal, too”—
to which Butler responded, “Well, that is illegal, but try to
prove it.” Ibid.
Finally, as in Hibbs, it is important to note the moderate

requirement. See 538 U. S., at 738–739. FMLA leave is
unpaid. It is limited to employees who have worked
at least one year for the employer and at least 1,250
hours during the past year. §§2611(2)(A), 2612(c)(1).
High-ranking employees, including state elected officials
and their staffs, are not within the Act’s compass.

notice of foreseeable leaves. §2612(e). Employers may
