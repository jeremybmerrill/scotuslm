GINSBURG, J., dissenting

exclude anyone from benefit eligibility because of gender but merely removes one physical condition—
pregnancy—from the list of compensable disabilities. While it is true that only women can become

classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based
classification . . . .
“The lack of identity between the excluded disability
and gender as such under this insurance program

classification . . . .”).
This reality is well illustrated by the facts of Aiello. The
California disability-insurance program at issue granted
disability benefits for virtually any conceivable work
disability, including those arising from cosmetic surgery,
