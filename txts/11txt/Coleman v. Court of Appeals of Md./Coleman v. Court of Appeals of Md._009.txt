COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

FMLA’s self-care provision: The self-care provision standing alone addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyping; the provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care
provision sustained in Hibbs; and the provision eases the
burden on single parents. But what the family-care provisions have to support them, the self-care provision lacks,
namely evidence of a pattern of state constitutional violations accompanied by a remedy drawn in narrow terms to
address or prevent those violations.

Standing alone, the self-care provision is not a valid
abrogation of the States’ immunity from suit. When the
FMLA was enacted, “ninety-five percent of full-time stateand local-government employees were covered by paid sick
leave plans and ninety-six percent of such employees
likewise enjoyed short-term disability protection.” Brief
for States of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 13–14 (hereinafter Texas Brief) (citing Bureau of Labor Statistics, U. S.
Dept. of Labor, Employee Benefits in State and Local
Governments 17–26 (1994) (hereinafter BLS Rept.)). The
evidence did not suggest States had facially discriminatory
self-care leave policies or that they administered neutral
self-care leave policies in a discriminatory way. And there
is scant evidence in the legislative history of a purported
stereotype harbored by employers that women take selfcare leave more often than men. Congress considered
evidence that “men and women are out on medical leave
approximately equally.” H. R. Rep. No. 101–28, pt. 1, p.
15 (1989) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). Nothing in the record
shows employers formulated self-care leave policies based
on a contrary view.
Without widespread evidence of sex discrimination or
sex stereotyping in the administration of sick leave, it is
apparent that the congressional purpose in enacting the
self-care provision is unrelated to these supposed wrongs.
