leave); 139 Cong. Rec. 1826 (1993) (remarks of Sen. Edward Kennedy) (“[W]omen who are pregnant are discriminated against as a general rule in our society and have
difficulty retaining their jobs.”). As summarized by the
American Bar Association:
“Historically, denial or curtailment of women’s employment opportunities has been traceable directly to
the pervasive presumption that women are mothers
first, and workers second. This prevailing ideology
about women’s roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or mothersto-be.” 1989 House Hearing 248 (American Bar
Association Background Report). See also Hibbs, 538
U. S., at 736 (quoting same language).
“Many pregnant women have been fired when their employer refused to provide an adequate leave of absence,”
Congress had ample cause to conclude. See H. R. Rep. No.
99–699, pt. 2, p. 22 (1986). Pregnancy, Congress also

year after childbirth, mothers’ earnings fell to $1.40 per

See 1991 Senate Report 28. See also 1989 House Hearing
356–357 (Report of 9to5, National Association of Working
Women (citing same study)).
Congress heard evidence tying this pattern of discrimination to the States. A 50-state survey by the Yale Bush
Center Infant Care Leave Project concluded that “[t]he
proportion and construction of leave policies available to
public sector employees differs little from those offered
private sector employees.” Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 730, n. 3
(quoting 1986 House Hearing 33 (statement of Meryl
Frank)). Roughly 28% of women employed in the public
sector did not receive eight weeks of job-protected medical
leave to recover from childbirth. See 1987 Senate Hearings, pt. 1, pp. 31, 35, 39 (statement of James T. Bond,
