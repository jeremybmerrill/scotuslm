basis of disability or age as long as the classification is
rationally related to a legitimate state interest. See Garrett, 531 U. S., at 366–367; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 83–84.
Therefore, for the statutes to be responsive to or designed
to prevent unconstitutional discrimination, Congress
needed to rely on a pattern of irrational state discrimination on the basis of disability or age. See Garrett, 531
U. S., at 368; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 89. Here, however,
Congress homed in on gender discrimination, which triggers heightened review. See United States v. Virginia, 518
U. S. 515, 531 (1996) (“Parties who seek to defend genderbased government action must demonstrate an exceedingly persuasive justification for that action.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). “[I]t was [therefore] easier for
Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations.”
Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 736.
Finally, the plurality’s opinion does not authorize state
employers to violate the FMLA, although it does block
injured employees from suing for monetary relief. The
self-care provision remains valid Commerce Clause legislation, Maryland concedes, and consequently binds the

Brief for Respondents 32–33. An employee wrongly denied
self-care leave, Maryland also acknowledges, may, pursuant to Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), seek injunctive relief against the responsible state official. See Brief
for Respondents 33. Moreover, the U. S. Department of
Labor may bring an action against a state for violating the
self-care provision and may recover monetary relief on an
employee’s behalf. 29 U. S. C. §§2617(b)(2)–(3), (d).

The plurality pays scant attention to the overarching
aim of the FMLA: to make it feasible for women to work
while sustaining family life. Over the course of eight
years, Congress considered the problem of workplace
