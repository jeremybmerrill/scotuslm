COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.

state legislator testified: “[I]n South Carolina, as well as in

discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not discrimination on the basis of sex. In my view, this case is a fit
occasion to revisit that conclusion. Footnote 20 reads:
“The dissenting opinion to the contrary, this case is
. . . a far cry from cases like Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71
(1971), and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677
(1973), involving discrimination based upon gender as
such. The California insurance program does not
