COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

§2612(a)(1).
Even accepting this Court’s view of the scope of Congress’ power under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, I
would hold that the self-care provision, §2612(a)(1)(D),
validly enforces the right to be free from gender discrimination in the workplace.1
I
Section 5 legislation “must be targeted at conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive provisions,” ante, at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted),
“[a]nd ‘[t]here must be a congruence and proportionality
between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the
means adopted to that end.’ ” Ibid. (quoting City of Boerne
v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 520 (1997)). The first step of the
now-familiar Boerne inquiry calls for identification of the
constitutional right Congress sought to enforce. See, e.g.,
Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U. S. 509, 522 (2004). The FMLA’s
self-care provision, Maryland asserts, trains not on the
right to be free from gender discrimination, but on an
“equal protection right to be free from irrational state
employment discrimination based on a medical condition.”

declaring, the plurality undervalues the language, pur——————

remain of the view that Congress can abrogate state sovereign
immunity pursuant to its Article I Commerce Clause power. See
Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 100 (1996) (Souter, J.,
dissenting). Beyond debate, 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1)(D) is valid Commerce Clause legislation. See infra, at 21. I also share the view that
Congress can abrogate state immunity pursuant to §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment where Congress could reasonably conclude that
legislation “constitutes an appropriate way to enforce [a] basic equal
protection requirement.” Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,
531 U. S. 356, 377 (2001) (BREYER, J., dissenting) (internal quotation
marks omitted).
