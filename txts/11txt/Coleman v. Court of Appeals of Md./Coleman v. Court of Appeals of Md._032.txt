COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

men from the workplace.” Id., at 738.
The plurality’s statement that Congress lacked “widespread evidence of sex discrimination . . . in the administration of sick leave,” ante, at 6, misses the point. So too
does the plurality’s observation that state employees likely
“could take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses”—
presumably severe morning sickness, toxemia, etc.—under
paid sick-leave plans, ante, at 7. Congress heard evidence

“The FMLA addresses the basic leave needs of all
employees. . . . This is an important principle reflected
in the bill.
“A law providing special protection to women . . . ,
in addition to being inequitable, runs the risk of causing discriminatory treatment. Employers might be
less inclined to hire women . . . . For example, legisla-
