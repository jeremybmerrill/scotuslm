COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

principle, Congress may abrogate the States’ immunity
from suit pursuant to its powers under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427
U. S. 445 (1976).
Congress must “mak[e] its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.” Hibbs, 538
U. S., at 726. On this point the Act does express the clear
purpose to abrogate the States’ immunity. Ibid. (“The
clarity of Congress’ intent” to abrogate the States’ immunity from suits for damages under the FMLA “is not fairly
debatable”). Congress subjected any “public agency” to
suit under the FMLA, 29 U. S. C. §2617(a)(2), and a “public agency” is defined to include both “the government of
a State or political subdivision thereof ” and “any agency of
. . . a State, or a political subdivision of a State,” §§203(x),
2611(4)(A)(iii).
The question then becomes whether the self-care provision and its attempt to abrogate the States’ immunity are
a valid exercise of congressional power under §5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Section 5 grants Congress the
power “to enforce” the substantive guarantees of §1 of
the Amendment by “appropriate legislation.” The power
to enforce “ ‘includes the authority both to remedy and to
deter violation[s] of rights guaranteed’ ” by §1. See Board
of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 365
(2001) (quoting Kimel, supra, at 81). To ensure Congress’
enforcement powers under §5 remain enforcement powers,
as envisioned by the ratifiers of the Amendment, rather
than powers to redefine the substantive scope of §1, Congress “must tailor” legislation enacted under §5 “ ‘to remedy or prevent’ ” “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth
Amendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid
Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank,
527 U. S. 627, 639 (1999).
Whether a congressional Act passed under §5 can impose monetary liability upon States requires an assess-
