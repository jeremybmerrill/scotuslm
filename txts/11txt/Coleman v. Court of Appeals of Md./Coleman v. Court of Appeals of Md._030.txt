COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

skiing accidents, and alcoholism. See Brief for EEOC as
Amicus Curiae in Aiello, O. T. 1973, No. 73–640, p. 7. It
also compensated men for disabilities caused by ailments
and procedures that affected men alone: for example,
vasectomies, circumcision, and prostatectomies. See Brief
for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae
in id., at 17–18. Only pregnancy was excluded from the
definition of disability. See Cal. Un. Ins. Code Ann. §2626
(West 1972); Aiello, 417 U. S., at 489. As Justice Brennan
insightfully concluded in dissent, “a limitation is imposed
upon the disabilities for which women workers may recover, while men receive full compensation for all disabilities suffered . . . . Such dissimilar treatment of men and
women, on the basis of physical characteristics inextricably
linked to one sex, inevitably constitutes sex discrimination.” Id., at 501.
Second, pregnancy provided a central justification for
the historic discrimination against women this Court
chronicled in Hibbs. See 538 U. S., at 729 (“[A] proper
discharge of [a woman’s] maternal functions—having in
view not merely her own health, but the well-being of the
race—justif[ies] legislation to protect her from the greed
as well as the passion of man.” (quoting Muller v. Oregon,
208 U. S. 412, 422 (1908); 2d and 3d alterations in Hibbs)).
See also Siegel, Employment Equality Under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, 94 Yale L. J. 929, 942
(1985) (Pregnancy “is a biological difference central to the
definition of gender roles, one traditionally believed to
render women unfit for employment.”). Relatedly, discrimination against pregnant employees was often “based
not on the pregnancy itself but on predictions concerning
the future behavior of the pregnant woman when her child
was born or on views about what her behavior should be.”
