COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

just think it’s wrong that there will be a perception that
this is something that only women will take and they are,
therefore, more expensive. Both men and women have

Ross, Georgetown University Law Center)).
The plurality therefore gets it wrong in concluding that
“[o]nly supposition and conjecture support the contention
that the self-care provision is necessary to make the familycare provisions effective.” Ante, at 9. Self-care leave, I

perceived incentive to avoid hiring women, §2612(a)(1)(D)
lessens the risk that the FMLA as a whole would give rise
to the very sex discrimination it was enacted to thwart.
The plurality offers no legitimate ground to dilute the

and Kimel, 528 U. S. 62. In those cases, as we observed in
Hibbs, we reviewed statutes targeting disability and age
discrimination, respectively. Neither disability nor age is
a suspect classification under this Court’s Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence; States may discriminate on the
