COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

require a doctor’s certification of a serious health condition. §2613(a). And, if an employer violates the FMLA,
the employees’ recoverable damages are “strictly defined
and measured by actual monetary losses.” Hibbs, 538
U. S., at 740 (citing §§2617(a)(1)(A)(i)–(iii)). The self-care
provision, I would therefore hold, is congruent and proportional to the injury to be prevented.

But even if Aiello senselessly holds sway, and impedes
the conclusion that §2612(a)(1)(D) is an appropriate response to the States’ unconstitutional discrimination
against pregnant women,6 I would nevertheless conclude
that the FMLA is valid §5 legislation. For it is a meet
response to “the States’ record of unconstitutional partici——————

the plurality does not cite or discuss Geduldig v. Aiello, 417
U. S. 484 (1974), perhaps embarrassed by that opinion’s widely criticized conclusion that discrimination based on pregnancy does not
involve “discrimination based upon gender as such,” id., at 496, n. 20.
See supra, at 10–13; E. Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law 759 (3d ed.
2006) (“It is hard to imagine a clearer sex-based distinction” than
the one at issue in Aiello); Kay, Equality and Difference: The Case of
Pregnancy, 1 Berkeley Women’s L. J. 1, 31 (1985) (“[Aiello] results in
unequal treatment of similarly situated women and men who have
engaged respectively in reproductive conduct [and wish to continue
working]. It should be overruled.”); Law, Rethinking Sex and the
Constitution, 132 U. Pa. L. Rev. 955, 983–984 (1984) (“Criticizing
[Aiello] has . . . become a cottage industry. Over two dozen law review
articles have condemned both the Court’s approach and the result. . . .
Even the principal scholarly defense of [Aiello] admits that the Court
was wrong in refusing to recognize that the classification was sex-based
. . . .”); Karst, The Supreme Court 1976 Term Foreword: Equal Citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment, 91 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 54, n. 304
(1977) (“[T]he constitutional sport of [Aiello] and last Term’s even sillier
statutory counterpart, General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125 (1976),
with their Alice-in-Wonderland view of pregnancy as a sex-neutral
phenomenon, are good candidates for early retirement. These decisions
are textbook examples of the effects of underrepresentation on “legislative” insensitivity. Imagine what the presence of even one woman
Justice would have meant to the Court’s conferences.”).
