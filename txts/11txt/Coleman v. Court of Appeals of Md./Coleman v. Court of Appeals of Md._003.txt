Syllabus
single parents happen to be women demonstrates, at most, that the
self-care provision was directed at remedying neutral leave restrictions that have a disparate effect on women.
However,
“[a]lthough disparate impact may be relevant evidence of . . . discrimination . . . such evidence is insufficient [to prove a constitutional
violation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.” Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,
531 U. S. 356, 373. Because it is unlikely that many of the neutral
leave policies affected by the self-care provision are unconstitutional,
the scope of the self-care provision is out of proportion to its supposed
remedial or preventive objectives. Pp. 11−12.
JUSTICE SCALIA adhered to his view that the Court should abandon
the “congruence and proportionality” approach in favor of one that is
properly tied to the text of §5, which grants Congress the power “to
enforce, by appropriate legislation,” the other provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Outside the context of racial discrimination,
Congress’s §5 power should be limited to the regulation of conduct
that itself violates the Fourteenth Amendment and thus would not
reach a State’s failure to grant self-care leave to its employees.
Pp. 1−2.
