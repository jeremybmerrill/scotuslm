COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

discrimination against women, and devised the FMLA to
reduce sex-based inequalities in leave programs. Essential to its design, Congress assiduously avoided a legislative package that, overall, was or would be seen as geared
to women only. Congress thereby reduced employers’
incentives to prefer men over women, advanced women’s
economic opportunities, and laid the foundation for a more
egalitarian relationship at home and at work. The selfcare provision is a key part of that endeavor, and, in my
view, a valid exercise of congressional power under §5 of
the Fourteenth Amendment. I would therefore reverse the
judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit.
