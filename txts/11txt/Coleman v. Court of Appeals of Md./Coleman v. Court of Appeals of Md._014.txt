Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

and, we must assume, a still prevalent wrong. An explicit
purpose of the Congress in adopting the FMLA was to
improve workplace conditions for women. See 29 U. S. C.
§§2601(b)(4), (5). But States may not be subject to suits
for damages based on violations of a comprehensive statute unless Congress has identified a specific pattern of
constitutional violations by state employers. See City of
Boerne, 521 U. S., at 532.

The petitioner’s last defense of the self-care provision is
that the provision helps single parents retain their jobs
when they become ill. This, however, does not explain
how the provision remedies or prevents constitutional
violations. The fact that most single parents happen to be
women, see, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 7, demonstrates, at
most, that the self-care provision was directed at remedying employers’ neutral leave restrictions which have a
disparate effect on women. “Although disparate impact
may be relevant evidence of . . . discrimination . . . such
evidence alone is insufficient [to prove a constitutional
violation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects
state action to strict scrutiny.” Garrett, supra, at 372–373;
see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U. S. 53, 82–83 (2001)
(O’Connor, J., dissenting); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S.
229, 239 (1976). To the extent, then, that the self-care
provision addresses neutral leave policies with a disparate
impact on women, it is not directed at a pattern of constitutional violations. Because, moreover, it is “unlikely that
many of the [neutral leave policies] . . . affected by” the
self-care provision are unconstitutional, “the scope of the
[self-care provision is] out of proportion to its supposed
remedial or preventive objectives.” Kimel, supra, at 82;
see City of Boerne, supra, at 519.
Of course, a State need not assert its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suits for damages. See, e.g., Sossa-
