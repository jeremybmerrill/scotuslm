COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

(2001) (hereinafter Wisensale). California’s law, enacted
in 1978, made it unlawful for an employer to refuse to
grant female employees disabled by pregnancy or childbirth up to four months’ unpaid, job-protected leave. See
1978 Cal. Stats. ch. 1321, §1, now codified at Cal. Govt.
Code Ann. §12945(a)(1) (West Supp. 2012).
The California law sharply divided women’s rights advocates. “Equal-treatment” feminists asserted it violated
the Pregnancy Discrimination Act’s (PDA) commitment
to treating pregnancy the same as other disabilities.2 It
did so by requiring leave only for disability caused by
pregnancy and childbirth, thereby treating pregnancy as
sui generis. See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union
et al. as Amici Curiae in California Fed., O. T. 1985,
No. 85–494, pp. 5–10. “Equal-opportunity” feminists disagreed, urging that the California law was consistent with
the PDA because it remedied the discriminatory burden
that inadequate leave policies placed on a woman’s right
to procreate. See Brief for Coalition for Reproductive
Equality in the Workplace et al. as Amici Curiae in id.,
at 2–6. See also Williams, Equality’s Riddle: Pregnancy
and the Equal Treatment/Special Treatment Debate, 13
N. Y. U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 325, 326–328 (1984–1985)
(hereinafter Williams) (discussing disagreement).
While California Fed. moved through the lower federal
courts, equal-treatment feminists began work on a genderneutral leave model, which eventually became the FMLA.
