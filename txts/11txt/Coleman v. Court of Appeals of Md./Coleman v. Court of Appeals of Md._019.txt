DANIEL COLEMAN, PETITIONER v. COURT OF

APPEALS OF MARYLAND ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[March 20, 2012]


JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
and with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and JUSTICE KAGAN
join as to all but footnote 1, dissenting.
Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: “No
State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws.” Section 5 grants Congress the “power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the
provisions of this article.” Congress’ §5 enforcement power
includes the authority to remedy and deter violations of
§1’s substantive guarantees by prohibiting conduct “not
itself forbidden by the Amendment’s text.” Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 81 (2000). “In other
words, Congress may enact so-called prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduct,
in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct.”
Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721,
727–728 (2003).
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA or
Act) entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of job-secured
leave during any 12-month period: (A) to care for a newborn son or daughter; (B) to care for a newly adopted son
or daughter; (C) to care for a spouse, child, or parent with
a serious health condition; or (D) because the employee
has a serious health condition that makes her unable
to perform the functions of her position. 29 U. S. C.
