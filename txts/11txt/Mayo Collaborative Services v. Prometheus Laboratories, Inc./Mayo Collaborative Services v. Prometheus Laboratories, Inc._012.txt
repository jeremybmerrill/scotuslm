MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS 

LABORATORIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court 


nonetheless led to the “clear and compelling conclusion . . .
that the . . . claims . . . do not encompass laws of nature or
preempt natural correlations.” 628 F. 3d 1347, 1355
(2010). Mayo again filed a petition for certiorari, which we
granted.
II
Prometheus’ patents set forth laws of nature—namely,
relationships between concentrations of certain metabo­
lites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a
thiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm.
Claim 1, for example, states that if the levels of 6–TG in
the blood (of a patient who has taken a dose of a thiopu­
rine drug) exceed about 400 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells,
then the administered dose is likely to produce toxic side
effects. While it takes a human action (the administration
of a thiopurine drug) to trigger a manifestation of this
relation in a particular person, the relation itself exists in
principle apart from any human action. The relation is a
consequence of the ways in which thiopurine compounds
are metabolized by the body—entirely natural processes.
And so a patent that simply describes that relation sets
forth a natural law.
The question before us is whether the claims do signifi­
cantly more than simply describe these natural relations.
To put the matter more precisely, do the patent claims add
enough to their statements of the correlations to allow the
processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible pro­
cesses that apply natural laws? We believe that the an­
swer to this question is no.
A
If a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a
process reciting a law of nature, unless that process has
additional features that provide practical assurance that
the process is more than a drafting effort designed to
