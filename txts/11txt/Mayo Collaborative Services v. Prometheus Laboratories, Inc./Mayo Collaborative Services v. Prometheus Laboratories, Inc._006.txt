MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS 

LABORATORIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court 


not patent his celebrated law that E=mc2; nor could New­
ton have patented the law of gravity. Such discoveries are
‘manifestations of . . . nature, free to all men and reserved
exclusively to none.’ ” Chakrabarty, supra, at 309 (quoting
Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S.
127, 130 (1948)).
“Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental
processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not pa­
tentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and tech­
nological work.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67
(1972). And monopolization of those tools through the
grant of a patent might tend to impede innovation more
than it would tend to promote it.
The Court has recognized, however, that too broad an
interpretation of this exclusionary principle could eviscer­
ate patent law. For all inventions at some level embody,
use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural
phenomena, or abstract ideas. Thus, in Diehr the Court
pointed out that “ ‘a process is not unpatentable simply
because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical
algorithm.’ ” 450 U. S., at 187 (quoting Parker v. Flook,
437 U. S. 584, 590 (1978)). It added that “an application
of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known
structure or process may well be deserving of patent pro­
tection.” Diehr, supra, at 187. And it emphasized Justice
Stone’s similar observation in Mackay Radio & Telegraph
Co. v. Radio Corp. of America, 306 U. S. 86 (1939):
“ ‘While a scientific truth, or the mathematical ex­
pression of it, is not a patentable invention, a novel
and useful structure created with the aid of
knowledge of scientific truth may be.’ ” 450 U. S., at
188 (quoting Mackay Radio, supra, at 94).

invention from [a discovery of a law of nature], it must
come from the application of the law of nature to a new
