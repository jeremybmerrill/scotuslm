MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS 

LABORATORIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court 


at 14) (“[T]he prohibition against patenting abstract ideas
‘cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of
the formula to a particular technological environment’ or
adding ‘insignificant postsolution activity’ ” (quoting Diehr,
supra, at 191–192)).
We find that the process claims at issue here do not
satisfy these conditions. In particular, the steps in the
claimed processes (apart from the natural laws them­
selves) involve well-understood, routine, conventional
activity previously engaged in by researchers in the field.
At the same time, upholding the patents would risk dis­
proportionately tying up the use of the underlying natural laws, inhibiting their use in the making of further
discoveries.

A

The patents before us concern the use of thiopurine
drugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. When a patient
ingests a thiopurine compound, his body metabolizes the
drug, causing metabolites to form in his bloodstream.
Because the way in which people metabolize thiopurine
compounds varies, the same dose of a thiopurine drug
affects different people differently, and it has been difficult
for doctors to determine whether for a particular patient a
given dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too
low, and so likely ineffective.
At the time the discoveries embodied in the patents
were made, scientists already understood that the levels
in a patient’s blood of certain metabolites, including, in
particular, 6-thioguanine and its nucleotides (6–TG) and
6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6–MMP), were correlated with
the likelihood that a particular dosage of a thiopurine
drug could cause harm or prove ineffective. See U. S.
