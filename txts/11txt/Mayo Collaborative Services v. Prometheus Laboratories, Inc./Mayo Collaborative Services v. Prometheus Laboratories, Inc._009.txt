Opinion of the Court

ous studies suggested that measurement of 6–MP metabo­
lite levels can be used to predict clinical efficacy and tolerance to azathioprine or 6–MP” (citing Cuffari, Théorêt,
Latour, & Seidman, 6-Mercaptopurine Metabolism in
Crohn’s Disease: Correlation with Efficacy and Toxicity,
39 Gut 401 (1996))). But those in the field did not know
the precise correlations between metabolite levels and
likely harm or ineffectiveness. The patent claims at issue
here set forth processes embodying researchers’ findings
that identified these correlations with some precision.
More specifically, the patents—U. S. Patent No.
6,355,623 (’623 patent) and U. S. Patent No. 6,680,302
(’302 patent)—embody findings that concentrations in a
patient’s blood of 6–TG or of 6–MMP metabolite beyond a
certain level (400 and 7000 picomoles per 8x108 red blood
cells, respectively) indicate that the dosage is likely too
high for the patient, while concentrations in the blood of
6–TG metabolite lower than a certain level (about 230
picomoles per 8x108 red blood cells) indicate that the
dosage is likely too low to be effective.
The patent claims seek to embody this research in a set
of processes. Like the Federal Circuit we take as typical
claim 1 of the ’623 Patent, which describes one of the
claimed processes as follows:
“A method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for
treatment of an immune-mediated gastrointestinal
disorder, comprising:
“(a) administering a drug providing 6-thioguanine to
a subject having said immune-mediated gastrointesti­
nal disorder; and
“(b) determining the level of 6-thioguanine in said
subject having said immune-mediated gastrointesti­
nal disorder,
“wherein the level of 6-thioguanine less than about
230 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells indicates a need to
