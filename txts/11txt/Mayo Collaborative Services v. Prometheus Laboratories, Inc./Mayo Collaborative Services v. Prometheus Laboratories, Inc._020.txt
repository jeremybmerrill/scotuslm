MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS
LABORATORIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

Finally, in Benson the Court considered the patentabil­
ity of a mathematical process for converting binary-coded
decimal numerals into pure binary numbers on a general
purpose digital computer. The claims “purported to cover
any use of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital
computer of any type.” 409 U. S., at 64, 65. The Court
recognized that “ ‘a novel and useful structure created with
the aid of knowledge of scientific truth’ ” might be patent­
able. Id., at 67 (quoting Mackay Radio, 306 U. S., at 94).
But it held that simply implementing a mathematical
principle on a physical machine, namely a computer, was
not a patentable application of that principle. For the
mathematical formula had “no substantial practical appli­
cation except in connection with a digital computer.”
Benson, supra, at 71. Hence the claim (like the claims
before us) was overly broad; it did not differ significantly
from a claim that just said “apply the algorithm.”

The Court has repeatedly emphasized this last men­
tioned concern, a concern that patent law not inhibit
further discovery by improperly tying up the future use of
laws of nature. Thus, in Morse the Court set aside as
unpatentable Samuel Morse’s general claim for “ ‘the use
of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current . . .
however developed, for making or printing intelligible
characters, letters, or signs, at any distances,’ ” 15 How., at
86. 	The Court explained:
“For aught that we now know some future inventor, in
the onward march of science, may discover a mode of
writing or printing at a distance by means of the elec­
tric or galvanic current, without using any part of the
process or combination set forth in the plaintiff ’s spec­
ification. His invention may be less complicated—less
liable to get out of order—less expensive in construc­
tion, and in its operation. But yet if it is covered by
