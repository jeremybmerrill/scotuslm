Opinion of the Court

to depart from case law precedent.
III
We have considered several further arguments in sup­
port of Prometheus’ position. But they do not lead us to
adopt a different conclusion. First, the Federal Circuit, in
upholding the patent eligibility of the claims before us,
relied on this Court’s determination that “[t]ransformation
and reduction of an article ‘to a different state or thing’ is
the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does
not include particular machines.” Benson, supra, at 70–71
(emphasis added); see also Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at
6–7); Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184; Flook, supra, at 588, n. 9;
Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788 (1877). It reasoned
that the claimed processes are therefore patent eligible,
since they involve transforming the human body by ad­
ministering a thiopurine drug and transforming the blood
by analyzing it to determine metabolite levels. 628 F. 3d,
at 1356–1357.
The first of these transformations, however, is irrele­
vant. As we have pointed out, the “administering” step
simply helps to pick out the group of individuals who are
likely interested in applying the law of nature. See supra,
at 9. And the second step could be satisfied without trans­
forming the blood, should science develop a totally differ­
ent system for determining metabolite levels that did not
involve such a transformation. See supra, at 18. Regard­
less, in stating that the “machine-or-transformation” test
is an “important and useful clue” to patentability, we have
neither said nor implied that the test trumps the “law of
nature” exclusion. Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6–7)
(emphasis added). That being so, the test fails here.
Second, Prometheus argues that, because the particular
laws of nature that its patent claims embody are narrow
and specific, the patents should be upheld. Thus, it en­
courages us to draw distinctions among laws of nature
