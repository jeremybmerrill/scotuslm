MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS 

LABORATORIES, INC.

Syllabus

gardless of whether he changes his dosage in the light of the inference he draws using the correlations. And they threaten to inhibit
the development of more refined treatment recommendations that
combine Prometheus’ correlations with later discoveries. This reinforces the conclusion that the processes at issue are not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law precedent. Pp. 16–19.
(c) Additional arguments supporting Prometheus’ position—that
the process is patent eligible because it passes the “machine or transformation test”; that, because the particular laws of nature that the
claims embody are narrow and specific, the patents should be upheld;
that the Court should not invalidate these patents under §101 because the Patent Act’s other validity requirements will screen out
overly broad patents; and that a principle of law denying patent coverage here will discourage investment in discoveries of new diagnostic laws of nature—do not lead to a different conclusion. Pp. 19–24.

628 F. 3d 1347, reversed.
BREYER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
