Opinion of the Court

this patent the inventor could not use it, nor the pub­
lic have the benefit of it without the permission of this
patentee.” Id., at 113.
Similarly, in Benson the Court said that the claims
before it were “so abstract and sweeping as to cover both
known and unknown uses of the [mathematical formula].”
409 U. S., at 67, 68. In Bilski the Court pointed out that
to allow “petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre­
empt use of this approach in all fields.” 561 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 15). And in Flook the Court expressed concern
that the claimed process was simply “a formula for compu­
ting an updated alarm limit,” which might “cover a broad
range of potential uses.” 437 U. S., at 586.
These statements reflect the fact that, even though
rewarding with patents those who discover new laws of
nature and the like might well encourage their discovery,
those laws and principles, considered generally, are “the
basic tools of scientific and technological work.” Benson,
supra, at 67. And so there is a danger that the grant of
patents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation
premised upon them, a danger that becomes acute when a
patented process amounts to no more than an instruction
to “apply the natural law,” or otherwise forecloses more
future invention than the underlying discovery could
reasonably justify. See generally Lemley, Risch, Sichel­
man, & Wagner, Life After Bilski, 63 Stan. L. Rev. 1315
(2011) (hereinafter Lemley) (arguing that §101 reflects
this kind of concern); see also C. Bohannan & H.
Hovenkamp, Creation without Restraint: Promoting Lib­
erty and Rivalry in Innovation 112 (2012) (“One problem
with [process] patents is that the more abstractly their
claims are stated, the more difficult it is to determine
precisely what they cover. They risk being applied to a
wide range of situations that were not anticipated by the
patentee”); W. Landes & R. Posner, The Economic Struc­
