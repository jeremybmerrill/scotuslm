Opinion of the Court

and useful end”).
Still, as the Court has also made clear, to transform an
unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law, one must do more than simply state the
law of nature while adding the words “apply it.” See, e.g.,
Benson, supra, at 71–72.
The case before us lies at the intersection of these basic
principles. It concerns patent claims covering processes
that help doctors who use thiopurine drugs to treat pa­
tients with autoimmune diseases determine whether a
given dosage level is too low or too high. The claims pur­
port to apply natural laws describing the relationships
between the concentration in the blood of certain thiopu­
rine metabolites and the likelihood that the drug dosage
will be ineffective or induce harmful side-effects. We must
determine whether the claimed processes have trans­
formed these unpatentable natural laws into patent­
eligible applications of those laws. We conclude that they
have not done so and that therefore the processes are not
patentable.
Our conclusion rests upon an examination of the partic­
ular claims before us in light of the Court’s precedents.
Those cases warn us against interpreting patent statutes
in ways that make patent eligibility “depend simply on the
draftsman’s art” without reference to the “principles un­
derlying the prohibition against patents for [natural
laws].” Flook, supra, at 593. They warn us against up­
holding patents that claim processes that too broadly
preempt the use of a natural law. Morse, supra, at 112–
120; Benson, supra, at 71–72. And they insist that a
process that focuses upon the use of a natural law also
contain other elements or a combination of elements,
sometimes referred to as an “inventive concept,” sufficient
to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to signifi­
cantly more than a patent upon the natural law itself.
