MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS 

LABORATORIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court 


increase the amount of said drug subsequently admin­
istered to said subject and
“wherein the level of 6-thioguanine greater than about
400 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells indicates a need to
decrease the amount of said drug subsequently ad­
ministered to said subject.” ’623 patent, col. 20, ll. 10–
20, 2 App. 16.
For present purposes we may assume that the other
claims in the patents do not differ significantly from
claim 1.
B
Respondent, Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (Prome­
theus), is the sole and exclusive licensee of the ’623 and
’302 patents. It sells diagnostic tests that embody the
processes the patents describe. For some time petitioners,
Mayo Clinic Rochester and Mayo Collaborative Services
(collectively Mayo), bought and used those tests. But in
2004 Mayo announced that it intended to begin using and
selling its own test—a test using somewhat higher metab­
olite levels to determine toxicity (450 pmol per 8x108 for
6–TG and 5700 pmol per 8x108 for 6–MMP). Prometheus
then brought this action claiming patent infringement.
The District Court found that Mayo’s test infringed
claim 7 of the ’623 patent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a–
115a. In interpreting the claim, the court accepted Prome­
theus’ view that the toxicity-risk level numbers in Mayo’s
test and the claim were too similar to render the tests
significantly different. The number Mayo used (450) was
too close to the number the claim used (400) to matter
given appropriate margins of error. Id., at 98a–107a. The
District Court also accepted Prometheus’ view that a
doctor using Mayo’s test could violate the patent even if he
did not actually alter his treatment decision in the light of
the test. In doing so, the court construed the claim’s lan­
guage, “indicates a need to decrease” (or “to increase”), as
