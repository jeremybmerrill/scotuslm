Opinion of the Court

“obvious in light of prior art,” §103, and that it be “full[y],
clear[ly], concise[ly], and exact[ly]” described, §112—can
perform this screening function. In particular, it argues
that these claims likely fail for lack of novelty under §102.
This approach, however, would make the “law of nature”
exception to §101 patentability a dead letter. The ap­
proach is therefore not consistent with prior law. The
relevant cases rest their holdings upon section 101, not
later sections. Bilski, 561 U. S. ___; Diehr, supra; Flook,
supra; Benson, 409 U. S. 63. See also H. R. Rep. No. 1923,
82d Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1952) (“A person may have ‘invent­
ed’ a machine or a manufacture, which may include any­
thing under the sun that is made by man, but it is not
necessarily patentable under section 101 unless the condi­
tions of the title are fulfilled” (emphasis added)).
We recognize that, in evaluating the significance of
additional steps, the §101 patent-eligibility inquiry and,
say, the §102 novelty inquiry might sometimes overlap.
But that need not always be so. And to shift the patent­
eligibility inquiry entirely to these later sections risks
creating significantly greater legal uncertainty, while
assuming that those sections can do work that they are
not equipped to do.
What role would laws of nature, including newly discov­
ered (and “novel”) laws of nature, play in the Govern­
ment’s suggested “novelty” inquiry? Intuitively, one would
suppose that a newly discovered law of nature is novel.
The Government, however, suggests in effect that the
novelty of a component law of nature may be disregarded
when evaluating the novelty of the whole. See Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 27. But §§102 and 103
say nothing about treating laws of nature as if they were
part of the prior art when applying those sections. Cf.
Diehr, 450 U. S., at 188 (patent claims “must be consid­
ered as a whole”). And studiously ignoring all laws of
nature when evaluating a patent application under §§102
