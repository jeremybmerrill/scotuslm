MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS
LABORATORIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

Hovenkamp, Creation without Restraint, at 98–100.
In consequence, we must hesitate before departing from
established general legal rules lest a new protective rule
that seems to suit the needs of one field produce unfore­
seen results in another. And we must recognize the role of
Congress in crafting more finely tailored rules where
necessary. Cf. 35 U. S. C. §§161–164 (special rules for
plant patents). We need not determine here whether,
from a policy perspective, increased protection for discov­
eries of diagnostic laws of nature is desirable.

For these reasons, we conclude that the patent claims at
issue here effectively claim the underlying laws of nature
themselves. The claims are consequently invalid. And the
Federal Circuit’s judgment is reversed.
It is so ordered.
