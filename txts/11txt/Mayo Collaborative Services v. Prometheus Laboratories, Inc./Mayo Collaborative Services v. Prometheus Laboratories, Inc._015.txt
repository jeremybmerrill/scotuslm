Opinion of the Court

light of the correlations. To put the matter more suc­
cinctly, the claims inform a relevant audience about
certain laws of nature; any additional steps consist of well­
understood, routine, conventional activity already engaged
in by the scientific community; and those steps, when
viewed as a whole, add nothing significant beyond the sum
of their parts taken separately. For these reasons we
believe that the steps are not sufficient to transform un­
patentable natural correlations into patentable applica­
tions of those regularities.

A more detailed consideration of the controlling prece­
dents reinforces our conclusion. The cases most directly
on point are Diehr and Flook, two cases in which the Court
reached opposite conclusions about the patent eligibility of
processes that embodied the equivalent of natural laws.
The Diehr process (held patent eligible) set forth a method
for molding raw, uncured rubber into various cured, mold­
ed products. The process used a known mathematical
equation, the Arrhenius equation, to determine when
(depending upon the temperature inside the mold, the
time the rubber had been in the mold, and the thickness of
the rubber) to open the press. It consisted in effect of the
steps of: (1) continuously monitoring the temperature on
the inside of the mold, (2) feeding the resulting numbers
into a computer, which would use the Arrhenius equation
to continuously recalculate the mold-opening time, and (3)
configuring the computer so that at the appropriate mo­
ment it would signal “a device” to open the press. Diehr,

The Court pointed out that the basic mathematical
equation, like a law of nature, was not patentable. But
it found the overall process patent eligible because of
the way the additional steps of the process integrated the
