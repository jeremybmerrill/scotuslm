MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS
LABORATORIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

2
Other cases offer further support for the view that simp­
ly appending conventional steps, specified at a high level
of generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and
abstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and
ideas patentable. This Court has previously discussed in
detail an English case, Neilson, which involved a patent
claim that posed a legal problem very similar to the prob­
lem now before us. The patent applicant there asserted a
claim
“for the improved application of air to produce heat in
fires, forges, and furnaces, where a blowing apparatus
is required. [The invention] was to be applied as
follows: The blast or current of air produced by the
blowing apparatus was to be passed from it into
an air-vessel or receptacle made sufficiently strong to
endure the blast; and through or from that vessel or
receptacle by means of a tube, pipe, or aperture into
the fire, the receptacle be kept artificially heated to a
considerable temperature by heat externally applied.”
Morse, 15 How., at 114–115.
The English court concluded that the claimed process did
more than simply instruct users to use the principle that
hot air promotes ignition better than cold air, since it
explained how the principle could be implemented in an
inventive way. Baron Parke wrote (for the court):
“It is very difficult to distinguish [Neilson’s claim]
from the specification of a patent for a principle, and
this at first created in the minds of some of the court
much difficulty; but after full consideration, we think
that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle,
but a machine embodying a principle, and a very val­
uable one. We think the case must be considered as if
the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first
