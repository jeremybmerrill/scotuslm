Opinion of the Court

and 103 would “make all inventions unpatentable because
all inventions can be reduced to underlying principles of
nature which, once known, make their implementation
obvious.” Id., at 189, n. 12. See also Eisenberg, Wisdom of

Section 112 requires only a “written description of the
invention . . . in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms
as to enable any person skilled in the art . . . to make and
use the same.” It does not focus on the possibility that a
law of nature (or its equivalent) that meets these condi­
tions will nonetheless create the kind of risk that under­
lies the law of nature exception, namely the risk that a
patent on the law would significantly impede future innovation. See Lemley 1329–1332 (outlining differences
between §§101 and 112); Eisenberg, supra, at ___ (manu­
script, at 92–96) (similar). Compare Risch, Everything
is Patentable, 75 Tenn. L. Rev. 591 (2008) (defending a
minimalist approach to §101) with Lemley (reflecting
Risch’s change of mind).
These considerations lead us to decline the Govern­
ment’s invitation to substitute §§102, 103, and 112 inquir­
ies for the better established inquiry under §101.
Fourth, Prometheus, supported by several amici, argues
that a principle of law denying patent coverage here will
interfere significantly with the ability of medical research­
ers to make valuable discoveries, particularly in the area
of diagnostic research. That research, which includes
research leading to the discovery of laws of nature, is
expensive; it “ha[s] made the United States the world
leader in this field”; and it requires protection. Brief for
