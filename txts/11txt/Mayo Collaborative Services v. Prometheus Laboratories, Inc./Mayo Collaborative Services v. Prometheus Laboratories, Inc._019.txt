Opinion of the Court

invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical appa­
ratus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in
this—by interposing a receptacle for heated air be­
tween the blowing apparatus and the furnace. In this
receptacle he directs the air to be heated by the appli­
cation of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he
accomplishes the object of applying the blast, which
was before of cold air, in a heated state to the fur­
nace.” Neilson v. Harford, Webster’s Patent Cases, at
371.
Thus, the claimed process included not only a law of
nature but also several unconventional steps (such as
inserting the receptacle, applying heat to the receptacle
externally, and blowing the air into the furnace) that
confined the claims to a particular, useful application of the
principle.
In Bilski the Court considered claims covering a process
for hedging risks of price changes by, for example, con­
tracting to purchase commodities from sellers at a fixed
price, reflecting the desire of sellers to hedge against a
drop in prices, while selling commodities to consumers at a
fixed price, reflecting the desire of consumers to hedge
against a price increase. One claim described the process;
another reduced the process to a mathematical formula.
561 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 2–3). The Court held
that the described “concept of hedging” was “an unpatent­
able abstract idea.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15). The fact
that some of the claims limited hedging to use in commod­
ities and energy markets and specified that “well-known
random analysis techniques [could be used] to help estab­
lish some of the inputs into the equation” did not under­
mine this conclusion, for “Flook established that limiting
an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postso­
lution components did not make the concept patentable.”
Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 16, 15).
