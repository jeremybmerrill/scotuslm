ment, but it does not necessarily convert a noncustodial situation into
Miranda custody. Isolation may contribute to a coercive atmosphere
when a nonprisoner is questioned, but questioning a prisoner in private does not generally remove him from a supportive atmosphere
and may be in his best interest. Neither does questioning a prisoner
about criminal activity outside the prison have a significantly greater
potential for coercion than questioning under otherwise identical circumstances about criminal activity within the prison walls. The coercive pressure that Miranda guards against is neither mitigated nor
magnified by the location of the conduct about which questions are
asked. Pp. 12–13.
3. When a prisoner is questioned, the determination of custody
should focus on all of the features of the interrogation. The record in
this case reveals that respondent was not taken into custody for Miranda purposes. While some of the facts lend support to his argument that Miranda’s custody requirement was met, they are offset by
others. Most important, he was told at the outset of the interrogation, and reminded thereafter, that he was free to leave and could go
back to his cell whenever he wanted. Moreover, he was not physically restrained or threatened, was interviewed in a well-lit, averagesized conference room where the door was sometimes left open, and
was offered food and water. These facts are consistent with an environment in which a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave, subject to the ordinary restraints of life
behind bars. Pp. 13–16.
