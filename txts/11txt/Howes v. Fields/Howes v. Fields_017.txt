HOWES v. FIELDS
Opinion of the Court

population for questioning and is “thereafter . . . subjected
to treatment” in connection with the interrogation “that
renders him ‘in custody’ for practical purposes . . . will be
entitled to the full panoply of protections prescribed by
Miranda.” Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 440.
“Fidelity to the doctrine announced in Miranda requires
that it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are
implicated.” Id., at 437; see Shatzer, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 9); Mathiason, supra, at 495. Confessions voluntarily made by prisoners in other situations should not be
suppressed. “Voluntary confessions are not merely a
proper element in law enforcement, they are an unmitigated good, essential to society’s compelling interest in
finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the
law.” Shatzer, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
B
The record in this case reveals that respondent was not
taken into custody for purposes of Miranda. To be sure,
respondent did not invite the interview or consent to it in
advance, and he was not advised that he was free to decline to speak with the deputies. The following facts also
lend some support to respondent’s argument that Miranda’s custody requirement was met: The interview lasted
for between five and seven hours in the evening and continued well past the hour when respondent generally went
to bed; the deputies who questioned respondent were
armed; and one of the deputies, according to respondent,
“[u]sed a very sharp tone,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a, and,
on one occasion, profanity, see id., at 77a.
These circumstances, however, were offset by others.
Most important, respondent was told at the outset of the
interrogation, and was reminded again thereafter, that he
could leave and go back to his cell whenever he wanted.
