HOWES v. FIELDS
Opinion of the Court

States, 391 U. S. 1 (1968), that “Miranda warnings must
be administered when law enforcement officers remove an
inmate from the general prison population and interrogate
him regarding criminal conduct that took place outside the
jail or prison.” 617 F. 3d 813, 820 (CA6 2010); see also id.,
at 818 (“The central holding of Mathis is that a Miranda
warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual
is isolated from the general prison population and interrogated, i.e.[,] questioned in a manner likely to lead to selfincrimination, about conduct occurring outside of the
prison”). Because Fields was isolated from the general
prison population and interrogated about conduct occurring in the outside world, the Court of Appeals found that
the state court’s decision was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by this Court in Mathis.
617 F. 3d, at 823.
We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).
II
Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant a state prisoner’s application for a writ of habeas corpus if the statecourt adjudication pursuant to which the prisoner is held
“resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal
law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United
States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). In this context, “clearly
established law” signifies “the holdings, as opposed to the
dicta, of this Court’s decisions.” Williams v. Taylor, 529
U. S. 362, 412 (2000).
In this case, it is abundantly clear that our precedents
do not clearly establish the categorical rule on which the
Court of Appeals relied, i.e., that the questioning of a
prisoner is always custodial when the prisoner is removed
from the general prison population and questioned about
events that occurred outside the prison. On the contrary,
we have repeatedly declined to adopt any categorical rule
