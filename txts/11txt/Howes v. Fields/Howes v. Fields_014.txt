Opinion of the Court

incarceration, we reasoned in Shatzer, the ordinary restrictions of prison life, while no doubt unpleasant, are
expected and familiar and thus do not involve the same
“inherently compelling pressures” that are often present
when a suspect is yanked from familiar surroundings in
the outside world and subjected to interrogation in a police
station. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).
Second, a prisoner, unlike a person who has not been
sentenced to a term of incarceration, is unlikely to be
lured into speaking by a longing for prompt release. When
a person is arrested and taken to a station house for interrogation, the person who is questioned may be pressured
to speak by the hope that, after doing so, he will be allowed to leave and go home. On the other hand, when a
prisoner is questioned, he knows that when the questioning ceases, he will remain under confinement. Id., at ___–
___, n. 8 (slip op., at 14–15, n. 8).
Third, a prisoner, unlike a person who has not been
convicted and sentenced, knows that the law enforcement
officers who question him probably lack the authority to
affect the duration of his sentence. Id., at ___–___ (slip
op., at 14–15). And “where the possibility of parole exists,”
the interrogating officers probably also lack the power to
bring about an early release. Ibid. “When the suspect has
no reason to think that the listeners have official power
over him, it should not be assumed that his words are
motivated by the reaction he expects from his listeners.”
Perkins, 496 U. S., at 297. Under such circumstances,
there is little “basis for the assumption that a suspect . . .
will feel compelled to speak by the fear of reprisal for
remaining silent or in the hope of [a] more lenient treatment should he confess.” Id., at 296–297.
In short, standard conditions of confinement and associated restrictions on freedom will not necessarily implicate
the same interests that the Court sought to protect when
it afforded special safeguards to persons subjected to
