Opinion of the Court

with respect to whether the questioning of a prison inmate
is custodial.
In Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292 (1990), where we
upheld the admission of un-Mirandized statements elicited from an inmate by an undercover officer masquerading
as another inmate, we noted that “[t]he bare fact of custody may not in every instance require a warning even when
the suspect is aware that he is speaking to an official, but
we do not have occasion to explore that issue here.” Id., at
299 (emphasis added). Instead, we simply “reject[ed] the
argument that Miranda warnings are required whenever
a suspect is in custody in a technical sense and converses
with someone who happens to be a government agent.”
Id., at 297.
Most recently, in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___
(2010), we expressly declined to adopt a bright-line rule
for determining the applicability of Miranda in prisons.
Shatzer considered whether a break in custody ends the
presumption of involuntariness established in Edwards v.
Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), and, if so, whether a prisoner’s return to the general prison population after a custodial interrogation constitutes a break in Miranda custody.
See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3–4). In considering the
latter question, we noted first that “[w]e have never decided whether incarceration constitutes custody for Miranda
purposes, and have indeed explicitly declined to address
the issue.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (citing Perkins,
supra, at 299; emphasis added). The answer to this question, we noted, would “depen[d] upon whether [incarceration] exerts the coercive pressure that Miranda was
designed to guard against—the ‘danger of coercion [that]
results from the interaction of custody and official interrogation.’ ” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting
Perkins, supra, at 297).
In concluding that our precedents establish a categorical
rule, the Court of Appeals placed great weight on the
