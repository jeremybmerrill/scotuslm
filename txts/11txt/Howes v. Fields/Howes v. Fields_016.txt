Opinion of the Court

dom of movement. A prisoner may, for example, be removed from an exercise yard and taken, under close
guard, to the room where the interview is to be held. But
such procedures are an ordinary and familiar attribute of
life behind bars. Escorts and special security precautions
may be standard procedures regardless of the purpose for
which an inmate is removed from his regular routine and
taken to a special location. For example, ordinary prison
procedure may require such measures when a prisoner is
led to a meeting with an attorney.
Finally, we fail to see why questioning about criminal
activity outside the prison should be regarded as having a
significantly greater potential for coercion than questioning under otherwise identical circumstances about criminal activity within the prison walls. In both instances,
there is the potential for additional criminal liability and
punishment. If anything, the distinction would seem to
cut the other way, as an inmate who confesses to misconduct that occurred within the prison may also incur administrative penalties, but even this is not enough to tip
the scale in the direction of custody. “The threat to a
citizen’s Fifth Amendment rights that Miranda was designed to neutralize” is neither mitigated nor magnified by
the location of the conduct about which questions are
asked. Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 435, n. 22.
For these reasons, the Court of Appeals’ categorical rule
is unsound.

custody should focus on all of the features of the interrogation. These include the language that is used in summoning the prisoner to the interview and the manner in which
the interrogation is conducted. See Yarborough, 541 U. S.,
at 665. An inmate who is removed from the general prison
