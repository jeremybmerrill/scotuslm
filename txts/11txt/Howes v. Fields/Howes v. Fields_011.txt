HOWES v. FIELDS
Opinion of the Court 


III

Not only does the categorical rule applied below go well
beyond anything that is clearly established in our prior
decisions, it is simply wrong. The three elements of that
rule—(1) imprisonment, (2) questioning in private, and (3)
questioning about events in the outside world—are not
necessarily enough to create a custodial situation for
Miranda purposes.
A
As used in our Miranda case law, “custody” is a term of
art that specifies circumstances that are thought generally
to present a serious danger of coercion. In determining
whether a person is in custody in this sense, the initial
step is to ascertain whether, in light of “the objective circumstances of the interrogation,” Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322–323, 325 (1994) (per curiam), a
“reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at
liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.” Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995). And in order to
determine how a suspect would have “gauge[d]” his “freedom of movement,” courts must examine “all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.” Stansbury,
supra, at 322, 325 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Relevant factors include the location of the questioning,
see Shatzer, supra, at ___–___ (slip op., at 13–16), its
duration, see Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 437–438
(1984), statements made during the interview, see Mathiason, supra, at 495; Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.
652, 665 (2004); Stansbury, supra, at 325, the presence or
absence of physical restraints during the questioning, see
New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984), and the
release of the interviewee at the end of the questioning,
see California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1122–1123
(1983) (per curiam).
