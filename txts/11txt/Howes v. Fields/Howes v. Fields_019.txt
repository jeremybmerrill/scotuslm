HOWES v. FIELDS
Opinion of the Court

“was told . . . if I did not want to cooperate, I needed to go
back to my cell,” these words did not coerce cooperation by
threatening harsher conditions. App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a;
see id., at 89a (“I was told, if I didn’t want to cooperate,
I could leave”). Returning to his cell would merely have
returned him to his usual environment. See Shatzer,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14) (“Interrogated suspects who
have previously been convicted of crime live in prison.
When they are released back into the general prison population, they return to their accustomed surroundings and
daily routine—they regain the degree of control they had
over their lives prior to the interrogation”).
Taking into account all of the circumstances of the
questioning—including especially the undisputed fact that
respondent was told that he was free to end the questioning and to return to his cell—we hold that respondent was
not in custody within the meaning of Miranda.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.
—————— 

“Q. The question is this, sir, not whether you had freedom to get up

and walk away, but did you understand that what that meant was that

a jailer would come get you and— 

“A. No— 

“Q. —take you back to your cell?

“A. I did not understand that. 

“Q. You didn’t? 

“A. No. 

“Q. Why not? That’s how you got there.

“A. Because I did not know if a jailer would take me back or if one of

those gentlemen would take me back. 

“Q. But you understood that, if you asked, one of them or a jailer would 

take you back to your cell? 

“A. I assumed that. 

“Q. And you believed that to be true?

“A. I assumed that.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 91a–92a.
