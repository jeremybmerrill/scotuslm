HOWES v. FIELDS
Opinion of the Court

decision in Mathis, but the Court of Appeals misread the
holding in that case. In Mathis, an inmate in a state
prison was questioned by an Internal Revenue agent and
was subsequently convicted for federal offenses. The
Court of Appeals held that Miranda did not apply to this
interview for two reasons: A criminal investigation had
not been commenced at the time of the interview, and
the prisoner was incarcerated for an “unconnected offense.”
Mathis v. United States, 376 F. 2d 595, 597 (CA5 1967).
This Court rejected both of those grounds for distinguishing Miranda, 391 U. S., at 4, and thus the holding in
Mathis is simply that a prisoner who otherwise meets the
requirements for Miranda custody is not taken outside the
scope of Miranda by either of the two factors on which
the Court of Appeals had relied. Mathis did not hold
that imprisonment, in and of itself, is enough to constitute
Miranda custody.4 Nor, contrary to respondent’s submission, see Brief for Respondent 14, did Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 494 (1977) (per curiam), which simply
restated in dictum the holding in Mathis.
The Court of Appeals purported to find support for its
per se rule in Shatzer, relying on our statement that “[n]o
one questions that Shatzer was in custody for Miranda
purposes” when he was interviewed. 559 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 13). But this statement means only that the issue
of custody was not contested before us. It strains credulity
to read the statement as constituting an “unambiguous
conclusion” or “finding” by this Court that Shatzer was in
custody. 617 F. 3d, at 822.
Finally, contrary to respondent’s suggestion, see Brief
for Respondent 12–15, Miranda itself did not clearly es——————
4 Indeed,

it is impossible to tell from either the opinion of this Court
or that of the court below whether the prisoner’s interview was routine
or whether there were special features that may have created an
especially coercive atmosphere.
