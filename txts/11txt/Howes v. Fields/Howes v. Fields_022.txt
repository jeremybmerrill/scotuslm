Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

617 F. 3d 813, 815 (CA6 2010). He was given water, App.
to Pet. for Cert. 74a, but not his evening medications,
id., at 79a.* Yet the Court concludes that Fields was in
“an interrogation environment in which a reasonable person
would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave.”
Ante, at 15 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.
652, 665 (2004)).
Critical to the Court’s judgment is “the undisputed fact
that [Fields] was told that he was free to end the questioning and to return to his cell.” Ante, at 17. Never mind
the facts suggesting that Fields’s submission to the overnight interview was anything but voluntary. Was Fields
“held for interrogation”? See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 471.
Brought to, and left alone with, the gun-bearing deputies,
he surely was in my judgment.
Miranda instructed that such a person “must be clearly
informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer
and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.”
Ibid. Those warnings, along with “warnings of the right
to remain silent and that anything stated can be used in
evidence against [the speaker],” Miranda explained, are
necessary “prerequisite[s] to [an] interrogation” compatible with the Fifth Amendment. Ibid. Today, for people
already in prison, the Court finds it adequate for the police
to say: “You are free to terminate this interrogation and
return to your cell.” Such a statement is no substitute for
one ensuring that an individual is aware of his rights.
For the reasons stated, I would hold that the “incommunicado interrogation [of Fields] in a police-dominated
atmosphere,” id., at 445, without informing him of his
rights, dishonored the Fifth Amendment privilege Miranda was designed to safeguard.

* Each night, Fields took an antidepressant and, due to his kidney
transplant surgery, two antirejection medications. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 79a.
