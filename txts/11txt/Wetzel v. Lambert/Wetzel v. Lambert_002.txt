WETZEL v. LAMBERT
Per Curiam

no evidence that Woodlock was ever investigated for any
other robbery, or that his photo was shown to a witness in
any other robbery.
Lambert claimed that the activity sheet was exculpatory, because it suggested that someone other than or in
addition to him, Jackson, and Reese was involved in the
Prince’s Lounge crime. Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584
Pa. 461, 472, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005). Lambert also
argued that he could have used the activity sheet to impeach Jackson’s testimony at trial, because the statement
attributed to Jackson suggested that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a participant prior to identifying Lambert. Ibid.
The Commonwealth countered that the asserted “statement” by Jackson reflected in the activity sheet was in fact
nothing more than an “ambiguously worded notation.”
Ibid. The Commonwealth argued that this notation simply indicated that Jackson had named Woodlock as a “codefendant” in some incident, without specifying whether
Woodlock was said to be involved in the Prince’s Lounge
robbery or one of the dozen other robberies in which
Jackson had admitted participating. In this regard, the
Commonwealth noted that Woodlock’s name was not
mentioned anywhere else in the police records, trial
proceedings, or Jackson’s statements about the Prince’s
Lounge robbery. As the Commonwealth has put it, “it
seems likely that Jackson identified [Woodlock] as a participant in one of his many other robberies, and police
simply confirmed that Woodlock had nothing to do with
this case.” Reply to Brief in Opposition 2. The Commonwealth “further note[d]” that the document would not have
advanced any impeachment of Jackson, because he had
already been extensively impeached at trial. Lambert, 584
Pa., at 472, 884 A. 2d, at 855. Thus, according to the
Commonwealth, the “ambiguous reference to Woodlock”
would not have discredited Jackson any further. Ibid.
