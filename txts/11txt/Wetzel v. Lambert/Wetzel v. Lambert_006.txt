WETZEL v. LAMBERT
Per Curiam

charges when the activity sheet was prepared, (4) Woodlock’s name appeared nowhere else in the Prince’s Lounge
files, and (5) the two witnesses from the Prince’s Lounge
robbery who were shown Woodlock’s photo did not identify
him as involved in that crime.
Any retrial here would take place three decades after the
crime, posing the most daunting difficulties for the prosecution. That burden should not be imposed unless each
ground supporting the state court decision is examined
and found to be unreasonable under AEDPA.

proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of
the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is vacated, and
the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
