Per Curiam

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed with the
Commonwealth and unanimously rejected Lambert’s
Brady claim, holding that the disputed document was not
material. Id., at 472–473, 848 A. 2d, at 855–856. The
court concluded that there was no reasonable probability
that the result of Lambert’s trial would have been different had the document been disclosed. Ibid. See Strickler
v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281 (1999). Calling Lambert’s
claim that the reference to Woodlock “automatically”
meant someone else was involved in the Prince’s Lounge
robbery “purely speculative at best,” the court noted that
“the police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock
a potential codefendant in this case as his name is not
mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.”
584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d, at 855. “Moreover,” the court
continued, the document “would not have materially furthered the impeachment of Jackson at trial as he was
already extensively impeached by both [Lambert] and
Reese.” Ibid.
Lambert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 28 U. S. C.
§2254, claiming, inter alia, that the Commonwealth’s
failure to disclose the document violated his rights under
Brady. The District Court denied the writ, holding that
the state courts’ determination that the notations “were
not exculpatory or impeaching” was “reasonable.” Lambert v. Beard, Civ. Action No. 02–9034 (July 24, 2007),
App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36. The court explained that
“[t]he various notations and statements which [Lambert]
claims the Commonwealth should have disclosed are entirely ambiguous, and would have required the state
courts to speculate to conclude they were favorable for
Lambert and material to his guilt or punishment.” Id.,
at 36.
On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit reversed and granted the writ. 633 F. 3d 126
