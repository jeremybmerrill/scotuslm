PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID
Opinion of the Court

and extraction business. Valladolid spent about 98 percent of his time on one of Pacific’s offshore drilling platforms performing maintenance duties, such as picking up
litter, emptying trashcans, washing decks, painting, maintaining equipment, and helping to load and unload the
platform crane. Valladolid spent the remainder of his
time working at Pacific’s onshore processing facility,
where he also performed maintenance duties, including
painting, sandblasting, pulling weeds, cleaning drain culverts, and operating a forklift.
While on duty at the onshore facility, Valladolid died in
a forklift accident. His widow, a respondent here, filed a
claim for benefits under the LHWCA pursuant to the
extension of that Act contained within the OCSLA. The
OCSLA provides, in relevant part:
“With respect to disability or death of an employee
resulting from any injury occurring as the result of
operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf
for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing,
or transporting by pipeline the natural resources, or
involving rights to the natural resources, of the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, compensation shall be payable under the provisions of the
[LHWCA].” 43 U. S. C. §1333(b).
After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)
dismissed respondent’s claim. The ALJ reasoned that
Valladolid’s fatal injury was not covered under §1333(b)
because his accident occurred on land, rather than on the
Outer Continental Shelf. On appeal, the United States
Department of Labor’s Benefits Review Board affirmed,
concluding that Congress intended to limit the coverage
provided by the OCSLA to injuries suffered by employees
within the “geographical locale” of the Outer Continental
Shelf. L. V. v. Pacific Operations Offshore, LLP, 42 BRBS
67, 71 (2008) (per curiam).
