Opinion of SCALIA, J.

to legal liability.” CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U. S.
___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). Life is too short to pursue
every event to its most remote, “but-for,” consequences,
and the doctrine of proximate cause provides a rough
guide for courts in cutting off otherwise endless chains of
cause-and-effect. See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 287 (1992) (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in judgment). Thus, as the Court notes in
rejecting the Third Circuit’s “but for” test for §1333(b)
coverage, we have interpreted statutes with language
similar to §1333(b) as prescribing a proximate-cause
standard. See ante, at 13–14.
Although the doctrine of proximate cause is rooted in
tort law and most commonly applied in negligence actions,
it can also provide a useful guide in no-fault compensation
schemes like this one. In Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.
115, 119 (1994), we considered a no-fault veterans’ compensation statute covering injuries that occurred “as the
result of ” medical treatment (precisely the language at
issue here); we suggested that the requisite “causal connection” between the injury and medical treatment may
be “limited to proximate causation so as to narrow the
class of compensable cases . . . by eliminating remote consequences.” Similarly, some state workers’ compensation
laws use the concept of proximate cause to determine
entitlement. See, e.g., Ex parte Patton, __ So. 3d __, __
(Ala. 2011); Marandino v. Prometheus Pharmacy, 294
Conn. 564, 591, 986 A. 2d 1023, 1041 (2010); Grant v.
Grant Textiles, 372 S. C. 196, 201, 641 S. E. 2d 869, 871
(2007). Indeed, the statutory law of California, where Mr.
Valladolid died while at work, limits workers’ compensation liability to cases “[w]here the injury is proximately
caused by the employment, either with or without negligence.” Cal. Lab. Code Ann. §3600(a)(3) (West 2011).* I
