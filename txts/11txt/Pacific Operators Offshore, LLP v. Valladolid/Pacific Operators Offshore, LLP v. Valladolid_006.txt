Opinion of the Court

The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that §1333(b) neither contains a “situs-of-injury” requirement, as the Fifth
Circuit has held, nor imposes a “but for” causation requirement, as the Third Circuit has held. See 604 F. 3d
1126, 1130–1140 (2010) (rejecting the holdings of Mills v.
Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 877
F. 2d 356 (CA5 1989) (en banc); Curtis v. Schlumberger
Offshore Service, Inc., 849 F. 2d 805 (CA3 1988)). Instead,
the Ninth Circuit concluded that “the claimant must
establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf” to qualify for workers’
compensation benefits under the OCSLA. 604 F. 3d, at
1139. We granted Pacific’s petition for a writ of certiorari
to resolve this conflict. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).
II
In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act, 67
Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. §1301 et seq., which extended the
boundaries of Coastal States three geographic miles into
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and three marine leagues
into the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, Congress enacted the OCSLA, affirming the Federal Government’s
authority and control over the “outer Continental Shelf,”
defined as the submerged lands subject to the jurisdiction
and control of the United States lying seaward and outside
of the submerged lands within the extended State boundaries. 67 Stat. 462, 43 U. S. C. §§1331(a), 1332(1). As
defined by the OCSLA, the Outer Continental Shelf includes the “submerged lands” beyond the extended state
boundaries, §1331(a), but not the waters above those
submerged lands or artificial islands or installations
attached to the seabed. For simplicity’s sake, we refer to
the entire geographical zone as the “OCS.”
Section 1333 extends various provisions of state and
federal law to certain aspects of the OCS. For example,
§1333(a)(1) extends the Constitution and federal laws of
