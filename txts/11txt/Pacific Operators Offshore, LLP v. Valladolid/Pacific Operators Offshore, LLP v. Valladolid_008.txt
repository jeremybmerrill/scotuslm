Opinion of the Court

was eligible for §1333(b) benefits. Id., at 806, 811. As the
Third Circuit summarized, “ ‘But for’ [Curtis’] travelling to
[his drill rig] for the purpose of conducting ‘operations’
within §1333(b), employee Curtis would not have sustained injuries in the automobile accident.” Id., at 811.
In Mills v. Director, supra, the Fifth Circuit, sitting en
banc, adopted a narrower interpretation of §1333(b). The
court concluded that Congress intended to establish “a
bright-line geographic boundary for §1333(b) coverage,”
and held that §1333(b) extends coverage only to employees
engaged in OCS extractive activities who “suffer injury or
death on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.”
Id., at 362. Applying its “situs-of-injury” test, the Fifth
Circuit held that a welder who was injured on land during
the construction of an offshore oil platform was not eligible
for §1333(b) benefits. Id., at 357, 362.
In the case below, the Ninth Circuit rejected the Fifth
Circuit’s “situs-of-injury” requirement as unsupported by
the text of §1333(b), and the Third Circuit’s “but for” test
as too broad to be consistent with Congress’ intent. 604
F. 3d, at 1137, 1139. Instead, the Ninth Circuit adopted a
third interpretation of §1333(b), holding that a “claimant
must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and
extractive operations on the shelf” to be eligible for
§1333(b) benefits. Id., at 1139. “To meet the standard,”
the Ninth Circuit explained, “the claimant must show that
the work performed directly furthers outer continental
shelf operations and is in the regular course of such operations.” Ibid.
The Solicitor General suggests yet a fourth interpretation of §1333(b).1 This interpretation would extend cover——————

Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, United
States Department of Labor, is a respondent in this case because the
Director administers the OCSLA workers’ compensation scheme
established by §1333(b).
