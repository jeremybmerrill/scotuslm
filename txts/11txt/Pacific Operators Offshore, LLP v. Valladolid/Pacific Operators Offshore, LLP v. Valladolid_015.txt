PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID
Opinion of the Court

and artificial islands and fixed structures thereon”).
Pacific concedes that this scheme would exclude the navigable waters above the shelf, including the waters immediately adjacent to any drilling platforms. Consequently,
under Pacific’s view, even employees on a crew ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured
during a platform explosion would be excluded from
§1333(b) coverage. That view cannot be squared with the
text of the statute, which applies to “any injury occurring
as the result of operations conducted” on the OCS.
C
Pacific also makes several policy arguments in favor of
a situs-of-injury requirement, but policy concerns cannot
justify an interpretation of §1333(b) that is inconsistent
with the text of the OCSLA. “[I]f Congress’ coverage
decisions are mistaken as a matter of policy, it is for Congress to change them. We should not legislate for them.”
Herb’s Welding, 470 U. S., at 427. The language of
§1333(b) simply does not support a categorical exclusion
of injuries that occur beyond the OCS.

The Solicitor General urges us to adopt a status-based
inquiry that applies one test to on-OCS injuries and a
different test to off-OCS injuries. Specifically, the Government proposes that when a worker is injured on the
OCS, he is eligible for workers’ compensation benefits if he
is employed by a company engaged in extractive operations on the OCS. But if the employee is injured off the
OCS, the employee will be covered only if his “duties
contribute to operations” on the OCS and if he performs
“work on the [OCS] itself that is substantial in terms of
both its duration and nature.” Brief for Federal Respondent 35. This approach is derived from our decision in
Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347 (1995) (establishing
