PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP, ET AL. v. 

VALLADOLID ET AL. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 10–507.

Argued October 11, 2011—Decided January 11, 2012

Petitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific), operates two drilling platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off the California
coast and an onshore oil and gas processing facility. Employee Juan
Valladolid spent 98 percent of his time working on an offshore platform, but he was killed in an accident while working at the onshore
facility. His widow, a respondent here, sought benefits under the
Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33
U. S. C. §901 et seq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands
Act (OCSLA), which extends LHWCA coverage to injuries “occurring
as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS]” for the purpose of
extracting natural resources from the shelf, 43 U. S. C. §1333(b). The

§1333(b) did not cover Valladolid’s fatal injury because his accident
occurred on land, not on the OCS. The Labor Department’s Benefits
Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Rejecting
tests used by the Third and the Fifth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA “must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf.”
Held: The OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a
substantial nexus between his injury and his employer’s extractive
operations on the OCS. Pp. 3–14.
(a) The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations of
§1333(b)’s scope. According to the Third Circuit, because Congress
intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, §1333(b) extends to all
injuries that would not have occurred “but for” operations on the
OCS. Thus, an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig,
