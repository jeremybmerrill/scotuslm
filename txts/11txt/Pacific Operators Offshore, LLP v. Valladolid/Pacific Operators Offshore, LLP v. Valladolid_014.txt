Opinion of the Court

B
Pacific also offers an alternative argument derived from
the interaction of §1333(b) and a provision of the LHWCA.
Specifically, Pacific argues that because the LHWCA
contains an explicit situs-of-injury requirement, see 33
U. S. C. §903(a) (providing benefits only for injuries occurring “upon the navigable waters” of the United States),
and because 43 U. S. C. §1333(b) extends the LHWCA
workers’ compensation scheme to the OCS, §1333(b) incorporates the strict LHWCA situs-of-injury requirement
from §903(a). According to Pacific, the words “occurring as
the result of operations” in §1333(b) impose a status requirement in addition to the imported LHWCA situs-ofinjury requirement, with the result that employees who
are injured on the OCS, but whose jobs are not related to
extractive operations, are excluded from the workers’
compensation coverage created by §1333(b). Thus, an
accountant who is injured on a field trip to the drilling
platform would be ineligible under §1333(b) despite being
an employee who is injured on the OCS.
Although this alternative argument has the advantage
of assigning some meaning to the words “occurring as the
result of operations” in §1333(b), we still find it unpersuasive. First, it is unlikely that Congress intended to impose
a situs-of-injury requirement in §1333(b) through such a
nonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate
legislative Acts. As we have already noted, creating an
express situs-of-injury requirement in the text of §1333(b)
would have been simple. Second, combining the §1333(b)
definition of “United States” with the LHWCA situs-ofinjury requirement in 33 U. S. C. §903(a) would result in
an OCS workers’ compensation scheme that applies only
to the seabed of the OCS and to any artificial islands and
fixed structures thereon. See 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)(3)
(stating that “the term ‘United States’ when used in a
geographical sense includes the outer Continental Shelf
