PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID
Opinion of the Court

age to two categories of injuries: (1) all on-OCS injuries
suffered by employees of companies engaged in resource
extraction on the OCS; and (2) the off-OCS injuries of
those employees who spend a substantial portion of their
worktime on the OCS engaging in extractive operations.
Brief for Federal Respondent 32–33. According to the

the outer Continental Shelf,” and the employee’s injury
must occur “as the result of ” those operations.
Despite the lack of a textual “situs-of-injury” requirement in §1333(b), Pacific argues that it is logically impos-
