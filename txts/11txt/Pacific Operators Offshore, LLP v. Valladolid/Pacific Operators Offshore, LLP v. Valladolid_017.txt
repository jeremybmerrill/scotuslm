PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID
Opinion of the Court

ton Acts. Id., at 267–268. Similarly, 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)’s
language hardly compels the Third Circuit’s expansive
“but for” interpretation.
Accordingly, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit’s
“substantial-nexus” test is more faithful to the text of
§1333(b). We understand the Ninth Circuit’s test to require
the injured employee to establish a significant causal link
between the injury that he suffered and his employer’s onOCS operations conducted for the purpose of extracting
natural resources from the OCS.
Although the Ninth Circuit’s test may not be the easiest
to administer, it best reflects the text of §1333(b), which
establishes neither a situs-of-injury nor a “but for” test.
We are confident that ALJs and courts will be able to
determine whether an injured employee has established a
significant causal link between the injury he suffered and
his employer’s on-OCS extractive operations. Although we
expect that employees injured while performing tasks on
the OCS will regularly satisfy the test, whether an employee injured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies—like Valladolid, who died while tasked with onshore
scrap metal consolidation—is a question that will depend
on the individual circumstances of each case. The Ninth
Circuit remanded the case for the Benefits Review Board
to apply the “substantial-nexus” test in the first instance,
and we agree with that disposition.
The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded to
the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
