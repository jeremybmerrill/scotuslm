Opinion of SCALIA, J.

test. Ante, at 13–14. In the opinion below, moreover, the
Ninth Circuit purported to endorse the Fifth Circuit’s pre1989 case law, which required “ ‘ that the claimant show a
nexus . . . similar to the proximate cause test in tort law.’ ”
604 F. 3d 1126, 1140 (CA9 2010) (quoting Mills v. Director,
Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 846 F. 2d
1013, 1015 (CA5 1988), rev’d en banc, 877 F. 2d 356
(1989)). Who knows whether this is a tertium quid or not?
The Court has given us a new test whose contours are
entirely undescribed, and which has nothing to be said for
it except that it will add complexity to the law and litigation to the courts.
Finally, I must note an additional uncertainty (or else a
peculiarity) that the Court’s opinion creates: The statutory
text at issue requires compensation for “disability or death
of an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the
result of operations conducted on the outer Continental
Shelf . . . .” §1333(b) (emphasis added). Before today,
I would have thought it clear that courts must apply
proximate-cause analysis to the “resulting from” provision;
but that would seem quite peculiar if (as the Court holds
today) we apply substantial-nexus analysis to the neighboring “occurring as the result of ” provision. Surely both
phrases express the same concept. What a tangled web we
weave.
I would affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment to remand
the case to the Benefits Review Board, but with instructions to apply a proximate-cause test.
