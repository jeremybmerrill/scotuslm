PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID
Opinion of the Court

As in Herb’s Welding, it is unclear whether the statement
in the Offshore Logistics footnote regarding §1333(b) was
referring to the explicit situs-of-operations requirement or
to an implicit situs-of-injury requirement. Moreover, the
entire footnote is dictum because, as the Court explicitly
stated, §1333(b) had no bearing on the case. 470 U. S., at
219–220.
Finally, Pacific argues that including off-OCS injuries
within the scope of the workers’ compensation coverage
created by §1333(b) runs counter to Congress’ intent in
drafting the OCSLA. According to Pacific, Congress intended to create a uniform OCS compensation scheme that
both filled the jurisdictional voids and eliminated jurisdictional overlaps between existing state and federal programs. Pacific points out that, without a situs-of-injury
requirement to narrow the scope of §1333(b), an off-OCS
worker could be eligible for both state and federal workers’
compensation coverage.
There is no indication in the text, however, that the
OCSLA excludes OCS workers from LHWCA coverage
when they are also eligible for state benefits. To the contrary, the LHWCA workers’ compensation scheme incorporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured
employees might be eligible for both state and federal
benefits. An offsetting provision in the LHWCA provides
that “any amounts paid to an employee for the same injury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed
under [the LHWCA] pursuant to any other workers’ compensation law or [the Jones Act] shall be credited against
any liability imposed by [the LHWCA].” 33 U. S. C.
§903(e). This provision, in addition to the lack of any
textual support for Pacific’s argument, convinces us that
Congress did not limit the scope of 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)’s
coverage to only those geographic areas where state workers’ compensation schemes do not apply.
