BREYER, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AMERICAN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC., FKA

WESTERN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC., 

ET AL. v. STEVE BULLOCK, ATTORNEY

GENERAL OF MONTANA, ET AL. 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME 

COURT OF MONTANA

No. 11–1179. Decided June 25, 2012


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the
Court concluded that “independent expenditures, includ­
ing those made by corporations, do not give rise to corrup­
tion or the appearance of corruption.” 558 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 42). I disagree with the Court’s holding for the reasons expressed in Justice Stevens’ dissent
in that case. As Justice Stevens explained, “technically in­
dependent expenditures can be corrupting in much the
same way as direct contributions.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at
67–68). Indeed, Justice Stevens recounted a “substantial
body of evidence” suggesting that “[m]any corporate inde­
pendent expenditures . . . had become essentially inter­
changeable with direct contributions in their capacity to
generate quid pro quo arrangements.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,
at 64–65).
Moreover, even if I were to accept Citizens United, this
Court’s legal conclusion should not bar the Montana Su­
preme Court’s finding, made on the record before it, that
independent expenditures by corporations did in fact lead
to corruption or the appearance of corruption in Montana.
Given the history and political landscape in Montana, that
court concluded that the State had a compelling interest in
limiting independent expenditures by corporations. 2011
