AMERICAN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC. v. BULLOCK
BREYER, J., dissenting

36–37. Thus, Montana’s experience, like considerable ex­
perience elsewhere since the Court’s decision in Citizens
United, casts grave doubt on the Court’s supposition that
independent expenditures do not corrupt or appear to do
so.
Were the matter up to me, I would vote to grant the
petition for certiorari in order to reconsider Citizens United
or, at least, its application in this case. But given the
Court’s per curiam disposition, I do not see a significant
possibility of reconsideration. Consequently, I vote in­
stead to deny the petition.
