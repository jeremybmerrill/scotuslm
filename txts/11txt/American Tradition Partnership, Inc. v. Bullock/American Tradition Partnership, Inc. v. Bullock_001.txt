SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AMERICAN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC., FKA

WESTERN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC., 

ET AL. v. STEVE BULLOCK, ATTORNEY

GENERAL OF MONTANA, ET AL. 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME 

COURT OF MONTANA

No. 11–1179. Decided June 25, 2012


PER CURIAM.
A Montana state law provides that a “corporation may
not make . . . an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a
candidate or a political party.” Mont. Code Ann. §13–
35–227(1) (2011). The Montana Supreme Court rejected
petitioners’ claim that this statute violates the First
Amendment. 2011 MT 328, 363 Mont. 220, 271 P. 3d 1.
In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, this
Court struck down a similar federal law, holding that
“political speech does not lose First Amendment protection
simply because its source is a corporation.” 558 U. S. ___,
___ (2010) (slip op., at 26) (internal quotation marks omitted). The question presented in this case is whether the
holding of Citizens United applies to the Montana state
law. There can be no serious doubt that it does. See U. S.
Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Montana’s arguments in support of
the judgment below either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.
The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of
the Supreme Court of Montana is reversed.
It is so ordered.
