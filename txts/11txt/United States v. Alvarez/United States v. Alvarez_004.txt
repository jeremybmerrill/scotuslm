UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
Syllabus
statements provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to
prosecute falsity without more. Those who are unpopular may fear
that the government will use that weapon selectively against them.
Although there are many statutes and common-law doctrines making the utterance of certain kinds of false statements unlawful, they
tend to be narrower than the Act, in that they limit the scope of their
application in various ways, for example, by requiring proof of specific harm to identifiable victims. The Act lacks any such limiting features. Although it prohibits only knowing and intentional falsehoods
about readily verifiable facts within the personal knowledge of the
speaker, it otherwise ranges broadly, and that breadth means that it
creates a significant risk of First Amendment harm. Pp. 3−8.
(c) The Act nonetheless has substantial justification. It seeks to
protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their health and life
for their country by seeking to preserve intact the country’s recognition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors. P. 8.
(d) It may, however, be possible substantially to achieve the Government’s objective in less burdensome ways. The First Amendment
risks flowing from the Act’s breadth of coverage could be diminished
or eliminated by a more finely tailored statute, for example, a statute
that requires a showing that the false statement caused specific harm
or is focused on lies more likely to be harmful or on contexts where
such lies are likely to cause harm. Pp. 8−10.
