ALITO, J., dissenting

Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976) (“Untruthful speech, commercial or otherwise, has never been
protected for its own sake”); Gertz, supra, at 340 (“[T]he
erroneous statement of fact is not worthy of constitutional
protection”); Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 389 (1967)
(“[T]he constitutional guarantees [of the First Amendment] can tolerate sanctions against calculated falsehood
without significant impairment of their essential function”); Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 75 (1964)
(“[T]he knowingly false statement and the false statement
made with reckless disregard of the truth, do not enjoy
constitutional protection”).
Consistent with this recognition, many kinds of false
factual statements have long been proscribed without
“ ‘rais[ing] any Constitutional problem.’ ” United States v.
Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6) (quoting
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571572
(1942)). Laws prohibiting fraud, perjury, and defamation,
for example, were in existence when the First Amendment
was adopted, and their constitutionality is now beyond
question. See, e.g., Donaldson v. Read Magazine, Inc., 333
U. S. 178, 190 (1948) (explaining that the government’s
power “to protect people against fraud” has “always been
recognized in this country and is firmly established”);
United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U. S. 87, 97 (1993) (observing that “the constitutionality of perjury statutes is
unquestioned”); Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 256
(1952) (noting that the “prevention and punishment” of
libel “have never been thought to raise any Constitutional
problem”).
We have also described as falling outside the First
Amendment’s protective shield certain false factual statements that were neither illegal nor tortious at the time of
the Amendment’s adoption. The right to freedom of
speech has been held to permit recovery for the intentional
infliction of emotional distress by means of a false state-
