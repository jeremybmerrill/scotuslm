ALITO, J., dissenting

B
While we have repeatedly endorsed the principle that
false statements of fact do not merit First Amendment
protection for their own sake, we have recognized that it is
sometimes necessary to “exten[d] a measure of strategic
protection” to these statements in order to ensure sufficient “ ‘breathing space’ ” for protected speech. Gertz, 418
U. S., at 342 (quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433
(1963)). Thus, in order to prevent the chilling of truthful
speech on matters of public concern, we have held that
liability for the defamation of a public official or figure
requires proof that defamatory statements were made
with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity. See
New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279280
(1964) (civil liability); Garrison, 379 U. S., at 7475 (criminal liability). This same requirement applies when public
officials and figures seek to recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Falwell, 485
U. S., at 5556. And we have imposed “[e]xacting proof
requirements” in other contexts as well when necessary to
ensure that truthful speech is not chilled. Madigan, 538
U. S., at 620 (complainant in a fraud action must show
that the defendant made a knowingly false statement of
material fact with the intent to mislead the listener and
that he succeeded in doing so); see also BE&K Constr., 536
U. S., at 531 (regulation of baseless lawsuits limited to
those that are both “objectively baseless and subjectively
motivated by an unlawful purpose”); Hartlage, 456 U. S.,
at 61 (sustaining as-applied First Amendment challenge to
law prohibiting certain “factual misstatements in the
course of political debate” where there had been no showing that the disputed statement was made “other than in
good faith and without knowledge of its falsity, or . . . with
reckless disregard as to whether it was false or not”). All
of these proof requirements inevitably have the effect of
