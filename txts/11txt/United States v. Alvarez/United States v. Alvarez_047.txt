ALITO, J., dissenting

permit the government to engage in viewpoint discrimination under the guise of regulating unprotected speech), the
potential for abuse of power in these areas is simply too
great.
In stark contrast to hypothetical laws prohibiting false
statements about history, science, and similar matters,
the Stolen Valor Act presents no risk at all that valuable
speech will be suppressed. The speech punished by the
Act is not only verifiably false and entirely lacking in
intrinsic value, but it also fails to serve any instrumental purpose that the First Amendment might protect. Tellingly, when asked at oral argument what truthful speech
the Stolen Valor Act might chill, even respondent’s counsel
conceded that the answer is none. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.
C
Neither of the two opinions endorsed by Justices in the
majority claims that the false statements covered by the
Stolen Valor Act possess either intrinsic or instrumental
value. Instead, those opinions appear to be based on the
distinct concern that the Act suffers from overbreadth.
See ante, at 10 (plurality opinion) (the Act applies to “personal, whispered conversations within a home”); ante, at 8
(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment) (the Act “applies in
family, social, or other private contexts” and in “political
contexts”). But to strike down a statute on the basis that
it is overbroad, it is necessary to show that the statute’s
“overbreadth [is] substantial, not only in an absolute
sense, but also relative to [its] plainly legitimate sweep.”
United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 292 (2008); see
also ibid. (noting that this requirement has been “vigorously enforced”). The plurality and the concurrence do not
even attempt to make this showing.
The plurality additionally worries that a decision sustaining the Stolen Valor Act might prompt Congress and
the state legislatures to enact laws criminalizing lies
