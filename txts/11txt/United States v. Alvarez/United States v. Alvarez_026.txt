UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

tion only upon a showing of “ ‘actual malice’ ”). As so interpreted the statute covers only lies. But although this
interpretation diminishes the extent to which the statute
endangers First Amendment values, it does not eliminate
the threat.
I must concede, as the Government points out, that this
Court has frequently said or implied that false factual
statements enjoy little First Amendment protection. See,
e.g., BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U. S. 516, 531 (2002)
(“[F]alse statements may be unprotected for their own
sake”); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52
(1988) (“False statements of fact are particularly valueless”); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340
(1974) (“[T]he erroneous statement of fact is not worthy of
constitutional protection”).
But these judicial statements cannot be read to mean
“no protection at all.” False factual statements can serve
useful human objectives, for example: in social contexts,
where they may prevent embarrassment, protect privacy,
shield a person from prejudice, provide the sick with comfort, or preserve a child’s innocence; in public contexts,
where they may stop a panic or otherwise preserve calm in
the face of danger; and even in technical, philosophical,
and scientific contexts, where (as Socrates’ methods suggest) examination of a false statement (even if made deliberately to mislead) can promote a form of thought that
ultimately helps realize the truth. See, e.g., 638 F. 3d
666, 673–675 (CA9 2011) (Kozinski, J., concurring in denial
of rehearing en banc) (providing numerous examples); S.
Bok, Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life (1999)
(same); New York Times Co., supra, at 279, n. 19 (“Even a
false statement may be deemed to make a valuable contribution to public debate, since it brings about ‘the clearer
perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by
its collision with error’ ” (quoting J. Mill, On Liberty 15
(Blackwell ed. 1947))).
