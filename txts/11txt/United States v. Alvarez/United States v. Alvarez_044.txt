UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
ALITO, J., dissenting

that many in our society either approve or condone certain
discrete categories of false statements, including false
statements made to prevent harm to innocent victims and
so-called “white lies.” See ante, at 4. But respondent’s
false claim to have received the Medal of Honor did not
fall into any of these categories. His lie did not “prevent
embarrassment, protect privacy, shield a person from
prejudice, provide the sick with comfort, or preserve a
child’s innocence.” Ibid. Nor did his lie “stop a panic or
otherwise preserve calm in the face of danger” or further
philosophical or scientific debate. Ibid. Respondent’s
claim, like all those covered by the Stolen Valor Act,
served no valid purpose.
Respondent and others who join him in attacking the
Stolen Valor Act take a different view. Respondent’s brief
features a veritable paean to lying. According to respondent, his lie about the Medal of Honor was nothing out of
the ordinary for 21st-century Americans. “Everyone lies,”
he says. Brief for Respondent 10. “We lie all the time.”
Ibid. “[H]uman beings are constantly forced to choose the
persona we present to the world, and our choices nearly
always involve intentional omissions and misrepresentations, if not outright deception.” Id., at 39. An academic
amicus tells us that the First Amendment protects the
right to construct “self-aggrandizing fabrications such as
having been awarded a military decoration.” Brief for
Jonathan D. Varat as Amicus Curiae 5.
This radical interpretation of the First Amendment is
not supported by any precedent of this Court. The lies
covered by the Stolen Valor Act have no intrinsic value
and thus merit no First Amendment protection unless
their prohibition would chill other expression that falls
within the Amendment’s scope. I now turn to that question.
