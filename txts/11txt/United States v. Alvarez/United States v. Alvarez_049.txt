ALITO, J., dissenting

members of the Armed Forces who “distinguis[h] [themselves] conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the
risk of [their lives] above and beyond the call of duty.” 10
U. S. C. §3741; see also §§6241, 8741. More than half of
the heroic individuals to have been awarded the Medal of
Honor after World War I received it posthumously.15
Congress was entitled to conclude that falsely claiming to
have won the Medal of Honor is qualitatively different
from even the most prestigious civilian awards and that
the misappropriation of that honor warrants criminal
sanction.

The Stolen Valor Act is a narrow law enacted to address
an important problem, and it presents no threat to freedom of expression. I would sustain the constitutionality of
the Act, and I therefore respectfully dissent.
