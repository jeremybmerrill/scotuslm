SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 11–210.

Argued February 22, 2012—Decided June 28, 2012

The Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime to falsely claim receipt of military decorations or medals and provides an enhanced penalty if the
Congressional Medal of Honor is involved. 18 U. S. C. §§704 (b), (c).
Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely claiming that he had
received the Medal of Honor, but reserved his right to appeal his

prevent.
Absent from these few categories is any general exception for false
statements. The Government argues that cases such as Hustler
Magazine, Inc., v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52, support its claim that
false statements have no value and hence no First Amendment protection. But all the Government’s quotations derive from cases dis-
