ALITO, J., dissenting

As Congress recognized, the lies proscribed by the Stolen Valor Act inflict substantial harm. In many instances,
the harm is tangible in nature: Individuals often falsely
represent themselves as award recipients in order to
obtain financial or other material rewards, such as lucrative contracts and government benefits.10 An investigation
of false claims in a single region of the United States, for
example, revealed that 12 men had defrauded the Department of Veterans Affairs out of more than $1.4 million
in veteran’s benefits.11 In other cases, the harm is less
tangible, but nonetheless significant. The lies proscribed
by the Stolen Valor Act tend to debase the distinctive
honor of military awards. See Stolen Valor Act of 2005,
§2, 120 Stat. 3266, note following 18 U. S. C. §704 (finding
that “[f]raudulent claims surrounding the receipt of [military decorations and medals] damage the reputation and
meaning of such decorations and medals”). And legitimate
award recipients and their families have expressed the
harm they endure when an imposter takes credit for heroic actions that he never performed. One Medal of Honor
recipient described the feeling as a “ ‘slap in the face
of veterans who have paid the price and earned their
medals.’ ”12
It is well recognized in trademark law that the proliferation of cheap imitations of luxury goods blurs the “ ‘signal’

Act apparently “parlayed his medals into lucrative security consulting
contracts.” Zambito, War Crime: FBI Targets Fake Heroes, New York
