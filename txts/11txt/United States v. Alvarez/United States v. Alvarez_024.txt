UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

review, sometimes as an examination of “fit,” and sometimes it has avoided the application of any label at all.
See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512
U. S. 622, 641–652 (1994) (intermediate scrutiny); Randall
v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 249 (2006) (plurality opinion)
(proportionality); Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.
v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (requiring a “fit” between means and ends that is “ ‘in proportion to the interest served’ ”); In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 203 (1982)
(“[I]nterference with speech must be in proportion to the
[substantial governmental] interest served”); Pickering v.
Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,
391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968).
Regardless of the label, some such approach is necessary
if the First Amendment is to offer proper protection in
the many instances in which a statute adversely affects
constitutionally protected interests but warrants neither
near-automatic condemnation (as “strict scrutiny” implies)
nor near-automatic approval (as is implicit in “rational
basis” review). See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc., supra, at 641–652 (“must-carry” cable regulations);
Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n
of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566 (1980) (nonmisleading commercial speech); Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 433–
434 (1992) (election regulation); Pickering, supra, at 568
(government employee speech); United States v. O’Brien,
391 U. S. 367, 377 (1968) (application of generally applicable laws to expressive conduct). I have used the term
“proportionality” to describe this approach. Thompson v.
Western States Medical Center, 535 U. S. 357, 388 (2002)
(dissenting opinion); see also Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532
U. S. 514, 536 (2001) (concurring opinion); Nixon v. Shrink
Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 402–403 (2000)
(concurring opinion). But in this case, the Court’s term
“intermediate scrutiny” describes what I think we should
do.
