ALITO, J., dissenting

ernment service. United States v. Lepowitch, 318 U. S.
702, 704 (1943) (quoting United States v. Barnow, 239
U. S. 74, 80 (1915)). All told, there are more than 100
federal criminal statutes that punish false statements
made in connection with areas of federal agency concern.
See United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 505507, and
nn. 810 (1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing “at least
100 federal false statement statutes” in the United States
Code).
These examples amply demonstrate that false statements of fact merit no First Amendment protection in
their own right.14 It is true, as JUSTICE BREYER notes,

plurality rejects this rule. Although we have made clear that
“[u]ntruthful speech . . . has never been protected for its own sake,”
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,
425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976), the most the plurality is willing to concede is
that “the falsity of speech bears upon whether it is protected,” ante, at
9. This represents a dramatic—and entirely unjustified—departure
from the sound approach taken in past cases.
Respondent and his supporting amici attempt to limit this rule to
certain subsets of false statements, see, e.g., Brief for Respondent 53
(asserting that, at most, only falsity that is proved to cause specific
harm is stripped of its First Amendment protection), but the examples
described above belie that attempt. These examples show that the rule
at least applies to (1) specific types of false statements that were
neither illegal nor tortious in 1791 (the torts of intentional infliction of
emotional distress and false-light invasion of privacy did not exist when
the First Amendment was adopted); (2) false speech that does not cause
pecuniary harm (the harm remedied by the torts of defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false-light invasion of privacy
is often nonpecuniary in nature, as is the harm inflicted by statements
that are illegal under §§912 and 1001); (3) false speech that does not
cause detrimental reliance (neither perjury laws nor many of the
federal false statement statutes require that anyone actually rely on
the false statement); (4) particular false statements that are not shown
in court to have caused specific harm (damages can be presumed in
defamation actions involving knowing or reckless falsehoods, and no
showing of specific harm is required in prosecutions under many of the
federal false statement statutes); and (5) false speech that does not
cause harm to a specific individual (the purpose of many of the federal
