UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

necessity of the statute, the necessity required by exacting
scrutiny.
*
*
*
The Nation well knows that one of the costs of the First
Amendment is that it protects the speech we detest as well
as the speech we embrace. Though few might find respondent’s statements anything but contemptible, his
right to make those statements is protected by the Constitution’s guarantee of freedom of speech and expression.
The Stolen Valor Act infringes upon speech protected by
the First Amendment.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
