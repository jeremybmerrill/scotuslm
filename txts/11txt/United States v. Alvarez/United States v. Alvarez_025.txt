BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

As the dissent points out, “there are broad areas in
which any attempt by the state to penalize purportedly
false speech would present a grave and unacceptable danger of suppressing truthful speech.” Post, at 14. Laws
restricting false statements about philosophy, religion,
history, the social sciences, the arts, and the like raise
such concerns, and in many contexts have called for strict
scrutiny. But this case does not involve such a law. The
dangers of suppressing valuable ideas are lower where, as
here, the regulations concern false statements about easily
verifiable facts that do not concern such subject matter.
Such false factual statements are less likely than are true
factual statements to make a valuable contribution to the
marketplace of ideas. And the government often has
good reasons to prohibit such false speech. See infra, at
5–7 (listing examples of statutes and doctrines regulating
false factual speech). But its regulation can nonetheless
threaten speech-related harms. Those circumstances lead
me to apply what the Court has termed “intermediate
scrutiny” here.

The Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime “falsely” to “represen[t]” oneself “to have been awarded any decoration or
medal authorized by Congress for the Armed Forces of
the United States.” 18 U. S. C. §704(b). I would read the
statute favorably to the Government as criminalizing only
false factual statements made with knowledge of their falsity and with the intent that they be taken as true. See
Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 605 (1994) (courts
construe statutes “in light of the background rules of the
common law, . . . in which the requirement of some mens
rea for a crime is firmly embedded”); cf. New York Times
