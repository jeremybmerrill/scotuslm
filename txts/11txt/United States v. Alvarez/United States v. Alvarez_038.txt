UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
ALITO, J., dissenting

given out by the purchasers of the originals.” Landes &
Posner, Trademark Law: An Economic Perspective, 30 J.
Law & Econ. 265, 308 (1987). In much the same way, the
proliferation of false claims about military awards blurs
the signal given out by the actual awards by making them
seem more common than they really are, and this diluting
effect harms the military by hampering its efforts to foster
morale and esprit de corps. Surely it was reasonable for
Congress to conclude that the goal of preserving the integrity of our country’s top military honors is at least as
worthy as that of protecting the prestige associated with
fancy watches and designer handbags. Cf. San Francisco
Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483
U. S. 522, 539541 (1987) (rejecting First Amendment
challenge to law prohibiting certain unauthorized uses of
the word “Olympic” and recognizing that such uses harm
the U. S. Olympic Committee by “lessening the distinctiveness” of the term).
Both the plurality and JUSTICE BREYER argue that
Congress could have preserved the integrity of military
honors by means other than a criminal prohibition, but
Congress had ample reason to believe that alternative
approaches would not be adequate. The chief alternative
that is recommended is the compilation and release of a
comprehensive list or database of actual medal recipients.
If the public could readily access such a resource, it is
argued, imposters would be quickly and easily exposed,
and the proliferation of lies about military honors would
come to an end.
This remedy, unfortunately, will not work. The Department of Defense has explained that the most that it
can do is to create a database of recipients of certain top
military honors awarded since 2001. See Office of Undersecretary of Defense, Report to the Senate and House
Armed Services Committees on a Searchable Military
