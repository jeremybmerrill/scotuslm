UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

The Government then gives three examples of regulations on false speech that courts generally have found permissible: first, the criminal prohibition of a false statement made to a Government official, 18 U. S. C. §1001;
second, laws punishing perjury; and third, prohibitions on the false representation that one is speaking as a
Government official or on behalf of the Government, see,
e.g., §912; §709. These restrictions, however, do not establish a principle that all proscriptions of false statements
are exempt from exacting First Amendment scrutiny.
The federal statute prohibiting false statements to
Government officials punishes “whoever, in any matter
within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or
judicial branch of the Government . . . makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation.” §1001. Section 1001’s prohibition on false
statements made to Government officials, in communications concerning official matters, does not lead to the broader
proposition that false statements are unprotected when
made to any person, at any time, in any context.
The same point can be made about what the Court has
confirmed is the “unquestioned constitutionality of perjury
statutes,” both the federal statute, §1623, and its state-law
equivalents. United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 54
(1978). See also Konigsberg v. State Bar of Cal., 366 U. S.
36, 51, n. 10 (1961). It is not simply because perjured
statements are false that they lack First Amendment
protection. Perjured testimony “is at war with justice”
because it can cause a court to render a “judgment not
resting on truth.” In re Michael, 326 U. S. 224, 227 (1945).
Perjury undermines the function and province of the law
and threatens the integrity of judgments that are the
basis of the legal system. See United States v. Dunnigan,
507 U. S. 87, 97 (1993) (“To uphold the integrity of our
trial system . . . the constitutionality of perjury statutes is
unquestioned”). Unlike speech in other contexts, testi-
