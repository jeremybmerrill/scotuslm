UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

this title, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.”
Respondent challenges the statute as a content-based
suppression of pure speech, speech not falling within any
of the few categories of expression where content-based
regulation is permissible. The Government defends the
statute as necessary to preserve the integrity and purpose
of the Medal, an integrity and purpose it contends are
compromised and frustrated by the false statements the
statute prohibits. It argues that false statements “have
no First Amendment value in themselves,” and thus “are
protected only to the extent needed to avoid chilling fully
protected speech.” Brief for United States 18, 20. Although the statute covers respondent’s speech, the Government argues that it leaves breathing room for protected speech, for example speech which might criticize
the idea of the Medal or the importance of the military.
The Government’s arguments cannot suffice to save the
statute.

“[A]s a general matter, the First Amendment means
that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its
content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535
U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).
As a result, the Constitution “demands that content-based
restrictions on speech be presumed invalid . . . and that
the Government bear the burden of showing their constitutionality.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,
542 U. S. 656, 660 (2004).
In light of the substantial and expansive threats to free
expression posed by content-based restrictions, this Court
has rejected as “startling and dangerous” a “free-floating
test for First Amendment coverage . . . [based on] an
ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.”
