UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

“freewheeling authority to declare new categories of
speech outside the scope of the First Amendment,” Stevens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), the Court has
acknowledged that perhaps there exist “some categories of
speech that have been historically unprotected . . . but
have not yet been specifically identified or discussed . . . in
our case law.” Ibid. Before exempting a category of
speech from the normal prohibition on content-based restrictions, however, the Court must be presented with “persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is
part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of
proscription,” Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn.,
564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 4). The Government
has not demonstrated that false statements generally
should constitute a new category of unprotected speech on
this basis.

The probable, and adverse, effect of the Act on freedom of expression illustrates, in a fundamental way, the
reasons for the Law’s distrust of content-based speech
prohibitions.
The Act by its plain terms applies to a false statement
made at any time, in any place, to any person. It can be
assumed that it would not apply to, say, a theatrical performance. See Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U. S.
1, 20 (1990) (recognizing that some statements nominally
purporting to contain false facts in reality “cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual” (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).
Still, the sweeping, quite unprecedented reach of the
statute puts it in conflict with the First Amendment. Here
the lie was made in a public meeting, but the statute
would apply with equal force to personal, whispered conversations within a home. The statute seeks to control
and suppress all false statements on this one subject in
