UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

IV
The previous discussion suffices to show that the Act
conflicts with free speech principles. But even when examined within its own narrow sphere of operation, the Act

sacrifice by men and women in uniform reinforces the
pride and national resolve that the military relies upon to
fulfill its mission.
These interests are related to the integrity of the military honors system in general, and the Congressional
