UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. XAVIER ALVAREZ
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[June 28, 2012]

JUSTICE ALITO,
TICE THOMAS join,

with whom JUSTICE SCALIA and JUSdissenting.
Only the bravest of the brave are awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, but the Court today holds that
every American has a constitutional right to claim to have
received this singular award. The Court strikes down the
Stolen Valor Act of 2005, which was enacted to stem an
epidemic of false claims about military decorations. These
lies, Congress reasonably concluded, were undermining
our country’s system of military honors and inflicting real
harm on actual medal recipients and their families.
Building on earlier efforts to protect the military awards
system, Congress responded to this problem by crafting a
narrow statute that presents no threat to the freedom of
speech. The statute reaches only knowingly false statements about hard facts directly within a speaker’s personal knowledge. These lies have no value in and of
themselves, and proscribing them does not chill any
valuable speech.
By holding that the First Amendment nevertheless
shields these lies, the Court breaks sharply from a long
line of cases recognizing that the right to free speech does
not protect false factual statements that inflict real harm
and serve no legitimate interest. I would adhere to that
principle and would thus uphold the constitutionality of
this valuable law.
