Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

military award for valor against an enemy force, has been
given just 3,476 times. Established in 1861, the Medal
is reserved for those who have distinguished themselves
“conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of
his life above and beyond the call of duty.” 10 U. S. C.
§§3741 (Army), 6241 (Navy and Marine Corps), 8741 (Air
Force), 14 U. S. C. §491 (Coast Guard). The stories of
those who earned the Medal inspire and fascinate, from
Dakota Meyer who in 2009 drove five times into the midst
of a Taliban ambush to save 36 lives, see Curtis, President
Obama Awards Medal of Honor to Dakota Meyer, The
White House Blog (Sept. 15, 2011) (all Internet materials
as visited June 25, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file); to Desmond Doss who served as an army medic
on Okinawa and on June 5, 1945, rescued 75 fellow soldiers, and who, after being wounded, gave up his own
place on a stretcher so others could be taken to safety, see
America’s Heroes 88–90 (J. Willbanks ed. 2011); to William Carney who sustained multiple gunshot wounds to
the head, chest, legs, and arm, and yet carried the flag
to ensure it did not touch the ground during the Union
army’s assault on Fort Wagner in July 1863, id., at 44–45.
The rare acts of courage the Medal celebrates led President Truman to say he would “rather have that medal
round my neck than . . . be president of the United States.”
Truman Gives No. 1 Army Medal to 15 Heroes, Washington Post, Oct. 13, 1945, p. 5. The Government’s interest in
protecting the integrity of the Medal of Honor is beyond
question.
But to recite the Government’s compelling interests is
not to end the matter. The First Amendment requires
that the Government’s chosen restriction on the speech
at issue be “actually necessary” to achieve its interest. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
12). There must be a direct causal link between the restriction imposed and the injury to be prevented. See ibid.
