Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

at 7). Instead, content-based restrictions on speech have
been permitted, as a general matter, only when confined
to the few “ ‘historic and traditional categories [of expression] long familiar to the bar,’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5)
(quoting Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State
Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991) (KENNEDY,
J., concurring in judgment)). Among these categories are
advocacy intended, and likely, to incite imminent lawless
action, see Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969)
(per curiam); obscenity, see, e.g., Miller v. California, 413
U. S. 15 (1973); defamation, see, e.g., New York Times Co.
v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964) (providing substantial
protection for speech about public figures); Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974) (imposing some limits on
liability for defaming a private figure); speech integral to
criminal conduct, see, e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage &
Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490 (1949); so-called “fighting words,”
see Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 (1942);
child pornography, see New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747
(1982); fraud, see Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia
Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976);
true threats, see Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705
(1969) (per curiam); and speech presenting some grave
and imminent threat the government has the power to
prevent, see Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S.
697, 716 (1931), although a restriction under the last
category is most difficult to sustain, see New York Times
Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (per curiam).
These categories have a historical foundation in the
Court’s free speech tradition. The vast realm of free
speech and thought always protected in our tradition can
still thrive, and even be furthered, by adherence to those
categories and rules.
Absent from those few categories where the law allows
content-based regulation of speech is any general exception to the First Amendment for false statements. This
