UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
ALITO, J., dissenting

JUSTICE BREYER also proposes narrowing the statute so
that it covers a shorter list of military awards, ante, at 9
(opinion concurring in judgment), but he does not provide
a hint about where he thinks the line must be drawn.
Perhaps he expects Congress to keep trying until it eventually passes a law that draws the line in just the right
place.

A

Time and again, this Court has recognized that as a
general matter false factual statements possess no intrinsic First Amendment value. See Illinois ex rel. Madigan v.
Telemarketing Associates, Inc., 538 U. S. 600, 612 (2003)
(“Like other forms of public deception, fraudulent charitable solicitation is unprotected speech”); BE&K Constr. Co.
v. NLRB, 536 U. S. 516, 531 (2002) (“[F]alse statements
may be unprotected for their own sake”); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52 (1988) (“False statements of fact are particularly valueless; they interfere
with the truth-seeking function of the marketplace of
ideas, and they cause damage to an individual’s reputation
that cannot easily be repaired by counterspeech, however
persuasive or effective”); Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,
465 U. S. 770, 776 (1984) (“There is ‘no constitutional
value in false statements of fact’ ” (quoting Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340 (1974))); Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 743 (1983)
(“[F]alse statements are not immunized by the First
Amendment right to freedom of speech”); Brown v.
Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 60 (1982) (“Of course, demonstrable falsehoods are not protected by the First Amendment
in the same manner as truthful statements”); Herbert v.
Lando, 441 U. S. 153, 171 (1979) (“Spreading false information in and of itself carries no First Amendment credentials”); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens
