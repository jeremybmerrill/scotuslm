UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
ALITO, J., dissenting

Medal of Honor.3 An investigation of the 333 people listed
in the online edition of Who’s Who as having received a
top military award revealed that fully a third of the claims
could not be substantiated.4 When the Library of Congress compiled oral histories for its Veterans History
Project, 24 of the 49 individuals who identified themselves
as Medal of Honor recipients had not actually received
that award.5 The same was true of 32 individuals who
claimed to have been awarded the Distinguished Service
Cross and 14 who claimed to have won the Navy Cross.6
Notorious cases brought to Congress’ attention included
the case of a judge who falsely claimed to have been
awarded two Medals of Honor and displayed counterfeit
medals in his courtroom;7 a television network’s military
consultant who falsely claimed that he had received the
Silver Star;8 and a former judge advocate in the Marine
Corps who lied about receiving the Bronze Star and a
Purple Heart.9
