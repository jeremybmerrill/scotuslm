UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. XAVIER ALVAREZ
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 28, 2012] 


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE KAGAN joins, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the plurality that the Stolen Valor Act of
2005 violates the First Amendment. But I do not rest my
conclusion upon a strict categorical analysis. Ante, at 4–
10. Rather, I base that conclusion upon the fact that the
statute works First Amendment harm, while the Government can achieve its legitimate objectives in less restrictive ways.

In determining whether a statute violates the First
Amendment, this Court has often found it appropriate to
examine the fit between statutory ends and means. In
doing so, it has examined speech-related harms, justifications, and potential alternatives. In particular, it has
taken account of the seriousness of the speech-related
harm the provision will likely cause, the nature and importance of the provision’s countervailing objectives, the
extent to which the provision will tend to achieve those
objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive
ways of doing so. Ultimately the Court has had to determine whether the statute works speech-related harm that
is out of proportion to its justifications.
Sometimes the Court has referred to this approach as
“intermediate scrutiny,” sometimes as “proportionality”
