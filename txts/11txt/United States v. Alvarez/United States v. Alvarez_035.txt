ALITO, J., dissenting

the Act is strictly viewpoint neutral. The false statements
proscribed by the Act are highly unlikely to be tied to
any particular political or ideological message. In the rare
cases where that is not so, the Act applies equally to all
false statements, whether they tend to disparage or commend the Government, the military, or the system of military honors.
The Stolen Valor Act follows a long tradition of efforts to
protect our country’s system of military honors. When
George Washington, as the commander of the Continental
Army, created the very first “honorary badges of distinction” for service in our country’s military, he established
a rigorous system to ensure that these awards would be
received and worn by only the truly deserving. See General Orders of George Washington Issued at Newburgh
on the Hudson, 1782–1783, p. 35 (E. Boynton ed. 1883)
(reprint 1973) (requiring the submission of “incontestible proof ” of “singularly meritorious action” to the Commander in Chief). Washington warned that anyone with the
“insolence to assume” a badge that had not actually been
earned would be “severely punished.” Id., at 34.
Building on this tradition, Congress long ago made it a
federal offense for anyone to wear, manufacture, or sell
certain military decorations without authorization. See
Act of Feb. 24, 1923, ch. 110, 42 Stat. 1286 (codified as
amended at 18 U. S. C. §704(a)). Although this Court has
never opined on the constitutionality of that particular
provision, we have said that §702, which makes it a crime
to wear a United States military uniform without authorization, is “a valid statute on its face.” Schacht v. United
States, 398 U. S. 58, 61 (1970).
Congress passed the Stolen Valor Act in response to a
proliferation of false claims concerning the receipt of
military awards. For example, in a single year, more than
600 Virginia residents falsely claimed to have won the
