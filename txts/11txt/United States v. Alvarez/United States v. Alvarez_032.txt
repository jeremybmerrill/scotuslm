UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ
BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

the Committee to Elect Gerald D. Lostracco v. Fox, 150
Mich. App. 617, 389 N. W. 2d 446 (1986) (upholding under
First Amendment statute prohibiting campaign material
falsely claiming that one is an incumbent). Without expressing any view on the validity of those cases, I would
also note, like the plurality, that in this area more accurate information will normally counteract the lie. And an
accurate, publicly available register of military awards,
easily obtainable by political opponents, may well adequately protect the integrity of an award against those
who would falsely claim to have earned it. See ante, at
17–18. And so it is likely that a more narrowly tailored
statute combined with such information-disseminating
devices will effectively serve Congress’ end.
The Government has provided no convincing explanation as to why a more finely tailored statute would not
work. In my own view, such a statute could significantly
reduce the threat of First Amendment harm while permitting the statute to achieve its important protective objective. That being so, I find the statute as presently drafted
works disproportionate constitutional harm. It consequently fails intermediate scrutiny, and so violates the
First Amendment.
For these reasons, I concur in the Court’s judgment.
