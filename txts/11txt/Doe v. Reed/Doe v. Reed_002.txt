DOE v. REED
ALITO, J., dissenting

retaliation or how severe the nature of the threats. Id., at
15. Whether this is a correct interpretation of our cases
presents an important question that merits serious appellate review.
The alternative basis for the District Court’s holding—
that petitioners did not present sufficient evidence of
threatened harm—also presents an important legal issue,
namely, the type and quantity of proof that persons objecting to disclosure must adduce. As Judge N. R. Smith
observed below, petitioners adduced evidence that some
supporters of the referendum “received death threats,”
“had their children threatened,” and suffered various
indignities, No. 11–35854 (CA9, Nov. 16, 2011), p. 8 (dissenting opinion), but according to the District Court, this
was not enough. Whether the standard of proof applied by
the District Court provides any real protection for persons
who are threatened with retaliation for asserting their
First Amendment rights is an important issue that merits
considered appellate review.
There has been no such review in this case. When
petitioners took an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the panel
denied the stay application over Judge Smith’s protest
that the majority had “race[d] to decide the case at [a]
preliminary stage based on incomplete information and
without even reviewing the record.” Id., at 3.
This Court now takes a similar approach. Particularly
since the referendum at issue went down to defeat more
than two years ago, the Court’s haste is hard to understand. I would grant a stay at least until the Court has
had an opportunity to review the record and to consider
the parties’ arguments.
