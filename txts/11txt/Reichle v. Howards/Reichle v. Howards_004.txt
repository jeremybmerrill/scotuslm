REICHLE v. HOWARDS
Opinion of the Court

the Vice President. When Howards approached the Vice
President, he told him that his “ ‘policies in Iraq are disgusting.’ ” Ibid. The Vice President simply thanked Howards and moved along, but Howards touched the Vice
President’s shoulder as the Vice President departed.1
Howards then walked away.
Several agents observed Howards’ encounter with the
Vice President. The agents determined that Agent Reichle,
who coordinated the protective intelligence team responsible for interviewing individuals suspected of violating the law, should question Howards. Agent Reichle had
not personally heard Howards’ comments or seen his contact with the Vice President, but Agent Doyle briefed
Agent Reichle on what had happened.
Agent Reichle approached Howards, presented his
badge and identified himself, and asked to speak with
him. Howards refused and attempted to walk away. At
that point, Agent Reichle stepped in front of Howards and
asked if he had assaulted the Vice President. Pointing his
finger at Agent Reichle, Howards denied assaulting the
Vice President and told Agent Reichle, “if you don’t want
other people sharing their opinions, you should have him
[the Vice President] avoid public places.” Howards v.
McLaughlin, 634 F. 3d 1131, 1137 (CA10 2011) (internal
quotation marks omitted). During this exchange, Agent
Reichle also asked Howards whether he had touched the
Vice President. Howards falsely denied doing so. After
confirming that Agent Doyle had indeed seen Howards
touch the Vice President, Reichle arrested Howards.
The Secret Service transferred Howards to the custody
of the local sheriff ’s department. Howards was charged by
local officials with harassment in violation of state law.

1 The parties dispute the manner of the touch. Howards described it
as an open-handed pat, while several Secret Service agents described it
as a forceful push. This dispute does not affect our analysis.
