Opinion of the Court

peals denying petitioners qualified immunity.4
III
Qualified immunity shields government officials from
civil damages liability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at
the time of the challenged conduct. See Ashcroft v. alKidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3). In Pearson
v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009), we held that courts
may grant qualified immunity on the ground that a purported right was not “clearly established” by prior case
law, without resolving the often more difficult question
whether the purported right exists at all. Id., at 227. This
approach comports with our usual reluctance to decide
constitutional questions unnecessarily. Id., at 241; see
also Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ – ___ (2011)
(slip op., at 9–10); al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).
To be clearly established, a right must be sufficiently
clear “that every ‘reasonable official would [have understood] that what he is doing violates that right.’ ” Id., at
___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483
U. S. 635, 640 (1987)). In other words, “existing precedent
must have placed the statutory or constitutional question
beyond debate.” 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). This
“clearly established” standard protects the balance between vindication of constitutional rights and government
officials’ effective performance of their duties by ensuring

4 This Court has recognized an implied cause of action for damages
against federal officials for Fourth Amendment violations. See Bivens
v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). We have
never held that Bivens extends to First Amendment claims. See
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 675 (2009) (assuming without deciding
that a First Amendment free exercise claim is actionable under Bivens);
Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, 368 (1983) (refusing to extend Bivens to a
First Amendment speech claim involving federal employment). We
need not (and do not) decide here whether Bivens extends to First
Amendment retaliatory arrest claims.
