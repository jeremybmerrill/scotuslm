REICHLE ET AL. v. HOWARDS
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE TENTH CIRCUIT
No. 11–262.

Argued March 21, 2012—Decided June 4, 2012

Petitioners Reichle and Doyle were members of a Secret Service detail
protecting Vice President Richard Cheney while he greeted members
of the public at a shopping mall. Agent Doyle overheard respondent

Federal District Court denied the motion. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit reversed the immunity ruling with respect to the Fourth
Amendment claim because petitioners had probable cause to arrest
Howards, but the court affirmed with regard to the First Amendment
claim. In doing so, the court rejected petitioners’ argument that, under Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, probable cause to arrest defeats
a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim. It concluded instead
that Hartman applied only to retaliatory prosecution claims and thus
did not upset prior Tenth Circuit precedent holding that a retaliatory
arrest violates the First Amendment even if supported by probable
