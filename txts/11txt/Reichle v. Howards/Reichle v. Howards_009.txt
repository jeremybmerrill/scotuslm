Opinion of the Court

B
We next consider Tenth Circuit precedent. Assuming arguendo that controlling Court of Appeals’ authority could
be a dispositive source of clearly established law in the
circumstances of this case, the Tenth Circuit’s cases do not
satisfy the “clearly established” standard here.
Relying on DeLoach v. Bevers, 922 F. 2d 618 (1990), and
Poole v. County of Otero, 271 F. 3d 955 (2001), the Court of
Appeals concluded that, at the time of Howards’ arrest, its
precedent had clearly established the unlawfulness of an
arrest in retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment
rights, irrespective of probable cause. In DeLoach, a case
involving both a retaliatory arrest and a retaliatory prosecution, the court held that “[a]n act taken in retaliation for
the exercise of a constitutionally protected right is actionable under §1983 even if the act, when taken for a different reason, would have been proper.” 922 F. 2d, at
620 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Poole, a subsequent retaliatory prosecution case, the court relied on
DeLoach for the proposition that a plaintiff ’s illegal conduct is “not relevant to his First Amendment claim.” 271
F. 3d, at 961.
The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Poole was
abrogated by this Court’s subsequent decision in Hartman
v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, which held that a plaintiff cannot
state a claim of retaliatory prosecution in violation of the
First Amendment if the charges were supported by probable cause. But the Court of Appeals determined that
Hartman’s no-probable-cause requirement did not extend
to claims of retaliatory arrest and therefore did not disturb
—————— 

such a “high level of generality.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___

(2011) (slip op., at 10). Whren’s discussion of the Fourteenth Amendment does not indicate, much less “clearly establish,” that an arrest

supported by probable cause could nonetheless violate the First

Amendment.
