REICHLE v. HOWARDS
Opinion of the Court

The court first determined that Howards had established
a material factual dispute regarding whether petitioners
were substantially motivated by Howards’ speech when
they arrested him. Id., at 1144–1145. The court then
rejected petitioners’ argument that, under this Court’s
decision in Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250 (2006), probable cause to arrest defeats a First Amendment claim of
retaliatory arrest. The court concluded that Hartman
established such a rule only for retaliatory prosecution
claims and, therefore, did not upset prior Tenth Circuit
precedent clearly establishing that a retaliatory arrest
violates the First Amendment even if supported by probable cause. 634 F. 3d, at 1148.
Judge Paul Kelly dissented from the court’s denial of
qualified immunity. He would have held that when Howards was arrested, it was not clearly established that an
arrest supported by probable cause could violate the First
Amendment. In Judge Kelly’s view, Hartman called into
serious question the Tenth Circuit’s prior precedent on
retaliatory arrests. 634 F. 3d, at 1151. He noted that
other Circuits had applied Hartman to retaliatory arrests
and that there was a “strong argument” in favor of doing
so. 634 F. 3d, at 1151–1152.
We granted certiorari on two questions: whether a First
Amendment retaliatory arrest claim may lie despite the
presence of probable cause to support the arrest, and
whether clearly established law at the time of Howards’
arrest so held. See 565 U. S. ___ (2011). If the answer
to either question is “no,” then the agents are entitled to
qualified immunity. We elect to address only the second
question. We conclude that, at the time of Howards’ arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could violate the First Amendment.
We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Ap-
