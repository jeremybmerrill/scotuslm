Opinion of the Court

The charge was eventually dismissed.
II
Howards brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado under Rev. Stat.
§1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.
Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971).2 Howards alleged
that he was arrested and searched without probable cause,
in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Howards also alleged that he was arrested in retaliation for criticizing
the Vice President, in violation of the First Amendment.
Petitioners Reichle and Doyle moved for summary
judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The District Court denied the motion. See
App. to Pet. for Cert. 46–61. On interlocutory appeal, a
divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 634
F. 3d 1131.
The Court of Appeals held that petitioners enjoyed
qualified immunity with respect to Howards’ Fourth
Amendment claim. The court concluded that petitioners
had probable cause to arrest Howards for making a materially false statement to a federal official in violation of 18
U. S. C. §1001 because he falsely denied touching the Vice
President. 634 F. 3d, at 1142. Thus, the court concluded
that neither Howards’ arrest nor search incident to the
arrest violated the Fourth Amendment.3 Id., at 1142–
1143.
However, the Court of Appeals denied petitioners qualified immunity from Howards’ First Amendment claim.
——————
2 Howards named several Secret Service agents as defendants, but
only Agents Reichle and Doyle are petitioners here. We address only
those parts of the lower courts’ decisions that involve petitioners
Reichle and Doyle.
3 Howards does not challenge the Court of Appeals’ probable-cause
determination.
