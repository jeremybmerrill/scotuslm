REICHLE v. HOWARDS
Opinion of the Court

its prior precedent in DeLoach. Accordingly, the court
concluded, “when Mr. Howards was arrested it was clearly
established that an arrest made in retaliation of an individual’s First Amendment rights is unlawful, even if the
arrest is supported by probable cause.” 634 F. 3d, at 1148.
We disagree. At the time of Howards’ arrest, Hartman’s
impact on the Tenth Circuit’s precedent governing retaliatory arrests was far from clear. Although the facts of
Hartman involved only a retaliatory prosecution, reasonable officers could have questioned whether the rule of
Hartman also applied to arrests.
Hartman was decided against a legal backdrop that
treated retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims similarly.
Hartman resolved a split among the Courts of Appeals
about the relevance of probable cause in retaliatory prosecution suits, but some of the conflicting court of appeals
cases involved both an arrest and a prosecution that were
alleged to be retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights. See 547 U. S., at 255–256, 259, n. 6 (citing
Mozzochi v. Borden, 959 F. 2d 1174 (CA2 1992); Singer v.
Fulton Cty. Sheriff, 63 F. 3d 110 (CA2 1995); Keenan v.
Tejeda, 290 F. 3d 252 (CA5 2002); Wood v. Kesler, 323
F. 3d 872 (CA11 2003)). Those cases made no distinction
between claims of retaliatory arrest and claims of retaliatory prosecution when considering the relevance of probable cause. See Mozzochi, supra, at 1179–1180; Singer,
supra, at 120; Keenan, supra, at 260; Wood, supra, at 883.
Indeed, the close relationship between retaliatory arrest
and prosecution claims is well demonstrated by the Tenth
Circuit’s own decision in DeLoach. DeLoach, too, involved
allegations of both retaliatory arrest and retaliatory prosecution, and the Tenth Circuit analyzed the two claims as
one. 922 F. 2d, at 620–621.
A reasonable official also could have interpreted Hartman’s rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests. Hartman
first observed that, in retaliatory prosecution cases, evi-
