REICHLE v. HOWARDS
Opinion of the Court

that officials can “ ‘reasonably . . . anticipate when their
conduct may give rise to liability for damages.’ ” Anderson,
supra, at 639 (quoting Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, 195
(1984)).
The “clearly established” standard is not satisfied here.
This Court has never recognized a First Amendment right
to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by
probable cause; nor was such a right otherwise clearly
established at the time of Howards’ arrest.

Howards contends that our cases have “settled” the rule
that, “ ‘as a general matter[,] the First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to
retaliatory actions’ ” for his speech. See Brief for Respondent 39 (quoting Hartman, supra, at 256). But we have
previously explained that the right allegedly violated must
be established, “ ‘not as a broad general proposition,’ ”
Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 198 (2004)
(per curiam), but in a “particularized” sense so that the
“contours” of the right are clear to a reasonable official,
Anderson, supra, at 640. Here, the right in question is not
the general right to be free from retaliation for one’s
speech, but the more specific right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable
cause. This Court has never held that there is such a
right.5

5 The Court of Appeals’ reliance on Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.
806 (1996), was misplaced. There, we held that a traffic stop supported
by probable cause did not violate the Fourth Amendment regardless
of the officer’s actual motivations, but we explained that the Equal
Protection Clause would prohibit an officer from selectively enforcing
the traffic laws based on race. Id., at 813. Citing Whren, the Court of
Appeals noted that “[i]t is well established that an act which is lawful
under the Fourth Amendment may still violate other provisions of the
Constitution.” Howards v. McLaughlin, 634 F. 3d 1131, 1149, n. 15
(CA10 2011). But, again, we do not define clearly established law at
