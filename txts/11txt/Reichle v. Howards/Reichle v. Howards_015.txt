[June 4, 2012]


JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
concurring in the judgment.
Were defendants ordinary law enforcement officers, I
would hold that Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250 (2006),

in a retaliatory-prosecution case] is not merely between
the retaliatory animus of one person and that person’s
own injurious action, but between the retaliatory animus
of one person and the action of another.” Hartman, 547
U. S., at 262. This “distinct problem of causation” justified
the absence-of-probable-cause requirement we recognized

cause to prosecute is needed “to bridge the gap between
the nonprosecuting government agent’s motive and the
prosecutor’s action.”). See also id., at 259 (“[T]he need to
