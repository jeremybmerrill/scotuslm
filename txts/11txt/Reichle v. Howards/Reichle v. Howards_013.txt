Opinion of the Court

Howards’ arrest, the Sixth Circuit held that Hartman
required a plaintiff alleging a retaliatory arrest to show
that the defendant officer lacked probable cause. See
Barnes v. Wright, 449 F. 3d 709, 720 (2006) (reasoning
that the Hartman “rule sweeps broadly”). That court’s
treatment of Hartman confirms that the inapplicability of
Hartman to arrests would not have been clear to a reasonable officer when Howards was arrested. Moreover, since
Howards’ arrest, additional Courts of Appeals have concluded that Hartman’s no-probable-cause requirement
extends to retaliatory arrests. See, e.g., McCabe v. Parker,
608 F. 3d 1068, 1075 (CA8 2010); Phillips v. Irvin, 222
Fed. Appx. 928, 929 (CA11 2007) (per curiam). As we have
previously observed, “[i]f judges thus disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money
damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.”
Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 618 (1999).7

Hartman injected uncertainty into the law governing
retaliatory arrests, particularly in light of Hartman’s
rationale and the close relationship between retaliatory
arrest and prosecution claims. This uncertainty was only
confirmed by subsequent appellate decisions that disagreed over whether the reasoning in Hartman applied
similarly to retaliatory arrests. Accordingly, when Howards was arrested it was not clearly established that an
arrest supported by probable cause could give rise to a
First Amendment violation. Petitioners Reichle and Doyle
are thus entitled to qualified immunity.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and

7 Indeed, the Tenth Circuit itself has applied Hartman outside the
context of retaliatory prosecution. See McBeth v. Himes, 598 F. 3d 708,
719 (2010) (requiring the absence of probable cause in the context of a
claim alleging that government officials suspended a business license in
retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights).
