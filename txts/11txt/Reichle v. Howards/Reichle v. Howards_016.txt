REICHLE v. HOWARDS
GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment

details specific to retaliatory-prosecution cases, . . . provides the strongest justification for the no-probable-cause
requirement.” (emphasis added)).
A similar causation problem will not arise in the typical retaliatory-arrest case. Unlike prosecutors, arresting
officers are not wholly immune from suit. As a result, a
plaintiff can sue the arresting officer directly and need
only show that the officer (not some other official) acted
with a retaliatory motive. Because, in the usual retaliatoryarrest case, there is no gap to bridge between one government official’s animus and a second government official’s action, Hartman’s no-probable-cause requirement is
inapplicable.
Nevertheless, I concur in the Court’s judgment. Officers
assigned to protect public officials must make singularly
swift, on the spot, decisions whether the safety of the
person they are guarding is in jeopardy. In performing
that protective function, they rightly take into account
words spoken to, or in the proximity of, the person whose
safety is their charge. Whatever the views of Secret Service Agents Reichle and Doyle on the administration’s
policies in Iraq, they were duty bound to take the content of Howards’ statements into account in determining
whether he posed an immediate threat to the Vice President’s physical security. Retaliatory animus cannot be
inferred from the assessment they made in that regard. If
rational, that assessment should not expose them to
claims for civil damages. Cf. 18 U. S. C. §3056(d) (knowingly and willfully resisting federal law enforcement agent
engaged in protective function is punishable by fine (up to
$1,000) and imprisonment (up to one year)); §1751(e)
(assaulting President or Vice President is a crime punishable by fine and imprisonment up to ten years).
