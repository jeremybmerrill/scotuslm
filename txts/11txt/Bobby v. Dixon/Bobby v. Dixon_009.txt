Per Curiam

Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the
Miranda warnings did not “effectively advise the suspect
that he had a real choice about giving an admissible
statement” because the unwarned and warned interroga­
tions blended into one “continuum.” 542 U. S., at 612, 617.
Given all the circumstances of this case, that is not so
here. Four hours passed between Dixon’s unwarned inter­
rogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which
time he traveled from the police station to a separate jail
and back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and
learned that police were talking to his accomplice and
had found Hammer’s body. Things had changed. Under
Seibert, this significant break in time and dramatic
change in circumstances created “a new and distinct expe­
rience,” ensuring that Dixon’s prior, unwarned interroga­
tion did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda
warnings he received before confessing to Hammer’s mur­
der. 542 U. S., at 615; see also id., at 622 (KENNEDY, J.,
concurring in judgment) (“For example, a substantial
break in time and circumstances between the prewarning
statement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most
circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the
two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has
taken a new turn”).4
The admission of Dixon’s murder confession was con­
sistent with this Court’s precedents: Dixon received Mi——————

erroneously placed the burden of proof on Dixon to prove that his
confession was coerced.” Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d 553, 558 (2010). But
the Ohio Supreme Court clearly said that “the state carries the burden
of proving voluntariness.” State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 332,
2004–Ohio–1585, 805 N. E. 2d 1042, 1050. That the court’s opinion
discusses the absence of evidence of coerciveness alongside the affirma­
tive evidence of voluntariness in no way indicates that the court shifted
the burden onto Dixon.
