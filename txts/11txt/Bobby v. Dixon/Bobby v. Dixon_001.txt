SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
DAVID BOBBY, WARDEN v. ARCHIE DIXON
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–1540. Decided November 7, 2011


PER CURIAM.
Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act, a state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus from
a federal court “must show that the state court’s ruling on
the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking
in justification that there was an error well understood
and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility
for fairminded disagreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 562
U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13). The Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit purported to identify three such
grievous errors in the Ohio Supreme Court’s affirmance of
respondent Archie Dixon’s murder conviction. Because it
is not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court erred at all,
much less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist
could agree with that court’s decision, the Sixth Circuit’s
judgment must be reversed.
