Per Curiam

The Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon’s first interrogation involved “an intentional Miranda violation.”
The court concluded, however, that “as in Elstad, the
breach of the Miranda procedures here involved no actual
compulsion” and thus there was no reason to suppress
Dixon’s later, warned confession. 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334,
805 N. E. 2d, at 1052 (citing Elstad, supra, at 318).
The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixon’s
confession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was
the product of a “deliberate question-first, warn-later
strategy.” 627 F. 3d, at 557. In so holding, the Sixth
Circuit relied heavily on this Court’s decision in Missouri
v. Seibert, 542 U. S. 600 (2004).3 In Seibert, police em­
ployed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda
warnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert
until she confessed to murder and then, after a 15- to 20­
minute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her
to repeat her prior confession. 542 U. S., at 604–606, 616
(plurality opinion). The Court held that Seibert’s second
confession was inadmissible as evidence against her even
though it was preceded by a Miranda warning. A plurali­
ty of the Court reasoned that “[u]pon hearing warnings
only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after mak­

3 Seibert was not decided until after the Ohio Supreme Court’s opin­
ion in this case, but was issued before this Court denied Dixon’s peti­
tion for certiorari seeking review of the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision.
It is thus an open question whether Seibert was “clearly established
Federal law” for purposes of §2254(d). See Smith v. Spisak¸ 558 U. S.
___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 3). It is not necessary to decide that ques­
tion here because Seibert is entirely consistent with the Ohio Supreme
Court’s decision. Thus, if Seibert was clearly established law, the Ohio
Supreme Court’s decision was not “contrary to” or “an unreasonable
application of” Seibert. §2254(d). And if Seibert was not clearly estab­
lished law, Seibert’s explication of Elstad further demonstrates that the
Ohio Supreme Court’s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable
application of Elstad.
