BOBBY v. DIXON
Per Curiam

The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon’s convictions
and sentence. To analyze the admissibility of Dixon’s
murder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad, 470
U. S. 298 (1985). The Ohio Supreme Court found that
Dixon’s confession to murder after receiving Miranda
warnings was admissible because that confession and his
prior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary.
State v. Dixon, supra, at 332–334, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1050–
1052; see Elstad, supra, at 318 (“We hold today that a
suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoer­
cive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his
rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite
Miranda warnings”).
Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus
under 28 U. S. C. §2254 in the U. S. District Court for the
Northern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, inter alia, that
the state court decisions allowing the admission of his
murder confession contravened clearly established federal
law. The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel
of the Sixth Circuit reversed. Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d
553 (2010).
The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of
habeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision
“was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application
of, clearly established Federal law,” as set forth in this
Court’s holdings, or was “based on an unreasonable de­
termination of the facts” in light of the state court record.
§2254(d); see Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).
The Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court’s
decision contained three such egregious errors.
First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the Miranda deci­
sion itself clearly established that police could not speak to
Dixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had
refused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is
plainly wrong. It is undisputed that Dixon was not in
custody during his chance encounter with police on No­
