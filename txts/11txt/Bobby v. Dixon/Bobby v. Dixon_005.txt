vember 4. And this Court has “never held that a person
can invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context
other than ‘custodial interrogation.’ ” McNeil v. Wisconsin,
501 U. S. 171, 182, n. 3 (1991); see also Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 16) (“If the
defendant is not in custody then [Miranda and its proge­
ny] do not apply”).
Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the
Fifth Amendment by urging Dixon to “cut a deal” before
his accomplice Hoffner did so.1 The Sixth Circuit cited no
precedent of this Court—or any court—holding that this
common police tactic is unconstitutional. Cf., e.g., Elstad,
supra, at 317 (“[T]he Court has refused to find that a
defendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his
codefendant has turned State’s evidence, does so involun­
tarily”). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much
less clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect
to confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit
had no authority to issue the writ on this ground.2

1 In the Sixth Circuit’s view, the Ohio Supreme Court’s contrary con­
clusion that Dixon’s confession was voluntary “was based on an unrea­
sonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in
the State court proceeding.” §2254(d)(2). The Sixth Circuit did not,
however, purport to identify any mistaken factual finding. It differed
with the Ohio Supreme Court only on the ultimate characterization of
Dixon’s confession as voluntary, and this Court’s cases make clear that
“the ultimate issue of ‘voluntariness’ is a legal question.” Miller v.
Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 110 (1985); see also Arizona v. Fulminante, 499
U. S. 279, 287 (1991). This Court therefore addresses the question the
Sixth Circuit should have addressed: whether the Ohio Supreme
Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica­
tion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States.” §2254(d)(1).
2 The only case the Sixth Circuit cited on this issue was Mincey v.
Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978). Mincey involved the “virtually continu­
ous questioning of a seriously and painfully wounded man on the edge
of consciousness” who was in a hospital’s intensive care unit and who
