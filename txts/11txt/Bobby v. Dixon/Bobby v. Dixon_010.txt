BOBBY v. DIXON
Per Curiam

randa warnings before confessing to Hammer’s murder;
the effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by
the sort of “two-step interrogation technique” condemned
in Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixon’s
statements was the product of actual coercion. That does
not excuse the detectives’ decision not to give Dixon Miranda warnings before his first interrogation. But the
Ohio courts recognized that failure and imposed the ap­
propriate remedy: exclusion of Dixon’s forgery confession
and the attendant statements given without the benefit of
Miranda warnings. Because no precedent of this Court
required Ohio to do more, the Sixth Circuit was without
authority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State’s
highest court.
The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s
motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
