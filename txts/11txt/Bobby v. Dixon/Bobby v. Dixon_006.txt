BOBBY v. DIXON
Per Curiam

Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme
Court unreasonably applied this Court’s precedent in
Elstad. In that case, a suspect who had not received
Miranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took
him into custody. Approximately an hour later, after he
had received Miranda warnings, the suspect again con­
fessed to the same burglary. This Court held that the
later, warned confession was admissible because “there is
no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the sus­
pect’s initial inculpatory statement, though technically
in violation of Miranda, was voluntary. The relevant
inquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] statement
was also voluntarily made.” 470 U. S., at 318 (footnote
omitted).
As the Ohio Supreme Court’s opinion explained, the
circumstances surrounding Dixon’s interrogations demon­
strate that his statements were voluntary. During Dixon’s
first interrogation, he received several breaks, was given
water and offered food, and was not abused or threatened.
He freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer’s
name, even stating that the police were “welcome” to that
information, and he had no difficulty denying that he had
anything to do with Hammer’s disappearance. State v.
Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1049.
Prior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolic­
ited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and
wanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer.
Then, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice
received Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights
form which stated that he was acting of his own free will.
——————
“clearly expressed his wish not to be interrogated” while in a “debilitat­
ed and helpless condition.” Id., at 399–401. There is simply nothing in
the facts or reasoning of Mincey suggesting that any of Dixon’s state­
ments were involuntary.
