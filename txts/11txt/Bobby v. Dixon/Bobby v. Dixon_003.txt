told him. Dixon insisted that he had told police everything
he knew and that he had “[n]othing whatsoever” to do
with Hammer’s disappearance. Id., at 186a. At approxi­
mately 3:30 p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the
detectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where
he was booked on a forgery charge.
The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer’s
grave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that
Hammer was buried there. After concluding their inter­
view with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon
transported back to the police station.
Dixon arrived at the police station at about 7:30 p.m.
Prior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had
heard the police had found a body and asked whether
Hoffner was in custody. The police told Dixon that
Hoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, “I talked to
my attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.” State
v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 331, 2004–Ohio–1585, 805
N. E. 2d 1042, 1050. The police read Dixon his Miranda
rights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke
with Dixon for about half an hour. At 8 p.m. the police,
now using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his
Miranda rights. In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted
to murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion’s
share of the blame on Hoffner.
At Dixon’s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both
Dixon’s initial confession to forgery and his later confes­
sion to murder. The State took an interlocutory appeal.
The State did not dispute that Dixon’s forgery confession
was properly suppressed, but argued that the murder
confession was admissible because Dixon had received
Miranda warnings prior to that confession. The Ohio
Court of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon’s murder
confession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convict­
ed of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sen­
tenced to death.
