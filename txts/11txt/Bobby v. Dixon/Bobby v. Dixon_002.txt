BOBBY v. DIXON
Per Curiam

pearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three
of which are relevant here. On November 4, 1993, a police
detective spoke with Dixon at a local police station. It is
undisputed that this was a chance encounter—Dixon was
apparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own
car, which had been impounded for a traffic violation. The
detective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then
asked to talk to him about Hammer’s disappearance. See
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Dixon declined

Hammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might
have left for Tennessee. The detectives challenged the
plausibility of Dixon’s tale and told Dixon that Tim

one point a detective told Dixon that “now is the time to
say” whether he had any involvement in Hammer’s disap­
pearance because “if Tim starts cutting a deal over there,
this is kinda like, a bus leaving. The first one that gets on
it is the only one that’s gonna get on.” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 183a. Dixon responded that, if Hoffner knew any­
thing about Hammer’s disappearance, Hoffner had not
