SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

16 (“In this case, first on direct examination by the defense, Dr. Quijano merely identified race as one statistical
factor and pointed out that African-Americans were
overrepresented in the criminal justice system; he did not
state a causal relationship, nor did he link this statistic to
Buck as an individual”). Buck did not argue that his race
made him less dangerous, and the prosecutor had no need
to revisit the issue. But she did, in a question specifically
designed to persuade the jury that Buck’s race made him
more dangerous and that, in part on this basis, he should
be sentenced to death.
The then-attorney general of Texas recognized that “it is
inappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in
our criminal justice system.” Record, Doc. 27–5, at 30
(internal quotation marks omitted). Whether the District
Court would accord any weight to the State’s purported
distinctions between Buck’s case and the others is a question which that court should decide in the first instance,
based on an unobscured record. Especially in light of the
capital nature of this case and the express recognition by
a Texas attorney general that the relevant testimony
was inappropriately race-charged, Buck has presented
issues that “deserve encouragement to proceed further.”
Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 327.
