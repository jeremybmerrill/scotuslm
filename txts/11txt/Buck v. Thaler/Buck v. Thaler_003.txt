SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Quijano “told you that there was a probability that [Buck]
would commit future acts of violence.” Id., at 260. The
jury returned a verdict of death.
This was not the first time that Quijano had testified in
a Texas capital case, or in which the prosecution asked
him questions regarding the relationship between race
and future dangerousness. State prosecutors had elicited
comparable testimony from Quijano in several other cases.
In four of them, the prosecution called Quijano as a witness. See Gonzales v. Cockrell, Civ. Action No. 99–72 (WD
Tex., Dec. 19, 2002); Broxton v. Johnson, Civ. Action No.
00–1034 (SD Tex., Mar. 28, 2001); Garcia v. Johnson, Civ.
Action No. 99–134 (ED Tex., Sept. 7, 2000); Saldano v.
Texas, 530 U. S. 1212 (2000). In two, the defense called
Quijano, but the prosecution was the first to elicit racerelated testimony from him. See Alba v. Johnson, 232
F. 3d 208 (CA5 2000) (Table); Blue v. Johnson, Civ. Action
No. 99–0350 (SD Tex., Sept. 29, 2000). In each case, as in
Buck’s, however, the salient fact was that the prosecution
invited the jury to consider race as a factor in sentencing.
And in each case, the defendant was sentenced to death.
When one of those defendants, Victor Hugo Saldano,
petitioned for this Court’s review, the State of Texas confessed error. It acknowledged that “the use of race in
Saldano’s sentencing seriously undermined the fairness,
integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process.”
Response to Pet. for Cert. in Saldano v. Texas, O. T. 1999,
No. 99–8119, p. 7. The State continued, “[T]he infusion of
race as a factor for the jury to weigh in making its determination violated [Saldano’s] constitutional right to be
sentenced without regard to the color of his skin.” Id., at
8. We granted Saldano’s petition, vacated the judgment,
and remanded. Saldano v. Texas, 530 U. S. 1212.
Shortly afterwards, the then-attorney general of Texas
announced publicly that he had identified six cases that
were “similar to that of Victor Hugo Saldano” in that
