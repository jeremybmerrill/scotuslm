FAIREY v. TUCKER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

U. S. 97, 105–106 (1934). This longstanding right reflects
the “notion that a fair trial [can] take place only if the
jurors me[e]t the defendant face-to-face and only if those
testifying against the defendant [do] so in his presence.”
Crosby v. United States, 506 U. S. 255, 259 (1993); see also
ibid. (“ ‘It is well settled that . . . at common law the personal presence of the defendant is essential to a valid trial
and conviction on a charge of felony.’ ” (quoting W. Mikell,
Clark’s Criminal Procedure 492 (2d ed. 1918) (hereinafter
Mikell))); Diaz v. United States, 223 U. S. 442, 455 (1912)
(right to be present is “scarcely less important to the accused than the right of trial itself ”). Thus in general, “if
[the defendant] is absent [from trial], . . . a conviction will
be set aside.” Crosby, 506 U. S., at 259 (quoting Mikell
492).
The Court has acknowledged only two exceptions to this
general rule. First, at least in noncapital trials, a defendant may waive his right to be present “ ‘if, after the trial
has begun in his presence, he voluntarily absents himself.’ ” Crosby, 506 U. S., at 260 (quoting Diaz, 223 U. S.,
at 455). Second, “a defendant can lose his right to be
present at trial if, after being warned that he will be removed if he continues his disruptive behavior, he nevertheless insists on conducting himself in a manner so
disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that
his trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom.”
Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337, 343 (1970). This case, of
course, does not fall within either exception. Rather, the
state court conceived an additional exception, one never
recognized by this Court: waiver on the basis of a defendant’s actions prior to the start of trial. And the state court
went on to conclude that Fairey’s actions established such
waiver on the basis of two facts: the Solicitor mailed
a subpoena to Fairey’s California address and Fairey
acknowledged in his 1998 personal recognizance bond
form that trial could proceed in his absence if he failed to
