SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
WILLIAM SMOAK FAIREY, JR., AKA DOAK FAIREY v.

KENNETH S. TUCKER, SECRETARY, FLORIDA 

DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

No. 11–7185. Decided June 18, 2012


The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
Petitioner William Fairey was tried in absentia and
without counsel on state felony charges. Although Fairey
had not received actual notice of his trial date, the state
court concluded that he had waived his right to be present
when he failed to appear in court on the scheduled trial
date. The State tried Fairey in his absence and, without
having heard any defense, the jury found Fairey guilty.
The court sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment and
$25,000 in restitution. Fairey sought relief on the ground
that his trial in absentia violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. After exhausting state remedies, he
filed a federal petition for writ of habeas corpus. The
District Court denied relief. Both the District Court and
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
denied a certificate of appealability (COA).
I believe a COA should have issued; at the very least,
“the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.” Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S.
322, 327 (2003). An accused’s right to be present at his
own trial is among the most fundamental rights our Constitution secures. In view of the importance of the right
involved and the obvious error here, I would grant the
petition for a writ of certiorari and summarily reverse the
judgment below.
