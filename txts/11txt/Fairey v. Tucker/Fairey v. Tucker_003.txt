SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

the California address, and a South Carolina address
listed on Fairey’s 1998 personal recognizance bond form.
It is undisputed that Fairey did not receive the subpoena.
Unaware of his trial date, he did not appear at trial. The
State tried him in his absence, and the jury found him
guilty after less than 30 minutes of deliberation.
When it came time to arrest Fairey, the State had no
trouble locating him in Florida. After he was incarcerated,
Fairey moved for a new trial. The trial court denied the
motion and the South Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed.
The court acknowledged that the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of an accused to be present at every stage
of his trial. 374 S. C. 92, 98–99, 646 S. E. 2d 445, 448
(2007). But the court concluded that Fairey had waived
this right because (1) notice of his trial date was sent to
his California address, which was the “permanent address
for service of notice” in the record; and (2) Fairey had been
warned on his 1998 personal recognizance bond form that
trial would proceed in his absence if he did not attend. Id.,
at 99–103, 646 S. E. 2d, at 448–450. After exhausting his
state remedies, Fairey petitioned the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina for a writ of
habeas corpus. The District Court denied relief, largely
adopting the reasoning of the State Court of Appeals. The
District Court and United States Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit denied a COA. See 441 Fed. Appx. 160
(2011). Fairey, proceeding pro se, petitioned for a writ of
certiorari.

It is a basic premise of our justice system that “in a
prosecution for a felony the defendant has the privilege
under the Fourteenth Amendment to be present in his
own person whenever his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to
defend against the charge.” Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291
