FAIREY v. TUCKER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

I
In early 1998, South Carolina served Fairey with an
arrest warrant for obtaining goods and moneys under
false pretenses, a state felony. Fairey was released on his
personal recognizance and the State dismissed the warrant. Some time later, Fairey moved from South Carolina
to Sarasota, Florida. In 2001, South Carolina indicted
Fairey for the charge underlying the warrant. Fairey
proceeded pro se and defended himself actively. He filed
motions, sought the discovery of documents, and corresponded with the court. Twice he traveled from Florida to
South Carolina for proceedings.
In the fall of 2002, Fairey informed the state solicitor
(hereinafter Solicitor) and the trial court of his new address in Castiac, California. Several months later, Fairey
moved to quash his indictment. In that submission, he
listed both the California and Florida addresses, the latter now denoted as a “temporary address.” Record in No.
4:09–cv–01610–RMG (D SC), Doc. 19, p. 160 (Exh. 10).
Fairey explained: “Beginning February 23, I have been
living temporarily in Sarasota, Florida, awaiting my next
[work] assignment and my return to California.” Id., at
171. He attended the hearing on his motion in March, and
there submitted a motion to dismiss and an accompanying
affidavit. Both listed only his Florida address. The trial
court denied Fairey’s motion to quash and sent notice of
its ruling to the Florida address alone. The Solicitor
subsequently sent at least one letter to that address.
Some 15 months later, the trial court denied Fairey’s
motion to dismiss. Notice again was sent only to Florida.
In June 2004, the Solicitor subpoenaed Fairey to appear
for trial in South Carolina the following month. Although
Fairey’s most recent filing had listed only his Florida
address, and both the trial court and Solicitor most recently had sent correspondence to that address alone, the
Solicitor mailed the subpoena to two different addresses:
