FAIREY v. TUCKER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

on his scheduled trial date. And he was informed on his
bail recognizance form that trial could proceed in his absence if he was not present. But the form did not specify
his trial date, and Fairey had no knowledge of that date
as he did not receive the Solicitor’s notice, which was sent
to California and not to Fairey’s most recent address in
Florida. There is no suggestion, moreover, that Fairey
was derelict in his duty to monitor the docket or to keep
the State informed of his whereabouts. His most recent
motion to the court provided only his Florida address. An
affidavit submitted two weeks earlier stated that he was
presently living in Florida. And Fairey had been contacted
at his Florida address by both the Solicitor and court
after that date. Until he informed the court that he had
returned to California or moved elsewhere, he was justified in believing the State would continue to contact him
at his Florida address. In short, while Fairey failed to
appear in court on the date of his scheduled trial, his
failure to do so was wholly inadvertent. Consequently, his
absence does not demonstrate the intent necessary to
establish waiver under our established case law.
I believe a COA should have issued and that our intervention is warranted. A trial conducted without actual
notice to a defendant and in his absence makes a mockery
of fair process and the constitutional right to be present at
trial. That is particularly true where, as here, the defendant participated actively in his defense and kept the State
informed of his whereabouts. I would grant the petition
and summarily reverse the judgment below.
