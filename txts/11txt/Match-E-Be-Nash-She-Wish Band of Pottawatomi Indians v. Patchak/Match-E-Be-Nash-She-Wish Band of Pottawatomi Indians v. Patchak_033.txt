12 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI
INDIANS v. PATCHAK
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

complaint, the Government may assert sovereign immunity only if its detective efforts uncover the plaintiff ’s
unstated property claim. Not only does that impose a
substantial burden on the Government, but it creates perverse incentives for private litigants. What if a plaintiff has a weak claim, or a claim that she does not know
about? Did Congress really intend for the availability of
APA relief to turn on whether a plaintiff does a better job
of overlooking or suppressing her own property interest
than the Government does of sleuthing it out?
As these observations illustrate, the majority’s rule will
impose a substantial burden on the Government and leave
an array of uncertainties. Moreover, it will open to suit
lands that Congress and the Executive Branch thought
the “national public interest” demanded should remain
immune from challenge. Congress did not intend either
result.

For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that the QTA
bars the relief Patchak seeks. I respectfully dissent.
