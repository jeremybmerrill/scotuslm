MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI 

INDIANS v. PATCHAK

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to divest the Federal
Government of title to and possession of land held in trust
for Indian tribes—relief expressly forbidden by the QTA—
so long as the complaint does not assert a personal interest in the land. That outcome cannot be squared with the
APA’s express admonition that it confers no “authority to
grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit
expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”
5 U. S. C. §702. The Court’s holding not only creates
perverse incentives for private litigants, but also exposes
the Government’s ownership of land to costly and prolonged challenges. Because I believe those results to be
inconsistent with the QTA and the APA, I respectfully
dissent.

Section 2409a(a) provides expansively that “[t]he United
States may be named as a party defendant in a civil action
under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real
property in which the United States claims an interest.”
That language mirrors the title proposed by the Executive
Branch for the legislation that Congress largely adopted:
“A Bill To permit suits to adjudicate disputed titles to
lands in which the United States claims an interest.” Id.,
at 7.
The remainder of the Act, however, imposes important
