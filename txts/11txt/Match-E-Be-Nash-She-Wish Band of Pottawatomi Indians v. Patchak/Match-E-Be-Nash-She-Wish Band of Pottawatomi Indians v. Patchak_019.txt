16 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI
INDIANS v. PATCHAK

Opinion of the Court 


included the word “arguably” in the test to indicate that
the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff. The test
forecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s “interests are so
marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes
implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.” Id.,
at 399.
Patchak’s suit satisfies that standard, because §465 has
far more to do with land use than the Government and
Band acknowledge. Start with what we and others have
said about §465’s context and purpose. As the leading
treatise on federal Indian law notes, §465 is “the capstone”
of the IRA’s land provisions. F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law §15.07[1][a], p. 1010 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen). And those provisions play a key role in the
IRA’s overall effort “to rehabilitate the Indian’s economic
life,” Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 152
(1973) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Land forms
the basis” of that “economic life,” providing the foundation
for “tourism, manufacturing, mining, logging, . . . and
gaming.” Cohen §15.01, at 965. Section 465 thus functions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes’
economic development. As the D. C. Circuit explained in
the MichGO litigation, the section “provid[es] lands sufficient to enable Indians to achieve self-support.” Michigan
Gambling, 525 F. 3d, at 31 (internal quotation marks
omitted); see Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 542 (1974)
(noting the IRA’s economic aspect). So when the Secretary
obtains land for Indians under §465, she does not do so in
a vacuum. Rather, she takes title to properties with at
least one eye directed toward how tribes will use those
——————
and the Government’s main argument acknowledges, whether issues of
land use (arguably) fall within §465’s scope—because if they do, a
neighbor complaining about such use may sue to enforce the statute’s
limits. See infra this page and 16–17.
