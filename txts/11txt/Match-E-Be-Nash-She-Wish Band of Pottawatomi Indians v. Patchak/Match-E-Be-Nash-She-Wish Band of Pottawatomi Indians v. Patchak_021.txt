18 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI
INDIANS v. PATCHAK
Opinion of the Court

fall “within the zone . . . protected or regulated by the
statute.” If the Government had violated a statute specifically addressing how federal land can be used, no one
would doubt that a neighboring landowner would have
prudential standing to bring suit to enforce the statute’s
limits. The difference here, as the Government and Band
point out, is that §465 specifically addresses only land acquisition. But for the reasons already given, decisions
under the statute are closely enough and often enough
entwined with considerations of land use to make that
difference immaterial. As in this very case, the Secretary
will typically acquire land with its eventual use in mind,
after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.
See 25 CFR §§151.10(c), 151.10(f), 151.11(a). And so
neighbors to the use (like Patchak) are reasonable—
indeed, predictable—challengers of the Secretary’s decisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental,
or aesthetic, come within §465’s regulatory ambit.

The QTA’s reservation of sovereign immunity does not
bar Patchak’s suit. Neither does the doctrine of prudential
standing. We therefore affirm the judgment of the D. C.
Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
