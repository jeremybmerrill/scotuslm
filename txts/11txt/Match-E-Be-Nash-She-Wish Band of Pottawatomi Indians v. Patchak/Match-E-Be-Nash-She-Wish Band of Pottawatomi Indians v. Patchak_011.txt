INDIANS v. PATCHAK

Opinion of the Court 


to establish a plaintiff’s title to land by compelling the
adverse claimant to establish a claim or be forever estopped from asserting it”); Grable & Sons Metal Products,
Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 315
(2005) (“[T]he facts showing the plaintiffs’ title . . . are
essential parts of the plaintiffs’ [quiet title] cause of action” (quoting Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 490
(1917))).
And the QTA’s other provisions make clear that the
recurrent statutory term “quiet title action” carries its ordinary meaning. The QTA directs that the complaint in
such an action “shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff
claims in the real property.” 28 U. S. C. §2409a(d). If the
plaintiff does not assert any such right (as Patchak does
not), the statute cannot come into play.4 Further, the QTA
provides an option for the United States, if it loses the
suit, to pay “just compensation,” rather than return the
property, to the “person determined to be entitled” to it.
§2409a(b). That provision makes perfect sense in a quiet
title action: If the plaintiff is found to own the property,
the Government can satisfy his claim through an award of
money (while still retaining the land for its operations).
But the provision makes no sense in a suit like this one,

4 The dissent contends that the QTA omits two other historical requirements for quiet title suits. See post, at 8. But many States had
abandoned those requirements by the time the QTA was passed. See
S. Rep. No. 92–575, p. 6 (1971) (noting “wide differences in State
statutory and decisional law” on quiet title suits); Steadman, “Forgive
the U. S. Its Trespasses?”: Land Title Disputes With the Sovereign—
Present Remedies and Prospective Reforms, 1972 Duke L. J. 15, 48–49,
and n. 152 (stating that cases had disputed whether a quiet title
plaintiff needed to possess the land); Welch v. Kai, 4 Cal. App. 3d 374,
380–381, 84 Cal. Rptr. 619, 622–623 (1970) (allowing a quiet title action
when the plaintiff claimed only an easement); Benson v. Fekete, 424
S. W. 2d 729 (Mo. 1968) (en banc) (same). So Congress in enacting the
QTA essentially chose one contemporaneous form of quiet title action.
