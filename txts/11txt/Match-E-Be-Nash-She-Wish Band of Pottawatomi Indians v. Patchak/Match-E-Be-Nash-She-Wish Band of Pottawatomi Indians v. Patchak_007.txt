MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI
INDIANS v. PATCHAK

Opinion of the Court 


Brief for Respondent 24–25. The month after the Government took title, this Court held in Carcieri v. Salazar,
555 U. S. 379, 382 (2009), that §465 authorizes the Secretary to take land into trust only for tribes that were “under federal jurisdiction” in 1934.2
The District Court dismissed the suit without considering the merits (including the relevance of Carcieri), ruling
that Patchak lacked prudential standing to challenge the
Secretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The court
reasoned that the injuries Patchak alleged fell outside
§465’s “zone of interests.” 646 F. Supp. 2d 72, 76 (DC
2009). The D. C. Circuit reversed that determination. See
632 F. 3d 702, 704–707 (2011). The court also rejected the
Secretary’s and the Band’s alternative argument that
by virtue of the QTA, sovereign immunity barred the suit.
See id., at 707–712. The latter ruling conflicted with
decisions of three Circuits holding that the United States
has immunity from suits like Patchak’s. See Neighbors for
Rational Development, Inc. v. Norton, 379 F. 3d 956, 961–
962 (CA10 2004); Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern Cal. v. United States, 830 F. 2d 139, 143–144 (CA9
1987) (per curiam); Florida Dept. of Bus. Regulation v.
Department of Interior, 768 F. 2d 1248, 1253–1255 (CA11
1985). We granted certiorari to review both of the D. C.
Circuit’s holdings, 565 U. S. ___ (2011), and we now
affirm.
II
We begin by considering whether the United States’
sovereign immunity bars Patchak’s suit under the APA.
——————
2 The merits of Patchak’s case are not before this Court. We therefore
express no view on whether the Band was “under federal jurisdiction”
in 1934, as Carcieri requires. Nor do we consider how that question
relates to Patchak’s allegation that the Band was not “federally recognized” at the time. Cf. Carcieri, 555 U. S., at 397–399 (BREYER, J.,
concurring) (discussing this issue).
