INDIANS v. PATCHAK
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

would establish only that the QTA does not expressly
forbid the relief Patchak seeks. The APA, however, does
not waive the Government’s sovereign immunity where
any other statute “expressly or impliedly forbids the relief
which is sought.” 5 U. S. C. §702 (emphasis added). The
text and history of the QTA, as well as this Court’s precedent, make clear that the United States intended to retain
its sovereign immunity from suits to dispossess the Government of Indian trust land. Patchak’s suit to oust the
Government of such land is therefore, at minimum, impliedly forbidden.6

Three consequences illustrate the difficulties today’s
holding will present for courts and the Government. First,
it will render the QTA’s limitations easily circumvented.
Although those with property claims will remain formally
prohibited from bringing APA suits because of Block,
savvy plaintiffs and their lawyers can recruit a family
member or neighbor to bring suit asserting only an “aesthetic” interest in the land but seeking an identical practical objective—to divest the Government of title and
possession. §§2409a(a), (b). Nothing will prevent them from
obtaining relief that the QTA was designed to foreclose.
Second, the majority’s holding will frustrate the Government’s ability to resolve challenges to its fee-to-trust
decisions expeditiously. When a plaintiff like Patchak
asserts an “aesthetic” or “environmental” concern with a
planned use of Indian trust land, he may bring a distinct
suit under statutes like the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
Those challenges generally may be brought within the
APA’s ordinary 6-year statute of limitations. Suits to

6 Because I conclude that sovereign immunity bars Patchak’s suit,
I would not reach the question of whether he has standing.
