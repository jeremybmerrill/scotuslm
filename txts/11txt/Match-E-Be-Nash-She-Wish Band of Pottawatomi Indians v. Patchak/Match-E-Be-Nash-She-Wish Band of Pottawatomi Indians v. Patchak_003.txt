Syllabus
because the statute focuses on land acquisition, while Patchak’s injuries relate to the land’s use as a casino. However, §465 has far more
to do with land use than the Government and Band acknowledge.
Section 465 is the capstone of the IRA’s land provisions, and functions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes’ economic development. The Secretary thus takes title to properties with an eye toward how tribes will use those lands to support such development.
The Department’s regulations make this statutory concern with land
use clear, requiring the Secretary to acquire land with its eventual
use in mind, after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.
And because §465 encompasses land’s use, neighbors to the use (like
Patchak) are reasonable―indeed, predictable―challengers of the Secretary’s decisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental,
or aesthetic, come within §465’s regulatory ambit. Pp. 14–18.
