MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI
INDIANS v. PATCHAK

Opinion of the Court 


tion. The first is whether the United States has sovereign
immunity from the suit by virtue of the Quiet Title Act
(QTA), 86 Stat. 1176. We think it does not. The second is
whether Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the
Secretary’s acquisition. We think he does. We therefore
hold that Patchak’s suit may proceed.
I
The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi
Indians (Band) is an Indian tribe residing in rural Michigan. Although the Band has a long history, the Department of the Interior (DOI) formally recognized it only in
1999. See 63 Fed. Reg. 56936 (1998). Two years later,
the Band petitioned the Secretary to exercise her authority
under §465 by taking into trust a tract of land in Wayland
Township, Michigan, known as the Bradley Property. The
Band’s application explained that the Band would use the
property “for gaming purposes,” with the goal of generating the “revenue necessary to promote tribal economic
development, self-sufficiency and a strong tribal government capable of providing its members with sorely needed
social and educational programs.” App. 52, 41.1
In 2005, after a lengthy administrative review, the
Secretary announced her decision to acquire the Bradley
Property in trust for the Band. See 70 Fed. Reg. 25596.
In accordance with applicable regulations, the Secretary
committed to wait 30 days before taking action, so that
interested parties could seek judicial review. See ibid.; 25
CFR §151.12(b) (2011). Within that window, an organization called Michigan Gambling Opposition (or MichGO)
——————
1 Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. §§2701–2721,
an Indian tribe may conduct gaming operations on “Indian lands,”
§2710, which include lands “held in trust by the United States for the
benefit of any Indian tribe,” §2703(4)(B). The application thus requested the Secretary to take the action necessary for the Band to
open a casino.
