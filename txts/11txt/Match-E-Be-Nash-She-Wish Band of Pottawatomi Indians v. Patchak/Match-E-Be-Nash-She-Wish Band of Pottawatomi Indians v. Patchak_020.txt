The Department’s regulations make this statutory
concern with land use crystal clear. Those regulations
permit the Secretary to acquire land in trust under §465
if the “land is necessary to facilitate tribal selfdetermination, economic development, or Indian housing.”
25 CFR §151.3(a)(3). And they require the Secretary to
consider, in evaluating any acquisition, both “[t]he purposes for which the land will be used” and the “potential conflicts of land use which may arise.” §§151.10(c),
151.10(f); see §151.11(a). For “off-reservation acquisitions”
made “for business purposes”—like the Bradley Property—
the regulations further provide that the tribe must

finish, the decision whether to acquire the Bradley Property under §465 involved questions of land use.
And because §465’s implementation encompasses these
issues, the interests Patchak raises—at least arguably—
