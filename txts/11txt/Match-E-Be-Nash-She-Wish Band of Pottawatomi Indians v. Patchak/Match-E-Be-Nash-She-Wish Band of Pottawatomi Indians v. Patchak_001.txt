MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF 

POTTAWATOMI INDIANS v. PATCHAK ET AL. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
No. 11–246.

Argued April 24, 2012—Decided June 18, 2012*

The Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) authorizes the Secretary of the
Interior to acquire property “for the purpose of providing land to Indians.” 25 U. S. C. §465. Petitioner Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish

intended to use “for gaming purposes.” The Secretary took title to
the Bradley Property in 2009. Respondent David Patchak, who lives
near the Bradley Property, filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), asserting that §465 did not authorize the Secretary
to acquire the property because the Band was not a federally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934. Patchak alleged a variety of economic, environmental, and aesthetic harms as a result of
the Band’s proposed use of the property to operate a casino, and requested injunctive and declaratory relief reversing the Secretary’s
decision to take title to the land. The Band intervened to defend the
Secretary’s decision. The District Court did not reach the merits of
Patchak’s suit, but ruled that he lacked prudential standing to challenge the Secretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The D. C.
Circuit reversed and also rejected the Secretary’s and the Band’s alternative argument that sovereign immunity barred the suit.
Held:
