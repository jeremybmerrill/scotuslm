INDIANS v. PATCHAK

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


a detailed mechanism for judicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of particular persons, judicial
review of those issues at the behest of other persons may
be found to be impliedly precluded”). That inference is
especially strong here, because the QTA was “enacted
against the backdrop of sovereign immunity.” S. Rep. No.
94–996, p. 27 (1976). Section 2409a(d) thus indicates
that Congress concluded that those without any “right, title,
or interest” in a given property did not have an interest sufficient to warrant abrogation of the Government’s
sovereign immunity.
Congress considered these conditions indispensible to its
immunity waiver.1 “[W]hen Congress attaches conditions
to legislation waiving the sovereign immunity of the United
States, those conditions must be strictly observed, and
exceptions thereto are not to be lightly implied.” Block,
461 U. S., at 287. Congress and the Executive Branch
intended the scheme to be the exclusive procedure for
resolving property title disputes involving the United
States. See id., at 285 (describing Act as a “careful and
thorough remedial scheme”); S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 4
(§2409a “provides a complete, thoughtful approach to the
problem of disputed titles to federally claimed land” (emphasis added)).
For that reason, we held that Congress did not intend to
create a “new supplemental remedy” when it enacted the
APA’s general waiver of sovereign immunity. Block, 461

1 As we explained in Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and
School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 282–283 (1983), Congress’ initial proposal
lacked such provisions. The Executive Branch, however, strongly
opposed the original bill, explaining that it was “too broad and sweeping in scope and lacking adequate safeguards to protect the public
interest.” Dispute of Titles on Public Lands: Hearings on S. 216 et al.
before the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Senate Committee on
Interior and Insular Affairs, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., 21 (1971). Congress
ultimately agreed, largely adopting the Executive’s substitute bill. See
Block, 461 U. S., at 283–284.
