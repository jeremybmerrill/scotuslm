MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER
Syllabus
visor, the deputy district attorney, and the magistrate were as well.
Pp. 16−18.
(e) In holding that the warrant in this case was so obviously defective that no reasonable officer could have believed it to be valid, the
court below erred in relying on Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551.
There, officers who carried out a warrant-approved search were not
entitled to qualified immunity because the warrant failed to describe
any of the items to be seized and “even a cursory reading of the warrant” would have revealed this defect. Id., at 557. Here, in contrast,
any arguable defect would have become apparent only upon a close
parsing of the warrant application, and a comparison of the supporting affidavit to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the affidavit established probable cause to search for all the items listed in
the warrant. Unlike in Groh, any error here would not be one that
“just a simple glance” would have revealed. Id. at 564. Pp. 18−19.
