Opinion of the Court

106, 157, 2007 WL 7589200, *21. The court also found
the warrant overbroad with respect to the search for gangrelated materials, because there “was no evidence that the
crime at issue was gang-related.” App. to Pet. for Cert.
157. As a result, the District Court granted summary
judgment to the Millenders on their constitutional challenges to the firearm and gang material aspects of the
search warrant. Id., at 160. The District Court also rejected the officers’ claim that they were entitled to qualified immunity from damages. Id., at 171.
Messerschmidt and Lawrence appealed, and a divided
panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court’s denial of qualified immunity.
564 F. 3d 1143 (2009). The court held that the officers
were entitled to qualified immunity because “they reasonably relied on the approval of the warrant by a deputy
district attorney and a judge.” Id., at 1145.
The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc and
affirmed the District Court’s denial of qualified immunity.
620 F. 3d 1016 (CA9 2010). The en banc court concluded
that the warrant’s authorization was unconstitutionally
overbroad because the affidavit and the warrant failed to
“establish[ ] probable cause that the broad categories of
firearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related
material described in the warrant were contraband or
evidence of a crime.” Id., at 1033. In the en banc court’s
view, “the deputies had probable cause to search for a
single, identified weapon . . . . They had no probable cause
to search for the broad class of firearms and firearmrelated materials described in the warrant.” Id., at 1027.
In addition, “[b]ecause the deputies failed to establish any
link between gang-related materials and a crime, the
warrant authorizing the search and seizure of all gangrelated evidence [was] likewise invalid.” Id., at 1031.
Concluding that “a reasonable officer in the deputies’
position would have been well aware of this deficiency,”
