SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

I respectfully dissent.

The Court holds that a well-trained officer could have
reasonably concluded that there was probable cause to
search the Millenders’ residence for any evidence of affiliation with “any Street Gang,” and “all handguns, rifles, or

majority therefore dismisses as “misleading” the Millenders’ characterization of the case as a “domestic dispute,”
insisting that Detective Messerschmidt could have reasonably thought that the crime was gang related. See
ante, at 13–14.2

assault and an assault with a deadly weapon.” Ante, at 13 (internal
quotation marks omitted). Solely domestic disputes often involve gun
violence, however. See Sorenson & Weibe, Weapons in the Lives of
