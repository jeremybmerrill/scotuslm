Opinion of the Court

818 (1982)). Qualified immunity “gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken
judgments,” and “protects ‘all but the plainly incompetent
or those who knowingly violate the law.’ ” Ashcroft v. alKidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting
Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986)). “[W]hether
an official protected by qualified immunity may be held
personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action
generally turns on the ‘objective legal reasonableness’ of
the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were
‘clearly established’ at the time it was taken.” Anderson v.
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639 (1987) (citation omitted).
Where the alleged Fourth Amendment violation involves
a search or seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a
neutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest
indication that the officers acted in an objectively reasonable manner or, as we have sometimes put it, in “objective
good faith.” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922–923
(1984).1 Nonetheless, under our precedents, the fact that
a neutral magistrate has issued a warrant authorizing the
allegedly unconstitutional search or seizure does not end
the inquiry into objective reasonableness. Rather, we
have recognized an exception allowing suit when “it is
obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have
concluded that a warrant should issue.” Malley, 475 U. S.,
at 341. The “shield of immunity” otherwise conferred by
the warrant, id., at 345, will be lost, for example, where
the warrant was “based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its exist——————
1 Although Leon involved the proper application of the exclusionary
rule to remedy a Fourth Amendment violation, we have held that “the
same standard of objective reasonableness that we applied in the context of a suppression hearing in Leon defines the qualified immunity accorded an officer” who obtained or relied on an allegedly invalid
warrant. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 344 (1986) (citation omitted);
Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 565, n. 8 (2004).
