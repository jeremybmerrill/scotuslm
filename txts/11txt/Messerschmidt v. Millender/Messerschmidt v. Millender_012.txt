MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER
Opinion of the Court

the en banc court held that the officers were not entitled to
qualified immunity. Id., at 1033–1035.
There were two separate dissenting opinions. Judge
Callahan determined that “the officers had probable cause
to search for and seize any firearms in the home in which
Bowen, a gang member and felon, was thought to reside.”
Id., at 1036. She also concluded that “the officers reasonably relied on their superiors, the district attorney, and
the magistrate to correct” any overbreadth in the warrant,
and that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity
because their actions were not objectively unreasonable.
Id., at 1044, 1049. Judge Silverman also dissented, concluding that the “deputies’ belief in the validity of . . . the
warrant was entirely reasonable” and that the “record
[wa]s totally devoid of any evidence that the deputies
acted other than in good faith.” Id., at 1050. Judge Tallman joined both dissents.
We granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).
II
The Millenders allege that they were subjected to an
unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment because the warrant authorizing the search of their
home was not supported by probable cause. They seek
damages from Messerschmidt and Lawrence for their roles
in obtaining and executing this warrant. The validity of
the warrant is not before us. The question instead is
whether Messerschmidt and Lawrence are entitled to immunity from damages, even assuming that the warrant
should not have been issued.
“The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials ‘from liability for civil damages insofar as
their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory
or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person
would have known.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223,
231 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,
