MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

that the police could have searched for all firearms to
uncover evidence of yet unnamed crimes, ante, at 11–12,
the warrant specified that the police were investigating

the shotgun used in this crime for that purpose. See App.

Jerry Ray Bowen and the recovery of the weapon could be
invaluable in the successful prosecution of the suspect
