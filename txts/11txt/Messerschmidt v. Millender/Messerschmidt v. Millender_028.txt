MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER
Opinion of KAGAN, J.

views relevant is to enable those teammates (whether
acting in good or bad faith) to confer immunity on each
other for unreasonable conductâ€”like applying for a warrant without anything resembling probable cause.
For these reasons, I would reverse in part and affirm in
part the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and I would
remand this case for further proceedings.
