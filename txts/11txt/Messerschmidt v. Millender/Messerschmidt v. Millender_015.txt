would have presumed that such a warrant was valid.”
Brief for Respondents 27. We disagree.

With respect to the warrant’s authorization to search for
and seize all firearms, the Millenders argue that “a reasonably well-trained officer would have readily perceived
that there was no probable cause to search the house for
all firearms and firearm-related items.” Id., at 32. Noting
that “the affidavit indicated exactly what item was evidence of a crime—the ‘black sawed off shotgun with a
pistol grip,’ ” they argue that “[n]o facts established that
Bowen possessed any other firearms, let alone that such
firearms (if they existed) were ‘contraband or evidence of a
crime.’ ” Ibid. (quoting App. 56).
Even if the scope of the warrant were overbroad in
authorizing a search for all guns when there was information only about a specific one, that specific one was a
sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip, owned by a known
gang member, who had just fired the weapon five times in
public in an attempt to murder another person, on the
asserted ground that she had “call[ed] the cops” on him.
Id., at 56. Under these circumstances—set forth in the
warrant—it would not have been unreasonable for an
officer to conclude that there was a “fair probability” that
the sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen
owned. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 238 (1983). And
it certainly would have been reasonable for an officer to
assume that Bowen’s sawed-off shotgun was illegal. Cf. 26
U. S. C. §§5845(a), 5861(d). Evidence of one crime is not
always evidence of several, but given Bowen’s possession
of one illegal gun, his gang membership, his willingness
to use the gun to kill someone, and his concern about
the police, a reasonable officer could conclude that there
would be additional illegal guns among others that Bowen
