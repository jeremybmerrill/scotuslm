MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

safety. And criminals like Bowen are not sympathetic
figures. But the Fourth Amendment “protects all, those
suspected or known to be offenders as well as the innocent.” Go-Bart Importing Co., 282 U. S., at 357. And this
Court long ago recognized that efforts “to bring the guilty
to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be
aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established
by years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted
in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.”
Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 393 (1914).
Qualified immunity properly affords police officers protection so long as their conduct is objectively reasonable.
But it is not objectively reasonable for police investigating a specific, non-gang-related assault committed with
a particular firearm to search for all evidence related to
“any Street Gang,” “photographs . . . which may depict
evidence of criminal activity,” and all firearms. The Court
reaches a contrary result not because it thinks that these
police officers’ stated reasons for searching were objectively reasonable, but because it thinks different conclusions
might be drawn from the crime scene that reasonably
might have led different officers to search for different
reasons. That analysis, however, is far removed from
qualified immunity’s proper focus on whether petitioners
acted in an objectively reasonable manner.
Because petitioners did not, I would affirm the judgment
of the Court of Appeals.
