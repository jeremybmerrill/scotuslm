MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER
Opinion of the Court

schmidt submitted the warrants to a magistrate. The
magistrate approved the warrants and authorized night
service.
The search warrant was served two days later by a team
of officers that included Messerschmidt and Lawrence.
Sheriff’s deputies forced open the front door of 2234 East
120th Street and encountered Augusta Millender—a
woman in her seventies—and Millender’s daughter and
grandson. As instructed by the police, the Millenders
went outside while the residence was secured but remained in the living room while the search was conducted.
Bowen was not found in the residence. The search did,
however, result in the seizure of Augusta Millender’s
shotgun, a California Social Services letter addressed to
Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.
Bowen was arrested two weeks later after Messerschmidt found him hiding under a bed in a motel room.
B
The Millenders filed suit in Federal District Court
against the County of Los Angeles, the sheriff ’s department, the sheriff, and a number of individual officers,
including Messerschmidt and Lawrence. The complaint
alleged, as relevant here, that the search warrant was
invalid under the Fourth Amendment. It sought damages
from Messerschmidt and Lawrence, among others.
The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment
on the validity of the search warrant. The District Court
found the warrant defective in two respects. The District
Court concluded that the warrant’s authorization to
search for firearms was unconstitutionally overbroad
because the “crime specified here was a physical assault
with a very specific weapon”—a black sawed-off shotgun
with a pistol grip—negating any need to “search for all
firearms.” Millender v. County of Los Angeles, Civ. No.
05–2298 (CD Cal., Mar. 15, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert.
