MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER
Opinion of the Court

Whatever the use to which evidence of Bowen’s gang
involvement might ultimately have been put, it would not
have been “entirely unreasonable” for an officer to believe
that the facts set out in the affidavit established a fair
probability that such evidence would aid the prosecution
of Bowen for the criminal acts at issue. Leon, 468 U. S., at
923 (internal quotation marks omitted).
B
Whether any of these facts, standing alone or taken
together, actually establish probable cause is a question
we need not decide. Qualified immunity “gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but
mistaken judgments.” al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 12). The officers’ judgment that the scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause may have been
mistaken, but it was not “plainly incompetent.” Malley,
475 U. S., at 341.
On top of all this, the fact that the officers sought and
obtained approval of the warrant application from a superior and a deputy district attorney before submitting it to
the magistrate provides further support for the conclusion
that an officer could reasonably have believed that the
scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause.
Ibid. Before seeking to have the warrant issued by a
magistrate, Messerschmidt conducted an extensive investigation into Bowen’s background and the facts of the
crime. Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt prepared a detailed warrant application that truthfully laid

members of the Millender household also had gang ties, see post, at 8
(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.); post, at 2–3 (opinion of KAGAN, J.), a reasonable officer could still conclude that evidence of gang membership
would help show Bowen’s connection to the residence. Such evidence
could, for example, have displayed Bowen’s gang moniker (“C Jay”)
or could have been identified by Kelly as belonging to Bowen. See
App. 64.
