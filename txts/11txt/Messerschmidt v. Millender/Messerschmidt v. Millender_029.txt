ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[February 22, 2012]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
joins, dissenting.
The fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment’s
warrant clause is “to protect against all general searches.”
Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344, 357
(1931). The Fourth Amendment was adopted specifically
in response to the Crown’s practice of using general warrants and writs of assistance to search “suspected places”
for evidence of smuggling, libel, or other crimes. Boyd v.
United States, 116 U. S. 616, 625–626 (1886). Early patriots railed against these practices as “the worst instrument
of arbitrary power” and John Adams later claimed that
“the child Independence was born” from colonists’ opposition to their use. Id., at 625 (internal quotation marks
omitted).
To prevent the issue of general warrants on “loose,
vague or doubtful bases of fact,” Go-Bart Importing Co.,
282 U. S., at 357, the Framers established the inviolable
principle that should resolve this case: “no Warrants shall
issue, but upon probable cause . . . and particularly describing the . . . things to be seized.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.
That is, the police must articulate an adequate reason to
search for specific items related to specific crimes.
