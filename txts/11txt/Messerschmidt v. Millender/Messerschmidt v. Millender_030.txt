MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

In this case, police officers investigating a specific, nongang-related assault committed with a specific firearm (a
sawed-off shotgun) obtained a warrant to search for all
evidence related to “any Street Gang,” “[a]ny photographs
. . . which may depict evidence of criminal activity,” and
“any firearms.” App. 52. They did so for the asserted
reason that the search might lead to evidence related to
other gang members and other criminal activity, and that
other “[v]alid warrants commonly allow police to search
for ‘firearms and ammunition.’ ” See infra, at 8–9. That
kind of general warrant is antithetical to the Fourth
Amendment.
The Court nonetheless concludes that the officers are
entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was
“objectively reasonable.” I could not disagree more. All
13 federal judges who previously considered this case
had little difficulty concluding that the police officers’
search for any gang-related material violated the Fourth
Amendment. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 28–29, 45, n. 7,
73, 94, 157–158. And a substantial majority agreed that
the police’s search for both gang-related material and all
firearms not only violated the Fourth Amendment, but
was objectively unreasonable. Like them, I believe that
any “reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position
would have known that his affidavit failed to establish
probable cause.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 345
(1986).
The Court also hints that a police officer’s otherwise
unreasonable conduct may be excused by the approval of
a magistrate, or more disturbingly, another police officer.
Ante, at 16–18. That is inconsistent with our focus on the
objective reasonableness of an officer’s decision to submit
a warrant application to a magistrate, and we long ago
rejected it. See Malley, 475 U. S., at 345–346.
The Court’s analysis bears little relationship to the
record in this case, our precedents, or the purposes under-
