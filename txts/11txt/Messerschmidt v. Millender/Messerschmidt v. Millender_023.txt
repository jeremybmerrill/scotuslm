Opinion of the Court

the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity.
The instant case is not remotely similar. In contrast to
Groh, any defect here would not have been obvious from
the face of the warrant. Rather, any arguable defect
would have become apparent only upon a close parsing of
the warrant application, and a comparison of the affidavit
to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the
affidavit established probable cause to search for all the
items listed in the warrant. This is not an error that
“just a simple glance” would have revealed. Ibid. Indeed,
unlike in Groh, the officers here did not merely submit
their application to a magistrate. They also presented it
for review by a superior officer, and a deputy district
attorney, before submitting it to the magistrate. The fact
that none of the officials who reviewed the application
expressed concern about its validity demonstrates that
any error was not obvious. Groh plainly does not control
the result here.

The question in this case is not whether the magistrate
erred in believing there was sufficient probable cause to
support the scope of the warrant he issued. It is instead
whether the magistrate so obviously erred that any reasonable officer would have recognized the error. The
occasions on which this standard will be met may be rare,
but so too are the circumstances in which it will be appropriate to impose personal liability on a lay officer in the
face of judicial approval of his actions. Even if the warrant in this case were invalid, it was not so obviously
lacking in probable cause that the officers can be considered “plainly incompetent” for concluding otherwise.
Malley, supra, at 341. The judgment of the Court of Appeals denying the officers qualified immunity must therefore be reversed.
It is so ordered.
