assault. She told the police what had happened—that
Bowen had attacked her after becoming “angry because
she had called the Sheriff’s Department”—and she mentioned that Bowen was “an active member of the ‘Mona
Park Crips,’ ” a local street gang. Id., at 39. Kelly also
provided the officers with photographs of Bowen.
Detective Curt Messerschmidt was assigned to investigate the incident. Messerschmidt met with Kelly to obtain
details of the assault and information about Bowen. Kelly
described the attack and informed Messerschmidt that she
thought Bowen was staying at his foster mother’s home
at 2234 East 120th Street. Kelly also informed Messerschmidt of Bowen’s previous assaults on her and of his
gang ties.
Messerschmidt then conducted a background check on
Bowen by consulting police records, California Department of Motor Vehicles records, and the “cal-gang” database. Based on this research, Messerschmidt confirmed
Bowen’s connection to the 2234 East 120th Street address.
He also confirmed that Bowen was an “active” member of
the Mona Park Crips and a “secondary” member of the
Dodge City Crips. Id., at 64. Finally, Messerschmidt
learned that Bowen had been arrested and convicted for
numerous violent and firearm-related offenses. Indeed, at
the time of the investigation, Bowen’s “rapsheet” spanned
over 17 printed pages, and indicated that he had been
arrested at least 31 times. Nine of these arrests were for
firearms offenses and six were for violent crimes, including three arrests for assault with a deadly weapon (firearm). Id., at 72–81.
Messerschmidt prepared two warrants: one to authorize
Bowen’s arrest and one to authorize the search of 2234
East 120th Street. An attachment to the search warrant
described the property that would be the object of the
search:
