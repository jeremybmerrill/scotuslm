UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v. AMERICAN
ATHEISTS, INC.
THOMAS, J., dissenting





The Tenth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with four
judges dissenting. The dissenters criticized the panel for
presuming that the crosses were unconstitutional and
then asking whether contextual factors were sufficient to
rebut that presumption. Instead, the dissenters argued,
the panel should have considered whether the crosses
amounted to an endorsement of religion in the first place
in light of their physical characteristics, location near the
site of the officer’s death, commemorative purpose, selec­
tion by surviving family members, and disavowal by the
State. 637 F. 3d 1095, 1103–1105 (2010) (opinion of Kelly,
J.). The dissenters also criticized the panel’s “unreasona­
ble ‘reasonable observer,’ ” id., at 1104, describing him as
“biased, replete with foibles, and prone to mistake,” id.,
at 1108 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). Noting that the court
“continue[d] to apply (or misapply) a reasonable observer/
endorsement test that has come under much recent
scrutiny,” the dissenters emphasized that the panel’s
decision was “worthy of review.” Id., at 1109–1110 (same).

Unsurprisingly, the Tenth Circuit relied on its own
precedent, rather than on any of this Court’s cases, when
it selected the Lemon/endorsement test as its governing
analysis. Our jurisprudence provides no principled basis by which a lower court could discern whether
Lemon/endorsement, or some other test, should apply in
Establishment Clause cases. Some of our cases have simply
ignored the Lemon or Lemon/endorsement formulations.
See, e.g., Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 (2002);
Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98
(2001); Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983). Other
decisions have indicated that the Lemon/endorsement test
is useful, but not binding. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S.
668, 679 (1984) (despite Lemon’s usefulness, we are “un­
willin[g] to be confined to any single test or criterion in
