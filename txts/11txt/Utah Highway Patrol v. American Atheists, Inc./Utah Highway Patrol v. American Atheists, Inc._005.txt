THOMAS, J., dissenting

this sensitive area”); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 741
(1973) (Lemon provides “no more than helpful signposts”).
Most recently, in Van Orden, 545 U. S. 677, a majority of
the Court declined to apply the Lemon/endorsement test in
upholding a Ten Commandments monument located on
the grounds of a state capitol.2 Yet in another case decid­
ed the same day, McCreary County v. American Civil
Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 859–866 (2005), the
Court selected the Lemon/endorsement test with nary a
word of explanation and then declared a display of the Ten
Commandments in a courthouse to be unconstitutional.
See also Van Orden, supra, at 692 (SCALIA, J., concurring)
(“I join the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE because I think
it accurately reflects our current Establishment Clause
jurisprudence—or at least the Establishment Clause
jurisprudence we currently apply some of the time”).
Thus, the Lemon/endorsement test continues to “stal[k]
our Establishment Clause jurisprudence” like “some ghoul
in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its
grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed
and buried.” Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union
Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 398 (1993) (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in judgment).
Since Van Orden and McCreary, lower courts have
understandably expressed confusion. See American Civil
Liberties Union of Ky. v. Mercer Cty., 432 F. 3d 624, 636

Van Orden, a plurality determined that the nature of a govern­
ment display and our Nation’s historical traditions should control. 545
U. S., at 686; see also ibid. (“Whatever may be the fate of the Lemon
test in the larger scheme of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we
think it not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument that
Texas has erected”). In a concurring opinion, JUSTICE BREYER consid­
ered the “basic purposes of the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses
themselves” rather than “a literal application of any particular test.”
Id., at 703–704 (opinion concurring in judgment); see also id., at 700
(“[I]n [difficult borderline] cases, I see no test-related substitute for the
exercise of legal judgment”).
