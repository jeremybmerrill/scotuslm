THOMAS, J., dissenting

surrounded by thousands of stone plaques honoring mili­

F. 2d 147 (upholding a Latin cross, surrounded by a pair of
wings, in a city insignia), and Weinbaum v. Las Cruces,
541 F. 3d 1017, 1025 (CA10 2008) (upholding “three inter­
locking crosses,” with a white, slightly taller center cross,
surrounded by a sun symbol, in a city insignia, as well as
a cross sculpture outside of a city sports complex and a
mural of crosses on an elementary school wall). See also
Salazar v. Buono, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (plurality
opinion) (slip op., at 14–15) (“A cross by the side of a public
highway marking, for instance, the place where a state
trooper perished need not be taken as a statement of
governmental support for sectarian beliefs”).
One might be forgiven for failing to discern a workable
principle that explains these wildly divergent outcomes.
Such arbitrariness is the product of an Establishment
Clause jurisprudence that does nothing to constrain judi­
cial discretion, but instead asks, based on terms like “con­
text” and “message,” whether a hypothetical reasonable
observer of a religious display could think that the gov­
ernment has made a law “respecting an establishment of
religion.”7 Whether a given court’s hypothetical observer
will be “any beholder (no matter how unknowledgeable), or
the average beholder, or . . . the ‘ultra-reasonable’ behold­
er,” Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette,
515 U. S. 753, 769, n. 3 (1995) (plurality opinion), is en­

7 That a violation of the Establishment Clause turns on an observer’s
potentially mistaken belief that the government has violated the Con­
stitution, rather than on whether the government has in fact done
so, is perhaps the best evidence that our Establishment Clause juris­
prudence has gone hopelessly awry. See McCreary County v. American
Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 901 (2005) (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting) (describing the “oddity” that “the legitimacy of a govern­
ment action with a wholly secular effect would turn on the misperception of an imaginary observer”).
