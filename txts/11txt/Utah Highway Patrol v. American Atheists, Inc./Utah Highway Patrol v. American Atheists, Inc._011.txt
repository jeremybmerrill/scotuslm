. . . does not constitute an endorsement by the Common­
wealth of any religion,’ ” and located on the grounds of the
state capitol, 100 yards from a Christmas tree), and Elewski v. Syracuse, 123 F. 3d 51, 52 (CA2 1997) (upholding a
solitary creche, raised on a platform “two feet above side­
walk level,” containing “statues representing Jesus, Mary,
and Joseph, a shepherd, a donkey, a lamb, and an angel”
holding a banner reading “ ‘Gloria in Excelsis Deo,’ ” “illu­
minated at night by two forty-watt spotlights” located in a
park on a “major downtown thoroughfare,” 300 feet from
a menorah and down the street from secular holiday
symbols).
Likewise, a menorah displayed on government property
violates the Establishment Clause, except when it doesn’t.
Compare Kaplan v. Burlington, 891 F. 2d 1024, 1026, 1030
(CA2 1989) (holding unconstitutional a solitary 16- by 12­
foot menorah, bearing a sign stating “ ‘Happy Chanukah’ ”
and “ ‘Sponsored by: Lubavitch of Vermont,’ ” located 60
feet away from City Hall, and “appear[ing] superimposed
upon City Hall” when viewed from “the general direction
of the westerly public street”), with Allegheny, supra, at
587, 582 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (upholding an “18-foot
Chanukah menorah of an abstract tree-and-branch de­
sign,” placed next to a 45-foot Christmas tree, bearing a
sign entitled “ ‘Salute to Liberty,’ ” and located outside of a
city-county building), and Skoros v. New York, 437 F. 3d 1
(CA2 2006) (upholding school policy permitting display of
menorah along with the Islamic star and crescent, the
Kwanzaa kinara, the Hebrew dreidel, and a Christmas
tree, but prohibiting a creche).
A display of the Ten Commandments on government
property also violates the Establishment Clause, except
when it doesn’t. Compare Green, 568 F. 3d, at 790 (hold­
ing unconstitutional a monument depicting the Ten Com­
mandments and the Mayflower Compact on the lawn of a
