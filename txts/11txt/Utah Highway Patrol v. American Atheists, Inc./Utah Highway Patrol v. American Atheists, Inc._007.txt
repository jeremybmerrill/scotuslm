THOMAS, J., dissenting

Orden.5 One Circuit, in a case later dismissed as moot,
applied both tests.6
Respondents assure us that any perceived conflict is
“artificial,” Brief in Opposition 8, because the lower courts
have quite properly applied Van Orden to “the distinct
class of Ten Commandments cases” indistinguishable from
Van Orden and have applied the Lemon/endorsement test
