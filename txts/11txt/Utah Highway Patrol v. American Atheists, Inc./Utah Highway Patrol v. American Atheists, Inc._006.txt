THOMAS, J., dissenting

n. 1 (CA10 2009) (Kelly, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)
(noting that “[w]hether Lemon . . . and its progeny actually create
discernable ‘tests,’ rather than a mere ad hoc patchwork, is debatable”
and describing the “judicial morass resulting from the Supreme Court’s
opinions”); Card v. Everett, 520 F. 3d 1009, 1016 (CA9 2008) (“Con­
founded by the ten individual opinions in [McCreary and Van Orden]
. . . courts have described the current state of the law as both ‘Estab­

1023–1024 (Fernandez, J., concurring) (applauding the majority’s
“heroic attempt to create a new world of useful principle out of the
Supreme Court’s dark materials” and lamenting the “still stalking

unhelpful that Establishment Clause jurisprudence has not become
more fathomable” (footnote omitted)); Skoros v. New York, 437 F. 3d 1,

dissenting) (admonishing the majority for failing to “integrate
McCreary and Van Orden into as coherent a framework as possible”),
dism’d as moot on rehearing en banc, 485 F. 3d 305 (CA5 2007).
