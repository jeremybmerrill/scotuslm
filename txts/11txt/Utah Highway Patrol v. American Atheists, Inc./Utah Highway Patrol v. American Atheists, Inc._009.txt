THOMAS, J., dissenting

JUSTICE BREYER’s opinion in Van Orden considered the
“context of the display” and the “message” it communicat­
ed. Brief in Opposition 8–12, and n. 5 (internal quotation
marks omitted); see Van Orden, 545 U. S., at 701–702
(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 703 (“For
these reasons, I believe that the Texas display . . . might
satisfy this Court’s more formal Establishment Clause
tests”). I do not doubt that a given court could reach the
same result under either test. See ACLU Neb. Foundation
v. Plattsmouth, 419 F. 3d 772, 778, n. 8 (CA8 2005) (en
banc) (upholding the constitutionality of a display of the
Ten Commandments under either standard); Trunk v. San
Diego, 629 F. 3d 1099, 1107, 1125 (CA9 2011) (concluding
that the display of a cross was unconstitutional under
either standard). The problem is that both tests are so
utterly indeterminate that they permit different courts to
reach inconsistent results. Compare Harris v. Zion, 927
F. 2d 1401 (CA7 1991) (applying Lemon/endorsement to
strike down a city seal bearing a depiction of a cross), with
Murray v. Austin, 947 F. 2d 147 (CA5 1991) (applying
Lemon/endorsement to uphold a city seal bearing a depic­
tion of a cross); compare also Plattsmouth, supra (applying
Van Orden to uphold a display of the Ten Command­
ments), with Staley, supra (applying Van Orden to strike
down a display of a Bible). As explained below, it is “the
very ‘flexibility’ of this Court’s Establishment Clause
precedent” that “leaves it incapable of consistent applica­
tion.” Van Orden, supra, at 697 (THOMAS, J., concurring).

In Allegheny, a majority of the Court took the view that
the endorsement test provides a “sound analytical frame­
work for evaluating governmental use of religious sym­
bols.” 492 U. S., at 595 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); id., at
629 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) (“I . . . remain convinced that the endorsement
