UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v. AMERICAN
ATHEISTS, INC.
THOMAS, J., dissenting





law “respecting an establishment of religion.” See Card v.
Everett, 520 F. 3d 1009, 1016 (CA9 2008) (describing
“Recent Developments in Ten Commandments Law”). But
even assuming that the lower courts uniformly under­
stand Van Orden to apply only to those religious displays
“factually indistinguishable” from the display in Van
Orden, Brief in Opposition 16, that understanding con­
flicts with JUSTICE BREYER’s controlling opinion. JUSTICE
BREYER’s concurrence concluded that there is “no test­
related substitute for the exercise of legal judgment” or
“exact formula” in “fact-intensive,” “difficult borderline
cases.” 545 U. S., at 700 (opinion concurring in judgment).
Nothing in his opinion indicated that only Ten Com­
mandments displays identical to the one in Van Orden call
for a departure from the Lemon/endorsement test.
Moreover, the lower courts have not neatly confined Van
Orden to similar Ten Commandments displays. In Myers
v. Loudoun Cty. Public Schools, 418 F. 3d 395, 402, and
n. 8 (2005), the Fourth Circuit applied the Van Orden
plurality opinion and JUSTICE BREYER’s concurring analy­
sis to resolve an Establishment Clause challenge to a
statute mandating recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.
In Staley v. Harris Cty., 461 F. 3d 504, 511–512 (2006),
dism’d as moot on rehearing en banc, 485 F. 3d 305 (2007),
the Fifth Circuit applied Van Orden to a monument dis­
playing an open bible. And, in Green v. Haskell Cty. Bd. of
Comm’rs, 568 F. 3d 784, 796–797 (2009), the Tenth Circuit
applied the Lemon/endorsement test to hold unconstitu­
tional a Ten Commandments monument located on the
grounds of a public building and surrounded by other
secular monuments, facts materially indistinguishable
from those in Van Orden.
Respondents further suggest that any variation among
the Circuits concerning the Establishment Clause stand­
ard for displays of religious imagery is merely academic,
for much like the traditional Lemon/endorsement inquiry,
