UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v. AMERICAN
ATHEISTS, INC.
THOMAS, J., dissenting





tirely unpredictable. Indeed, the Tenth Circuit stated
below that its observer, although not “omniscient,” would
“know far more than most actual members of a given
community,” and then unhelpfully concluded that “[h]ow
much information we will impute to a reasonable observer
is unclear.” 616 F. 3d, at 1159 (internal quotation marks

observers of similar insight and eyesight, it is “unrealistic
to expect different judges . . . to reach consistent answers
as to what any beholder, the average beholder, or the

name, rank, and badge number of the fallen officer embla­
zoned above it. 637 F. 3d, at 1108–1109 (opinion of Gor­
such, J.); id., at 1104 (opinion of Kelly, J.). The dissenters
would also have employed an observer who was able to
