ON PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

Nos. 10–1276 and 10–1297. Decided October 31, 2011


The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.
Today the Court rejects an opportunity to provide clarity
to an Establishment Clause jurisprudence in shambles. A
sharply divided Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has
declared unconstitutional a private association’s efforts
to memorialize slain police officers with white roadside
crosses, holding that the crosses convey to a reasonable
observer that the State of Utah is endorsing Christianity.
The Tenth Circuit’s opinion is one of the latest in a long
line of “ ‘religious display’ ” decisions that, because of this
Court’s nebulous Establishment Clause analyses, turn on
little more than “judicial predilections.” See Van Orden v.
Perry, 545 U. S. 677, 696, 697 (2005) (THOMAS, J., concur­
ring). Because our jurisprudence has confounded the
lower courts and rendered the constitutionality of displays
of religious imagery on government property anyone’s
guess, I would grant certiorari.
