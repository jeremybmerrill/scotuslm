THOMAS, J., dissenting

Concurring in Allegheny, JUSTICE O’CONNOR wrote that
“the courts have made case-specific examinations” of
government actions in order to avoid “sweep[ing] away all
government recognition and acknowledgment of the role of
religion in the lives of our citizens.” 492 U. S., at 623
(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
But that is precisely the effect of this Court’s repeated
failure to apply the correct standard—or at least a clear,
workable standard—for adjudicating challenges to gov­
ernment action under the Establishment Clause. Gov­
ernment officials, not to mention everyday people who
wish to celebrate or commemorate an occasion with a
public display that contains religious elements, cannot
afford to guess whether a federal court, applying our
“jurisprudence of minutiae,” id., at 674 (KENNEDY, J.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part),
will conclude that a given display is sufficiently secular.
The safer course will be to “purge from the public sphere
all that in any way partakes of the religious.” Van Orden,
545 U. S., at 699 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).
Because “the Establishment Clause does not compel” that
result, ibid., I would grant certiorari.
