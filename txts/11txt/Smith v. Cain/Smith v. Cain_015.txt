THOMAS, J., dissenting

Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 291 (1999); see also Agurs, 427
U. S., at 109–110 (“The mere possibility that an item of
undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or
might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish ‘materiality’ in the constitutional sense.” Rather,
a “petitioner’s burden is to establish a reasonable probability of a different result.” Strickler, supra, at 291.
Instead of requiring Smith to show a reasonable probability that Boatner’s undisclosed statements would have

could have accorded some weight to Boatner’s undisclosed
statements. Smith’s burden is to show a reasonable probability that the jury would have accorded those statements
sufficient weight to alter its verdict. In light of the record
as a whole—which the Court declines to consider—Smith
has not carried that burden.

and Dale Mims documented in Ronquillo’s handwritten
notes could have been used to impeach Boatner’s identification of Smith because the statements indicate that

contains several entries about various aspects of the investigation, states, “female—face down against cabinets—
conscious.” On the next line, the note continues, “said—in
