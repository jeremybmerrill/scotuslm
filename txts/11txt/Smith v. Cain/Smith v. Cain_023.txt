THOMAS, J., dissenting

ings. Id., at 102 (Dec. 5, 1995). According to Ronquillo,
Young “was strapped to a chair. He really couldn’t talk,
[h]e mumbled. He could use his left hand, that was all.
He couldn’t walk or anything. He was fed through a tube
by the people there. He was in really bad shape.” Id., at
102–103. When asked whether Young was able to communicate with him “at all,” Ronquillo responded, “No. I
couldn’t understand anything that he was saying.” Id., at
103.
The undisclosed note from Ronquillo’s meeting with
Young reads as follows: “Short Dog/Bucko/Fats—No—
Didn’t shoot me—No—Not with me when went to house—
Yes—one of people in house shot me—No—Not responsible—‘Posse’—Didn’t drive to house—‘Posse’—Yes—Knows
names of perps—Yes—Drove in car—Yes—girlfriend’s
car.” 13 Record 2568. Smith contends that this note is
exculpatory in that it suggests that he was “not involved”
in the shootings. Brief for Petitioner 43.
Young’s statement is only exculpatory if Smith concedes
(as the statement asserts) that he is, in fact, “Short Dog”
and a member of the “Cut Throat Posse.” Such a concession would only have strengthened the inculpatory value
of the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that
Smith was the “Short Dog” who committed the murders at
Espadron’s home. In any event, the exculpatory value of
the note is minimal for several other reasons. First, it is
unclear whether Ronquillo’s note reflects a statement by
Young that the “Posse” was not responsible for shooting
the victims or a statement that the “Posse” was not responsible for shooting Young. Further, the statement that
“Short Dog” and others were not with Young when he went
to the house is certainly not a clear statement that “Short
Dog” did not commit the murders, especially in light of
evidence in the record that the assailants used two cars on
