SMITH v. CAIN
Opinion of the Court

alone suffice to undermine confidence in Smithâ€™s conviction, we have no need to consider his arguments that the
other undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under
Brady.
The judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District
Court of Louisiana is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
