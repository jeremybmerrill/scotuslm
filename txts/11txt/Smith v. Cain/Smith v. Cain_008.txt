SMITH v. CAIN
THOMAS, J., dissenting

their way through the door, demanding drugs and money.
Tr. 153–154 (Dec. 5, 1995). The first man though the door
put a gun in Boatner’s face and pushed him backwards.
Id., at 154–155. The men initially ordered Boatner and
his friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand
up. At that time, the man who had been the first one
through the door placed his gun under Boatner’s chin. Id.,
at 156–157. When Boatner asked what the men wanted
him to do, the first man struck Boatner on the back of the
head with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the ground.
Id., at 157–158.
After hearing the commotion, Espadron emerged from a
back bedroom, where she had been when the men entered
the house. As Espadron opened an inside door leading to
the kitchen, a man with a “covering” over his mouth pointed his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor. Id., at
70–71. Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back
toward the bedroom, at which point the intruders opened
fire. Id., at 71–72, 159.
When the shooting was over, four people lay dead. A
fifth person, 17-year-old Shelita Russell, was mortally
wounded and died later at the hospital. Of those originally gathered in the house, the only survivors were Boatner,
who suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first
man’s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who
escaped unharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had remained in a back bedroom during the shooting. The police
also found a man named Phillip Young at the scene.
Young was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the
head. Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never
seen Young before, the police surmised that Young had
been one of the perpetrators.1

1 Young was indicted along with Smith for the murders, but he was
deemed incompetent to stand trial due to the brain damage he suffered
