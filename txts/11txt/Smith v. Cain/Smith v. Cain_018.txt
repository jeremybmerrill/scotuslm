SMITH v. CAIN
THOMAS, J., dissenting

ing, id., at 30–31 (Dec. 4, 1995); id., at 71 (Dec. 5, 1995).
Thus, the totality of the evidence indicates that some, but
not all, of the perpetrators were masked, a conclusion that
in no way undermines Boatner’s consistent assertions that
the only perpetrator he saw was unmasked.

Smith also contends that Ronquillo’s undisclosed note
documenting a pretrial statement by firearms examiner
Kenneth Leary is material for purposes of Brady. The
note states that “Leary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM
ammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders]
was typed to have been fired from a[n] [Intratec], ‘Mac[-]
11’ model type, semi automatic weapon.” 5 Record 831.
According to Smith, this statement conflicts with Leary’s
trial testimony that the 9-millimeter ammunition found
at the scene “was fired by one particular weapon, one 9millimeter handgun,” Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an
Intratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a “handgun.” Smith further argues that Leary’s pretrial statement could have
been used to exculpate Smith, whose guilt the prosecution
attempted to show by calling a pathologist to testify that
Shelita Russell’s wounds could have been inflicted by a
9-millimeter “handgun,” id., at 39 (Dec. 4, 1995), and by
calling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held under
his chin was a 9-millimeter silver “hand gun,” id., at 157
(Dec. 5, 1995).
Contrary to Smith’s contentions, Leary’s pretrial statement does not undermine the evidence presented at trial.
Leary’s pretrial statement is consistent with his and
Boatner’s trial testimony because an Intratec or Mac-11
pistol is a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith concedes that
such a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges. Brief for
Petitioner 48. Moreover, a “handgun” is simply “[a] firearm that can be used with one hand,” American Heritage
Dictionary 819 (3d ed. 1992), and no one disputes that an
