SMITH v. CAIN
THOMAS, J., dissenting

527 U. S., at 281–282 (To make out a Brady violation, “[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the
accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is

Smith next points to purportedly exculpatory and material undisclosed pretrial statements made by Robert
Trackling, a member of the “Cut Throat Posse” street gang
with which Smith was allegedly associated, and by Eric
Rogers, an inmate who was incarcerated with Trackling.
5 Record 845. Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an
interview to investigators on May 19, 1995, during which
he described a conversation that he had with Trackling
while in prison. During that conversation, Trackling
described the murders at Espadron’s home and stated that
he had committed the crime along with “Fat, Buckle, and

that’s what they call him, they call Robert Home.” Id., at
845. Smith suggests that Rogers’ prior identification of
“Short Dog” as “Juan [Smith]” was equivocal in light of his
later statement that “Short Dog” was a man named “Robert Home.” Reply Brief 21. Second, Smith asserts that
disclosure of Rogers’ interview would have led the defense
and the jury to learn of Rogers’ allegation—made for the
first time 10 years after Smith’s trial—that the police had
asked him to implicate Juan Smith as “Short Dog,” Tr.
284–285 (Jan. 13, 2009).
Neither argument is persuasive. If the jury had learned
