THOMAS, J., dissenting

of Rogers’ statement, it would have heard information
directly inculpating Smith as “Short Dog,” a perpetrator of
the shootings. Rogers’ physical description of “Short
Dog”—“he[’s] short[,] he[’s] got golds going across his
mouth[,] and . . . he’s like built,” 5 Record 844–also corroborated Boatner’s description of the first man through the
door as having a “mouth full of gold” and a “heavy” build.
Furthermore, Smith ignores other inculpatory information
documented in Ronquillo’s notes of Rogers’ statement.
Those notes reflect Trackling’s own interview with police
on June 1, 1995, in which Trackling identified Phillips,
Bannister, and “Juan Smith” as the perpetrators of the
murders at Espadron’s home. Id., at 832; see also id., at
854–855. Trackling’s statement only strengthens the
inculpatory nature of Rogers’ interview.
Further, the jury assuredly would not have believed
Smith’s suggestion that Rogers identified “Short Dog” as a
man named “Robert Home.” When this statement is taken
in context, it appears that Rogers was describing the
nickname—“Home”9—of Robert Trackling, the “Robert”
whom Rogers had repeatedly referenced throughout his
interview. See id., at 839–850. Indeed, Rogers’ phraseology, “they call Robert Home,” was consistent with his previous comments that “[t]hey call Contez Philip Buckle,”
and “they call Darnell Banister Fat.” Id., at 845 (emphasis
added). Unsurprisingly, in the thousands of pages of

used by two black people either from the same Southern state or simply
from the South,” similar to “homey” or “home boy”); 2 Green’s Dictionary of Slang 828 (2010) (defining “home,” an abbreviation of homeboy,
as “a friend, often used in direct address”); Concise New Partridge
