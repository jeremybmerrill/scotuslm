THOMAS, J., dissenting

*

*
The question presented here is not whether a prudent
prosecutor should have disclosed the information that
Smith identifies. Rather, the question is whether the cumulative effect of the disclosed and undisclosed evidence
in Smith’s case “put[s] the whole case in such a different
light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.” Kyles,
514 U. S., at 435. When, as in this case, the Court departs
from its usual practice of declining to review alleged misapplications of settled law to particular facts, id., at 456
(SCALIA, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and KENNEDY and
THOMAS, JJ., dissenting), the Court should at least consider all of the facts. And, the Court certainly should not
decline to review all of the facts on the assumption that
the remainder of the record would only further support
Smith’s claims, as the Court appears to have done here.
Ante, at 3–4.
Such an assumption is incorrect. Here, much of the
record evidence confirms that, from the night of the murders through trial, Boatner consistently described—with
one understandable exception—the first perpetrator
through the door, that Boatner’s description matched
Smith, and that Boatner made strong out-of-court and incourt identifications implicating Smith. Some of the undisclosed evidence cited by Smith is not favorable to him
at all, either because it is of no impeachment or exculpatory value or because it actually inculpates him. Because
what remains is evidence of such minimal impeachment
and exculpatory value as to be immaterial in light of the
whole record, I must dissent from the Court’s holding that
the State violated Brady.
