THOMAS, J., dissenting

the postconviction judge—who had also presided over
Smith’s 2-day trial—denied Smith’s Brady claims.

murder.” 5 id., at 817.
Smith is correct that these undisclosed statements could

cross-examination. But the statements are not material
for purposes of Brady because they cannot “reasonably be
taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to
undermine confidence in the verdict.” Kyles, 514 U. S., at
435. When weighed against the substantial evidence that
Boatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator,
offered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occasions, and even identified him as Smith, the undisclosed
