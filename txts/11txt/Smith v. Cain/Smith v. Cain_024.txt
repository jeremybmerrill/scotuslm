SMITH v. CAIN
THOMAS, J., dissenting

the night of the murders.11 Second, had the jury learned
of Ronquillo’s note, it would have presumably heard Ronquillo testify, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that
he was not even sure whether his note actually reflected
statements by Young, given that Young “couldn’t talk,”
was “jumbled,” could only “kind of move his head,” and
sometimes would just sit and stare when Ronquillo asked
a question.12 Tr. 423–424 (Jan. 22, 2009). Accordingly,
Ronquillo explained, “I never had hide nor hair actually of
what [Young] said.” Id., at 423.
The jury thus would have evaluated Ronquillo’s note, of
unclear exculpatory value on its face, against a backdrop
of doubt as to what, if anything, Young actually communicated. The jury also would have weighed this evidence
against the strongly inculpatory nature of Boatner’s descriptions and identifications and Rogers’ and Trackling’s
statements, which corroborated Boatner’s identification.
When all of the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it
must be, Smith has not shown a reasonable probability
that the jury would have reached a different verdict.

his station house statement, Boatner explained that the loud car
that arrived at Espadron’s home was white. 5 Record 866. In Rogers’
interview with the police, Rogers said that Trackling escaped from
Espadron’s home in a burgundy car. Id., at 842.
12 Smith also contends that the defense could have used the undisclosed note to impeach Ronquillo’s trial testimony that Young was not
able to communicate with him “at all.” That argument lacks merit.
Ronquillo’s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest that
no communication occurred. Rather, Ronquillo made clear that he
simply “couldn’t understand anything that [Young] was saying.” See Tr.
103 (Dec. 5, 1995) (emphasis added). That testimony is consistent with
the garbled nature of the note, and the note thus would have had little,
if any, impeachment value.
