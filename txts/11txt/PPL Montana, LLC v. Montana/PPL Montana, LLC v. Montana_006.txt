tal Divide. The Madison flows into the Missouri, which
then continues at length to its junction with the Missis­
sippi River. The Clark Fork River is on the western side
of the Continental Divide. Its waters join the Columbia
River system that flows into the Pacific Ocean. Each river
shall be described in somewhat more detail.

The Missouri River originates in Montana and traverses
seven States before a point just north of St. Louis where
it joins the Mississippi. 19 Encyclopedia Americana 270
(int’l ed. 2006). If considered with the continuous path
formed by certain streams that provide the Missouri Riv­
er’s headwaters, the Missouri is over 2,500 miles long, the
longest river in the United States. Ibid. The Missouri
