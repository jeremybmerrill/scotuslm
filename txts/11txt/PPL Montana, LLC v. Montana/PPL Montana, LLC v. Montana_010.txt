The third river at issue in this case is the Clark Fork.
That river, which consists in large part of “long, narrow
streams confined by mountainous terrain,” rises at an elevation of about 5,000 feet in the Silver Bow Mountains
of southwestern Montana. 3 Encyclopaedia Britannica
352; Dept. of Interior, U. S. Geological Survey, J. Stevens
& F. Henshaw, Surface Water Supply of the United
States, 1907–8, Water-Supply Paper 252, pp. 81–82
(1910). The river flows northward for about 40 miles;
turns northwest for a stretch; then turns abruptly north­
east for a short stint, by which time it has descended
nearly 2,500 feet in altitude. It then resumes a north­
westward course until it empties into Lake Pend Oreille in
northern Idaho, out of which flows a tributary to the Co­
lumbia River of the Pacific Northwest. Ibid.; 1 Columbia
Gazetteer 816. The Clark Fork is “one of the wildest and
most picturesque streams in the West,” marked by “many
waterfalls and boxed gorges.” Federal Writers’ Projects of
the Works Progress Administration, Idaho: A Guide in
Word and Picture 230 (2d ed. 1950).
Lewis and Clark knew of the Clark Fork River but did
not try to navigate it, in part because the absence of salm­
on in one of its tributaries made Lewis believe “ ‘there
must be a considerable fall in [the river] below.’ ” H. Fritz,
The Lewis and Clark Expedition 38–39 (2004). This was
correct, for shortly before the Clark Fork exits to Idaho
from the northwest corner of Montana, “the waters of the
river dash madly along their rocky bed,” dropping over 30
feet in a half-mile as they rush over falls and rapids in­
cluding a “foaming waterfall” now known as Thompson
Falls. O. Rand, A Vacation Excursion: From Massachu­
setts Bay to Puget Sound 176–177 (1884); C. Kirk, A
