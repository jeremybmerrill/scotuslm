Opinion of the Court

have been left to the discretion of the Montana Board of
Land Commissioners. App. to Pet. for Cert. 128–129.
In a decision by a divided court, the Montana Supreme
Court affirmed. 355 Mont., at 461–462, 229 P. 3d, at 460–
461; id., at 462, 229 P. 3d, at 461 (dissenting opinion).
The court reasoned from the background principle that
“navigability for title purposes is very liberally construed.”
Id., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. It dismissed as having
“limited applicability” this Court’s approach of assessing
the navigability of the disputed segment of the river ra­
ther than the river as a whole. Id., at 441–442, 229 P. 3d,
at 448–449. The Montana court accepted that certain
relevant stretches of the rivers were not navigable but
declared them “merely short interruptions” insufficient as
a matter of law to find nonnavigability, since traffic had
circumvented those stretches by overland portage. Id.,
at 438, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 446, 449. Placing extensive
reliance upon evidence of present-day use of the Madison
River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of
law at the time of statehood. Id., at 439, 229 P. 3d, at 447.
Justice Rice dissented. Id., at 462, 229 P. 3d, at 461.
He stated that “courts are not to assume an entire river is
navigable merely because certain reaches of the river are
navigable.” Id., at 464, 229 P. 3d, at 462. The majority
erred, he wrote, in rejecting the “section-by-section ap­
proach” and “declaring, as a matter of law, that the
reaches claimed by PPL to be non-navigable are simply too
‘short’ to matter,” when in fact PPL’s evidence showed the
“disputed reaches of the rivers were, at the time of state­
hood, non-navigable.” Id., at 463–466, 476–477, 229 P. 3d,
at 462–464, 470.
This Court granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and
now reverses the judgment.
