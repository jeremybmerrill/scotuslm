Opinion of the Court

(summarizing J. Angell, A Treatise on the Common Law
in Relation to Water-Courses 14–18 (1824)); 3 J. Kent,
Commentaries on American Law 528–529 (9th ed. 1858).
While the tide-based distinction for bed title was the
initial rule in the 13 Colonies, after the Revolution Ameri­
can law moved to a different standard. Some state courts
came early to the conclusion that a State holds presump­
tive title to navigable waters whether or not the waters
are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide. See, e.g., Carson v. Blazer, 2 Binn. 475 (Pa. 1810); Executors of Cates v.
Wadlington, 12 S. C. L. 580 (1822); Wilson v. Forbes, 13
N. C. 30 (1828); Bullock v. Wilson, 2 Port. 436 (Ala. 1835);
Elder v. Burrus, 25 Tenn. 358 (1845). The tidal rule of
“navigability” for sovereign ownership of riverbeds, while
perhaps appropriate for England’s dominant coastal geog­
raphy, was ill suited to the United States with its vast
number of major inland rivers upon which navigation
could be sustained. See L. Houck, Law of Navigable Riv­
ers 26–27, 31–35 (1868); Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661,
667–669 (1891). By the late 19th century, the Court had
recognized “the now prevailing doctrine” of state sovereign
“title in the soil of rivers really navigable.” Shively, supra,
at 31; see Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 336 (1877) (“In
this country, as a general thing, all waters are deemed
navigable which are really so”). This title rule became
known as “navigability in fact.”
The rule for state riverbed title assumed federal consti­
tutional significance under the equal-footing doctrine. In
1842, the Court declared that for the 13 original States,
the people of each State, based on principles of sovereign­
ty, “hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters
and the soils under them,” subject only to rights surren­
dered and powers granted by the Constitution to the
Federal Government. Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet.
367, 410 (1842). In a series of 19th-century cases, the
Court determined that the same principle applied to
