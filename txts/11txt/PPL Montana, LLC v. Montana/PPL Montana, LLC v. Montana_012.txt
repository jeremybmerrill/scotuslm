PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA
Opinion of the Court

Missouri-Madison project). Yet the State did not seek, and
accordingly PPL and its predecessor did not pay, compen­
sation for use of the riverbeds. 355 Mont., at 406, 229
P. 3d, at 427. Instead, the understanding of PPL and the
United States is that PPL has been paying rents to the
United States for use of those riverbeds, as well as for use
of river uplands flooded by PPL’s projects. Reply Brief for
Petitioner 4; App. to Supp. Brief for Petitioner 4–5; Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 3, n. 3.
In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren sued PPL in
the United States District Court for the District of Mon­

that were state owned and part of Montana’s school trust

by the litigation, the State joined the lawsuit, for the first
time seeking rents for PPL’s riverbed use. The case was
dismissed in September 2005 for lack of diversity jurisdiction. Dolan v. PPL Montana, LLC, No. 9:03–cv–167

P. 3d, at 427–428. By counterclaim, the State sought a
declaration that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns
the riverbeds used by PPL and can charge rent for their
use. Id., at 408, 229 P. 3d, at 428. The Montana trial
court granted summary judgment to Montana as to navi­
gability for purposes of determining riverbed title. Id., at
408–409, 413–414, 229 P. 3d, at 428, 431–432; App. to Pet.

riverbeds. 355 Mont., at 428–429, 229 P. 3d, at 440. The
court ordered PPL to pay $40,956,180 in rent for use of
the riverbeds between 2000 and 2007. Id., at 431–432,
