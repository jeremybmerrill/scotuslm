PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA
Opinion of the Court

below receives the water . . . and brakes it into a per­
fect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in
a moment sometimes flying up in jets . . . [that] are
scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same
beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals
them. . . . [T]he [rainbow] reflection of the sun on the
sprey or mist . . . adds not a little to the beauty of this
majestically grand senery.” The Lewis and Clark
Journals: An American Epic of Discovery 129 (G.
Moulton ed. 2003) (hereinafter Lewis and Clark Jour­
nals); The Journals of Lewis and Clark 136–138 (B.
DeVoto ed. 1981).
If one proceeds alongside the river upstream from Great
Falls, as Lewis did in scouting the river for the expedition,
the other four falls in order are “Crooked Falls” (19 feet
high); “Rainbow Falls” (48 feet), which Lewis called “one of
the most bea[u]tifull objects in nature”; “Colter Falls” (7
feet), and “Black Eagle Falls” (26 feet). See Lewis and
Clark Journals 131–132; Dear Brother 109, n. 5; P. Cutright, Lewis & Clark: Pioneering Naturalists 154–156
(2003). Despite the falls’ beauty, Lewis could see that
their steep cliffs and swift waters would impede progress
on the river, which had been the expedition’s upstream
course for so many months. The party proceeded over a
more circuitous land route by means of portage, circum­
venting the Great Falls and their surrounding reach of
river before returning to travel upon the river about a
month later. See Lewis and Clark Journals 126–152.
The Upper Missouri River, both around and further
upstream of the Great Falls, shares the precipitous and
fast-moving character of the falls themselves. As it moves
downstream over the Great Falls reach, a 17-mile stretch
that begins somewhat above the head of Black Eagle Falls,
the river quickly descends about 520 feet in elevation, see
