PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA
Opinion of the Court

Co. v. United States, 256 U. S. 113, 123–124 (1921), or are
not navigable and never have been but may become so by
reasonable improvements, see Appalachian Elec. Power
Co., supra, at 407–408. With respect to the federal com­
merce power, the inquiry regarding navigation historically
focused on interstate commerce. See The Daniel Ball,
supra, at 564. And, of course, the commerce power ex­
tends beyond navigation. See Kaiser Aetna v. United
States, 444 U. S. 164, 173–174 (1979). In contrast, for title
purposes, the inquiry depends only on navigation and not
on interstate travel. See Utah, supra, at 76. This list of
differences is not exhaustive. Indeed, “[e]ach application
of [the Daniel Ball] test . . . is apt to uncover variations
and refinements which require further elaboration.” Appalachian Elec. Power Co., supra, at 406.

The primary flaw in the reasoning of the Montana Su­
preme Court lies in its treatment of the question of river
segments and overland portage.
To determine title to a riverbed under the equal-footing
doctrine, this Court considers the river on a segment­
by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the
river, under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable
or not. In United States v. Utah, for example, the Court
noted,
“the controversy relates only to the sections of the riv­
ers which are described in the complaint, and the
Master has limited his findings and conclusions as to
navigability accordingly. The propriety of this course,
in view of the physical characteristics of the streams,
is apparent. Even where the navigability of a river,
speaking generally, is a matter of common knowledge,
and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken,
it may yet be a question, to be determined upon evi­
