PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA
Opinion of the Court

States later admitted to the Union, because the States in
the Union are coequal sovereigns under the Constitution.
See, e.g., Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 228–229
(1845); Knight v. United States Land Assn., 142 U. S. 161,
183 (1891); Shively, supra, at 26–31; see United States v.
Texas, 339 U. S. 707, 716 (1950). These precedents are the
basis for the equal-footing doctrine, under which a State’s
title to these lands was “conferred not by Congress but by
the Constitution itself.” Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v.
Corvallis Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U. S. 363, 374 (1977). It
follows that any ensuing questions of navigability for determining state riverbed title are governed by federal
law. See, e.g., United States v. Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 75
(1931); United States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14 (1935).
The title consequences of the equal-footing doctrine can
be stated in summary form: Upon statehood, the State
gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then
navigable (or tidally influenced, see Phillips Petroleum Co.
v. Mississippi, 484 U. S. 469 (1988), although that is not
relevant in this case). It may allocate and govern those
lands according to state law subject only to “the para­
mount power of the United States to control such waters
for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign com­
merce.” Oregon, supra, at 14; see Montana v. United
States, 450 U. S. 544, 551 (1981); United States v. Holt
State Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 54 (1926). The United States
retains any title vested in it before statehood to any land
beneath waters not then navigable (and not tidally influ­
enced), to be transferred or licensed if and as it chooses.
See Utah, supra, at 75; Oregon, supra, at 14.
Returning to the “navigability in fact” rule, the Court
has explained the elements of this test. A basic formula­
tion of the rule was set forth in The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall.
557 (1871), a case concerning federal power to regulate
navigation:
