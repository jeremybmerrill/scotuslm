Opinion of the Court

PPL’s Thompson Falls facility) had a fall of about 1,100
feet in 250 miles and “is a mountain torrential stream, full
of rocks, rapids, and falls, . . . utterly unnavigable, and incapable of being made navigable except at an enormous
cost.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3250; see App. 379–380
(Docket No. 169). The report based its conclusions on
various failed attempts to navigate the river. It found the
Thompson Falls “a complete obstruction to navigation”
and the river around that area “exceedingly rapid, rough,
and full of rocks.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3251. This
was consistent with a 1910 Federal District Court decree.
The decree adjudicated a title dispute between two private
parties over the riverbed near and under Thompson Falls
and declared the river at that place “was and is a non­
navigable stream incapable of carrying the products of
the country in the usual manner of water transportation.”
Steele v. Donlan, Equity No. 950 (CC D Mont., July 19,
1910), p. 1; see App. 380–381 (Docket No. 169). While the
ultimate decision as to this and the other disputed river
stretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the
Montana courts upon remand, the relevant evidence
should be assessed in light of the principles discussed in
this opinion.

The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter
of law in its reliance upon the evidence of present-day,
primarily recreational use of the Madison River. Error is
not inherent in a court’s consideration of such evidence,
but the evidence must be confined to that which shows the
river could sustain the kinds of commercial use that, as a
realistic matter, might have occurred at the time of state­
hood. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of
statehood, and it concerns the river’s usefulness for “ ‘trade
and travel,’ ” rather than for other purposes. See Utah,
283 U. S., at 75–76. Mere use by initial explorers or trap­
