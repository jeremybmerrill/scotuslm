PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA
Opinion of the Court

III

A

PPL contends the opinion of the Montana Supreme
Court is flawed in three respects: first, the court’s failure
to consider with care the navigability of the particular
river segments to which title is disputed, and its disregard
of the necessary overland portage around some of those
segments; second, its misplaced reliance upon evidence of
present-day, recreational use; and third, what the state
court itself called its liberal construction of the navigabil­
ity test, which did not place the burden of proof upon
the State to show navigability. Brief for Petitioner 26. The
United States as amicus is in substantial agreement with
PPL’s arguments, although it offers a more extended dis­
cussion with respect to evidence of present-day, recrea­
tional use. Brief for United States 27–33.
It is appropriate to begin the analysis by discussing the
legal principles that control the case.
B
The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns,
hold title to the beds under navigable waters has origins
in English common law. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S.
1, 13 (1894). A distinction was made in England between
waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide (royal rivers)
and nontidal waters (public highways). With respect to
royal rivers, the Crown was presumed to hold title to the
riverbed and soil, but the public retained the right of
passage and the right to fish in the stream. With respect
to public highways, as the name suggests, the public also
retained the right of water passage; but title to the riv­
erbed and soil, as a general matter, was held in private
ownership. Riparian landowners shared title, with each
owning from his side to the center thread of the stream, as
well as the exclusive right to fish there. See Idaho v.
Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 285 (1997)
