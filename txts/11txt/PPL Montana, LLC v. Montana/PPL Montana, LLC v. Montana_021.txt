Opinion of the Court

landowner owns bed and soil to the center of the stream).
See J. Angell, A Treatise on the Law of Watercourses
18 (6th ed. 1869); Tyler v. Wilkinson, 24 F. Cas. 472, 474
(No. 14,312) (CC RI 1827) (Story, J.). Montana, moreover,
cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when
the state courts managed to divide up and apportion the
underlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their
value and the corresponding rents owed by PPL.
The Montana Supreme Court, relying upon Utah, decided that the segment-by-segment approach is inapplicable
here because it “does not apply to ‘short interruption[s] of
navigability in a stream otherwise navigable.’ ” 355 Mont.,
at 442, 229 P. 3d, at 449 (quoting Utah, 283 U. S., at 77).
This was mistaken. In Utah, this Court noted in pass­
ing that the facts of the case concerned “long reaches
with particular characteristics of navigability or non­
navigability” rather than “short interruption[s].” Id., at
77. The Court in Utah did not say the case would have a
different outcome if a “short interruption” were concerned.

Even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments
so minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer,
navigable reach for purposes of title under the equal­
footing doctrine, it is doubtful that any of the segments in
this case would meet that standard, and one—the Great
Falls reach—certainly would not. As an initial matter, the
kinds of considerations that would define a de minimis
exception to the segment-by-segment approach would be
those related to principles of ownership and title, such as
inadministrability of parcels of exceedingly small size,
or worthlessness of the parcels due to overdivision. See
Heller, The Tragedy of the Anticommons, 111 Harv. L.
Rev. 621, 682–684 (1998) (explaining that dividing property into square-inch parcels, could, absent countervailing legal mechanisms, “paralyze the alienability of scarce
