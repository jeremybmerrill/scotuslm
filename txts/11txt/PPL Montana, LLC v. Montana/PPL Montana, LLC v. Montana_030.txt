PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA
Opinion of the Court

process. While this Court does not reach the question, it
may be that by virtue of the State’s sovereignty, neither
laches nor estoppel could apply in a strict sense to bar the
State’s much belated claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and
its predecessors in title upon the State’s long failure to
assert title is some evidence to support the conclusion that
the river segments were nonnavigable for purposes of the
equal-footing doctrine.
The Montana Supreme Court’s ruling that Montana
owns and may charge for use of riverbeds across the
State was based upon an infirm legal understanding of
this Court’s rules of navigability for title under the equal­
footing doctrine. As the Court said in Brewer-Elliott, “It is
not for a State by courts or legislature, in dealing with the
general subject of beds or streams, to adopt a retroactive
rule for determining navigability which . . . would enlarge
what actually passed to the State, at the time of her ad­
mission, under the constitutional rule of equality here
invoked.” 260 U. S., at 88.
