footing and public trust doctrines.
The public trust doctrine is of ancient origin. Its roots
trace to Roman civil law and its principles can be found in
the English common law on public navigation and fishing
rights over tidal lands and in the state laws of this coun­
try. See Coeur d’Alene, 521 U. S., at 284–286; Illinois
Central R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387, 458 (1892);
D. Slade, Putting the Public Trust Doctrine to Work 3–8,
15–24 (1990); see, e.g., National Audubon Soc. v. Superior
Court of Alpine Cty., 33 Cal. 3d 419, 433–441, 658 P. 2d
709, 718–724 (1983); Arnold v. Mundy, 6 N. J. L. 1, 9–10
(1821). Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, however, which
is the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of
riverbed title, the public trust doctrine remains a matter
of state law, see Coeur d’Alene, supra, at 285 (Illinois
Central, a Supreme Court public trust case, was “ ‘neces­
sarily a statement of Illinois law’ ”); Appleby v. City of New
York, 271 U. S. 364, 395 (1926) (same), subject as well to
the federal power to regulate vessels and navigation under
the Commerce Clause and admiralty power. While equal­
footing cases have noted that the State takes title to the
navigable waters and their beds in trust for the public, see
Shively, 152 U. S., at 49, 15–17, 24, 46, the contours of
that public trust do not depend upon the Constitution.
Under accepted principles of federalism, the States retain
residual power to determine the scope of the public trust
over waters within their borders, while federal law deter­
mines riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.

As the litigation history of this case shows, Montana
filed its claim for riverbed rent over a century after the
first of the dams was built upon the riverbeds. Montana
had not sought compensation before then, despite its full
awareness of PPL’s hydroelectric projects and despite the
State’s own participation in the projects’ federal licensing
