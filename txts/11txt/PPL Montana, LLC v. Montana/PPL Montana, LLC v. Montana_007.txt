cascading over a roughly 10-mile stretch of cataracts and
rapids over which the river drops more than 400 feet; and
courses swiftly to Fort Benton, a 19th-century fur trading
post, before progressing farther east into North Dakota
and on to the Great Plains. 19 Encyclopedia Americana,

tana became a State, the Upper Missouri River above Fort
Benton was “seriously obstructed by numerous rapids and
rocks,” and the 168-mile portion flowing eastward “[f]rom
Fort Benton to Carroll, Mont., [was] called the rocky riv­

and the one first encountered by Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark when they led their remarkable expedition

“Great Falls,” the tallest of the five falls at 87 feet. W.
Clark, Dear Brother: Letters of William Clark to Jonathan
Clark 109, n. 5 (J. Holmberg ed. 2002) (hereinafter Dear
