Opinion of the Court

History of the Montana Power Company 231 (2008).
II
Petitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates
hydroelectric facilities that serve Montana residents and
businesses. Ten of its facilities are built upon riverbeds
underlying segments of the Upper Missouri, Madison, and
Clark Fork Rivers. It is these beds to which title is
disputed.
On the Upper Missouri River, PPL has seven hydroelec­
tric dams. Five of them are along the Great Falls reach,
including on the three tallest falls; and the other two are
in canyons upstream on the Stubbs Ferry stretch. See K.
Robison, Cascade County and Great Falls 56 (2011); Aar­
stad et al., supra, at 125, 119, 145–146. On the Madison
River, two hydroelectric dams are located in steep can­
yons. On the Clark Fork River, a hydroelectric facility is
constructed on the Thompson Falls.
The dams on the Upper Missouri and Madison are
called the Missouri-Madison project. The Thompson Falls
facility is called the Thompson Falls project. Both projects
are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis­
sion. PPL acquired them in 1999 from its predecessor, the
Montana Power Company. 355 Mont., at 405–406, 229
P. 3d, at 426.
PPL’s power facilities have existed at their locations for
many decades, some for over a century. See Robison,
supra, at 40 (Black Eagle Falls dam constructed by 1891).
Until recently, these facilities were operated without title­
based objection by the State of Montana. The State was
well aware of the facilities’ existence on the riverbeds—
indeed, various Montana state agencies had participated
in federal licensing proceedings for these hydroelectric
projects. See, e.g., Montana Power Co., 8 F. P. C. 751, 752
(1949) (Thompson Falls project); Montana Power Co., 27
