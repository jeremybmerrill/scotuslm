Opinion of the Court

dence, how far navigability extends.” 283 U. S., at 77.
The Court went on to conclude, after reciting and as­
sessing the evidence, that the Colorado River was naviga­
ble for its first roughly 4-mile stretch, nonnavigable for the
next roughly 36-mile stretch, and navigable for its remain­
ing 149 miles. Id., at 73–74, 79–81, 89. The Court noted
the importance of determining “the exact point at which
navigability may be deemed to end.” Id., at 90.
Similarly, in Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United
States, 260 U. S. 77, 85 (1922), the Court examined the
segment of the Arkansas River that ran along the Osage
Indian Reservation, assessing whether the Arkansas River
was “navigable in fact at the locus in quo.” The Court
concluded that the United States originally, and the Osag­
es as its grantees, unequivocally held title to the riverbeds
because the Arkansas River “is and was not navigable at
the place where the river bed lots, here in controversy,
are.” Id., at 86. The Court found the segment of river
along the reservation to be nonnavigable even though a
segment of the river that began further downstream was
navigable. Ibid. See also Oklahoma, supra, at 583, 584,
587–588, 589–591 (noting that “how far up the streams
navigability extended was not known”; assessing separate­
ly the segments of the Red River above and below its
confluence with the Washita River within Oklahoma’s
borders; and concluding that neither segment, and hence
“no part of the river within Oklahoma,” was navigable).
The Montana Supreme Court discounted the segment­
by-segment approach of this Court’s cases, calling it
“a piecemeal classification of navigability—with some
stretches declared navigable, and others declared non­
navigable.” 355 Mont., at 440–442, 229 P. 3d, at 448–449.
This was error. The segment-by-segment approach to
navigability for title is well settled, and it should not be
disregarded. A key justification for sovereign ownership of
