Opinion of the Court

“Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable
rivers in law which are navigable in fact. And they
are navigable in fact when they are used, or are sus­
ceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as
highways for commerce, over which trade and travel
are or may be conducted in the customary modes of
trade and travel on water.” Id., at 563.
The Daniel Ball formulation has been invoked in con­
sidering the navigability of waters for purposes of as­
sessing federal regulatory authority under the Constitu­
tion, and the application of specific federal statutes, as to
the waters and their beds. See, e.g., ibid.; The Montello,
20 Wall. 430, 439 (1874); United States v. Appalachian
Elec. Power Co., 311 U. S. 377, 406, and n. 21 (1940) (Fed­
eral Power Act); Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715,
730–731 (2006) (plurality opinion) (Clean Water Act); id.,
at 761 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It
has been used as well to determine questions of title to
water beds under the equal-footing doctrine. See Utah,
supra, at 76; Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 586
(1922); Holt State Bank, supra, at 56. It should be noted,
however, that the test for navigability is not applied in the
same way in these distinct types of cases.
Among the differences in application are the following.
For state title under the equal-footing doctrine, naviga­
bility is determined at the time of statehood, see Utah,
supra, at 75, and based on the “natural and ordinary condition” of the water, see Oklahoma, supra, at 591. In
contrast, admiralty jurisdiction extends to water routes
made navigable even if not formerly so, see, e.g., Ex parte
Boyer, 109 U. S. 629, 631–632 (1884) (artificial canal); and
federal regulatory authority encompasses waters that only
recently have become navigable, see, e.g., Philadelphia Co.
v. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 634–635 (1912), were once
navigable but are no longer, see Economy Light & Power
