PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA
Opinion of the Court

easier to navigate now than at statehood.
The Montana Supreme Court altogether ignored the
expert’s reasoning about the past condition of the river’s
channels and the significance of that information for
navigability. Further, contrary to the Montana Supreme
Court’s suggestion, the expert’s affidavit was not mere
evidence of change in “seasonal variations” of water depth.
355 Mont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. It provided meaning­

statehood in ways that made present-day navigation of the
river easier in all seasons than it was at the relevant time.
While the Montana court was correct that a river need not
be susceptible of navigation at every point during the year,
neither can that susceptibility be so brief that it is not a
commercial reality. Against this background, the present­
day recreational use of the river did not bear on navigabil­

The Montana Supreme Court’s reliance upon the State’s
evidence of present-day, recreational use, at least without
further inquiry, was wrong as a matter of law.

The above analysis is sufficient to require reversal of
the grant of summary judgment to Montana. Therefore, the
Court declines to decide whether the Montana Supreme
Court further erred as to the burden of proof regarding
navigability.

As a final contention, the State of Montana suggests
that denying the State title to the riverbeds here in dis­
pute will undermine the public trust doctrine, which con­
cerns public access to the waters above those beds for
purposes of navigation, fishing, and other recreational
uses. Brief for Respondent 20, 24–26. This suggestion
underscores the State’s misapprehension of the equal
