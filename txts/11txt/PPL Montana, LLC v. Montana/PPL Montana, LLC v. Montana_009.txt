Opinion of the Court

491 (CADC 1950); 2010 MT 64, ¶¶29–30, 108–109, 355
Mont. 402, 416, 442, 229 P. 3d 421, 433, 449, dropping
over 400 feet within 10 miles from the first rapid to the
foot of Great Falls, Parker, Black Eagle Falls Dam, 27
Transactions of the Am. Soc. of Civil Engineers 56 (1892).
In 1879, that stretch was a “constant succession of rapids
and falls.” Warner, supra, at 75; see also 9 The Journals
of the Lewis & Clark Expedition 171 (G. Moulton ed. 1995)
(hereinafter Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition) (“a
continued rapid the whole way for 17 miles”). Lewis noted
the water was so swift over the area that buffalo were
swept over the cataracts in “considerable quantities” and
were “instantly crushed.” Lewis and Clark Journals 136–
137. Well above the Great Falls reach, the Stubbs Ferry
stretch of the river from Helena to Cascade also had steep
gradient and was “much obstructed by rocks and danger­
ous rapids.” Report of the Secretary of War, 2 H. R. Doc.
No. 2, 54th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 301 (1895).

The second river to be considered is the Madison, one
of the Missouri River’s headwater tributaries. Named by
Lewis and Clark for then-Secretary of State James Madi­
son, the Madison River courses west out of the Northern
Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Montana in what is
now Yellowstone National Park, then runs north and
merges with the Jefferson and Gallatin Rivers at Three
Forks, Montana, to form the Upper Missouri. Lewis and
Clark Journals 158; Rivers of North America 459; 7 Encyclopaedia Britannica 658; 2 Columbia Gazetteer 2242.
Along its path, the Madison River flows through two lakes
artificially created by dams built in canyons: Hebgen Lake
and Ennis Lake. Federal Writers’ Project of the Work
