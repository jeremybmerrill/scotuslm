SACKETT v. EPA
Opinion of the Court

regulated parties into “voluntary compliance” without the
opportunity for judicial review—even judicial review of the
question whether the regulated party is within the EPA’s
jurisdiction. Compliance orders will remain an effective
means of securing prompt voluntary compliance in those
many cases where there is no substantial basis to question
their validity.

We conclude that the compliance order in this case is
final agency action for which there is no adequate remedy
other than APA review, and that the Clean Water Act does
not preclude that review. We therefore reverse the judg­
ment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
