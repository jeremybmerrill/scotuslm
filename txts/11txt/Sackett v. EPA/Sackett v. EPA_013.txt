CHANTELL SACKETT, ET VIR, PETITIONERS v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[March 21, 2012]

JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring.
Faced with an EPA administrative compliance order
threatening tens of thousands of dollars in civil penalties
per day, the Sacketts sued “to contest the jurisdictional
bases for the order.” Brief for Petitioners 9. “As a logical
prerequisite to the issuance of the challenged compliance
order,” the Sacketts contend, “EPA had to determine that
it has regulatory authority over [our] property.” Id., at
54–55. The Court holds that the Sacketts may immediately litigate their jurisdictional challenge in federal court. I
agree, for the Agency has ruled definitively on that question. Whether the Sacketts could challenge not only the
EPA’s authority to regulate their land under the Clean
Water Act, but also, at this pre-enforcement stage, the
terms and conditions of the compliance order, is a question
today’s opinion does not reach out to resolve. Not raised
by the Sacketts here, the question remains open for another day and case. On that understanding, I join the
Court’s opinion.
