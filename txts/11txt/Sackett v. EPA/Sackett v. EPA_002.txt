SACKETT v. EPA
Syllabus
Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 178, requiring the Sacketts to restore their
property according to an agency-approved plan and to give the EPA
access. Also, “legal consequences . . . flow” from the order, ibid.,
which, according to the Government’s litigating position, exposes the
Sacketts to double penalties in future enforcement proceedings. The
order also severely limits their ability to obtain a permit for their fill
from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C. §1344; 33 CFR
§326.3(e)(1)(iv). Further, the order’s issuance marks the “consummation” of the agency’s decisionmaking process, Bennett, supra, at 178,
for the EPA’s findings in the compliance order were not subject to
further agency review. The Sacketts also had “no other adequate
remedy in a court,” 5 U. S. C. §704. A civil action brought by the EPA
under 33 U. S. C. §1319 ordinarily provides judicial review in such
cases, but the Sacketts cannot initiate that process. And each day
they wait, they accrue additional potential liability. Applying to the
Corps of Engineers for a permit and then filing suit under the APA if
that permit is denied also does not provide an adequate remedy for
the EPA’s action. Pp. 4–6.
(b) The Clean Water Act is not a statute that “preclude[s] judicial
review” under the APA, 5 U. S. C. §701(a)(1). The APA creates a
“presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.”
Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 349. While
this presumption “may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn
from the statutory scheme as a whole,” ibid., the Government’s arguments do not support an inference that the Clean Water Act’s statutory scheme precludes APA review. Pp. 7–10.

622 F. 3d 1139, reversed and remanded.
SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. GINSBURG,
J., and ALITO, J., filed concurring opinions.
