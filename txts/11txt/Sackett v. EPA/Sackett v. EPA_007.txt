Opinion of the Court

order is final agency action. There is no doubt it is agency
action, which the APA defines as including even a “failure
to act.” §§551(13), 701(b)(2). But is it final? It has all of
the hallmarks of APA finality that our opinions establish.
Through the order, the EPA “ ‘determined’ ” “ ‘rights or ob­
ligations.’ ” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 178 (1997)
(quoting Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U. S. 62, 71 (1970)).
By reason of the order, the Sacketts have the legal obliga­
tion to “restore” their property according to an agency­
approved Restoration Work Plan, and must give the EPA
access to their property and to “records and documentation
related to the conditions at the Site.” App. 22, ¶2.7. Also,
“ ‘legal consequences . . . flow’ ” from issuance of the order.
Bennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Marine Terminal, supra,
at 71). For one, according to the Government’s current
litigating position, the order exposes the Sacketts to dou­
ble penalties in a future enforcement proceeding.2 It also
severely limits the Sacketts’ ability to obtain a permit for
their fill from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C.
§1344. The Corps’ regulations provide that, once the EPA
has issued a compliance order with respect to certain
property, the Corps will not process a permit application
for that property unless doing so “is clearly appropriate.”
33 CFR §326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011).3
The issuance of the compliance order also marks the
“ ‘consummation’ ” of the agency’s decisionmaking process.
——————
2 We do not decide today that the Government’s position is correct,
but assume the consequences of the order to be what the Government
asserts.
3 The regulation provides this consequence for “enforcement litigation
that has been initiated by other Federal . . . regulatory agencies.” 33
CFR §326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011). The Government acknowledges, however,
that EPA’s issuance of a compliance order is considered by the Corps to
fall within the provision. Brief for Respondents 31. Here again, we
take the Government at its word without affirming that it represents a
proper interpretation of the regulation.
