SACKETT v. EPA
Opinion of the Court

day for each violation.”1 §1319(d). And according to the
Government, when the EPA prevails against any person
who has been issued a compliance order but has failed
to comply, that amount is increased to $75,000—up to
$37,500 for the statutory violation and up to an additional
$37,500 for violating the compliance order.
The particulars of this case flow from a dispute about
the scope of “the navigable waters” subject to this en­
forcement regime. Today we consider only whether the
dispute may be brought to court by challenging the com­
pliance order—we do not resolve the dispute on the merits.
The reader will be curious, however, to know what all
the fuss is about. In United States v. Riverside Bayview
Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121 (1985), we upheld a regulation
that construed “the navigable waters” to include “freshwa­
ter wetlands,” id., at 124, themselves not actually naviga­
ble, that were adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters. Later,
in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army
Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159 (2001), we held that an
abandoned sand and gravel pit, which “seasonally ponded”
but which was not adjacent to open water, id., at 164, was
not part of the navigable waters. Then most recently, in
Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715 (2006), we consid­
ered whether a wetland not adjacent to navigable-in-fact
waters fell within the scope of the Act. Our answer was
no, but no one rationale commanded a majority of the
Court. In his separate opinion, THE CHIEF JUSTICE ex­
pressed the concern that interested parties would lack

original statute set a penalty cap of $25,000 per violation per
day. The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 104
Stat. 890, note following 28 U. S. C. §2461, as amended by the Debt
Collection Improvement Act of 1996, §3720E, 110 Stat. 1321–373, note
following 28 U. S. C. §2461, p. 1315 (Amendment), authorizes the EPA
to adjust that maximum penalty for inflation. On the basis of that
authority, the agency has raised the cap to $37,500. See 74 Fed. Reg.
626, 627 (2009).
