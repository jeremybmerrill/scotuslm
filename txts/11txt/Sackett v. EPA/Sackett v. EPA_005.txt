Opinion of the Court

guidance “on precisely how to read Congress’ limits on the
reach of the Clean Water Act” and would be left “to feel
their way on a case-by-case basis.” Id., at 758 (concurring
opinion).
The Sacketts are interested parties feeling their way.
They own a 2⁄3-acre residential lot in Bonner County,
Idaho. Their property lies just north of Priest Lake, but is
separated from the lake by several lots containing perma­
nent structures. In preparation for constructing a house,
the Sacketts filled in part of their lot with dirt and rock.
Some months later, they received from the EPA a compli­
ance order. The order contained a number of “Findings
and Conclusions,” including the following:
“1.4 [The Sacketts’ property] contains wetlands with­
in the meaning of 33 C. F. R. §328.4(8)(b); the wet­
lands meet the criteria for jurisdictional wetlands in
the 1987 ‘Federal Manual for Identifying and Deline­
ating Jurisdictional Wetlands.’
“1.5 The Site’s wetlands are adjacent to Priest Lake
within the meaning of 33 C. F. R. §328.4(8)(c). Priest
Lake is a ‘navigable water’ within the meaning of sec­
tion 502(7) of the Act, 33 U. S. C. §1362(7), and ‘wa­
ters of the United States’ within the meaning of 40
C. F. R. §232.2.
“1.6 In April and May, 2007, at times more fully
known to [the Sacketts, they] and/or persons acting on
their behalf discharged fill material into wetlands at
the Site. [They] filled approximately one half acre.

.
“1.9 By causing such fill material to enter waters of
the United States, [the Sacketts] have engaged, and
are continuing to engage, in the ‘discharge of pollu­
tants’ from a point source within the meaning of sec­
tions 301 and 502(12) of the Act, 33 U. S. C. §§1311
and 1362(12).
