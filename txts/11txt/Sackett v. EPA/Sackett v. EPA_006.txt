SACKETT v. EPA
Opinion of the Court

“1.11 [The Sacketts’] discharge of pollutants into wa­
ters of the United States at the Site without [a] per­
mit constitutes a violation of section 301 of the Act, 33
U. S. C. §1311.” App. 19–20.
On the basis of these findings and conclusions, the order
directs the Sacketts, among other things, “immediately
[to] undertake activities to restore the Site in accordance
with [an EPA-created] Restoration Work Plan” and to “provide and/or obtain access to the Site . . . [and] access to
all records and documentation related to the conditions at
the Site . . . to EPA employees and/or their designated
representatives.” Id., at 21–22, ¶¶2.1, 2.7.
The Sacketts, who do not believe that their property is
subject to the Act, asked the EPA for a hearing, but that
request was denied. They then brought this action in the
United States District Court for the District of Idaho,
seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their complaint
contended that the EPA’s issuance of the compliance order
was “arbitrary [and] capricious” under the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A), and that it
deprived them of “life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law,” in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The
District Court dismissed the claims for want of subject­
matter jurisdiction, and the United States Court of Ap­
peals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 622 F. 3d 1139
(2010).
It concluded that the Act “preclude[s] pre­
enforcement judicial review of compliance orders,” id., at
1144, and that such preclusion does not violate the Fifth
Amendment’s due process guarantee, id., at 1147. We
granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).
II
The Sacketts brought suit under Chapter 7 of the APA,
which provides for judicial review of “final agency action
for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” 5
U. S. C. §704. We consider first whether the compliance
