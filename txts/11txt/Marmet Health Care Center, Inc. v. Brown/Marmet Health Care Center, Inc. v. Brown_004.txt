MARMET HEALTH CARE CENTER v. BROWN
Per Curiam

cion, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6–7). That rule
resolves these cases. West Virginia’s prohibition against
predispute agreements to arbitrate personal-injury or
wrongful-death claims against nursing homes is a categorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of
claim, and that rule is contrary to the terms and coverage
of the FAA. See ibid. See also, e.g., Preston v. Ferrer, 552
U. S. 346, 356 (2008) (FAA pre-empts state law granting
state commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide issue
the parties agreed to arbitrate); Mastrobuono v. Shearson
Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 56 (1995) (FAA preempts state law requiring judicial resolution of claims
involving punitive damages); Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S.
483, 491 (1987) (FAA pre-empts state-law requirement
that litigants be provided a judicial forum for wage disputes); Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 10
(1984) (FAA pre-empts state financial investment statute’s
prohibition of arbitration of claims brought under that
statute).
II
The West Virginia court proposed an “alternativ[e]” holding that the particular arbitration clauses in Brown’s
case and Taylor’s case were unconscionable. Pet. App.
89a–91a, 94a. See also id., at 98a (not addressing the
question whether the arbitration agreement in Marchio’s
case is unenforceable for reasons other than public policy).
It is unclear, however, to what degree the state court’s
alternative holding was influenced by the invalid, categorical rule discussed above, the rule against predispute
arbitration agreements. For example, in its discussion of
the alternative holding, the state court found the arbitration clauses unconscionable in part because a predispute
arbitration agreement that applies to claims of personal
injury or wrongful death against nursing homes “clearly
violates public policy.” Id., at 91a.
