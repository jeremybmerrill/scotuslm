v.
SHARON A. MARCHIO, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF
PAULINE VIRGINIA WILLETT
ON PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME 

COURT OF APPEALS OF WEST VIRGINIA

Nos. 11–391 and 11–394.

Decided February 21, 2012


PER CURIAM.
State and federal courts must enforce the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., with respect to all
arbitration agreements covered by that statute. Here, the
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, by misreading
and disregarding the precedents of this Court interpreting
the FAA, did not follow controlling federal law implementing that basic principle. The state court held unenforceable all predispute arbitration agreements that apply to
claims alleging personal injury or wrongful death against
nursing homes.
The decision of the state court found the FAA’s coverage
to be more limited than mandated by this Court’s previous
cases. The decision of the State Supreme Court of Appeals
must be vacated. When this Court has fulfilled its duty to
interpret federal law, a state court may not contradict or
fail to implement the rule so established. See U. S. Const.,
Art. VI, cl. 2.
