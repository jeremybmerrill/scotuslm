MARMET HEALTH CARE CENTER v. BROWN
Per Curiam


I

This litigation involves three negligence suits against
nursing homes in West Virginia. The suits were brought
by Clayton Brown, Jeffrey Taylor, and Sharon Marchio.
In each case, a family member of a patient requiring extensive nursing care had signed an agreement with a
nursing home on behalf of the patient. The relevant parts
of the agreements in Brown’s case and Taylor’s case were
identical. The contracts included a clause requiring the
parties to arbitrate all disputes, other than claims to collect late payments owed by the patient. The contracts
included a provision holding the party filing the arbitration responsible for paying a filing fee in accordance with
the Rules of the American Arbitration Association fee
schedules. The agreement in Marchio’s case also included
a clause requiring arbitration but made no exceptions to
the arbitration requirement and did not mention filing
fees.
In each of the three cases, a family member of a patient
who had died sued the nursing home in state court, alleging that negligence caused injuries or harm resulting in
death. A state trial court dismissed the suits by Brown
and Taylor based on the agreements to arbitrate. The
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia consolidated
those cases with Marchio’s, which was before the court on
other issues.
In a decision concerning all three cases, the state court
held that “as a matter of public policy under West Virginia
law, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission
agreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence
that results in a personal injury or wrongful death, shall
not be enforced to compel arbitration of a dispute concerning the negligence.” Brown v. Genesis Healthcare Corp.,
