KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

*

*
For the reasons stated, I would hold that making a
material, false statement on a tax return does not qualify
as an aggravated felony within the compass of 8 U. S. C.
ยง1101(a)(43)(M)(i). I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
