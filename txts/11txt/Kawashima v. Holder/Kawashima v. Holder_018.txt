KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

§1101(a)(43)(M)(i); Tr. of Oral Arg. 30–31.
The elements of tax evasion are the existence of a tax
deficiency, willfulness, and “an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.” Sansone
v. United States, 380 U. S. 343, 351 (1965). As this Court’s
decisions indicate, the evasion of taxes involves deceit or
fraud upon the Government, achieved by concealing a tax
liability or misleading the Government as to the extent of
the liability. See, e.g., Spies v. United States, 317 U. S.
492, 499 (1943) (an act of tax evasion may be “any conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to
conceal”). Accordingly, courts have determined that tax
evasion is a crime of moral turpitude, because it necessarily involves fraud. See, e.g., Carty v. Ashcroft, 395 F. 3d
1081, 1085, n. 7 (CA9 2005) (fraud is “implicit in the nature of the crime” of tax evasion); Considine v. United
States, 683 F. 2d 1285, 1287 (CA9 1982) (“The express
language of section 7201 requires an intent to avoid tax (a
legitimate synonym for fraud).”); Costello v. INS, 311 F. 2d
343, 348 (CA2 1962) (“There can be no ‘wilful’ [tax] evasion without a specific intent to defraud.”), rev’d on other
grounds, 376 U. S. 120 (1964).
Even more to the point, courts have held that a conviction for tax evasion under 26 U. S. C. §7201 “conclusively
establishes fraud in a subsequent civil tax fraud proceeding.” Gray v. Commissioner, 708 F. 2d 243, 246 (CA6
1983); see Klein v. Commissioner, 880 F. 2d 260, 262
(CA10 1989) (conviction under 7201 “collaterally estops a
taxpayer from denying fraud [in a] civil tax case involving
the same years”).1 This preclusive effect obtains, courts
have explained, because “ ‘willful’ [tax evasion] includes all
of the elements of fraud.” Tomlinson v. Lefkowitz, 334
——————
1 See also, e.g., Blohm v. Commissioner, 994 F. 2d 1542, 1554 (CA11
1993); Fontneau v. United States, 654 F. 2d 8, 10 (CA1 1981)
(per curiam); Plunkett v. Commissioner, 465 F. 2d 299, 307 (CA7 1972).
