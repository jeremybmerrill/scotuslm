KAWASHIMA ET UX. v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY 

GENERAL



CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 10–577.

Argued November 7, 2011—Decided February 21, 2012

An Immigration Judge ordered the removal of resident aliens Akio and
Fusako Kawashima, determining that Mr. Kawashima’s conviction
for willfully making and subscribing a false tax return, 26 U. S. C.
§7206(1), and Mrs. Kawashima’s conviction for aiding and assisting
in the preparation of a false tax return, §7206(2), qualified as crimes
involving fraud or deceit under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (Clause
(i)) and thus were aggravated felonies for which they could be deported under §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. Holding that convictions under 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2)
in which the Government’s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 constitute
aggravated felonies under Clause (i), the Ninth Circuit affirmed, but
remanded for the Board to determine whether Mrs. Kawashima’s
conviction had caused a Government loss in excess of $10,000.
Held: Convictions under 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) in which the
Government’s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggravated
felonies pursuant to Clause (i). Pp. 3−11.
(a) The Kawashimas’ argument that they cannot be deported for
the commission of an “aggravated felony” because crimes under
§§7206(1) and (2) do not involve the fraud or deceit required by
Clause (i) is rejected. This Court looks to the statute defining the
crime of conviction, rather than the specific facts underlying the
crime, see Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U. S. 183, 186, to determine whether the Kawashimas’ offenses involve fraud or deceit within the meaning of Clause (i). Section 7206(1) provides that any person who “willfully makes and subscribes any return . . . which
contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under
the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and
