GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Nor would the $10,000 threshold set in 8 U. S. C.
§1101(a)(43)(M) prevent deportation for tax crimes far less
serious than willful tax evasion, for as many as six years
may be included in the amount-of-loss calculation. See 26
U. S. C. §6531 (setting a six-year statute of limitations for,
inter alia, tax crimes involving fraud or falsity); Brief for
Johnnie M. Walters as Amicus Curiae 15–16 (hereinafter
Walters Brief).2
Finally, the Court’s decision has adverse consequences
for the efficient handling of tax prosecutions. It is often
easier for the Government to obtain a conviction under
§7206 (false statements) than under §7201 (tax evasion).
See United States v. Olgin, 745 F. 2d 263, 272 (CA3 1984)
(unlike a conviction under §7201, a conviction under §7206
does not require proof of a tax deficiency); Considine, 683
F. 2d, at 1287 (unlike a conviction under §7201, a conviction under §7206 does not require proof of an attempt to
escape a tax). For this reason, the Government has allowed taxpayers to plead guilty to a §7206 charge in lieu of
going to trial under §7201 on an evasion charge. See
Walters Brief 19–20. Deportation consequences are important to aliens facing criminal charges. See Padilla v.
Kentucky, 559 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 10)
(“[P]reserving the client’s right to remain in the United
States may be more important to the client than any
potential jail sentence.” (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at
322)). If a §7206 charge carries the same prospect of
deportation as a §7201 charge, then an alien’s incentive to
plead guilty to any tax offense is significantly reduced.

2 One might also ask what reason Congress would have for making a
tax misdemeanor a deportable offense, while more serious crimes do not
jeopardize an alien’s residency in the United States. See, e.g., Leocal v.
Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11–12 (2004) (driving while drunk, causing
serious bodily injury to others is not an aggravated felony).
