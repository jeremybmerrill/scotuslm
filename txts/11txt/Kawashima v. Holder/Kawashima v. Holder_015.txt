AKIO KAWASHIMA, ET UX., PETITIONERS v. ERIC H.
HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[February 21, 2012]

JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER and
JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
Petitioner Akio Kawashima was convicted of preparing
a false corporate tax return in violation of 26 U. S. C.

United States. See 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).
Congress has defined “aggravated felony” to include,

to the fisc exceeds $10,000, ranks as an “aggravated felony.” See ante, at 11. Because the Kawashimas’ tax offense involved deceit and meets the monetary threshold,
the Court concludes, they have committed an aggravated
