GINSBURG, J., dissenting

F. 2d 262, 265 (CA5 1964); see Gray, 708 F. 2d, at 246
(“The elements of criminal tax evasion and civil tax fraud
are identical.”); Moore v. United States, 360 F. 2d 353, 356
(CA4 1966) (“[W]hile the criminal evasion statute does not
explicitly require a finding of fraud, the case-by-case process of construction of the civil [fraud] and criminal tax
provisions has demonstrated that their constituent elements are identical.”).
Tax offenses span a wide range, from failure to file a tax
return, 26 U. S. C. §7203, to the unauthorized use of tax
stamps, §7209. But “the gravest of offenses against the
revenues,” this Court has said, the “capstone” of tax law
violations, is tax evasion. Spies, 317 U. S., at 497, 499;
see Boulware v. United States, 552 U. S. 421, 424 (2008).
Tellingly, the Kawashimas pleaded guilty to a crime carrying a maximum prison term of three years, §7206; for tax
evasion, the maximum term is five years, §7201. It is thus
understandable that Congress would single out tax evasion, as it did in Clause (ii), specifically designating it, and
no other tax crime, an “aggravated felony” for deportation
purposes.
The Court ascribes a different purpose to Clause (ii).
Tax evasion, made criminal by §7201, the Court states,
“almost invariably,” but “not necessarily[,] involve[s] fraud
or deceit.” Ante, at 10. But see supra, at 4 and this page.
Congress likely included Clause (ii), the Court suggests,
simply “to remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies
as an aggravated felony.” Ante, at 8. In other words, in
holding that Clause (i) includes tax offenses, the Court
finds Clause (ii) largely, but not totally, redundant.
In support of the notion that tax evasion can occur
without fraud or deceit, the Court cites United States v.
Scharton, 285 U. S. 518 (1932); see ante, at 9. In that
long-obsolete case, the Court rejected the Government’s
plea for the application of an extended limitation period to
a prosecution for tax evasion. The generally applicable
