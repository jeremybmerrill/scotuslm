KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

felony and are therefore deportable.
The Court’s construction of the statute is dubious, as
I see it. For one thing, it effectively renders Clause (ii)
superfluous. Further, the Court’s reading sweeps a wide
variety of federal, state, and local tax offenses—including
misdemeanors—into the “aggravated felony” category. In
addition, today’s decision may discourage aliens from
pleading guilty to tax offenses less grave than tax evasion,
thereby complicating and delaying enforcement of the
internal revenue laws. I conclude that Clause (i) does not
address tax offenses, and would therefore hold that making a false statement on a tax return in violation of §7206
is not an “aggravated felony.”
I
Any alien convicted of an “aggravated felony” after
admission to the United States is deportable. 8 U. S. C.
§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).
Subparagraph (M) of §1101(a)(43)
includes as an “aggravated felony”:
“an offense that—
“(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the
victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or
“(ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating
to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.”
Notably, Clause (i) speaks of “loss to the victim,” Clause
(ii) of “revenue loss to the Government.” The Kawashimas
contend that Clause (i) covers crimes of fraud or deceit
causing losses unrelated to tax revenue. Tax crimes,
they argue, are addressed exclusively in Clause (ii), and
that clause designates only tax evasion proscribed by 26
U. S. C. §7201 as an “aggravated felony.” Willfully submitting a false statement proscribed by §7206, the
Kawashimas maintain, is not an “aggravated felony”
that would render them deportable under 8 U. S. C.
