KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

tion do not fall within the scope of Clause (i) because
neither “fraud” nor “deceit” is a formal element of a conviction under §7206(1) or §7206(2). The Government
responds that the Kawashimas’ convictions necessarily involved deceit because they required a showing that the
Kawashimas willfully made materially false statements.
To determine whether the Kawashimas’ offenses “involv[e]
fraud or deceit” within the meaning of Clause (i), we employ a categorical approach by looking to the statute defining the crime of conviction, rather than to the specific facts
underlying the crime. See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez,
549 U. S. 183, 186 (2007) (applying the approach set forth
in Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599–600 (1990)).
If the elements of the offenses establish that the Kawashimas committed crimes involving fraud or deceit,
then the first requirement of Clause (i) is satisfied.3
Mr. Kawashima was convicted of violating 26 U. S. C.
§7206(1), which provides that any person who “[w]illfully
makes and subscribes any return, statement, or other
document, which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and
which he does not believe to be true and correct as to
every material matter,” shall be guilty of a felony. Mr. Kawashima does not dispute that the elements of a violation
of §7206(1) include, inter alia, that the document in question was false as to a material matter, that the defendant
did not believe the document to be true and correct as to
every material matter, and that he acted willfully with the
specific intent to violate the law. See, e.g., United States v.
Aramony, 88 F. 3d 1369, 1382 (CA4 1996); United States v.
Kaiser, 893 F. 2d 1300, 1305 (CA11 1990); United States v.

3 We

note that the issue whether the Kawashimas’ offenses satisfy
the second requirement of Clause (i)—that the loss to the victim exceeded $10,000—is not before us. We address only whether their
offenses of conviction qualify as crimes “involv[ing] fraud or deceit.”
