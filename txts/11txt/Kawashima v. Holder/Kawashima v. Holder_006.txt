Opinion of the Court

reopen its decision, the Kawashimas filed petitions for
review of the Board’s decision in the United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
The Ninth Circuit held that “convictions for violating
§§7206(1) and (2) in which the tax loss to the Government
exceeds $10,000 constitute aggravated felonies under
subsection (M)(i).” 615 F. 3d 1043, 1053 (2010). The
court concluded that Mr. Kawashima’s conviction under §7206(1) qualified as an aggravated felony within
Clause (i)’s definition “because it involved ‘fraud or deceit’
and because his offense resulted in a loss to the government in excess of $10,000.” Id., at 1055. The Ninth Circuit also determined that Mrs. Kawashima’s conviction
under §7206(2) “necessarily ‘involve[d] fraud or deceit.’ ”
Id., at 1055. But because Mrs. Kawashima’s plea agreement was not in the administrative record, the Ninth
Circuit remanded to the Board to determine whether Mrs.
Kawashima’s conviction had caused a loss to the Government in excess of $10,000. Id., at 1056–1057.
We granted the Kawashimas’ petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether their convictions for violations
of 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) respectively qualify as
aggravated felonies under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i).
563 U. S. ___ (2011). We now affirm.

The Kawashimas argue that they cannot be deported for
commission of an “aggravated felony” because crimes
under §§7206(1) and (2) do not “involv[e] fraud or deceit”
as required by Clause (i). The Kawashimas also assert
that their convictions under §7206 are not “aggravated
felonies” because tax crimes are not included within
Clause (i) at all. We address each argument in turn.

The Kawashimas contend that their offenses of convic-
