KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

U. S. C. §7206, involve false statements or misleading
conduct. See, e.g., §7202 (failing to truthfully account for
and pay taxes owed). Conviction of any of these offenses,
if the Court’s construction were correct, would render an
alien deportable. So would conviction of state and local
tax offenses involving false statements. Ferreira v. Ashcroft, 390 F. 3d 1091, 1096–1097 (CA9 2004) (state-law
offenses qualify as offenses involving fraud or deceit under
8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)); see, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.
30, §574 (2009) (submitting a tax return false as to any
material matter is a criminal offense); D. C. Code §47–
4106 (2001–2005) (same); Ala. Code §40–29–114 (2003)
(same); Va. Code Ann. §58.1–1815 (2009) (willfully failing
to account truthfully for and pay certain taxes is a criminal offense).
Rendering all tax offenses involving false statements
“aggravated felon[ies]” that subject an alien to deportation
is all the more problematic, for many of these offenses are
misdemeanors. Among federal misdemeanors, see, e.g., 26
U. S. C. §7204 (“furnish[ing] a false” W-2 form to an employee); §7205 (“suppl[ying] false or fraudulent information” to an employer); §7207 (filing a return “known . . .
to be false as to any material matter”). On the state and
local level, see, e.g., Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. §1610.4
(West 1998) (“Every person who wilfully states anything
which he knows to be false in any oral or written statement, not under oath, required or authorized to be made
as the basis of an application to reduce any tax or assessment, is guilty of a misdemeanor.”); N. D. Cent. Code Ann.
§57–37.116 (Lexis 2011) (“Every person who willfully and
knowingly subscribes or makes any false statement of
facts [on an estate tax return] . . . is guilty of a class A
misdemeanor.”); Columbus, Ohio City Code §§361.31(a)(4),
(b), (d) (2009) (any person who “knowingly make[s]
and file[s] an incomplete, false or fraudulent [municipal]
return” is guilty of a fourth-degree misdemeanor).
