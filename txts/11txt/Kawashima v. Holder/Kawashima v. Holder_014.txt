Opinion of the Court

does not refer to all offenses “involving taxation.” Rather,
Clause (ii) is expressly limited to tax evasion offenses
under §7201. That textual difference undercuts any inference that Congress was considering, much less incorporating, the distinction drawn by the Guidelines.

Finally, the Kawashimas argue that subparagraph (M)’s
treatment of tax crimes other than tax evasion is ambiguous, and that we should therefore construe the statute in
their favor. It is true that we have, in the past, construed
ambiguities in deportation statutes in the alien’s favor.
See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 320 (2001). We think
the application of the present statute clear enough that
resort to the rule of lenity is not warranted.

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that convictions
under 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) in which the revenue
loss to the Government exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggravated felonies pursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i).
Because the Kawashimas are subject to deportation as
aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies
pursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the judgment of
the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
