GINSBURG, J., dissenting

§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).
The Government contends that Clause (i) covers all
tax offenses involving fraud or deceit, and that Congress
included Clause (ii) out of caution, to make certain that
persons convicted of tax evasion would be subject to deportation. Under the Government’s construction, because the
crime of making a false statement on a tax return involves
“fraud” or “deceit,” the Kawashimas committed an aggravated felony. See ante, at 5 (“the words ‘fraud’ and ‘deceit’
are absent from the text of §7206(1) and are not themselves formal elements of the crime,” nonetheless, “[the]
elements [of a §7206 crime] necessarily entail fraudulent
or deceitful conduct”).
The Court’s task is to determine which reading of
the statute is correct. If the two proffered constructions of
subparagraph (M) are plausible in roughly equal measure,
then our precedent directs us to construe the statute in
the Kawashimas’ favor. See Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333
U. S. 6, 10 (1948) (“We resolve the doubts in favor of [the
alien] because deportation is a drastic measure . . . .”); INS
v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 320 (2001) (same).

In interpreting 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M), I would rely

upon the familiar canon that statutes should be interpreted to avoid superfluity. See Corley v. United States, 556 

U. S. 303, 314 (2009) (quoting Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88,
101 (2004) (“[O]ne of the most basic interpretive canons” is
that a “statute should be construed so that effect is given
to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or
superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .”)). If Clause (i) is
construed to apply to tax crimes, then Clause (ii)’s discrete
inclusion of tax evasion would add nothing, for tax evasion
is itself an offense that, in all actual instances of which
the Government is aware, “involves fraud or deceit.” See
