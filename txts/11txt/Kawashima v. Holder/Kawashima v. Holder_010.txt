Opinion of the Court

general, non-tax crimes involving fraud or deceit that
cause actual losses to real victims in Clause (i), and
tax crimes involving revenue losses to the Government
in Clause (ii). For the reasons discussed below, this
argument cannot overcome the plain language of Clause
(i), which encompasses the Kawashimas’ offenses of
conviction.
1
The Kawashimas contend that textual differences between Clauses (i) and (ii) indicate that Congress intended
to exclude tax crimes from Clause (i). Specifically, they
note that Clause (i) addresses “loss to the victim,” whereas
Clause (ii) addresses “revenue loss to the Government.”
This difference in language does not establish Congress’
intent to remove tax crimes from the scope of Clause (i).
Clause (i) covers a broad class of offenses that involve
fraud or deceit. Clause (i) thus uses correspondingly broad
language to refer to the wide range of potential losses and
victims. Clause (ii), on the other hand, is limited to the
single type of offense “described in section 7201 of title 26
(relating to tax evasion),” which, by definition, can only
cause one type of loss (revenue loss) to one type of victim
(the Government). Congress’ decision to tailor Clause (ii)’s
language to match the sole type of offense covered by
Clause (ii) does not demonstrate that Congress also intended to implicitly circumscribe the broad scope of
Clause (i)’s plain language.

Next, the Kawashimas argue that interpreting
Clause (i) to include tax crimes violates the presumption
against superfluities by rendering Clause (ii) completely
redundant to Clause (i). Clause (ii) explicitly states that
convictions for tax evasion pursuant to 26 U. S. C. §7201
that cause a revenue loss of at least $10,000 to the Gov-
