KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

assisting her husband’s filing of a materially false tax
return, Mrs. Kawashima also committed a felony that
involved “deceit.”
The language of Clause (i) is clear. Anyone who is convicted of an offense that “involves fraud or deceit in which
the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000” has
committed an aggravated felony and is subject to deportation pursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The elements of willfully making and subscribing a false corporate tax return, in violation of 26 U. S. C. §7206(1), and of
aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return, in violation of 26 U. S. C. §7206(2), establish that
those crimes are deportable offenses because they necessarily entail deceit.

Clause (ii). The full text of subparagraph (M) reads as

“(M) an offense that—
“(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the
victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or
“(ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to
tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.”
The Kawashimas argue that when Clause (i) is read together with Clause (ii), Clause (i) must be interpreted as
being inapplicable to tax crimes. In their view, subparagraph (M), when considered in its entirety, demonstrates
that Congress was addressing two mutually exclusive
categories of crimes in subparagraph (M)’s two clauses:
