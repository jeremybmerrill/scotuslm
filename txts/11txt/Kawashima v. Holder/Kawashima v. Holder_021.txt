GINSBURG, J., dissenting

or deceit. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30–31.
The canon that statutes should be interpreted to avoid superfluity cannot be skirted as easily as the Government
here urges. We have declined to interpret legislation in
a way that “would in practical effect render [a provision]
entirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circumstances.” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 29 (2001). It
is hardly sufficient for the Government to hypothesize a
case in which the provision might have some independent
role. See id., at 30. Where, as here, “the Government
concede[s] that the independent function one could attribute to the [provision] would [rarely] arise,” a construction
moored to a case “most unlikely” to exist should be rejected. Id., at 31. It is highly improbable that “a proviso accounting for more than half of [the] text” of
§1101(a)(43)(M), i.e., Clause (ii), “would lie dormant in all
but the most unlikely situations.” See 534 U. S., at 31.
Congress’ aim in drafting §1101(a)(43) was to determine
which crimes are sufficiently serious to warrant the “drastic measure” of deportation, and which are not. See Fong
Haw Tan, 333 U. S., at 10. It is implausible that Congress, when drafting §1101(a)(43)(M), intended to address,
or was even aware of, the Government’s scenario: a taxpayer who files a truthful return, then, to thwart collection of the tax due, moves all her assets offshore. Far
more likely, Congress did not intend to include tax offenses in §1101(a)(43)(M)(i), but instead drafted that provision
to address fraudulent schemes against private victims,
then added §1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) so that the “capstone” tax
offense against the Government also qualified as an aggravated felony. See supra, at 5.

The Court’s construction of the statute is even less
plausible given the numerous offenses it would rank as
“aggravated felon[ies].” Many federal tax offenses, like 26
