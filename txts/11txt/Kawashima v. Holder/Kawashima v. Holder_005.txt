KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

ralization Service charged the Kawashimas with being
deportable from the United States as aliens who had
been convicted of an aggravated felony.1 See 8 U. S. C.
§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (“Any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable”).2 In the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress
listed categories of offenses that qualify as “aggravated
felonies” for the purpose of deportation. See §1101(a)(43).
Here, the Government charged the Kawashimas with being deportable for committing offenses under subparagraph (M) of §1101(a)(43). That subparagraph classifies
as an aggravated felony an offense that either: “(i) involves
fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or (ii) is described in section 7201 of
title 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue
loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.” Hereinafter,
we refer to §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) as “Clause (i)” and to
§1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) as “Clause (ii).”

appealed the removal order to the Board of Immigration
Appeals (Board), which affirmed the Immigration Judge’s
decision. After unsuccessfully petitioning the Board to

Naturalization Service were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration
and Customs Enforcement, and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service ceased to exist.
2 Before 1996, there were two procedures for removing aliens from the
country: “deportation” of aliens who were already present, and “exclusion” of aliens seeking entry or reentry into the country. Since 1996,
the Government has used a unified procedure, known as “removal,” for
both exclusion and deportation. See 8 U. S. C. §§1229, 1229a. We use
the terms “deportation” and “removal” interchangeably in this opinion.
