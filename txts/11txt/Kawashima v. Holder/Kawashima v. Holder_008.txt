Opinion of the Court

Marabelles, 724 F. 2d 1374, 1380 (CA9 1984); United
States v. Whyte, 699 F. 2d 375, 381 (CA7 1983). Although
the words “fraud” and “deceit” are absent from the text of
§7206(1) and are not themselves formal elements of the
crime, it does not follow that his offense falls outside of
Clause (i). The scope of that clause is not limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.
Rather, Clause (i) refers more broadly to offenses that
“involv[e]” fraud or deceit—meaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful
conduct.
When subparagraph (M) was enacted, the term “deceit”
meant a “the act or process of deceiving (as by falsification,
concealment, or cheating).” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 584 (1993). Mr. Kawashima’s conviction
under §7206(1) establishes that he knowingly and willfully
submitted a tax return that was false as to a material
matter. He therefore committed a felony that involved
“deceit.”
Turning to Mrs. Kawashima, our analysis follows a
similar path. Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of violating
26 U. S. C. §7206(2), which declares that any person who
“[w]illfully aids or assists in . . . the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter arising
under, the internal revenue laws, of a return, affidavit,
claim, or other document, which is fraudulent or is false as
to any material matter,” has committed a felony. Mrs.
Kawashima does not dispute that the elements of a violation of §7206(2) include, inter alia, that the document in
question was false as to a material matter and that the
defendant acted willfully. See Aramony, supra, at 1382;
United States v. Sassak, 881 F. 2d 276, 278 (CA6 1989);
United States v. Hooks, 848 F. 2d 785, 788–789 (CA7
1988); United States v. Dahlstrom, 713 F. 2d 1423, 1426–
1427 (CA9 1983). We conclude that Mrs. Kawashima’s
conviction establishes that, by knowingly and willfully
