KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

takes affirmative steps to evade payment by moving his
assets beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.
Although the Government concedes that evasion-ofpayment cases will almost invariably involve some affirmative acts of fraud or deceit, it is still true that the elements of tax evasion pursuant to §7201 do not necessarily
involve fraud or deceit. Thus, we conclude that the specific inclusion of tax evasion in Clause (ii) was intended to
ensure that tax evasion pursuant to §7201 was a deportable offense. Clause (ii) does not implicitly remove all other
tax offenses from the scope of Clause (i)’s plain language.

The Kawashimas also assert that the separate treatment of tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit
in the United State Sentencing Guidelines supports their
contention that Congress did not intend to include tax
crimes within Clause (i). They point to the fact that, in
1987, the United States Sentencing Commission included
within the Guidelines a category of “offenses involving
fraud or deceit.” USSG §§2F1.1 to 2F1.2 (deleted effective Nov. 1, 2001). The Commission simultaneously included “offenses involving taxation” as a separate category.
§§2T1.1 et seq. (Nov. 2011). Although the Kawashimas
acknowledge that they have found no evidence that Congress actually considered the Guidelines, they contend
that “it is likely that the language of [Clause (i)] and
[Clause (ii)] was taken from the Sentencing Guidelines” by
the sponsors of the bill that expanded the definition of
aggravated felony to include subparagraph (M). Brief for
Petitioners 29. Therefore, the theory goes, we can infer
from the similar language in the Guidelines that Congress
did not intend Clause (i) to include tax crimes.
We reject the Kawashimas’ reliance on the Guidelines.
The Kawashimas’ argument is at odds with the fact that,
unlike the Guideline that the Kawashimas cite, Clause (ii)
