Opinion of the Court

tuting an evasion or an attempted evasion of the tax.
Boulware v. United States, 552 U. S. 421, 424, n. 2 (2008).
A conviction under §7201, therefore, only qualifies as an
aggravated felony under Clause (i) if a willful, affirmative
attempt to evade a tax necessarily entails fraud or deceit.
This Court’s decision in United States v. Scharton, 285
U. S. 518 (1932), gave Congress good reason to doubt that
a conviction under §7201 satisfies that condition. In
Scharton, the defendant was indicted for attempting to
evade income taxes by falsely understating his taxable
income. The question before the Court was whether the
crime was subject to the 3-year statute of limitations
generally applicable to tax crimes, or whether it was
instead subject to the 6-year statute of limitations applicable to “ ‘offenses involving the defrauding or attempting
to defraud the United States or any agency thereof,
whether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner.’ ” Id., at
520, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §585 (1962 ed., Supp. V)).
The Government argued that the 6-year statute of limitations applied because “fraud is implicit in the concept of
evading or defeating” and because any effort to evade a tax
is tantamount to an attempt to defraud the taxing body.
285 U. S., at 520–521. The Court rejected that argument,
noting that, in an indictment for evasion, “an averment [of
intent to defraud] would be surplusage, for it would be
sufficient to plead and prove a willful attempt to evade
or defeat.” Id., at 521.
Moreover, §7201 includes two offenses: “the offense of
willfully attempting to evade or defeat the assessment of a
tax as well as the offense of willfully attempting to evade
or defeat the payment of a tax.” Sansone v. United States,
380 U. S. 343, 354 (1965) (emphasis in original). As the
Government notes, it is possible to willfully evade or defeat payment of a tax under §7201 without making any
misrepresentation. For example, §7201 can be violated by
a taxpayer who files a truthful tax return, but who also
