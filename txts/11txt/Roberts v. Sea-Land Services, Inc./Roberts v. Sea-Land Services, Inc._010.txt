ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

But “award” can also mean “grant,” or “confer or bestow
upon.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, at
152; see also ibid. (1971 ed.) (same). The LHWCA “grants”
benefits to disabled employees, and so can be said to
“award” compensation by force of its entitlement-creating
provisions. Indeed, this Court has often said that statutes
“award” entitlements. See, e.g., Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U. S.
___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (referring to “statutes that
award attorney’s fees to a prevailing party”); Barber v.
Thomas, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (appendix to majority
opinion) (slip op., at 19) (statute “awards” good-time cred­
its to federal prisoners); New Energy Co. of Ind. v.
Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 271 (1988) (Ohio statute “awards
a tax credit”); Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial
Accident Comm’n, 306 U. S. 493, 500 (1939) (California
workers’ compensation statute “award[s] compensation for
injuries to an employee”); see also, e.g., Connecticut v.
Doehr, 501 U. S. 1, 28 (1991) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment) (“Materialman’s and
mechanic’s lien statutes award an interest in real property
to workers”). Similarly, this Court has described an em­
ployee’s survivors as “having been ‘newly awarded’ death
benefits” by virtue of the employee’s death, without any
reference to a formal order. Director, Office of Workers’
Compensation Programs v. Rasmussen, 440 U. S. 29, 44,
n. 16 (1979) (quoting §906(c)’s predecessor provision, 33
U. S. C. §906(d) (1976 ed.)).
In short, the text of §906(c), in isolation, is indetermi­
nate.

Statutory language, however, “cannot be construed in a
vacuum. It is a fundamental canon of statutory construc­
tion that the words of a statute must be read in their
context and with a view to their place in the overall statu­
tory scheme.” Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489
