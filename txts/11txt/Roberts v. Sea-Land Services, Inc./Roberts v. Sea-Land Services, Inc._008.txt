ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

B
In fiscal year 2002, petitioner Dana Roberts slipped and
fell on a patch of ice while employed at respondent SeaLand Services’ marine terminal in Dutch Harbor, Alaska.
Roberts injured his neck and shoulder and did not return
to work. On receiving notice of his disability, Sea-Land
(except for a six-week period in 2003) voluntarily paid
Roberts benefits absent a compensation order until fiscal
year 2005. When Sea-Land discontinued voluntary pay­
ments, Roberts filed an LHWCA claim, and Sea-Land
controverted. In fiscal year 2007, after a hearing, an ALJ
awarded Roberts benefits at the statutory maximum rate
of $966.08 per week. This was twice the national average
weekly wage for fiscal year 2002, the fiscal year when
Roberts became disabled.
Roberts moved for reconsideration, arguing that the “ap­
plicable” national average weekly wage was the figure
for fiscal year 2007, the fiscal year when he was “newly
awarded compensation” by the ALJ’s order. The latter
figure would have entitled Roberts to $1,114.44 per week.
The ALJ denied reconsideration, and the Department of
Labor’s Benefits Review Board (or BRB) affirmed, conclud­
ing that “the pertinent maximum rate is determined by
the date the disability commences.” App. to Pet. for Cert.
20. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding
that an employee “is ‘newly awarded compensation’ within
the meaning of [§906(c)] when he first becomes entitled to
compensation.” Roberts v. Director, OWCP, 625 F. 3d
1204, 1208 (2010) (per curiam). We granted certiorari, 564
U. S. ___ (2011), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits
with respect to the time when a beneficiary is “newly
awarded compensation,” and now affirm.4
