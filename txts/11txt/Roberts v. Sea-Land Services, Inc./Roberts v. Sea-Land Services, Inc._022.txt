ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

Order ¶5.11
*
*
*
We hold that an employee is “newly awarded compensa­
tion” when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes
statutorily entitled to benefits, no matter whether, or
when, a compensation order issues on his behalf.12 The
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is
affirmed.
It is so ordered.

——————
11 Thus,

as under JUSTICE GINSBURG’s approach, an employer who
controverts still “runs the risk” of greater liability if an ALJ awards an
employee compensation at some point subsequent to the onset of
disability. See post, at 5.
12 Because “newly awarded compensation,” read in context, is unam­
biguous, we do not reach respondents’ argument that the Director’s
interpretation of §906(c) is entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).
