Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

going forward and for all uncompensated weeks covered by
the ALJ’s order.4

For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the Ninth
Circuit’s judgment and hold that an employee is “newly
awarded compensation” when her employer either volun——————
33 U. S. C. §906(b)(3). The 2007 maximum rate therefore applies to all
employees “newly awarded compensation” between October 1, 2006 and
September 30, 2007.
4 The Court asserts that an employer could “easily circumven[t]” my
approach by making voluntary payments to an injured worker that are
substantially below the employee’s “actual entitlement.” Ante, at 10,
n. 6. The prospect that an employer could successfully execute, or
would even attempt, such a strategy is imaginary. Employers who
make voluntary payments to employees are required to file a report
with the Department of Labor describing the nature of the employee’s
injury and stating the amount of the payments made. See ante, at 9–
10; 33 U. S. C. §930(a). The employer must also submit the results of
a medical evaluation of the employee’s condition. Dept. of Labor,
Longshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual §2–201(2)(b) (hereinafter Longshore Procedure Manual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/
lspm/lspm2-201.htm (as visited Mar. 14, 2012, and in Clerk of Court’s
case file). Upon receiving the employer’s report, a DOL claims examiner verifies “the compensation rate for accuracy” and must followup with the employer “[i]f the compensation rate appears low.” Longshore Procedure Manual §2–201(3)(b)(1). The chances are slim that a
claims examiner would validate a substantial underpayment. Employers who underpay benefits, moreover, are subject to a penalty equal to
10% of the amount of the underpayment. See 33 U. S. C. §914(e);
Longshore Procedure Manual §8–202(3)(c) (“If partial payments are
made by the employer, the [10% penalty] appl[ies] . . . to the difference
between the amount owed and the amount paid.”). Employers would
thus risk paying more, not less, were they to attempt to “circumven[t]”
my approach by deliberately undercompensating injured workers. And
while it is true that an employer who controverts an employee’s right to
compensation does not have to pay the 10% penalty, see ante, at 10,
n. 6, the Act does not permit an employer to pay any amount it likes
and controvert the remainder. See 33 U. S. C. §914(a) (requiring
employers either to pay benefits in full or to controvert “liability to pay
compensation” at all).
