Opinion of the Court

II
Roberts contends that “awarded compensation” means
“awarded compensation in a formal order.” Sea-Land,
supported by the Director, OWCP, responds that “awarded
compensation” means “statutorily entitled to compensa­
tion because of disability.” The text of §906(c), standing
alone, admits of either interpretation. But “our task is to
fit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.” FTC
v. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389 (1959). Only
the interpretation advanced by Sea-Land and the Director
makes §906 a working part of the statutory scheme; sup­
plies an administrable rule that results in equal treatment
of similarly situated beneficiaries; and avoids gamesman­
ship in the claims process. In light of these contextual
and structural considerations, we hold that an employee
is “newly awarded compensation” when he first becomes
disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to bene­
fits under the Act, no matter whether, or when, a compen­
sation order issues on his behalf.

We first consider “whether the language at issue has
a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519
U. S. 337, 340 (1997). The LHWCA does not define
“awarded,” but in construing the Act, as with any statute,
“ ‘we look first to its language, giving the words used their
ordinary meaning.’ ” Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director,
Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 519 U. S. 248,
255 (1997) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.
103, 108 (1990)). At first blush, Roberts’ position is ap­
pealing. In ordinary usage, “award” most often means
“give by judicial decree” or “assign after careful judgment.”
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002);
see also, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009)
(“grant by formal process or by judicial decree”).
