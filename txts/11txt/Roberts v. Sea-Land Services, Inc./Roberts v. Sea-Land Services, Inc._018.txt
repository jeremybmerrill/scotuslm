ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

payment.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 11. In Roberts’ view,
no disfigured employee may receive benefits without invoking the administrative claims process. That argument, however, runs counter to §908’s preface, which
directs that “[c]ompensation for disability shall be paid to
the employee,” and to §914(a), which requires the payment
of compensation “without an award.” It is also belied by
employers’ practice of paying §908(c)(20) benefits volun­
tarily. See, e.g., Williams-McDowell v. Newport News
Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., No. 99–0627 etc., 2000 WL
35928576, *1 (BRB, Mar. 15, 2000) (per curiam); Evans v.
Bergeron Barges, Inc., No. 98–1641, 1999 WL 35135283,
*1 (BRB, Sept. 3, 1999) (per curiam). In light of the
LHWCA’s interest in prompt payment and settled prac­
tice, “awarded” in §908(c)(20) can only be better read, as in
§906(c), to refer to a disfigured employee’s entitlement to
benefits.
Likewise, §908(d)(1) provides that if an employee who is
receiving compensation for a scheduled disability9 dies
before receiving the full amount of compensation to which
the schedule entitles him, “the total amount of the award
unpaid at the time of death shall be payable to or for the
benefit of his survivors.” See also §908(d)(2). Roberts’
interpretation of “award” would introduce an odd gap:
Only survivors of those employees who were receiving
schedule benefits pursuant to orders—not survivors of
employees who were receiving voluntary payments—
would be entitled to the unpaid balances due their dece­
dents. There is no reason why Congress would have cho­

9 Sections 908(c)(1) to (20) set forth a “schedule” of particular injuries
that entitle an employee “to receive two-thirds of his average weekly
wages for a specific number of weeks, regardless of whether his earning
capacity has actually been impaired.” Potomac Elec. Power Co. v.
Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 449 U. S. 268, 269
(1980). For example, an employee who loses an arm is entitled to two­
thirds of his average weekly wage for 312 weeks. §908(c)(1).
