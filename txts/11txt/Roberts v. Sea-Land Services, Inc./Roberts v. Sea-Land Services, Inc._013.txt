Opinion of the Court

employers can lock in the caps in effect at the time their
employees become disabled. This is a solution in search of
a problem. Under settled LHWCA practice, orders are
rare. Roberts’ interpretation would set needless adminis­
trative machinery in motion and would disrupt the con­
gressionally preferred system of voluntary compensation
and informal dispute resolution. The incongruity of Rob­
erts’ proposal is highlighted by his inability to identify a
vehicle for the entry of an order in an uncontested case.
Section 919(c), on which Roberts relies, applies only if an
employee has filed a claim. Likewise, 20 CFR §702.315(a)
applies only in the case of a claim or an employer’s notice of controversion. See §702.301. We doubt that an employee will file a claim for the sole purpose of assisting his
employer in securing a lower cap. And we will not read
§906(c) to compel an employer to file a baseless notice of
controversion. Cf. 33 U. S. C. §§928(a), (d) (providing for
assessment of attorney’s fees and costs against employers
who controvert unsuccessfully). Roberts suggests that
employers could threaten to terminate benefits in order to
induce their employees to file claims, and thus initiate the
administrative process. Construing any workers’ compen­
sation regime to encourage gratuitous confrontation be­
tween employers and employees strikes us as unsound.

Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal
year in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with
the LHWCA’s administrative structure. Section 914(b)
requires an employer to pay benefits within 14 days of
notice of an employee’s disability. To do so, an employer
must be able to calculate the cap. An employer must also
notify the Department of Labor of voluntary payments by
filing a form that indicates, inter alia, whether the “maxi­
mum rate is being paid.” Dept. of Labor, Form LS–206,
