Opinion of the Court

LHWCA clearly use “award” to mean “award in a formal
order,” and contends that the same must be true of
“awarded compensation” in §906(c). We agree that the Act
sometimes uses “award” as Roberts urges. Section 914(a),
for example, refers to the payment of compensation “to the
person entitled thereto, without an award,” foreclosing the
equation of “entitlement” and “award” that we adopt with
respect to §906(c) today.8 But the presumption that “iden­
tical words used in different parts of the same act are
intended to have the same meaning . . . readily yields
whenever there is such variation in the connection in
which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the
conclusion that they were employed in different parts of
the act with different intent.” General Dynamics Land
Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595 (2004) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted); see also, e.g.,
United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S.
200, 213 (2001). Here, we find the presumption overcome
because several provisions of the Act would make no sense
if “award” were read as Roberts proposes. Those provi­
sions confirm today’s holding because they too, in context,
use “award” to denote a statutory entitlement to compen­
sation because of disability.
For example, §908(c)(20) provides that “[p]roper and
equitable compensation not to exceed $7,500 shall be
awarded for serious disfigurement.” Roberts argues that
§908(c)(20) “necessarily contemplates administrative
action to fix the amount of the liability and direct its

8 Other

LHWCA provisions, read in context, also use award to mean
“award in a formal order.” For example, §§913(a) and 928(b), like
§914(a), refer to the payment of compensation “without an award.” And
the LHWCA distinguishes between voluntary payments and those due
under an order for purposes of punishing employer delinquency.
Compare §914(e) (10 percent penalty for late payment of “compensation
payable without an award”) with §914(f) (20 percent penalty for late
payment of “compensation, payable under the terms of an award”).
