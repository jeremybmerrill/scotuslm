Opinion of the Court

did not hold that the groups of “employees entitled to
compensation” and “employees awarded compensation”
were mutually exclusive. The former group includes the
latter: The entry of a compensation order is a sufficient
but not necessary condition for membership in the former.
See id., at 477.

Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation fur­
thers the LHWCA’s purpose of providing employees with
prompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid
delay and expedite administrative proceedings. But Rob­
erts’ remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily
pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their
employees’ injuries. These employers would owe benefits
under the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year
when their employees chose to file claims. And Roberts’
remedy would offer no relief at all to the many beneficiar­
ies entitled to less than the statutory maximum rate.
The more measured deterrent to employer tardiness is
interest that “accrues from the date a benefit came due,
rather than from the date of the ALJ’s award.” Matulic v.
Director, OWCP, 154 F. 3d 1052, 1059 (CA9 1998). The
Director has long taken the position that “interest is a
necessary and inherent component of ‘compensation’
because it ensures that the delay in payment of compensa­
tion does not diminish the amount of compensation to
which the employee is entitled.” Sproull v. Director,
OWCP, 86 F. 3d 895, 900 (CA9 1996); see also, e.g., Strachan Shipping Co. v. Wedemeyer, 452 F. 2d 1225, 1229
(CA5 1971). Moreover, “[t]imely controversion does not
relieve the responsible party from paying interest on
unpaid compensation.” Longshore Procedure Manual §8­
201, online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm8­
201.htm. Indeed, the ALJ awarded Roberts interest “on
each unpaid installment of compensation from the date
the compensation became due.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 108,
