PERRY v. PEREZ
Per Curiam

reasonable probability of failing to gain §5 preclearance,
see supra, at 6. Without such a determination, the District Court had no basis for drawing a district that does
not resemble any legislatively enacted plan.
The court’s approach in drawing other districts was
unclear. The interim plan’s Congressional District 33, for
example, disregards aspects of the State’s plan that appear to be subject to strong challenges in the §5 proceeding. See 3 id., at 600–601; 5 id., at 12–14. That much
seems appropriate, but there are grounds for concern with
the path the District Court followed from there. The
court’s order suggests that it may have intentionally
drawn District 33 as a “minority coalition opportunity
district” in which the court expected two different minority
groups to band together to form an electoral majority.
1 id., at 147. The order is somewhat ambiguous on this
point—some portions suggest that the court deliberately
designed such a district, other parts suggest that it drew
the district solely as a response to population growth in
the area. Compare id., at 146–147 (“Because much of the
growth that occurred in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex
was attributable to minorities, the new district 33 was
drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district”), with
id., at 144 (“The Court has nowhere expressly sought to
increase the performance of any opportunity district above
benchmark”). If the District Court did set out to create a
minority coalition district, rather than drawing a district
that simply reflected population growth, it had no basis for
doing so. Cf. Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U. S. 1, 13–15
(2009) (plurality opinion).
Because it is unclear whether the District Court for the
Western District of Texas followed the appropriate standards in drawing interim maps for the 2012 Texas elections, the orders implementing those maps are vacated,
and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
