Per Curiam

The District Court also erred in refusing to split voting
precincts (called “voter tabulation districts” in Texas) in
drawing the interim plans. Id., at 90, 102–103. That
choice alone prevented the District Court from following
the lead of Texas’ enacted plan—which freely splits precincts—in many areas where there were no legal challenges to the plan’s details. See id., at 102–103, 116, n. 24.
The District Court was apparently motivated by a wellintentioned desire to save Texas the time and expense of
reconfiguring precincts, and to ensure that the court’s
interim plan could be implemented in time for the upcoming election. Id., at 90, 102–103, 109. But the State’s plan
accepted the costs of splitting precincts in order to accomplish other goals, and Texas law expressly allows recasting
precincts when redistricting. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann.
§42.032 (West 2010). If a State has chosen to accept the
burden of changing its precincts, and its decision to do so
is otherwise lawful, there is no warrant for a district court
to ignore the State’s decision. Of course, in this case it
may well be that Texas will reexamine this issue in light
of the exigencies caused by the impending election.
The District Court also appears to have unnecessarily
ignored the State’s plans in drawing certain individual
districts. For example, the District Court drew an interim
District 77 that resembles neither the State’s newly enacted plan, nor the previous plan in effect prior to the 2010
census. The court said that it did so in response to alleged
constitutional violations. 1 App. 174–175. But the court
did not say that those allegations were plausible, much
less likely to succeed. Nor did the District Court rely on a
finding that the relevant aspects of the state plan stood a
——————
maps. See, e.g., Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 98 (1997). But this
Court has also explained that those “stricter standard[s]” are not
triggered where a district court incorporates unchallenged portions of a
State’s map into an interim map. Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 42–
43 (1982) (per curiam).
