population growth since 2000. A three-judge panel of the
United States District Court for the Western District of
Texas was convened. See 28 U. S. C. §2284. That court
heard argument and held a trial with respect to the plaintiffs’ claims, but withheld judgment pending resolution
of the preclearance process in the D. C. court. Cf. Branch
v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 283–285 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,
concurring).
As Texas’ 2012 primaries approached, it became increasingly likely that the State’s newly enacted plans would not
receive preclearance in time for the 2012 elections. And
the State’s old district lines could not be used, because
population growth had rendered them inconsistent with
the Constitution’s one-person, one-vote requirement. It
thus fell to the District Court in Texas to devise interim
plans for the State’s 2012 primaries and elections. See
Connor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 414–415 (1977). After
receiving proposals from the parties and holding extensive
hearings, that court issued its interim plans. The court
unanimously agreed on an interim State Senate plan, but
Judge Smith dissented with respect to the congressional
and State House plans. Texas asked this Court to stay the
interim plans pending an appeal, arguing that they were
unnecessarily inconsistent with the State’s enacted plans.
This Court granted the stay and noted probable jurisdiction. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).
Redistricting is “primarily the duty and responsibility
of the State.” Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975).
The failure of a State’s newly enacted plan to gain preclearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by
itself, require a court to take up the state legislature’s task.
That is because, in most circumstances, the State’s last
enacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan
receives preclearance. But if an intervening event—most
commonly, as here, a census—renders the current plan
unusable, a court must undertake the “unwelcome obliga-
