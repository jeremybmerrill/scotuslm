PERRY v. PEREZ
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

lenged on the grounds that they violate the Federal Constitution and §2 of the Voting Rights Act, they have not
yet been found to violate any law. Accordingly, Texas’
duly enacted redistricting plans should govern the upcoming elections. I would therefore vacate the interim orders
and remand for the United States District Court for the
Western District of Texas to consider appellees’ constitutional and §2 challenges in the ordinary course.
