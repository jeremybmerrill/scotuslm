Texas is a “covered jurisdiction” under Section 5 of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965. See 79 Stat. 439, 42 U. S. C.
§1973c(a); 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2011). Section 5 suspends

process remains ongoing. Texas was unsuccessful in its

coming weeks. Meanwhile, various plaintiffs—appellees
here—brought suit in Texas, claiming that the State’s
newly enacted plans violate the United States Constitution and §2 of the Voting Rights Act.1 Appellees alleged,
inter alia, that Texas’ enacted plans discriminate against
Latinos and African-Americans and dilute their voting
strength, notwithstanding the fact that Latinos and
African-Americans accounted for three-quarters of Texas’

2 prohibits “any State or political subdivision” from imposing any electoral practice “which results in a denial or abridgement of
the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or
color.” 42 U. S. C. §1973(a).
