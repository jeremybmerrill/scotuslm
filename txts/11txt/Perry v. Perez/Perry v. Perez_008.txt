PERRY v. PEREZ
Per Curiam

citizens of Texas,” the court erred.
In proclaiming its ability to draw an interim map “without regard to political considerations,” the District Court
relied heavily on Balderas v. Texas, No. 6:01cv158, 2001
U. S. Dist. LEXIS 25740 (ED Tex., Nov. 14, 2001)
(per curiam), summarily aff’d, 536 U. S. 919 (2002). 1
App. 182. But in Balderas there was no recently enacted
state plan to which the District Court could turn. Without
the benefit of legislative guidance in making distinctly
legislative policy judgments, the Balderas court was perhaps compelled to design an interim map based on its own
notion of the public good. Because the District Court here
had the benefit of a recently enacted plan to assist it, the
court had neither the need nor the license to cast aside
that vital aid.
Some specific aspects of the District Court’s plans seem
to pay adequate attention to the State’s policies, others do
not, and the propriety of still others is unclear. For example, in drawing State House districts in North and East
Texas, the District Court closely followed the State’s policies. See 1 App. 173; 5 id., at 25–26. Although Texas’
entire State House plan is challenged in the §5 proceedings, there is apparently no serious allegation that the
district lines in North and East Texas have a discriminatory intent or effect. 1 id., at 187, n. 4. The District Court
was thus correct to take guidance from the State’s plan in
drawing the interim map for those regions. But the court
then altered those districts to achieve de minimis population variations—even though there was no claim that the
population variations in those districts were unlawful.
Id., at 171, and n. 8. In the absence of any legal flaw in
this respect in the State’s plan, the District Court had no
basis to modify that plan.2

standard of acceptable population variation than legislatively enacted
