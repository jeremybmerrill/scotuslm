SCALIA, J., dissenting

to 16 months (rather than from six years to 16 months)
would have done nothing to reduce the jurors’ belief in his
testimony.
The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that evidence
of Storch’s prior activity as a police informant would have
helped to contradict his testimony that he had never
before testified for the district attorney. See 628 F. 3d,
at 511. The recitation of this non sequitur is its own
refutation.
Finally, the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion that both pieces
of evidence could have been used to establish Storch’s
sophistication as an informant does not hold water. To
begin with, the court erred in its belief that Storch “independently negotiated” the new deal, id., at 498. While it
was true enough that Storch “worked a deal . . . without
his public defender,” id., at 510, that does not establish
that he negotiated a deal on his own. As Maxwell acknowledges, Storch “obtained a private lawyer to work
out” the deal. Brief in Opposition 14. Moreover, the jury
was aware of this fact because Storch himself testified to
it. 3 Record 596. And it is incomprehensible how the
substitution of a 16-month-instead-of-36-month deal for a
previous 16-month-instead-of-6-year deal demonstrates
Storch’s sophistication. Of similarly questionable value is
evidence of Storch’s prior activity as a police informant.
Contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s intimations, this would not
have portrayed Storch as a wheeler-dealer who trumped
up stories to receive decreased sentences. Indeed, there
was no evidence that Storch received anything in exchange from the police, App. to Pet. for Cert. 125–126, and
as I have described, supra, at 3–4, two officers testified at
the evidentiary hearing that information he provided them
was reliable.
In view of the evidence, it is not possible to say that the
California Supreme Court’s denial of the claim “was so
lacking in justification that there was an error well under-
