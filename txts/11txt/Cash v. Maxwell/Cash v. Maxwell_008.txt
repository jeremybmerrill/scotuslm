CASH v. MAXWELL
SCALIA, J., dissenting

stood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”
Harrington v.
Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13). In fact,
it seems clear that Maxwell was not entitled to relief.

It is a regrettable reality that some federal judges like to
second-guess state courts. The only way this Court can
ensure observance of Congress’s abridgement of their
habeas power is to perform the unaccustomed task of
reviewing utterly fact-bound decisions that present no
disputed issues of law. We have often not shrunk from
that task, which we have found particularly needful with
regard to decisions of the Ninth Circuit. See, e.g., Cavazos
v. Smith, 565 U. S. 1 (2011) (per curiam) (reinstating
California conviction for assault on a child resulting in
death); Felkner v. Jackson, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (per curiam) (reinstating California conviction for sexual attack on
a 72-year-old woman); Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. ___
(2011) (reinstating Oregon conviction for murder of a
kidnaped victim); Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. 111
(2009) (reinstating California first-degree murder conviction); Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333 (2006) (reinstating
California conviction for cocaine possession); Kane v.
Garcia Espitia, 546 U. S. 9 (2005) (per curiam) (reinstating California conviction for carjacking and other offenses); Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1 (2003) (per curiam)
(reinstating California conviction for assault with a deadly
weapon); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19 (2002) (per
curiam) (reinstating capital sentence for California prisoner convicted of first-degree murder, attempted murder,
and armed robbery). Today we have shrunk, letting stand
a judgment that once again deprives California courts of
that control over the State’s administration of criminal
justice which federal law assures. We should grant the
petition for certiorari and summarily reverse the Ninth
Circuit’s latest unsupportable §2254 judgment.
