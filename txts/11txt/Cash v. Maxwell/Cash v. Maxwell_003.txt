SCALIA, J., dissenting

violated his right to due process by failing to disclose certain evidence relating to Storch. See Brady v. Maryland,
373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963). The court summarily denied the
petition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 105.
Maxwell then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus
under §2254 in the United States District Court for the
Central District of California, renewing his claims that his
conviction violated his right to due process because (1) it
was based on the false testimony of Storch; and (2) the
State failed to disclose favorable and material evidence
regarding Storch. The District Court dismissed the petition, id., at 47, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Maxwell v.
Roe, 628 F. 3d 486 (2010).

First, the Ninth Circuit set aside the state habeas
court’s determination that Storch had not fabricated his
testimony. It based that action on nothing more than
circumstantial evidence indicating that Storch was generally an untruthful person. For example, the court pointed
to various mistruths Storch purportedly told at trial (regarding, for example, his criminal history and his motivation for coming forward). But as the Ninth Circuit itself
recognized, those lies “d[o] not alone establish that Storch
lied about the confession.” Id., at 501. The Ninth Circuit
also concluded that Storch “misrepresented his sophistication and experience as a jailhouse informant.” Ibid. This
finds no support in the record. App. to Pet. for Cert. 119–
120. Storch’s only testimony as to his informant history
was that he had never before testified for the district
attorney, 3 Record 551; no evidence in the habeas record
contradicts that. The Ninth Circuit went on to conclude
that Storch had a history of falsely implicating individuals. But any evidence of this, as the state court noted, was
highly speculative, see, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 136—
