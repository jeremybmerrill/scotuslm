SCALIA, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
BRENDA CASH, ACTING WARDEN v. BOBBY JOE

MAXWELL 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–1548. Decided January 9, 2012 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996 (AEDPA) put an end to federal-district-court readjudication of issues already decided, with full due process
of law, in state criminal cases. It provides that a writ of
habeas corpus challenging a state criminal conviction
shall not be granted with respect to any claim “adjudicated
on the merits in State court proceedings,” unless that state
adjudication
“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States; or
“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the
evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” 28
U. S. C. §2254(d).
We have called this a “difficult to meet . . . and highly
deferential standard” which “demands that state-court
decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,” Cullen v.
Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted). It forbids federal courts “to
second-guess the reasonable decisions of state courts,”
Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12).
I believe that in this case the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit unquestionably ignored
