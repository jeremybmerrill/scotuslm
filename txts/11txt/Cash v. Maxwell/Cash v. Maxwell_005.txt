SCALIA, J., dissenting

mination of the facts.” The only factual determination
necessary to support the California court’s decision was
that Maxwell had not established that Storch lied. And it
is of course that point to which the California court directed its attention. (“[Certain evidence] does little to
establish whether [Storch] lied about [Maxwell’s] admissions in 1984.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 136.) What JUSTICE
SOTOMAYOR calls “the overwhelming evidence supporting
the conclusion that Storch falsely testified at Maxwell’s
trial,” ante, at 3, consists of nothing more than evidence
which establishes, at most, that Storch was an habitual
liar. That may well provide reason to suspect that Storch
testified falsely at Maxwell’s trial; or even to think it likely
that Storch testified falsely; but it does not remotely support the conclusion that it was unreasonable to determine
that Maxwell had not established that Storch testified
falsely. In finding the state court’s determination not
merely wrong but unreasonable, the Ninth Circuit plainly
did what we have said §2254(d) forbids: It “use[d] a set of
debatable inferences to set aside the conclusion reached by
the state court.” Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 342 (2006).
To make matters worse, having stretched the facts, the
Ninth Circuit also stretched the Constitution, holding that
the use of Storch’s false testimony violated the Fourteenth
Amendment’s Due Process Clause, whether or not the
prosecution knew of its falsity. See 628 F. 3d, at 506–507.
We have never held that, and are unlikely ever to do so.
All we have held is that “a conviction obtained through use
of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the
State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.”
Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, 269 (1959) (emphasis
added). This extension of due process by the Ninth Circuit
should not be left standing.
