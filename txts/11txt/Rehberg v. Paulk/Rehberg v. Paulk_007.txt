REHBERG v. PAULK
Opinion of the Court

within the legitimate sphere of legislative authority.
Immunities “well grounded in history and reason,” the
Court wrote, were not somehow eliminated “by covert
inclusion in the general language” of §1983. Id., at 376.
This interpretation has been reaffirmed by the Court
time and again and is now an entrenched feature of our
§1983 jurisprudence. See, e.g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S.
547, 554–555 (1967) (“The legislative record gives no clear
indication that Congress meant to abolish wholesale all
common-law immunities. Accordingly, this Court held . . .
that the immunity of legislators for acts within the legislative role was not abolished. The immunity of judges for
acts within the judicial role is equally well established,
and we presume that Congress would have specifically so

supra, at 418 (statute must “be read in harmony with
general principles of tort immunities and defenses rather
than in derogation of them”); Procunier v. Navarette, 434
U. S. 555, 561 (1978) (“Although the Court has recognized
that in enacting §1983 Congress must have intended to
expose state officials to damages liability in some circumstances, the section has been consistently construed as not
intending wholesale revocation of the common-law immunity afforded government officials”); Briscoe v. LaHue,
460 U. S. 325, 330 (1983) (“ ‘It is by now well settled that
the tort liability created by §1983 cannot be understood in
a historical vacuum. . . . One important assumption underlying the Court’s decisions in this area is that members of
the 42d Congress were familiar with common-law principles, including defenses previously recognized in ordinary
tort litigation, and that they likely intended these common-law principles to obtain, absent specific provisions to
the contrary’ ” (quoting Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453
U. S. 247, 258 (1981)); Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529

common law. Our cases have proceeded on the assump-
