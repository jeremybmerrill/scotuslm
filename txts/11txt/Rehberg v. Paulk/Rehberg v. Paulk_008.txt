Opinion of the Court

tion that common-law principles of . . . immunity were
incorporated into our judicial system and that they should
not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent to do so”).
B
Recognizing that “Congress intended [§1983] to be
construed in the light of common-law principles,” the
Court has looked to the common law for guidance in determining the scope of the immunities available in a §1983
action. Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 123 (1997). We
do not simply make our own judgment about the need for
immunity. We have made it clear that it is not our role “to
make a freewheeling policy choice,” Malley v. Briggs, 475
U. S. 335, 342 (1986), and that we do not have a license to
create immunities based solely on our view of sound policy, see Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 922–923 (1984).
Instead, we conduct “a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant official at common
law and the interests behind it.” Imbler, supra, at 421.
We take what has been termed a “functional approach.”
See Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 224 (1988); Burns,
supra, at 486. We consult the common law to identify
those governmental functions that were historically
viewed as so important and vulnerable to interference by
means of litigation that some form of absolute immunity
from civil liability was needed to ensure that they are
performed “ ‘with independence and without fear of consequences.’ ” Pierson, supra, at 554 (quoting Bradley v.
Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 350, n. ‡ (1872)). Taking this approach, we have identified the following functions that are
absolutely immune from liability for damages under
§1983: actions taken by legislators within the legitimate
scope of legislative authority, see Tenney, supra; actions
taken by judges within the legitimate scope of judicial
authority, see Pierson, supra; actions taken by prosecutors
in their role as advocates, see Imbler, 424 U. S., at 430–
