Opinion of the Court

U. S., at 340–341, and n. 3 (citing cases). Instead, “the
generally accepted rule” was that a private complainant
who procured an arrest or prosecution could be held liable
in an action for malicious prosecution if the complainant
acted with malice and without probable cause. See id., at
340–341; see also Briscoe, 460 U. S., at 351 (Marshall, J.,
dissenting) (“Both English and American courts routinely
permitted plaintiffs to bring actions alleging that the defendant had made a false and malicious accusation of a
felony to a magistrate or other judicial officer”); Wheeler v.
Nesbitt, 24 How. 544, 550 (1861) (“Undoubtedly, every
person who puts the criminal law in force maliciously,
and without any reasonable or probable cause, commits a
wrongful act; and if the accused is thereby prejudiced,
either in his person or property, the injury and loss so
sustained constitute the proper foundation of an action to
recover compensation”); Dinsman v. Wilkes, 12 How. 390,
402 (1852) (no immunity “where a party had maliciously,
and without probable cause, procured the plaintiff to be
indicted or arrested for an offence of which he was not
guilty”).

Rights Act, however, the prosecutorial function was increasingly assumed by public officials, and common-law
courts held that public prosecutors, unlike their private
predecessors, were absolutely immune from the types of
tort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal defendant was most likely to assert, namely, claims for malicious
prosecution or defamation. See Imbler, supra, at 441–442
(White, J., concurring in judgment); Kalina, supra, at 124,
n. 11 (noting that cases “decided after 1871 . . . granted a
broader immunity to public prosecutors than had been
available in malicious prosecution actions against private
persons who brought prosecutions at early common law”);
see also Burns, supra, at 505 (SCALIA, J., concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the
