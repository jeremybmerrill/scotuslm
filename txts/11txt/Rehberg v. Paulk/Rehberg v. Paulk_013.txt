REHBERG v. PAULK
Opinion of the Court

The factors that justify absolute immunity for trial
witnesses apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.
In both contexts, a witness’ fear of retaliatory litigation
may deprive the tribunal of critical evidence. And in
neither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability
needed to prevent perjurious testimony. In Briscoe, the
Court concluded that the possibility of civil liability was
not needed to deter false testimony at trial because other
sanctions—chiefly prosecution for perjury—provided a
sufficient deterrent. Id., at 342. Since perjury before a
grand jury, like perjury at trial, is a serious criminal
offense, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1623(a), there is no reason to
think that this deterrent is any less effective in preventing
false grand jury testimony.
B
Neither is there any reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses. In Briscoe, it was
argued that absolute immunity was not needed for policeofficer witnesses, but the Court refused to draw that distinction. The Court wrote:
“When a police officer appears as a witness, he may
reasonably be viewed as acting like any other witness
sworn to tell the truth—in which event he can make a
strong claim to witness immunity; alternatively, he
may be regarded as an official performing a critical
role in the judicial process, in which event he may
seek the benefit afforded to other governmental participants in the same proceeding. Nothing in the language of the statute suggests that such a witness belongs in a narrow, special category lacking protection
against damages suits.” 460 U. S., at 335–336 (footnote omitted).
See also id., at 342 (“A police officer on the witness stand
performs the same functions as any other witness”).
