Opinion of the Court

Malley and Kalina, already establish that a “complaining
witness” is not shielded by absolute immunity. See Brief
for Petitioner 17–22. In those cases, law enforcement
officials who submitted affidavits in support of applications for arrest warrants were denied absolute immunity
because they “performed the function of a complaining
witness.” Kalina, 522 U. S., at 131; see Malley, 475 U. S.,
at 340–341. Relying on these cases, petitioner contends
that certain grand jury witnesses—namely, those who
qualify as “complaining witnesses”—are not entitled to
absolute immunity. Petitioner’s argument is based on a
fundamental misunderstanding of the distinctive function
played by a “complaining witness” during the period when
§1983’s predecessor was enacted.
At that time, the term “complaining witness” was used
to refer to a party who procured an arrest and initiated a
criminal prosecution, see Kalina, 522 U. S., at 135
(SCALIA, J., concurring). A “complaining witness” might
not actually ever testify, and thus the term “ ‘witness’ in
‘complaining witness’ is misleading.” Ibid. See also Malley, supra, at 340 (complaining witness “procure[s] the
issuance of an arrest warrant by submitting a complaint”);
Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 164–165 (1992) (complaining
witness “set[s] the wheels of government in motion by
instigating a legal action”).
It is true that a mid-19th century complaining witness
might testify, either before a grand jury or at trial. But
testifying was not a necessary characteristic of a “complaining witness.” See M. Newell, Malicious Prosecution
368 (1892). Nor have we been presented with evidence
that witnesses who did no more than testify before a grand
jury were regarded as complaining witnesses and were
successfully sued for malicious prosecution. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 14–15, 24–25.
In sum, testifying, whether before a grand jury or at
trial, was not the distinctive function performed by a
