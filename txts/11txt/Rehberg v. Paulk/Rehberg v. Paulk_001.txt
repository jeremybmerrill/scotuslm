SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus

REHBERG v. PAULK
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 10–788.

Argued November 1, 2011—Decided April 2, 2012

Respondent, the chief investigator for a district attorney’s office, testified at grand jury proceedings that resulted in petitioner’s indictment. After the indictments were dismissed, petitioner brought an
action under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that respondent had conspired to present and did present false testimony to the grand jury.
The Federal District Court denied respondent’s motion to dismiss on
immunity grounds, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that
respondent had absolute immunity from a §1983 claim based on his
grand jury testimony.
Held: A witness in a grand jury proceeding is entitled to the same absolute immunity from suit under §1983 as a witness who testifies at
trial. Pp. 3–18.
(a) Section 1983, which derives from §1 of the Civil Rights Act of
1871, was not meant to effect a radical departure from ordinary tort
law and the common-law immunities applicable in tort suits. See,
e.g., Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 484. This interpretation of §1983
has been reaffirmed by the Court time and again. Thus, the Court
looks to the common law for guidance in determining the scope of the
immunities available in actions brought under §1983. See Kalina v.
Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 123. Taking a “functional approach,” see,
e.g., Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 224, the Court identifies those
governmental functions that were historically viewed as so important
and vulnerable to interference by means of litigation that some form
of absolute immunity from civil liability was needed to ensure that
they are “ ‘performed with independence and without fear of consequences,’ ” Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554.
The Court’s functional approach is tied to the common law’s identification of functions meriting the protection of absolute immunity,
