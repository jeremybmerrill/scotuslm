REHBERG v. PAULK
Opinion of the Court

431; and the giving of testimony by witnesses at trial, see
Briscoe, supra. By contrast, the Court has found no absolute immunity for the acts of the chief executive officer of
a State, the senior and subordinate officers of a State’s
National Guard, the president of a state university, see
Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 247–248 (1974); school
board members, see Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308,
318 (1975); the superintendent of a state hospital, see
O’Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563, 577 (1975); police
officers, see Pierson, supra, at 555; prison officials and
officers, Procunier, supra, at 561; and private coconspirators of a judge, see Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U. S. 24,
27 (1980).

While the Court’s functional approach is tied to the
common law’s identification of the functions that merit the
protection of absolute immunity, the Court’s precedents
have not mechanically duplicated the precise scope of the
absolute immunity that the common law provided to protect those functions. See, e.g., Burns, 500 U. S., at 493
(“ ‘[T]he precise contours of official immunity’ need not
mirror the immunity at common law” (quoting Anderson v.
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987))).
This approach is illustrated by the Court’s analysis of
the absolute immunity enjoyed today by public prosecutors. When §1983’s predecessor was enacted in 1871, it
was common for criminal cases to be prosecuted by private
parties. See, e.g., Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 198
(1879) (Bradley, J., dissenting) (“[E]very man in the community, if he has probable cause for prosecuting another,
has a perfect right, by law, to institute such prosecution,
subject only, in the case of private prosecutions, to the
penalty of paying the costs if he fails in his suit”). And
private prosecutors, like private plaintiffs in civil suits, did
not enjoy absolute immunity from suit. See Malley, 475
