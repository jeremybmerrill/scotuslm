Opinion of the Court

act under color of state law. See Briscoe, supra, at 329.
Section 1983 “ha[s] no precise counterpart in state law. . . .
[I]t is the purest coincidence when state statutes or the
common law provide for equivalent remedies; any analogies to those causes of action are bound to be imperfect.”
Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261, 272 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, both the scope
of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity
available in §1983 actions differ in some respects from the
common law.

A

At common law, trial witnesses enjoyed a limited form
of absolute immunity for statements made in the course
of a judicial proceeding: They had complete immunity
against slander and libel claims, even if it was alleged that
the statements in question were maliciously false. Kalina,
supra, at 133 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (citing F. Hilliard,
Law of Torts 319 (1866)); see Briscoe, supra, at 351 (Marshall, J., dissenting); Burns, 500 U. S., at 501 (opinion of
SCALIA, J.).
In Briscoe, however, this Court held that the immunity
of a trial witness sued under §1983 is broader: In such a
case, a trial witness has absolute immunity with respect to
any claim based on the witness’ testimony. When a witness is sued because of his testimony, the Court wrote,
“ ‘the claims of the individual must yield to the dictates of
public policy.’ ” 460 U. S., at 332–333 (quoting Calkins v.
Sumner, 13 Wis. 193, 197 (1860)). Without absolute immunity for witnesses, the Court concluded, the truthseeking process at trial would be impaired. Witnesses
“might be reluctant to come forward to testify,” and even if
a witness took the stand, the witness “might be inclined to
shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff ” for
“fear of subsequent liability.” 460 U. S., at 333.
