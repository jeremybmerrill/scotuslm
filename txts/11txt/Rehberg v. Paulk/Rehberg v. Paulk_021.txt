REHBERG v. PAULK
Opinion of the Court

indictment for felonies provide a preliminary hearing at
which witnesses testify. See LaFave §14.2(d), at 304, and
n. 47, 307, and n. 60. The lower courts have held that
witnesses at a preliminary hearing are protected by the
same immunity accorded grand jury witnesses, see, e.g.,
Brice v. Nkaru, 220 F. 3d 233, 239, n. 6 (CA4 2000); Curtis
v. Bembenek, 48 F. 3d 281, 284–285 (CA7 1995) (citing
cases), and petitioner does not argue otherwise, see Tr. of
Oral Arg. 51.

For these reasons, we hold that a grand jury witness is
entitled to the same immunity as a trial witness. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is
Affirmed.
