Opinion of the Court

neering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424 (1983) (quoting Douglas
Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 U. S. 211, 218–219
(1979)). “ ‘[I]f preindictment proceedings were made public,
many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come
forward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom
they testify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover,
witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be
less likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be
open to retribution.’ ” 463 U. S., at 424.
Allowing §1983 actions against grand jury witnesses

the identities of grand jury witnesses could be discovered
by filing a §1983 action and moving for the disclosure of
the transcript of grand jury proceedings. Especially in
cases involving violent criminal organizations or other
subjects who might retaliate against adverse grand jury
witnesses, the threat of such disclosure might seriously
undermine the grand jury process.

Finally, contrary to petitioner’s suggestion, recognizing
absolute immunity for grand jury witnesses does not
create an insupportable distinction between States that
use grand juries and those that do not. Petitioner argues
that it would make no sense to distinguish for purposes
of §1983 immunity between prosecutions initiated by the
return of a grand jury indictment and those initiated by
the filing of a complaint or information, and he notes that
26 States permit felony prosecutions to be brought by
information. Brief for Petitioner 23–24. But petitioner
draws the wrong analogy. In States that permit felony
prosecutions to be initiated by information, the closest
analog to a grand jury witness is a witness at a preliminary hearing. Most of the States that do not require an
