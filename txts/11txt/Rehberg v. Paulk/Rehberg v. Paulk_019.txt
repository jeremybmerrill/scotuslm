REHBERG v. PAULK
Opinion of the Court

is “someone who sets the prosecution in motion.” Tr. of
Oral Arg. 8; see Reply Brief for Petitioner 15. And petitioner maintains that the same distinction made at common law between complaining witnesses and other witnesses applies in §1983 actions. See id., at 14–16. But,
as we have explained, a complaining witness played a distinctive role, and therefore even when a “complaining
witness” testified, there was a clear basis for distinguishing between the “complaining witness” and other witnesses. Because no modern grand jury witness plays a
comparable role, petitioner’s proposed test would be of
little use. Consider a case in which the case agent or lead
detective testifies before the grand jury and provides a
wealth of background information and then a cooperating
witness appears and furnishes critical incriminating
testimony. Or suppose that two witnesses each provide
essential testimony regarding different counts of an indictment or different elements of an offense. In these
cases, which witnesses would be “complaining witnesses”
and thus vulnerable to suit based on their testimony?

Petitioner contends that the deterrent effect of civil
liability is more needed in the grand jury context because
trial witnesses are exposed to cross-examination, which is
designed to expose perjury. See Brief for Petitioner 21,
25–26. This argument overlooks the fact that a critical
grand jury witness is likely to testify again at trial and
may be cross-examined at that time. But in any event, the
force of petitioner’s argument is more than offset by a
special problem that would be created by allowing civil
actions against grand jury witnesses—subversion of grand
jury secrecy.
