REHBERG v. PAULK
Opinion of the Court

nesses should enjoy the same immunity as witnesses at
trial. This means that a grand jury witness has absolute
immunity from any §1983 claim based on the witness’
testimony. In addition, as the Court of Appeals held, this
rule may not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury
witness conspired to present false testimony or by using
evidence of the witness’ testimony to support any other
§1983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of
a prosecution. Were it otherwise, “a criminal defendant
turned civil plaintiff could simply reframe a claim to attack the preparation instead of the absolutely immune
actions themselves.” Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S.
259, 283 (1993) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part); see also Dykes v. Hosemann, 776 F. 2d
942, 946 (CA11 1985) (per curiam) (“[J]udges, on mere
allegations of conspiracy or prior agreement, could be
hauled into court and made to defend their judicial acts,
the precise result judicial immunity was designed to
avoid”). In the vast majority of cases involving a claim
against a grand jury witness, the witness and the prosecutor conducting the investigation engage in preparatory
activity, such as a preliminary discussion in which the
witness relates the substance of his intended testimony.
We decline to endorse a rule of absolute immunity that is
so easily frustrated.1

activity that a witness conducts outside of the grand jury room. For
example, we have accorded only qualified immunity to law enforcement
officials who falsify affidavits, see Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118,
129–131 (1997); Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340–345 (1986), and
fabricate evidence concerning an unsolved crime, see Buckley, 509
U. S., at 272–276.
