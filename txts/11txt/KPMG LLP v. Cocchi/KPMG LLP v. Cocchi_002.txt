KPMG LLP v. COCCHI
Per Curiam


*
*
* 

Respondents are 19 individuals and entities who bought
limited partnership interests in one of three limited partnerships, all known as the Rye Funds. The Rye Funds
were managed by Tremont Group Holding, Inc., and
Tremont Partners, Inc., both of which were audited by
KPMG. The Rye Funds were invested with financier
Bernard Madoff and allegedly lost millions of dollars as a
result of a scheme to defraud. Respondents sued the Rye
Funds, the Tremont defendants, and Tremont’s auditing
firm, KPMG.
Only the claims against KPMG are at issue in this case.
Against KPMG, respondents alleged four causes of action:
negligent misrepresentation; violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA), Fla.
Stat. 501.201 et seq. (2010); professional malpractice; and
aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. Respondents’ basic theory was that KPMG failed to use proper
auditing standards with respect to the financial statements of the partnerships. These improper audits, respondents contend, led to “substantial misrepresentations”
about the health of the funds and resulted in respondents’
investment losses. 51 So. 3d 1165, 1168 (Fla. App. 2010).
KPMG moved to compel arbitration based on the audit
services agreement that existed between it and the Tremont defendants. That agreement provided that “[a]ny
dispute or claim arising out of or relating to . . . the services provided [by KPMG] . . . (including any dispute or
claim involving any person or entity for whose benefit the
services in question are or were provided) shall be resolved” either by mediation or arbitration. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 63a. The Florida Circuit Court of the Fifteenth
Judicial Circuit Palm Beach County denied the motion.
The Court of Appeal affirmed, noting that “[n]one of the
plaintiffs . . . expressly assented in any fashion to [the
audit services agreement] or the arbitration provision.” 51
