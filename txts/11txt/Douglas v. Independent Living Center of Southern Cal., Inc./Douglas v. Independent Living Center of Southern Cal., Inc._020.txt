ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

review provisions, however, seem to stand in the way of
such a transformation. To convert the litigation into an
APA suit, the current defendant (the State) would need to
be dismissed and the agency (which is not currently a
party at all) would have to be sued in its stead. 5 U. S. C.
§§701–706. Given that APA actions also feature—among
other things—different standards of review, different
records, and different potential remedies, it is difficult to
see what would be left of the original Supremacy Clause
suit. Or, again, why one should have been permitted in
the first place, when agency review was provided by statute, and the parties were able to and did participate fully
in that process.
I would dispel all these difficulties by simply holding
what the logic of the majority’s own opinion suggests:
When Congress did not intend to provide a private right of
action to enforce a statute enacted under the Spending
Clause, the Supremacy Clause does not supply one of its
own force. The Ninth Circuit’s decisions to the contrary
should be reversed.
