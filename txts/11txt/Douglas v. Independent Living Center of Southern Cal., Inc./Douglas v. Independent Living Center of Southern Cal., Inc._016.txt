ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

traditional exercise of equity jurisdiction supports finding
a direct cause of action in the Supremacy Clause. This
contention fails for the same reason. It is a longstanding maxim that “[e]quity follows the law.” 1 J. Pomeroy,
Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence §425 (3d ed. 1905). A
court of equity may not “create a remedy in violation of
law, or even without the authority of law.” Rees v. Watertown, 19 Wall. 107, 122 (1874). Here the law established
by Congress is that there is no remedy available to private
parties to enforce the federal rules against the State. For
a court to reach a contrary conclusion under its general
equitable powers would raise the most serious concerns
regarding both the separation of powers (Congress, not
the Judiciary, decides whether there is a private right of
action to enforce a federal statute) and federalism (the
States under the Spending Clause agree only to conditions
clearly specified by Congress, not any implied on an ad hoc
basis by the courts).
This is not to say that federal courts lack equitable
powers to enforce the supremacy of federal law when such
action gives effect to the federal rule, rather than contravening it. The providers and beneficiaries rely heavily
on cases of this kind, most prominently Ex parte Young,
209 U. S. 123 (1908). Those cases, however, present quite
different questions involving “the pre-emptive assertion in
equity of a defense that would otherwise have been available in the State’s enforcement proceedings at law.” Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, 563
U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (slip op., at
1). Nothing of that sort is at issue here; the respondents
are not subject to or threatened with any enforcement
proceeding like the one in Ex parte Young. They simply
seek a private cause of action Congress chose not to
provide.
