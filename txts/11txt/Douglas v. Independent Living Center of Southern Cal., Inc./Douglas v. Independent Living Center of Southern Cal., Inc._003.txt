Syllabus
parties suggest no reasons why such standards should not be applied
here or why, now that CMS has acted, a court should reach a different result in an APA action than in a Supremacy Clause action. That
would make the Supremacy Clause challenge at best redundant.
Permitting it to continue would seem inefficient, for the federal agency is not a participant in the action, which will decide whether
agency-approved state rates violate federal law. Pp. 5–8.
(b) Given the present posture of the cases, the Court does not address whether the Ninth Circuit properly recognized a Supremacy
Clause action to enforce the federal law before the agency took final
action. To decide whether these cases may proceed under the Supremacy Clause now that the agency has acted, it will be necessary
on remand to consider at least the matters addressed by this Court.
P. 8.
