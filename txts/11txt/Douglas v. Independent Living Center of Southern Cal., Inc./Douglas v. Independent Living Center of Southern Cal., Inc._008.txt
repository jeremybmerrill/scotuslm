Opinion of the Court

In the meantime, the federal agency was also reviewing
the same state statutes to determine whether they satisfied the same federal statutory conditions. In November
2010, agency officials concluded that they did not satisfy those conditions, and the officials disapproved the
amendments. California then exercised its right to further
administrative review within the agency. The cases were
in this posture when we granted certiorari to decide
whether respondents could mount a Supremacy Clause
challenge to the state statutes and obtain a court injunction preventing California from implementing its statutes.
About a month after we heard oral argument, the federal agency reversed course and approved several of California’s statutory amendments to its plan. See Letter from
Donald M. Berwick, Administrator, CMS, to Toby Douglas,
Director, Cal. Dept. of Health Care Servs. (Oct. 27, 2011);
Letter from Larry Reed, Director, Division of Pharmacy,
Disabled and Elderly Health Programs Group, CMS, to
Toby Douglas, Director, Cal. Dept. of Health Care Servs.
(Oct. 27, 2011). In doing so, the agency also approved a
limited retroactive implementation of some of the amendments’ rate reductions. The State, in turn, withdrew its
requests for approval of the remaining amendments, in
effect agreeing (with one exception) that it would not seek
to implement any unapproved reduction. See Letter from
Michael E. Kilpatrick, Assistant Chief Counsel, Cal. Dept.
of Health Care Servs., to Benjamin R. Cohen, Director,
Office of Hearings, CMS (Oct. 27, 2011). (The exception
consists of one statute for which California has submitted
no amendment and which, by its own terms, cannot take
effect unless and until this litigation is complete, see 2010
Cal. Sess. Laws ch. 725, §25.)
II
All parties agree that the agency’s approval of the enjoined rate reductions does not make these cases moot.
