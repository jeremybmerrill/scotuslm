DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF
SOUTHERN CAL., INC.
Opinion of the Court 





with (and pre-empts) state Medicaid statutes that reduce
payments to providers. Since we granted certiorari, however, the relevant circumstances have changed. The federal agency in charge of administering Medicaid, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has now
approved the state statutes as consistent with the federal
law. In light of the changed circumstances, we believe
that the question before us now is whether, once the agency has approved the state statutes, groups of Medicaid
providers and beneficiaries may still maintain a Supremacy Clause action asserting that the state statutes are
inconsistent with the federal Medicaid law. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the Ninth Circuit’s judgments and remand these cases for proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

A

Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that
provides medical care to needy individuals. To qualify
for federal funds, States must submit to a federal agency
(CMS, a division of the Department of Health and Human
Services) a state Medicaid plan that details the nature and
scope of the State’s Medicaid program. It must also submit any amendments to the plan that it may make from
time to time. And it must receive the agency’s approval of
the plan and any amendments. Before granting approval,
the agency reviews the State’s plan and amendments to
determine whether they comply with the statutory and
regulatory requirements governing the Medicaid program.
See 42 U. S. C. §§1316(a)(1), (b), 1396a(a), (b); 42 CFR
§430.10 et seq. (2010); Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn.,
496 U. S. 498, 502 (1990). And the agency’s director has
specified that the agency will not provide federal funds for
any state plan amendment until the agency approves the
amendment. See Letter from Timothy M. Westmoreland,
