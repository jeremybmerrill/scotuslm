DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF
SOUTHERN CAL., INC.
Opinion of the Court 





to the federal agency a series of plan amendments designed to implement most of the reductions contained in
these bills. Before the agency finished reviewing the
amendments, however, groups of Medicaid providers and
beneficiaries filed a series of lawsuits seeking to enjoin the
rate reductions on the ground that they conflicted with,
and therefore were pre-empted by, federal Medicaid law,
in particular the statutory provision that we have just
set forth. They argued that California’s Medicaid plan
amendments were inconsistent with the federal provision
because the State had failed to study whether the rate
reductions would be consistent with the statutory factors
of efficiency, economy, quality, and access to care. In
effect, they argued that California had not shown that its
Medicaid plan, as amended, would “enlist enough providers” to make Medicaid “care and services” sufficiently
available. 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(30)(A).
The consolidated cases before us encompass five lawsuits brought by Medicaid providers and beneficiaries
against state officials. Those cases produced seven decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See
572 F. 3d 644 (2009); 342 Fed. Appx. 306 (2009); 596 F. 3d
1098 (2010); 563 F. 3d 847 (2009); 374 Fed. Appx. 690
(2010); 596 F. 3d 1087 (2010); and 380 Fed. Appx. 656
(2010). The decisions ultimately affirmed or ordered
preliminary injunctions that prevented the State from implementing its statutes. They (1) held that the Medicaid providers and beneficiaries could directly bring an
action based on the Supremacy Clause; (2) essentially
accepted the claim that the State had not demonstrated
that its Medicaid plan, as amended, would provide sufficient services; (3) held that the amendments consequently
conflicted with the statutory provision we have quoted;
and (4) held that, given the Constitution’s Supremacy
Clause, the federal statute must prevail. That is to say,
the federal statute pre-empted the State’s new laws.
