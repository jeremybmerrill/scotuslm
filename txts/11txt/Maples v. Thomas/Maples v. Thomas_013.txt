Opinion of the Court

contacted his mother. Id., at 258a. She telephoned Sullivan & Cromwell to inquire about her son’s case. Ibid.
Prompted by her call, Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys
Marc De Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer submitted a motion, through Butler, asking the trial court to
reissue its order denying Maples’ Rule 32 petition, thereby
restarting the 42-day appeal period. Id., at 222a.
The trial court denied the motion, id., at 222a–225a, noting that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had not withdrawn
from the case and, consequently, were “still attorneys of record for the petitioner,” id., at 223a. Furthermore, the court added, attorneys De Leeuw, Duffy, and
Brewer had not “yet been admitted to practice in Alabama” or “entered appearances as attorneys of record.”
Ibid. “How,” the court asked, “can a Circuit Clerk in
Decatur, Alabama know what is going on in a law firm in
New York, New York?” Id., at 223a–224a. Declining to
blame the clerk for the missed notice of appeal deadline,
the court said it was “unwilling to enter into subterfuge in
order to gloss over mistakes made by counsel for the petitioner.” Ibid.
Maples next petitioned the Alabama Court of Criminal
Appeals for a writ of mandamus, granting him leave to file
an out-of-time appeal. Rejecting Maples’ plea, the Court of
Criminal Appeals determined that, although the clerk had
“assumed a duty to notify the parties of the resolution of
Maples’s Rule 32 petition,” the clerk had satisfied that
obligation by sending notices to the attorneys of record at
the addresses those attorneys provided. Id., at 234a–235a.
Butler’s receipt of the order, the court observed, sufficed to
notify all attorneys “in light of their apparent co-counsel
status.” Id., at 235a–236a (quoting Thomas v. Kellett, 489
So. 2d 554, 555 (Ala. 1986)). The Alabama Supreme Court
summarily affirmed the Court of Criminal Appeals’ judgment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 237a, and this Court denied
certiorari, Maples v. Alabama, 543 U. S. 1148 (2005).
