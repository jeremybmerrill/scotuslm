Opinion of the Court

“extraordinary circumstances beyond his control,” ibid.,
necessary to lift the state procedural bar to his federal
petition.
B
From the time he filed his initial Rule 32 petition until
well after time ran out for appealing the trial court’s
denial of that petition, Maples had only three attorneys of
record: Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler. Unknown to
Maples, not one of these lawyers was in fact serving as his
attorney during the 42 days permitted for an appeal from
the trial court’s order.

The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell represented Maples throughout his state postconviction proceedings. Accordingly, the State urges, Maples cannot
establish abandonment by counsel continuing through the
six weeks allowed for noticing an appeal from the trial
court’s denial of his Rule 32 petition. We disagree. It is
undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their
agency relationship with Maples long before the default
occurred. See Brief for Respondent 47 (conceding that the
two attorneys erred in failing to file motions to withdraw
from the case). Both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left
Sullivan & Cromwell’s employ in the summer of 2002, at
least nine months before the Alabama trial court entered
its order denying Rule 32 relief. App. to Pet. for Cert.
258a. Their new employment—Munanka as a law clerk
for a federal judge, Ingen-Housz as an employee of the
European Commission in Belgium—disabled them from
continuing to represent Maples. See Code of Conduct for
Judicial Employees, Canon 4(D)(3) (1999) (prohibiting
judicial employees from participating in “litigation against
federal, state or local government”); Staff Regulations of
Officials of the European Commission, Tit. I, Art. 12b
