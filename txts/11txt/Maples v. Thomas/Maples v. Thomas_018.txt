MAPLES v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

the court. 560 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 3–4) (brackets
and internal quotation marks omitted); see Nara v. Frank,
264 F. 3d 310, 320 (CA3 2001) (ordering a hearing on
whether a client’s effective abandonment by his lawyer
merited tolling of the one-year deadline for filing a federal
habeas petition).
In a concurring opinion in Holland, JUSTICE ALITO
homed in on the essential difference between a claim of
attorney error, however egregious, and a claim that an
attorney had essentially abandoned his client. 560 U. S.,
at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–7). Holland’s plea fit the latter
category: He alleged abandonment “evidenced by counsel’s
near-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to
respond to petitioner’s many inquiries and requests over a
period of several years.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see id.,
at ___–___, ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 3–4, 20). If
true, JUSTICE ALITO explained, “petitioner’s allegations
would suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances
beyond his control[:] Common sense dictates that a litigant cannot be held constructively responsible for the
conduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent
in any meaningful sense of that word.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,
at 6).7
We agree that, under agency principles, a client cannot
be charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who
has abandoned him. Nor can a client be faulted for failing
to act on his own behalf when he lacks reason to believe
his attorneys of record, in fact, are not representing him.
We therefore inquire whether Maples has shown that his
attorneys of record abandoned him, thereby supplying the

7 Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), involved tolling of a federal
time bar, while Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), concerned
cause for excusing a procedural default in state court. See Holland, 560
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18). We see no reason, however, why the
distinction between attorney negligence and attorney abandonment
should not hold in both contexts.
