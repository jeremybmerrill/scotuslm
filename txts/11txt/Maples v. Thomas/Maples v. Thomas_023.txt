Opinion of the Court

beside the point. At the time critical to preserving Maples’
access to an appeal, they, like Munanka and Ingen-Housz,
were not Maples’ authorized agents.
2
Maples’ only other attorney of record, local counsel
Butler, also left him abandoned. Indeed, Butler did not
even begin to represent Maples. Butler informed Munanka and Ingen-Housz that he would serve as local counsel
only for the purpose of enabling the two out-of-state attorneys to appear pro hac vice. Supra, at 5–6. Lacking the
necessary “resources, available time [and] experience,”
Butler told the two Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers, he
would not “deal with substantive issues in the case.” Ibid.
That the minimal participation he undertook was inconsistent with Alabama law, see Rule VII, supra, at 5, underscores the absurdity of holding Maples barred because
Butler signed on as local counsel.
In recognizing that Butler had no role in the case other
than to allow Munanka and Ingen-Housz to appear pro
hac vice, we need not rely solely on Butler’s and De
Leeuw’s statements to that effect. App. to Pet. for Cert.
255a–258a. Other factors confirm that Butler did not
“operat[e] as [Maples’] agent in any meaningful sense of
that word.” Holland, 560 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6).
The first is Butler’s own conduct. Upon receiving a copy of
the trial court’s Rule 32 order, Butler did not contact
Sullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were
taking appropriate action. Although Butler had reason to
believe that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had received a
copy of the court’s order, see App. 225 (indicating that
Munanka and Ingen-Housz were CC’d on the order), Butler’s failure even to place a phone call to the New York
firm substantiates his disclaimer of any genuinely representative role in the case.
