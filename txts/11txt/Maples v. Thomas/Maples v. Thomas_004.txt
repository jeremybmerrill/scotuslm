MAPLES v. THOMAS
Syllabus
an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an
opposing party known to be represented by counsel. Pp. 19–20.
(3) Not only was Maples left without any functioning attorney of
record; the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler as his
representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive notice. He in fact received none within the 42 days allowed for commencing an appeal. Given no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and willing to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from
complying with the State’s procedural rule. Pp. 20–21.
(c) “The cause and prejudice requirement shows due regard for
States’ finality and comity interests while ensuring that ‘fundamental fairness [remains] the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.’ ” Dretke v. Haley, 541 U. S. 386, 393. In the unusual circumstances of this case, agency law principles and fundamental fairness
point to the same conclusion: there was indeed cause to excuse Maples’ procedural default. Through no fault of his own, he lacked the
assistance of any authorized attorney during the 42-day appeal period. And he had no reason to suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to pro se status. Pp. 21–22.
(d) The question of prejudice, which neither the District Court nor
the Eleventh Circuit reached, remains open for decision on remand.
P. 22.
