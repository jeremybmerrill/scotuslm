MAPLES v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

he was trapped when counsel of record abandoned him
without a word of warning.
III
Having found no cause to excuse the failure to file a
timely notice of appeal in state court, the District Court
and the Eleventh Circuit did not reach the question of
prejudice. See supra, at 10â€“11. That issue, therefore,
remains open for decision on remand.
*
*
*
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
