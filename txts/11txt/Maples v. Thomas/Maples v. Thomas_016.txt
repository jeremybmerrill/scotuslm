MAPLES v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

(1977).
Given the single issue on which we granted review, we
will assume, for purposes of this decision, that the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals’ refusal to consider
Maples’ ineffective-assistance claims rested on an independent and adequate state procedural ground: namely,
Maples’ failure to satisfy Alabama’s Rule requiring a
notice of appeal to be filed within 42 days from the trial
court’s final order. Accordingly, we confine our consideration to the question whether Maples has shown cause to
excuse the missed notice of appeal deadline.
Cause for a procedural default exists where “something
external to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be
attributed to him[,] . . . ‘impeded [his] efforts to comply
with the State’s procedural rule.’ ” Coleman, 501 U. S., at
753 (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986);
emphasis in original). Negligence on the part of a prisoner’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as “cause.”
Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753. That is so, we reasoned in
Coleman, because the attorney is the prisoner’s agent, and
under “well-settled principles of agency law,” the principal
bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his
agent. Id., at 753–754. See also Irwin v. Department of
Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (“Under our
system of representative litigation, ‘each party is deemed
bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.’ ” (quoting Link v.
Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962))). Thus, when a
petitioner’s postconviction attorney misses a filing deadline, the petitioner is bound by the oversight and cannot
rely on it to establish cause. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753–
754. We do not disturb that general rule.
A markedly different situation is presented, however, when
an attorney abandons his client without notice, and thereby occasions the default. Having severed the principalagent relationship, an attorney no longer acts, or fails
to act, as the client’s representative. See 1 Restatement
