MAPLES v. THOMAS
SCALIA, J., dissenting

Appellate Procedure (4)(a).” And although Federal Rule
of Appellate Rule 4(a)(6) in turn provides that the time for
filing an appeal can be reopened when a litigant did not

reopen must be filed. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(6)(B).

defendants, ante, at 2–4, a portion of the Court’s opinion
that is so disconnected from the rest of its analysis as to be
otherwise inexplicable.
But if the interest of fairness justifies our excusing

defendant’s procedural default is caused by his attorney.
That is simply not the law—and cannot be, if the states
are to have an orderly system of criminal litigation conducted by counsel. Our precedents allow a State to stand
on its rights and enforce a habeas petitioner’s procedural
default even when counsel is to blame. Because a faithful
application of those precedents leads to the conclusion that
Maples has not demonstrated cause to excuse his proce-
