SCALIA, J., dissenting

ington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), makes the attorney’s error
chargeable to the State, and hence external to the defense.
See Murray, supra, at 488. But when the client has no
right to counsel—as is the case in the postconviction setting, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555
(1987)—the client bears the risk of all attorney errors
made in the course of the representation, regardless of the
egregiousness of the mistake. Coleman, supra, at 754
(“[I]t is not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters,
but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to
counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external
factor”).
B
In light of the principles just set out, the Court is correct
to conclude, ante, at 14, that a habeas petitioner’s procedural default may be excused when it is attributable to
abandonment by his attorney. In such a case, Coleman’s
rationale for attributing the attorney’s acts and omissions
to the client breaks down; for once the attorney has ceased
acting as the client’s agent, “well-settled principles of
agency law,” 501 U. S., at 754, no longer support charging
the client with his lawyer’s mistakes. The attorney’s
mistakes may therefore be understood as an “external
factor,” ibid., and in appropriate circumstances may justify excusing the prisoner’s procedural default.
I likewise agree with the Court’s conclusion, ante, at 15,
that Maples’ two out-of-state attorneys of record, Jaasi
Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, had abandoned Maples
by the time the Alabama trial court entered its order
denying his petition for postconviction relief. As the Court
observes, ante, at 15–16, without informing Maples or
seeking leave from the Alabama trial court to withdraw
from Maples’ case, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left
Sullivan & Cromwell’s employ and accepted new positions
that precluded them from continuing to represent Maples.
