Opinion of the Court

Housz severed their agency relationship with Maples upon
their departure from Sullivan & Cromwell, the State
argues that, nonetheless, Maples was not abandoned.
Other attorneys at the firm, the State asserts, continued
to serve as Maples’ counsel. Regarding this assertion, we
note, first, that the record is cloudy on the role other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys played. In an affidavit submitted to the Alabama trial court in support of Maples’
request that the court reissue its Rule 32 order, see supra,
at 9, partner Marc De Leeuw stated that he had been “involved in [Maples’] case since the summer of 2001.” App.
to Pet. for Cert. 257a. After the trial court initially denied
the State’s motion to dismiss in December 2001, De Leeuw
informed the court, Sullivan & Cromwell “lawyers working
on this case for Mr. Maples prepared for [an anticipated]
evidentiary hearing.” Id., at 258a. Another Sullivan &
Cromwell attorney, Felice Duffy, stated, in an affidavit
submitted to the Alabama trial court in September 2003,
that she “ha[d] worked on [Maples’] case since October 14,
2002.” App. 231. But neither De Leeuw nor Duffy described what their “involve[ment]” or “wor[k] on [Maples’]
case” entailed. And neither attorney named the lawyers,
other than Munanka and Ingen-Housz (both of them still
with Sullivan & Cromwell in December 2001), engaged in
preparation for the expected hearing. Nor did De Leeuw
identify the specific work, if any, other lawyers performed
on Maples’ case between Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s
departures and the firm’s receipt of the telephone call
from Maples’ mother.8

8 The unclear state of the record is perhaps not surprising, given Sullivan & Cromwell’s representation of Maples after the default. As
amici for Maples explain, a significant conflict of interest arose for the
firm once the crucial deadline passed. Brief for Legal Ethics Professors
et al. as Amici Curiae 23–27. Following the default, the firm’s interest
in avoiding damage to its own reputation was at odds with Maples’
strongest argument—i.e., that his attorneys had abandoned him,
