represent him. In disregard of Alabama law, see Ala. Rule
Crim. Proc. 6.2, Comment, neither attorney sought the
trial court’s leave to withdraw, App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a.
Compounding Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s inaction, no
other Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer entered an appearance
on Maples’ behalf, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise notified the court of any change in Maples’ representation. Ibid.
Another nine months passed. During this time period,
no Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys assigned to Maples’
case sought admission to the Alabama bar, entered appearances on Maples’ behalf, or otherwise advised the
Alabama court that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were no
longer Maples’ attorneys. Thus, Munanka and IngenHousz (along with Butler) remained Maples’ listed, and
only, “attorneys of record.” Id., at 223a.
There things stood when, in May 2003, the trial court,
without holding a hearing, entered an order denying
Maples’ Rule 32 petition. App. 146–225.5 The clerk of the
Alabama trial court mailed copies of the order to Maples’
three attorneys of record. He sent Munanka’s and IngenHousz’s copies to Sullivan & Cromwell’s New York address, which the pair had provided upon entering their
appearances.
When those copies arrived at Sullivan & Cromwell,
Munanka and Ingen-Housz had long since departed. The
notices, however, were not forwarded to another Sullivan
& Cromwell attorney. Instead, a mailroom employee sent
the unopened envelopes back to the court. “Returned to
Sender—Attempted, Unknown” was stamped on the envelope addressed to Munanka. App. to Reply to Brief in

of Maples’ attorneys observed, without contradiction, that the
trial court’s order was a “word for word copy of the proposed Order that
the State had submitted [with] its [December 2001] Motion to Dismiss.”
Id., at 300.
