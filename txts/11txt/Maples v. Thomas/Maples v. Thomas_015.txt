Opinion of the Court

claims in state court by failing to file a timely notice of
appeal, id., at 890, and that Coleman rendered Maples’
assertion of “cause” unacceptable, 586 F. 3d, at 891.
Judge Barkett dissented. Id., at 895–898. She concluded that the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals had acted
“arbitrarily” in refusing to grant Maples’ request for an
out-of-time appeal. Id., at 896. In a case involving “indistinguishable facts,” Judge Barkett noted, the Alabama
appellate court had allowed the petitioner to file a late
appeal. Ibid. (citing Marshall v. State, 884 So. 2d 898, 899
(Ala. Crim. App. 2002)). Inconsistent application of the
42-days-to-appeal rule, Judge Barkett said, “render[ed]
the rule an inadequate ground on which to bar federal
review of Maples’s claims.” 586 F. 3d, at 897. The interests of justice, she added, required review of Maples’
claims in view of the exceptional circumstances and high
stakes involved, and the absence of any fault on Maples’
part. Ibid.
We granted certiorari to decide whether the uncommon
facts presented here establish cause adequate to excuse
Maples’ procedural default. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).

A

As a rule, a state prisoner’s habeas claims may not be
entertained by a federal court “when (1) ‘a state court
[has] declined to address [those] claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,’
and (2) ‘the state judgment rests on independent and
adequate state procedural grounds.’ ” Walker v. Martin,
562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7) (quoting Coleman,
501 U. S., at 729–730). The bar to federal review may be
lifted, however, if “the prisoner can demonstrate cause for
the [procedural] default [in state court] and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.” Id.,
at 750; see Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84–85
