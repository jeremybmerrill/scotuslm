MAPLES v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

allowing the two New York attorneys to appear pro hac
vice on behalf of Maples. App. to Pet. for Cert. 255a.
Given his lack of “resources, available time [and] experience,” Butler told the Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers, he
could not “deal with substantive issues in the case.” Ibid.
The Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys accepted Butler’s
conditions. Id., at 257a. This arrangement between outof-state and local attorneys, it appears, was hardly atypical. See Justices Brief 36 (“The fact is that local counsel

With the aid of his pro bono counsel, Maples filed a
petition for postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of
Criminal Procedure 32.4 Among other claims, Maples

alleged, in this regard, that his inexperienced and underfunded attorneys failed to develop and raise an obvious
intoxication defense, did not object to several egregious
instances of prosecutorial misconduct, and woefully underprepared for the penalty phase of his trial. The State
responded by moving for summary dismissal of Maples’
petition. On December 27, 2001, the trial court denied the
State’s motion.
Some seven months later, in the summer of 2002, both
Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan & Cromwell.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 258a. Munanka gained a clerkship
with a federal judge; Ingen-Housz accepted a position with
the European Commission in Belgium. Ibid. Neither
attorney told Maples of their departure from Sullivan &
Cromwell or of their resulting inability to continue to

only minor alterations, in December 2001. See App. 22–24, 28–142.
