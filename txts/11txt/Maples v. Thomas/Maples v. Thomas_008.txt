MAPLES v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

Nearly alone among the States, Alabama does not guarantee representation to indigent capital defendants in
postconviction proceedings. ABA Report 111–112, 158–
160; Justices Brief 33. The State has elected, instead, “to
rely on the efforts of typically well-funded [out-of-state]
volunteers.” Brief in Opposition in Barbour v. Allen, O. T.
2006, No. 06–10605, p. 23. Thus, as of 2006, 86% of the
attorneys representing Alabama’s death row inmates in
state collateral review proceedings “either worked for the
Equal Justice Initiative (headed by NYU Law professor
Bryan Stevenson), out-of-state public interest groups like
the Innocence Project, or an out-of-state mega-firm.” Brief
in Opposition 16, n. 4. On occasion, some prisoners sentenced to death receive no postconviction representation at
all. See ABA Report 112 (“[A]s of April 2006, approximately fifteen of Alabama’s death row inmates in the final rounds of state appeals had no lawyer to represent
them.”).

This system was in place when, in 1997, Alabama
charged Maples with two counts of capital murder; the
victims, Stacy Alan Terry and Barry Dewayne Robinson
II, were Maples’ friends who, on the night of the murders,
had been out on the town with him. Maples pleaded not
guilty, and his case proceeded to trial, where he was represented by two court-appointed Alabama attorneys. Only
one of them had earlier served in a capital case. See Tr.
3081. Neither counsel had previously tried the penalty
phase of a capital case. Compensation for each lawyer was
capped at $1,000 for time spent out-of-court preparing
Maples’ case, and at $40 per hour for in-court services.
See Ala. Code §15–12–21 (1995).
Finding Maples guilty on both counts, the jury recommended that he be sentenced to death. The vote was 10 to
2, the minimum number Alabama requires for a death
