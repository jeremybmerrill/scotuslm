Opinion of the Court

(Third) of Law Governing Lawyers §31, Comment f (1998)
(“Withdrawal, whether proper or improper, terminates
the lawyer’s authority to act for the client.”). His acts or
omissions therefore “cannot fairly be attributed to [the
client].” Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753. See, e.g., Jamison v.
Lockhart, 975 F. 2d 1377, 1380 (CA8 1992) (attorney
conduct may provide cause to excuse a state procedural
default where, as a result of a conflict of interest, the
attorney “ceased to be [petitioner’s] agent”); Porter v.
State, 339 Ark. 15, 16–19, 2 S. W. 3d 73, 74–76 (1999)
(finding “good cause” for petitioner’s failure to file a timely
habeas petition where the petitioner’s attorney terminated
his representation without notifying petitioner and without taking “any formal steps to withdraw as the attorney
of record”).
Our recent decision in Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___
(2010), is instructive. That case involved a missed oneyear deadline, prescribed by 28 U. S. C. §2244(d), for filing
a federal habeas petition. Holland presented two issues:
first, whether the §2244(d) time limitation can be tolled
for equitable reasons, and, second, whether an attorney’s
unprofessional conduct can ever count as an “extraordinary circumstance” justifying equitable tolling. 560 U. S.,
at ___, ___–___ (slip op., at 1, 16–17) (internal quotation
marks omitted). We answered yes to both questions.
On the second issue, the Court recognized that an attorney’s negligence, for example, miscalculating a filing
deadline, does not provide a basis for tolling a statutory
time limit. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19); id., at ___–___
(ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
(slip op., at 5–6); see Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327,
336 (2007). The Holland petitioner, however, urged that
attorney negligence was not the gravamen of his complaint. Rather, he asserted that his lawyer had detached
himself from any trust relationship with his client: “[My
lawyer] has abandoned me,” the petitioner complained to
