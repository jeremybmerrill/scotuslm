MAPLES v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

quent inability to serve as his counsel. Nor did they seek
the Alabama trial court’s leave to withdraw. Neither they
nor anyone else moved for the substitution of counsel able
to handle Maples’ case.
In May 2003, the Alabama trial court denied Maples’
petition. Notices of the court’s order were posted to the
New York attorneys at the address of the law firm with
which they had been associated. Those postings were returned, unopened, to the trial court clerk, who attempted no further mailing. With no attorney of record in fact
acting on Maples’ behalf, the time to appeal ran out.
Thereafter, Maples petitioned for a writ of habeas
corpus in federal court. The District Court and, in turn,
the Eleventh Circuit, rejected his petition, pointing to the
procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples’ failure
timely to appeal the Alabama trial court’s order denying
him postconviction relief. Maples, it is uncontested, was
blameless for the default.
The sole question this Court has taken up for review is
whether, on the extraordinary facts of Maples’ case, there
is “cause” to excuse the default. Maples maintains that
there is, for the lawyers he believed to be vigilantly representing him had abandoned the case without leave of
court, without informing Maples they could no longer
represent him, and without securing any recorded substitution of counsel. We agree. Abandoned by counsel, Maples was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state
postconviction petition, and he lacked a clue of any need to
protect himself pro se. In these circumstances, no just
system would lay the default at Maples’ death-cell door.
Satisfied that the requisite cause has been shown, we
reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.
