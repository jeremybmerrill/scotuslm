Opinion of the Court

appointed to represent indigent capital defendants at trial.
American Bar Association, Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems: The Alabama Death
Penalty Assessment Report 117–120 (June 2006) (hereinafter ABA Report); Brief for Alabama Appellate Court
Justices et al. as Amici Curiae 7–8 (hereinafter Justices
Brief). Appointed counsel need only be a member of the
Alabama bar and have “five years’ prior experience in the
active practice of criminal law.” Ala. Code §13A–5–54
(2006). Experience with capital cases is not required.
Justices Brief 7–8. Nor does the State provide, or require
appointed counsel to gain, any capital-case-specific professional education or training. ABA Report 129–131; Justices Brief 14–16.
Appointed counsel in death penalty cases are also undercompensated. ABA Report 124–129; Justices Brief 12–
14. Until 1999, the State paid appointed capital defense
attorneys just “$40.00 per hour for time expended in court
and $20.00 per hour for time reasonably expended out of
court in the preparation of [the defendant’s] case.” Ala.
Code §15–12–21(d) (1995). Although death penalty litigation is plainly time intensive,1 the State capped at $1,000
fees recoverable by capital defense attorneys for out-ofcourt work. Ibid.2 Even today, court-appointed attorneys
receive only $70 per hour. 2011 Ala. Acts no. 2011–678,
pp. 1072–1073, §6.

1 One

study of federal capital trials from 1990 to 1997 found that defense attorneys spent an average of 1,480 out-of-court hours preparing a defendant’s case. Subcommittee on Federal Death Penalty Cases,
Committee on Defender Services, Judicial Conference of the United
States, Federal Death Penalty Cases: Recommendations Concerning the
Cost and Quality of Defense Representation 14 (May 1998).
2 In 1999, the State removed the cap on fees for out-of-court work in
capital cases. Ala. Code §15–12–21(d) (2010 Cum. Supp.). Perhaps not
coincidentally, 70% of the inmates on Alabama’s death row in 2006,
including Maples, had been convicted when the $1,000 cap was in
effect. ABA Report 126.
