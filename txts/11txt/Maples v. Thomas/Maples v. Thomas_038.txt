SCALIA, J., dissenting

Maples had been abandoned, but whether Maples really
was abandoned. And as it turns out, Butler’s conduct
after learning about the default further belies any such
contention. Almost immediately, Butler began to cooperate with Maples’ lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, filing
papers as “Counsel for Mr. Maples” or “Local Counsel for
Petitioner Cory Maples” in multiple courts in an attempt
to rectify the mistake. See App. 229, 230, 236, 238. Had
Butler reassumed his representational duties after having
abandoned them? Hardly. There is no proper basis for a
conclusion of abandonment interruptus.

Maples argues in the alternative that his default should
be excused because his right to due process was violated
when the trial-court clerk failed to take action after Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s copies of the court’s dismissal
order were returned undeliverable. According to Maples,
our decision in Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S. 220 (2006),
establishes that the clerk had a duty to do more.
We held in Jones that, when a mailed notice of a tax
sale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional
reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property. See id., at 234. It
is questionable whether that holding has any relevance to
the circumstances here, which involved not the institution
of proceedings against an unwitting litigant, but rather
the issuance of an order in a pending case that was instituted by Maples himself. Indeed, I think it doubtful
whether due process entitles a litigant to any notice of a
court’s order in a pending case. The Federal Rules certainly reject the notion that notice is an absolute requirement. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d)(2) provides
that “[l]ack of notice of the entry [of an order or judgment]
does not affect the time for appeal or relieve—or authorize
the court to relieve—a party for failing to appeal within
