grown in the years following Smith’s 1997 trial. Doubt
has increased in the medical community “over whether
infants can be fatally injured through shaking alone.”

become apparent that “there was inadequate scientific
evidence to come to a firm conclusion on most aspects
of causation, diagnosis, treatment, or any other matters
pertaining to SBS,” and that “the commonly held opinion
that the finding of [subdural hemorrhage] and [retinal
hemorrhage] in an infant was strong evidence of SBS was
unsustainable.”); Bandak, Shaken Baby Syndrome: A

levels commonly reported for SBS generate forces that are
far too great for the infant neck to withstand without
injury. . . . [A]n SBS diagnosis in an infant . . . without
cervical spine or brain stem injury is questionable and
other causes of the intracerebral injury must be consid­
ered.”); Minns, Shaken Baby Syndrome: Theoretical and
Evidential Controversies, 35 J. Royal College of Physicians

mechanism of injury . . . is not possible, because these are

variety of mechanisms solely or in combination.”); Uscin­
