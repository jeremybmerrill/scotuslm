CAVAZOS v. SMITH
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

sleeping the night he died. In addition, [Smith’s]
daughter [Tomeka], Etzel’s mother, was in the room
next door when Etzel died. The medical evidence was
not typical either, in that some of the telltale signs
usually found in shaken baby cases did not exist in
this case.” Smith v. Mitchell, Case No. CV 01–4484–
ABC (CD Cal., Mar. 22, 2004), p. 10, App. I to Pet. for

Beyond question, the Court today reviews a case as
tragic as it is extraordinary and fact intensive. By taking
