GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Court’s functions.” E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro,
T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice
§5.12(c)(3), p. 351 (9th ed. 2007). As this Court’s Rule 10
informs, “[a] petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely
granted when the asserted error [is] . . . the misapplication
of a properly stated rule of law.” The Ninth Circuit cor­
rectly described the relevant legal rules under AEDPA and
Jackson v. Virginia. This Court, therefore, has no law­
clarifying role to play. Its summary adjudication seems to
me all the more untoward for these reasons: What is now
known about shaken baby syndrome (SBS) casts grave
doubt on the charge leveled against Smith; and uncontra­
dicted evidence shows that she poses no danger whatever
to her family or anyone else in society.
I turn first to the medical evidence presented at trial.
Dr. Carpenter, the autopsy supervisor, testified that the
following symptoms are consistent with, but not required
for, a diagnosis of SBS: cerebral edema, subdural hemor­
rhage, retinal hemorrhage, bleeding at the joints of the
back of the neck, bruises on the arms, fractures of the ribs,
and internal injuries to the buttocks, abdominal organs,
and chest organs. Tr. 575. Few of these signs of SBS were
present here. Etzel’s subdural hemorrhage and subarach­
noid hemorrhage were “minimal,” insufficient to cause
death. Id., at 540–541, 557–558, 675, 693, 700, 729, 1484–
1485. There was no brain swelling and no retinal hemor­
rhage in either eye. Id., at 580, 693, 802, 1274.1 Similarly
absent were any fractures, sprains, bleeding in the joints,
or displacement of joints. Id., at 682. A “tiny” abrasion on
the skin and a corresponding bruise under the scalp did
not produce brain trauma. Id., at 555, 562, 576, 712–713.
These findings led Dr. Carpenter, the autopsy supervi­

1 The State’s third expert, Dr. Chadwick, who was not present at
Etzel’s autopsy, testified that there may have been some swelling. But
he conceded that any swelling could not have caused death. Tr. 1478.
