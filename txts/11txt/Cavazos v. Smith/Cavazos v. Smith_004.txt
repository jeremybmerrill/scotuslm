CAVAZOS v. SMITH
Per Curiam

(absent in Etzel’s case) is present in 75 to 80 percent of
SBS cases.
The third prosecution expert, Dr. David Chadwick, is
board certified in pediatrics and the author of articles on
childhood death by abusive trauma. He testified that
Etzel’s injuries were consistent with SBS and that old
trauma could not have been the cause of the child’s death.
The defense called two experts to dispute these conclusions. The first, pathologist Dr. Richard Siegler, testified
that Etzel died from brain trauma, but that it was not the
result of SBS, given the lack of retinal hemorrhaging. He
admitted on cross-examination, however, that an absence
of retinal hemorrhaging does not exclude a finding of SBS.
He also acknowledged that he did not believe the cause
of Etzel’s death was SIDS. According to Dr. Siegler,
Etzel died from old trauma, an opinion he reached on the
basis of studying photographs of the neuropathological
examination.
The other defense expert, pediatric neurologist Dr.
William Goldie, testified that Etzel’s death was due to
SIDS. He noted that Etzel was born with jaundice, a
heart murmur, and low birth weight—making him more
susceptible to SIDS. Dr. Goldie testified that pathologists
had not been able to determine the cause of Etzel’s death
and that the bleeding could be attributed to the resuscitation efforts.
The jury found Smith guilty. Concluding that the jury
“carefully weighed” the “tremendous amount of evidence”
supporting the verdict, Tr. 1649, the trial judge denied
Smith’s motion for a new trial and sentenced her to an
indeterminate term of 15 years to life in prison.
On direct review, Smith contended that the evidence
was not sufficient to establish that Etzel died from SBS.
After thoroughly reviewing the competing medical testimony, the California Court of Appeal rejected this claim,
concluding:
