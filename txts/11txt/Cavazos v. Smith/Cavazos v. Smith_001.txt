SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
JAVIER CAVAZOS, ACTING WARDEN v. SHIRLEY 

REE SMITH 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–1115. Decided October 31, 2011


PER CURIAM. 

The opinion of the Court in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 

U. S. 307 (1979), makes clear that it is the responsibility of
the jury—not the court—to decide what conclusions should
be drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing
court may set aside the jury’s verdict on the ground of
insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could
have agreed with the jury. What is more, a federal court
may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the federal court disagrees with the state court. The federal
court instead may do so only if the state court decision
was “objectively unreasonable.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S.
___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
Because rational people can sometimes disagree, the
inevitable consequence of this settled law is that judges
will sometimes encounter convictions that they believe to
be mistaken, but that they must nonetheless uphold. The
Court of Appeals in this case substituted its judgment for
that of a California jury on the question whether the
prosecution’s or the defense’s expert witnesses more persuasively explained the cause of a death. For this reason,
certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed.
