CAVAZOS v. SMITH
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

sor, and Dr. Erlich, who performed Etzel’s autopsy, to rule
out two commonly proffered causes of death in SBS cases:
massive bleeding and massive swelling that create pres­
sure and push the brain downward. Id., at 541, 551–552,
729–730, 801. Instead, they opined, Etzel’s death was
caused by direct injury—shearing or tearing of the brain­
stem or the brain itself. Id., at 694–696, 729–730, 801,
1298. The autopsy revealed no physical evidence of such
injury, either grossly or microscopically. Id., at 730, 763,
803–804, 1298–1299. Dr. Carpenter was unable to state
which particular areas of the brain were injured, and the
neuropathologist found no evidence of specific brain inju­
ry. Id., at 696, 1475. No doctor located any tear. Indeed,
the examining physicians did not cut open Etzel’s brain­
stem, or submit it to neuropathology, because, in their own
estimation, “[w]e wouldn’t have seen anything anyway.”
Id., at 803, 1299.2
Neither doctor testified to ever having performed an
autopsy on an infant in which a similar conclusion was
reached. Nor did either physician point to any medical
literature supporting their belief that shearing or tearing
of the brainstem or the brain itself caused Etzel’s death.
Id., at 694–696, 801–802. Dr. Carpenter nevertheless
maintained that when there is subdural hemorrhage
without signs of external trauma to the head or skull, the
injury is necessarily caused by violent shaking. Id., at
576–577, 660–661. Smith’s conviction thus turned on, as
Dr. Erlich put it, “direct trauma which we don’t see to the
brainstem.” Id., at 801. That this gave the Ninth Circuit
pause is understandable. Dr. Erlich herself conceded that
“[i]t is a difficult concept to absorb.” Id., at 1298.
Reason to suspect the Carpenter-Erlich thesis has
——————
2 Dr. Chadwick mentioned new methods, not then standard in medi­
cal examiners’ offices and not used here, which may reveal this type of
brainstem damage. Id., at 1448, 1481–1482.
