Per Curiam

“The expert opinion evidence we have summarized
was conflicting. It was for the jury to resolve the conflicts. The credited evidence was substantial and sufficient to support the jury’s conclusions that Etzel died
from shaken baby syndrome. The conviction is supported by substantial evidence.” People v. Smith, No.
B118869 (Feb. 10, 2000), App. K to Pet. for Cert. 86.
The California Supreme Court denied review. App. J, id.,
at 74.
Smith then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus
with the United States District Court for the Central
District of California, renewing her claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Etzel died of SBS.
Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, that court had no power
to afford relief unless Smith could show either that the
California Court of Appeal’s decision affirming the conviction “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,” clearly established federal law as reflected in
the holdings of this Court’s cases, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1),
or that it “was based on an unreasonable determination of
the facts” in light of the state court record, §2254(d)(2).
Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,
at 10).
The Magistrate Judge to whom the case was assigned
issued a report acknowledging that “[t]his is not the typical shaken baby case” and that the evidence against Smith
“raises many questions.” App. I to Pet. for Cert. 65. But
the Magistrate Judge nevertheless concluded that the
evidence was “clearly sufficient to support a conviction.”
Ibid. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s
report and denied the petition. App. G, id., at 52.
On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed with instructions
to grant the writ. Smith v. Mitchell, 437 F. 3d 884 (2006).
Despite the plentitude of expert testimony in the trial
