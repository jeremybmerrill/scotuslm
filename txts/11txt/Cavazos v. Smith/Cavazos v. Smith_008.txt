CAVAZOS v. SMITH
Per Curiam

and its decision is supported by the record.*
It is said that Smith, who already has served years in
prison, has been punished enough, and that she poses no
danger to society. These or other considerations perhaps
would be grounds to seek clemency, a prerogative granted
to executive authorities to help ensure that justice is
tempered by mercy. It is not clear to the Court whether
this process has been invoked, or, if so, what its course has
been. It is not for the Judicial Branch to determine the
standards for this discretion. If the clemency power is
exercised in either too generous or too stingy a way, that
calls for political correctives, not judicial intervention.
The decision below cannot be allowed to stand. This
Court vacated and remanded this judgment twice before,
calling the panel’s attention to this Court’s opinions highlighting the necessity of deference to state courts in
§2254(d) habeas cases. Each time the panel persisted in
its course, reinstating its judgment without seriously
confronting the significance of the cases called to its attention. See Patrick v. Smith, 550 U. S. 915 (vacating and
remanding in light of Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70
(2006)), reinstated on remand, 508 F. 3d 1256 (2007)
(per curiam); 558 U. S. ___ (2010) (vacating and remanding in light of McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U. S. ___ (2010) (per
curiam)), reinstated on remand sub nom. Smith v. Mitchell, 624 F. 3d 1235 (2010) (per curiam). Its refusal to do so
necessitates this Court’s action today.
The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s
——————
* The dissent’s review of the evidence presented to the jury over seven
days is precisely the sort of reweighing of facts that is precluded by
Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324 (1979), and precisely the sort of
second-guessing of a state court decision applying Jackson that is
precluded by AEDPA, §2254(d). The dissent’s views on how “adamantly” experts would testify today as opposed to at the time of trial, post, at
6 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.), are of course pure speculation, as would be
any views on how a jury would react to less adamant testimony.
