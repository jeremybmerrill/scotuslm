experts, whom the jury was entitled to believe, opined that
the physical evidence was consistent with, and best explained by, death from sudden tearing of the brainstem
caused by shaking. The Ninth Circuit’s assertion that
these experts “reached [their] conclusion because there
was no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death” is
simply false. There was “evidence in the brain itself.” The
autopsy revealed indications of recent trauma to Etzel’s
brain, such as subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhaging,
hemorrhaging around the optic nerves, and the presence
of a blood clot between the brain’s hemispheres. The
autopsy also revealed a bruise and abrasion on the lower
back of Etzel’s head. These affirmative indications of
trauma formed the basis of the experts’ opinion that Etzel
died from shaking so severe that his brainstem tore.
Defense counsel made certain that the jury understood
that the prosecution’s experts were unable to identify the
precise point of tearing itself. But as Judge Bea noted in
his dissent from the Ninth Circuit’s denial of rehearing en
banc, the experts explained why the location of the tear
was undetectable: “Etzel’s death happened so quickly that
the effects of the trauma did not have time to develop.”
Smith v. Mitchell, 453 F. 3d 1203, 1207 (2006). According
to the prosecutions’ experts, there was simply no opportunity for swelling to occur around the brainstem before
Etzel died.
In light of the evidence presented at trial, the Ninth
Circuit plainly erred in concluding that the jury’s verdict was irrational, let alone that it was unreasonable for
the California Court of Appeal to think otherwise. See
§2254(d). Doubts about whether Smith is in fact guilty are
understandable. But it is not the job of this Court, and
was not that of the Ninth Circuit, to decide whether the
State’s theory was correct. The jury decided that question,
