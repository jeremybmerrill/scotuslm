GINSBURG, J., dissenting

and argument afford. See, e.g., R. Fallon, J. Manning, D.
Meltzer, D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler’s The Federal
Courts and the Federal System 1480 (6th ed. 2009) (posing
question whether summary reversal would “smack of
unfairness to the losing party unless an opportunity were
afforded for the filing of briefs on the merits”); Gressman,
Supreme Court Practice §6.12(c), p. 417, and n. 46 (ques­
tioning the Court’s reliance on its own examination of the
record in summarily reversing, without at least affording
the parties, “particularly the respondent,” an opportunity
to brief the critical issue and identify the relevant portions
of the record). Peremptory disposition, in my judgment, is
all the more inappropriate given the grave consequences of
upsetting the judgment below: Smith, who has already
served ten years, will be returned to prison to complete a
sentence of fifteen years to life. Before depriving Smith of
the liberty she currently enjoys, and her family of her
care, I would at least afford her a full opportunity to de­
fend her release from a decade’s incarceration.

For the reasons stated, justice is not served by the
Court’s exercise of discretion to take up this tragic, fact­
bound case. I would therefore deny the petition for review.
