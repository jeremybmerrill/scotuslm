GINSBURG, J., dissenting

intent on the night in question. Instead, the evidence
indicated that Smith was warm hearted, sensitive, and
gentle. Tr. 1086. As earlier observed, see supra, at 1, the
Magistrate Judge noted the absence of any motive or
precipitating event that might have led Smith to shake
Etzel violently. Although shaking may quiet a crying
child, Tr. 601, no evidence showed that Etzel was crying in
the hours before he died, id., at 444. To the contrary: Any
loud crying likely would have woken Etzel’s siblings,
Yondale, age 14 months, and Yolanda, age 4, asleep only
feet away, even Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, asleep in the
neighboring room. Id., at 335, 358–361. Yet no one’s
slumber was disturbed. Id., at 358–361.
The prosecution relied on the testimony of a social
worker, who asserted that Smith, after hearing that the
cause of Etzel’s death had been changed from Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) to shaken baby syndrome,
id., at 840, and after stating that she had given Etzel “a
little shake, a jostle to awaken him” when she found him
unresponsive, asked “something like ‘Oh, my God. Did I
do it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.’ ” Id., at 842, 847.3 Etzel’s
mother, Tomeka, contradicted this account. According to
Tomeka, after the social worker accused Smith of killing
Etzel, Smith started crying, id., at 429–430, and respond­
ed, “No, I didn’t,” id., at 387. Taking the social worker’s
version of events as true, Smith’s distraught and equivocal
question fairly cannot be equated to a confession of guilt.
Giving a baby “a little shake, a jostle to wake him,” ante,
at 2 (internal quotation marks omitted), after finding him
unexpectedly unresponsive, surely is not an admission to
shaking a child violently, causing his brainstem to tear.

3 The social worker also testified that Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, told
Smith: “If it wasn’t for you this wouldn’t have happened.” Id., at 847.
Tomeka denied making any statement to that effect. Id., at 389.
