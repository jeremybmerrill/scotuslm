CAVAZOS v. SMITH
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

1969–2001, 26 Am. J. Forensic Med. & Pathology 199, 211
(2005) (“[M]ost of the pathologies in allegedly shaken
babies are due to impact injuries to the head and body.”);
Squier, Shaken Baby Syndrome: The Quest for Evidence,
50 Developmental Med. & Child Neurology 10, 13 (2008)
(“[H]ead impacts onto carpeted floors and steps from
heights in the 1 to 3 feet range result in far greater . . .
forces and accelerations than shaking and slamming onto
either a sofa or a bed.”).
In light of current information, it is unlikely that the
prosecution’s experts would today testify as adamantly as
they did in 1997. Noteworthy in this regard, prosecution
witnesses Carpenter and Erlich testified that the belated
diagnosis of old (i.e., chronic) blood in Etzel’s brain and
around his optic nerves did not change their initial cause­
of-death findings, because rebleeding of old subdural blood
does not occur in infants. Tr. 608–609, 672–673, 721–722,
771, 776, 1269–1270, 1283. Recent scientific opinion
undermines this testimony. See Miller & Miller, Over­
representation of Males in Traumatic Brain Injury of
Infancy and in Infants with Macrocephaly, 31 Am. J.
Forensic Med. & Pathology 165, 170 (2010) (“Small,
asymptomatic [subdural hematomas] from the normal
trauma of the birth process can spontaneously rebleed or
rebleed with minimal forces, enlarge, and then present
with clinical symptoms and [subdural hematoma, retinal
hemorrhages, and neurologic dysfunction] in the first year
of life. . . . [This situation] mimic[s] child abuse, and we
believe many such infants in the past have been mistaken­
ly diagnosed as victims of child abuse, when they were
likely not.”). What is now known about SBS hypotheses
seems to me worthy of considerable weight in the discre­
tionary decision whether to take up this tragic case.
I consider next the State’s meager nonmedical evidence.
There was no evidence whatever that Smith abused her
grandchildren in the past or acted with any malicious
