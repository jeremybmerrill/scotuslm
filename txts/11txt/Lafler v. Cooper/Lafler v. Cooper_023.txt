SCALIA, J., dissenting

surd for violation of a constitutional right. I respectfully
dissent.

This case and its companion, Missouri v. Frye, ante,
p. ___, raise relatively straightforward questions about the
scope of the right to effective assistance of counsel. Our
case law originally derived that right from the Due Pro­
cess Clause, and its guarantee of a fair trial, see United
States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 147 (2006), but
the seminal case of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.
668 (1984), located the right within the Sixth Amendment.
As the Court notes, ante, at 6, the right to counsel does not
begin at trial. It extends to “any stage of the prosecution,
formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel’s ab­
sence might derogate from the accused’s right to a fair
trial.” United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967).
Applying that principle, we held that the “entry of a guilty
plea, whether to a misdemeanor or a felony charge, ranks
as a ‘critical stage’ at which the right to counsel adheres.”
Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 81 (2004); see also Hill v.
Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 58 (1985). And it follows from this
that acceptance of a plea offer is a critical stage. That, and
nothing more, is the point of the Court’s observation in
Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at
16), that “the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical
phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment
right to effective assistance of counsel.” The defendant in
Padilla had accepted the plea bargain and pleaded guilty,
abandoning his right to a fair trial; he was entitled to
advice of competent counsel before he did so. The Court
has never held that the rule articulated in Padilla, Tovar,
and Hill extends to all aspects of plea negotiations, requir­
ing not just advice of competent counsel before the defend­
ant accepts a plea bargain and pleads guilty, but also the
advice of competent counsel before the defendant rejects a
