LAFLER v. COOPER
ALITO, J., dissenting

would represent an abuse of discretion in at least two
circumstances: first, when important new information
about a defendant’s culpability comes to light after the
offer is rejected, and, second, when the rejection of the
plea offer results in a substantial expenditure of scarce
prosecutorial or judicial resources.
The lower court judges who must implement today’s
holding may—and I hope, will—do so in a way that mitigates its potential to produce unjust results. But I would
not depend on these judges to come to the rescue. The
Court’s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to
counsel is unsound, and I therefore respectfully dissent.
