LAFLER v. COOPER
Syllabus
The parties concede the fact of deficient performance. And respond­
ent has shown that but for that performance there is a reasonable
probability he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea.
In addition, as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted
at trial, he received a minimum sentence 3½ times greater than he
would have received under the plea. As a remedy, the District Court
ordered specific performance of the plea agreement, but the correct
remedy is to order the State to reoffer the plea. If respondent accepts
the offer, the state trial court can exercise its discretion in determin­
ing whether to vacate respondent’s convictions and resentence pur­
suant to the plea agreement, to vacate only some of the convictions
and resentence accordingly, or to leave the conviction and sentence
resulting from the trial undisturbed. Pp. 14–16.
