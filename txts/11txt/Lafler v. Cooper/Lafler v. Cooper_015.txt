rights of criminal defendants,” the Court observed, “are
granted to the innocent and the guilty alike. Consequent­
ly, we decline to hold either that the guarantee of effective
assistance of counsel belongs solely to the innocent or that
it attaches only to matters affecting the determination of
actual guilt.” 477 U. S., at 380. The same logic applies
here. The fact that respondent is guilty does not mean
he was not entitled by the Sixth Amendment to effective
assistance or that he suffered no prejudice from his attor­

performance by defense counsel during plea bargaining.
That position ignores the reality that criminal justice
today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system

ninety-four percent of state convictions are the result of
guilty pleas. See Frye, ante, at 7. As explained in Frye,
the right to adequate assistance of counsel cannot be
defined or enforced without taking account of the central
role plea bargaining plays in securing convictions and
determining sentences. Ibid. (“[I]t is insufficient simply
to point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a backstop that
inoculates any errors in the pretrial process”).

now be addressed.
Sixth Amendment remedies should be “tailored to the
injury suffered from the constitutional violation and
should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.”
United States v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 364 (1981).
Thus, a remedy must “neutralize the taint” of a constitu­
