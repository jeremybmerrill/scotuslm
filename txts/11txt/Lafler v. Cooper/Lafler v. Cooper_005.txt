BLAINE LAFLER, PETITIONER v. ANTHONY COOPER
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[March 21, 2012]


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case, as in Missouri v. Frye, ante, p. ___, also
decided today, a criminal defendant seeks a remedy when
inadequate assistance of counsel caused nonacceptance of
a plea offer and further proceedings led to a less favorable
outcome. In Frye, defense counsel did not inform the
defendant of the plea offer; and after the offer lapsed the
defendant still pleaded guilty, but on more severe terms.
Here, the favorable plea offer was reported to the client
but, on advice of counsel, was rejected. In Frye there was
a later guilty plea. Here, after the plea offer had been
rejected, there was a full and fair trial before a jury. After
a guilty verdict, the defendant received a sentence harsher
than that offered in the rejected plea bargain. The instant
case comes to the Court with the concession that counsel’s
advice with respect to the plea offer fell below the stand­
ard of adequate assistance of counsel guaranteed by the
Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States through the
Fourteenth Amendment.
