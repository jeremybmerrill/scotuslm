LAFLER v. COOPER
SCALIA, J., dissenting

was based on a lack of prejudice or rather the court’s
factual determination that there had been no deficient
performance, to provide relief under AEDPA this Court
must conclude that both holdings would have been unrea­
sonable applications of clearly established law. See Premo
v. Moore, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7). The first
is impossible of doing, since this Court has never held that
a defendant in Cooper’s position can establish Strickland
prejudice. The Sixth Circuit thus violated AEDPA in
granting habeas relief, and the Court now does the same.
III
It is impossible to conclude discussion of today’s ex­
traordinary opinion without commenting upon the remedy
it provides for the unconstitutional conviction. It is a
remedy unheard-of in American jurisprudence—and, I
would be willing to bet, in the jurisprudence of any other
country.
The Court requires Michigan to “reoffer the plea agree­
ment” that was rejected because of bad advice from coun­
sel. Ante, at 16. That would indeed be a powerful remedy—
but for the fact that Cooper’s acceptance of that reoffered agreement is not conclusive. Astoundingly, “the
state trial court can then exercise its discretion in deter­
mining whether to vacate the convictions and resentence
respondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to vacate only
some of the convictions and resentence respondent accord­
ingly, or to leave the convictions and sentence from trial
undisturbed.” Ibid. (emphasis added).
Why, one might ask, require a “reoffer” of the plea
agreement, and its acceptance by the defendant? If the
district court finds (as a necessary element, supposedly, of
Strickland prejudice) that Cooper would have accepted the
original offer, and would thereby have avoided trial and
conviction, why not skip the reoffer-and-reacceptance
minuet and simply leave it to the discretion of the state
