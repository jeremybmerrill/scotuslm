LAFLER v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

probability he and the trial court would have accepted the
guilty plea. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571–572. In addition,
as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted at
trial, respondent received a minimum sentence 3½ times
greater than he would have received under the plea. The
standard for ineffective assistance under Strickland has
thus been satisfied.
As a remedy, the District Court ordered specific perfor­
mance of the original plea agreement. The correct remedy
in these circumstances, however, is to order the State to
reoffer the plea agreement. Presuming respondent accepts
the offer, the state trial court can then exercise its discre­
tion in determining whether to vacate the convictions and
resentence respondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to
vacate only some of the convictions and resentence re­
spondent accordingly, or to leave the convictions and
sentence from trial undisturbed. See Mich. Ct. Rule
6.302(C)(3) (2011) (“If there is a plea agreement and its
terms provide for the defendant’s plea to be made in ex­
change for a specific sentence disposition or a prosecutorial sentence recommendation, the court may . . . reject
the agreement”). Today’s decision leaves open to the trial
court how best to exercise that discretion in all the cir­
cumstances of the case.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
