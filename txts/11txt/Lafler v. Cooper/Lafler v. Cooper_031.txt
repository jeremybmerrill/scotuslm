SCALIA, J., dissenting

trial court what the remedy shall be? The answer, of
course, is camouflage. Trial courts, after all, regularly
accept or reject plea agreements, so there seems to be
nothing extraordinary about their accepting or rejecting
the new one mandated by today’s decision. But the ac­
ceptance or rejection of a plea agreement that has no
status whatever under the United States Constitution is
worlds apart from what this is: “discretionary” specifi­
cation of a remedy for an unconstitutional criminal
conviction.
To be sure, the Court asserts that there are “factors”
which bear upon (and presumably limit) exercise of this
discretion—factors that it is not prepared to specify in full,
much less assign some determinative weight. “Principles
elaborated over time in decisions of state and federal
courts, and in statutes and rules” will (in the Court’s rosy
view) sort all that out. Ante, at 13. I find it extraordinary
that “statutes and rules” can specify the remedy for a
criminal defendant’s unconstitutional conviction. Or that
the remedy for an unconstitutional conviction should ever
be subject at all to a trial judge’s discretion. Or, finally,
that the remedy could ever include no remedy at all.
I suspect that the Court’s squeamishness in fashioning a
remedy, and the incoherence of what it comes up with, is
attributable to its realization, deep down, that there is no
real constitutional violation here anyway. The defendant
has been fairly tried, lawfully convicted, and properly
sentenced, and any “remedy” provided for this will do
nothing but undo the just results of a fair adversarial
process.

In many—perhaps most—countries of the world, American­
style plea bargaining is forbidden in cases as serious
as this one, even for the purpose of obtaining testimony
that enables conviction of a greater malefactor, much less
