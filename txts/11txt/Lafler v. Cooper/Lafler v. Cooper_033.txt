SCALIA, J., dissenting

constitutional and statutory limitations upon the evidence
that the prosecution can bring forward, and (in Michigan
as in most States3) the requirement of a unanimous guilty
verdict by impartial jurors; the Court says that his convic­
tion is invalid because he was deprived of his constitutional entitlement to plea-bargain.
I am less saddened by the outcome of this case than I
am by what it says about this Court’s attitude toward
criminal justice. The Court today embraces the sporting­
chance theory of criminal law, in which the State functions
like a conscientious casino-operator, giving each player a
fair chance to beat the house, that is, to serve less time
than the law says he deserves. And when a player is
excluded from the tables, his constitutional rights have
been violated. I do not subscribe to that theory. No one
should, least of all the Justices of the Supreme Court.

Today’s decision upends decades of our cases, violates a
federal statute, and opens a whole new boutique of consti­
tutional jurisprudence (“plea-bargaining law”) without
even specifying the remedies the boutique offers. The
result in the present case is the undoing of an adjudicatory
process that worked exactly as it is supposed to. Released
felon Anthony Cooper, who shot repeatedly and gravely
injured a woman named Kali Mundy, was tried and con­
victed for his crimes by a jury of his peers, and given a
punishment that Michigan’s elected representatives have
deemed appropriate. Nothing about that result is unfair
or unconstitutional. To the contrary, it is wonderfully
just, and infinitely superior to the trial-by-bargain that
today’s opinion affords constitutional status. I respectfully
dissent.
