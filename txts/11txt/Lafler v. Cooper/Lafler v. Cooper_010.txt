LAFLER v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

the Solicitor General offer for their approach are unper­
suasive.
First, petitioner and the Solicitor General claim that
the sole purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the
right to a fair trial. Errors before trial, they argue, are not
cognizable under the Sixth Amendment unless they affect
the fairness of the trial itself. See Brief for Petitioner 12–
21; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10–12. The
Sixth Amendment, however, is not so narrow in its reach.
Cf. Frye, ante, at 11 (holding that a defendant can show
prejudice under Strickland even absent a showing that the
deficient performance precluded him from going to trial).
The Sixth Amendment requires effective assistance of
counsel at critical stages of a criminal proceeding. Its
protections are not designed simply to protect the trial,
even though “counsel’s absence [in these stages] may
derogate from the accused’s right to a fair trial.” United
States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967). The constitu­
tional guarantee applies to pretrial critical stages that are
part of the whole course of a criminal proceeding, a pro­
ceeding in which defendants cannot be presumed to make
critical decisions without counsel’s advice. This is con­
sistent, too, with the rule that defendants have a right to
effective assistance of counsel on appeal, even though that
cannot in any way be characterized as part of the trial.
See, e.g., Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605 (2005); Evitts
v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387 (1985). The precedents also estab­
lish that there exists a right to counsel during sentencing
in both noncapital, see Glover v. United States, 531 U. S.
198, 203–204 (2001); Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U. S. 128
(1967), and capital cases, see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S.
510, 538 (2003). Even though sentencing does not concern
the defendant’s guilt or innocence, ineffective assistance of
counsel during a sentencing hearing can result in Strickland prejudice because “any amount of [additional] jail
time has Sixth Amendment significance.” Glover, supra,
