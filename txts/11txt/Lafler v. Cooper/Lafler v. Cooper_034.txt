JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting.
For the reasons set out in Parts I and II of JUSTICE
SCALIA’s dissent, the Court’s holding in this case misapplies our ineffective-assistance-of-counsel case law and
violates the requirements of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Respondent received a
trial that was free of any identified constitutional error,
and, as a result, there is no basis for concluding that
respondent suffered prejudice and certainly not for granting habeas relief.
The weakness in the Court’s analysis is highlighted by
its opaque discussion of the remedy that is appropriate
when a plea offer is rejected due to defective legal representation. If a defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights are
violated when deficient legal advice about a favorable plea
offer causes the opportunity for that bargain to be lost, the
only logical remedy is to give the defendant the benefit of
the favorable deal. But such a remedy would cause serious injustice in many instances, as I believe the Court
tacitly recognizes. The Court therefore eschews the only
logical remedy and relies on the lower courts to exercise
sound discretion in determining what is to be done.
Time will tell how this works out. The Court, for its
part, finds it unnecessary to define “the boundaries of
proper discretion” in today’s opinion. Ante, at 13. In my
view, requiring the prosecution to renew an old plea offer
