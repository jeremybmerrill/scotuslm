Opinion of the Court

appeal. People v. Cooper, 474 Mich. 905, 705 N. W. 2d 118
(2005) (table).
Respondent then filed a petition for federal habeas relief
under 28 U. S. C. §2254, renewing his ineffective­
assistance-of-counsel claim. After finding, as required by
the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA), that the Michigan Court of Appeals had unreasonably applied the constitutional standards for effective
assistance of counsel laid out in Strickland v. Washington,
466 U. S. 668 (1984), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52
(1985), the District Court granted a conditional writ.
Cooper v. Lafler, No. 06–11068, 2009 WL 817712, *10 (ED
Mich., Mar. 26, 2009), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a–42a. To
remedy the violation, the District Court ordered “specific
performance of [respondent’s] original plea agreement, for
a minimum sentence in the range of fifty-one to eighty-five
months.” Id., at *9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
affirmed, 376 Fed. Appx. 563 (2010), finding “[e]ven full
deference under AEDPA cannot salvage the state court’s
decision,” id., at 569. Applying Strickland, the Court of
Appeals found that respondent’s attorney had provided
deficient performance by informing respondent of “an
incorrect legal rule,” 376 Fed. Appx., at 570–571, and that
respondent suffered prejudice because he “lost out on an
opportunity to plead guilty and receive the lower sentence
that was offered to him.” Id., at 573. This Court granted
certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).
