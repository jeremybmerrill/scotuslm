LAFLER v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

a “flood did not follow in that decision’s wake”). In addi­
tion, the “prosecution and the trial courts may adopt some
measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabri­
cated claims after a later, less advantageous plea offer
has been accepted or after a trial leading to conviction.”
Frye, ante, at 10. See also ibid. (listing procedures cur­
rently used by various States). This, too, will help ensure
against meritless claims.

The standards for ineffective assistance of counsel when
a defendant rejects a plea offer and goes to trial must now
be applied to this case. Respondent brings a federal col­
lateral challenge to a state-court conviction.
Under
AEDPA, a federal court may not grant a petition for a writ

U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). A decision is contrary to clearly
established law if the state court “applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court]
cases.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405 (2000)
(opinion for the Court by O’Connor, J.). The Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit could not determine whether
the Michigan Court of Appeals addressed respondent’s
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim or, if it did, “what
the court decided, or even whether the correct legal rule
was identified.” 376 Fed. Appx., at 568–569.
The state court’s decision may not be quite so opaque as
the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit thought, yet the
federal court was correct to note that AEDPA does not
present a bar to granting respondent relief. That is be­
cause the Michigan Court of Appeals identified respond­
ent’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim but failed to
apply Strickland to assess it. Rather than applying
