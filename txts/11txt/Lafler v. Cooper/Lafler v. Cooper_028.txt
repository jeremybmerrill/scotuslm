LAFLER v. COOPER 

SCALIA, J., dissenting 


II

Novelty alone is the second, independent reason why the
Court’s decision is wrong. This case arises on federal
habeas, and hence is governed by the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Since, as
the Court acknowledges, the Michigan Court of Appeals

of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Yet the
Court concludes that §2254(d)(1) does not bar relief here,

a Ginther hearing that defense counsel provided effec­

ing process. He contends that defense counsel failed
to convey the benefits of the plea offer to him and ig­
