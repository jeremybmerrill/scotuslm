errors, [the defendant] would not have pleaded guilty and
would have insisted on going to trial.” Ibid.
In contrast to Hill, here the ineffective advice led not to
an offer’s acceptance but to its rejection. Having to stand
trial, not choosing to waive it, is the prejudice alleged. In
these circumstances a defendant must show that but for
the ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented
to the court (i.e., that the defendant would have accepted
the plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it
in light of intervening circumstances), that the court
would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or
sentence, or both, under the offer’s terms would have been
less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in
fact were imposed. Here, the Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit agreed with that test for Strickland preju­
dice in the context of a rejected plea bargain. This is
consistent with the test adopted and applied by other
appellate courts without demonstrated difficulties or
systemic disruptions. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571–573; see
also, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F. 2d
747, 753, n. 1 (CA1 1991) (per curiam); United States v.
Gordon, 156 F. 3d 376, 380–381 (CA2 1998) (per curiam);

Petitioner and the Solicitor General propose a different,
far more narrow, view of the Sixth Amendment. They
contend there can be no finding of Strickland prejudice
arising from plea bargaining if the defendant is later
convicted at a fair trial. The three reasons petitioner and
