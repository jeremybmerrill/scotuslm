PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

out of a photo array, id., at 235a; and (7) Perry’s position
next to a uniformed, gun-bearing police officer at the
moment Blandon made her identification, id., at 202a–
205a. Perry’s counsel reminded the jury of these frailties
during her summation.
Id., at 374a–375a (Blandon
“wasn’t able to tell you much about who she saw . . . . She
couldn’t pick [Perry] out of a lineup, out of a photo array
. . . . [Blandon said] [t]hat guy that was with the police
officer, that’s who was circling. Again, think about the
context with the guns, the uniforms. Powerful, powerful
context clues.”).
After closing arguments, the trial court read the jury a
lengthy instruction on identification testimony and the
factors the jury should consider when evaluating it. Id.,
at 399a–401a. The court also instructed the jury that
the defendant’s guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt, id., at 390a, 392a, 395a–396a, and specifically
cautioned that “one of the things the State must prove
[beyond a reasonable doubt] is the identification of the
defendant as the person who committed the offense,” id.,
at 398a–399a.
Given the safeguards generally applicable in criminal
trials, protections availed of by the defense in Perry’s case,
we hold that the introduction of Blandon’s eyewitness
testimony, without a preliminary judicial assessment of its
reliability, did not render Perry’s trial fundamentally
unfair.

For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the New
Hampshire courts’ appraisal of our decisions. See supra,
at 4–5. Finding no convincing reason to alter our precedent, we hold that the Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial inquiry into the reliability of
an eyewitness identification when the identification was
not procured under unnecessarily suggestive circum-
