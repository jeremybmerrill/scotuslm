reliable under the totality of the circumstances. That step
entails considering the witness’ opportunity to view the
perpetrator, degree of attention, accuracy of description,
level of certainty, and the time between the crime and
pretrial confrontation, then weighing such factors against
the “corrupting effect of the suggestive identification.”
Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 108, 114. Most identifications
will be admissible. The standard of “fairness as required
by the Due Process Clause,” id., at 113, however, demands
that a subset of the most unreliable identifications—those
carrying a “ ‘very substantial likelihood of . . . misidentification’ ”—will be excluded. Biggers, 409 U. S., at 198.

“rigging,” the majority holds, our two-step inquiry does not
even “com[e] into play.” Ante, at 2, 11. I cannot agree.
The majority does not simply hold that an eyewitness
identification must be the product of police action to trigger our ordinary two-step inquiry. Rather, the majority
maintains that the suggestive circumstances giving rise
to the identification must be “police-arranged,” “police
rigg[ed],” “police-designed,” or “police-organized.” Ante, at
2, 12–13. Those terms connote a degree of intentional
orchestration or manipulation. See Brief for Respondent
19 (no indication that police “deliberately tried to manipulate any evidence”); Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 18 (“[N]o one deliberately arranged the circumstances to obtain an identification”). The majority cate-
