Opinion of the Court

Apart from these guarantees, we have recognized, state
and federal statutes and rules ordinarily govern the admissibility of evidence, and juries are assigned the task of
determining the reliability of the evidence presented at
trial. See Kansas v. Ventris, 556 U. S. 586, 594, n. (2009)
(“Our legal system . . . is built on the premise that it is the
province of the jury to weigh the credibility of competing
witnesses.”). Only when evidence “is so extremely unfair
that its admission violates fundamental conceptions of
justice,” Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352
(1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), have we imposed a constraint tied to the Due Process Clause. See,
e.g., Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, 269 (1959) (Due
process prohibits the State’s “knowin[g] use [of] false
evidence,” because such use violates “any concept of ordered liberty.”).
Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated
here, Perry relies on a series of decisions involving policearranged identification procedures. In Stovall v. Denno,
388 U. S. 293 (1967), first of those decisions, a witness
identified the defendant as her assailant after police officers brought the defendant to the witness’ hospital room.
Id., at 295. At the time the witness made the identification, the defendant—the only African-American in the
room—was handcuffed and surrounded by police officers.
Ibid. Although the police-arranged showup was undeniably suggestive, the Court held that no due process violation occurred. Id., at 302. Crucial to the Court’s decision
was the procedure’s necessity: The witness was the only
person who could identify or exonerate the defendant; the
witness could not leave her hospital room; and it was
uncertain whether she would live to identify the defendant
in more neutral circumstances. Ibid.
A year later, in Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377
(1968), the Court addressed a due process challenge to
police use of a photographic array. When a witness identi-
