PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

police-arranged suggestive circumstances, the identification evidence ordinarily will be admitted, and the jury will
ultimately determine its worth.
We have not extended pretrial screening for reliability
to cases in which the suggestive circumstances were not
arranged by law enforcement officers. Petitioner requests
that we do so because of the grave risk that mistaken
identification will yield a miscarriage of justice.1 Our
decisions, however, turn on the presence of state action
and aim to deter police from rigging identification procedures, for example, at a lineup, showup, or photograph
array. When no improper law enforcement activity is
involved, we hold, it suffices to test reliability through the
rights and opportunities generally designed for that purpose, notably, the presence of counsel at postindictment
lineups, vigorous cross-examination, protective rules of evidence, and jury instructions on both the fallibility of
eyewitness identification and the requirement that guilt
be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

1 The dissent, too, appears to urge that all suggestive circumstances
raise due process concerns warranting a pretrial ruling. See post, at 6,
9, 14–17. Neither Perry nor the dissent, however, points to a single
case in which we have required pretrial screening absent a policearranged identification procedure. Understandably so, for there are no
such cases. Instead, the dissent surveys our decisions, heedless of the
police arrangement that underlies every one of them, and inventing a
“longstanding rule,” post, at 6, that never existed. Nor are we, as the
dissent suggests, imposing a mens rea requirement, post, at 1, 7, or
otherwise altering our precedent in any way. As our case law makes
clear, what triggers due process concerns is police use of an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure, whether or not they intended
the arranged procedure to be suggestive.
