Opinion of the Court

reported that an African-American male was trying to
break into cars parked in the lot of Ullon’s apartment
building. Officer Nicole Clay responded to the call. Upon
arriving at the parking lot, Clay heard what “sounded like
a metal bat hitting the ground.” App. 37a–38a. She then
saw petitioner Barion Perry standing between two cars.
Perry walked toward Clay, holding two car-stereo amplifiers in his hands. A metal bat lay on the ground behind
him. Clay asked Perry where the amplifiers came from.
“[I] found them on the ground,” Perry responded. Id.,
at 39a.
Meanwhile, Ullon’s wife, Nubia Blandon, woke her
neighbor, Alex Clavijo, and told him she had just seen
someone break into his car. Clavijo immediately went
downstairs to the parking lot to inspect the car. He first
observed that one of the rear windows had been shattered.
On further inspection, he discovered that the speakers
and amplifiers from his car stereo were missing, as were
his bat and wrench. Clavijo then approached Clay and
told her about Blandon’s alert and his own subsequent
observations.
By this time, another officer had arrived at the scene.
Clay asked Perry to stay in the parking lot with that
officer, while she and Clavijo went to talk to Blandon.
Clay and Clavijo then entered the apartment building
and took the stairs to the fourth floor, where Blandon’s and
Clavijo’s apartments were located. They met Blandon in
the hallway just outside the open door to her apartment.
Asked to describe what she had seen, Blandon stated
that, around 2:30 a.m., she saw from her kitchen window a
tall, African-American man roaming the parking lot and
looking into cars. Eventually, the man circled Clavijo’s
car, opened the trunk, and removed a large box.2

2 The box, which Clay found on the ground near where she first encountered Perry, contained car-stereo speakers. App. 177a–178a.
