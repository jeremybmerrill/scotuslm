PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

require exclusion of the resulting identification. 432 U. S.,
at 114–117. The witness, an undercover police officer,
viewed the defendant in good light for several minutes,
provided a thorough description of the suspect, and was
certain of his identification. Id., at 115. Hence, the “indicators of [the witness’] ability to make an accurate identification [were] hardly outweighed by the corrupting effect

under suggestive circumstances. We disagree.
Perry’s argument depends, in large part, on the Court’s
statement in Brathwaite that “reliability is the linchpin in
determining the admissibility of identification testimony.”
432 U. S., at 114. If reliability is the linchpin of admissibility under the Due Process Clause, Perry maintains, it
should make no difference whether law enforcement was
responsible for creating the suggestive circumstances that
marred the identification.
Perry has removed our statement in Brathwaite from its
mooring, and thereby attributes to the statement a meaning a fair reading of our opinion does not bear. As just
explained, supra, at 8–9, the Brathwaite Court’s reference
to reliability appears in a portion of the opinion concerning
the appropriate remedy when the police use an unneces-
