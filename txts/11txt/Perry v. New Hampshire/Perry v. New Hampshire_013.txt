Opinion of the Court

sanction,” one “that may frustrate rather than promote
justice”).
Instead of mandating a per se exclusionary rule, the
Court held that the Due Process Clause requires courts to
assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether improper police
conduct created a “substantial likelihood of misidentification.” Biggers, 409 U. S., at 201; see Brathwaite, 432
U. S., at 116. “[R]eliability [of the eyewitness identification] is the linchpin” of that evaluation, the Court stated
in Brathwaite. Id., at 114. Where the “indicators of [a
witness’] ability to make an accurate identification” are
“outweighed by the corrupting effect” of law enforcement
suggestion, the identification should be suppressed. Id., at
114, 116. Otherwise, the evidence (if admissible in all
other respects) should be submitted to the jury.5
Applying this “totality of the circumstances” approach,
id., at 110, the Court held in Biggers that law enforcement’s use of an unnecessarily suggestive showup did not
require suppression of the victim’s identification of her
assailant. 409 U. S., at 199–200. Notwithstanding the
improper procedure, the victim’s identification was reliable: She saw her assailant for a considerable period of time
under adequate light, provided police with a detailed description of her attacker long before the showup, and
had “no doubt” that the defendant was the person she had
seen. Id., at 200 (internal quotation marks omitted).

“factors to be considered” in evaluating a witness’ “ability to
make an accurate identification,” the Court listed: “the opportunity of
the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness’
degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal,
the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time
between the crime and the confrontation.” Manson v. Brathwaite, 432
U. S. 98, 114 (1977) (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 199–200
(1972)).
