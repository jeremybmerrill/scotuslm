PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

fication. The defendants in Coleman contended that a
witness’ in-court identifications violated due process,
because a pretrial stationhouse lineup was “so unduly
prejudicial and conducive to irreparable misidentification
as fatally to taint [the later identifications].” 399 U. S., at
3 (plurality opinion). The Court rejected this argument.
Id., at 5–6 (plurality opinion), 13–14 (Black, J., concurring), 22, n. 2 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), 28, n. 2 (Stewart,
J., dissenting). No due process violation occurred, the
plurality explained, because nothing “the police said or did
prompted [the witness’] virtually spontaneous identification of [the defendants].” Id., at 6. True, Coleman was the
only person in the lineup wearing a hat, the plurality
noted, but “nothing in the record show[ed] that he was
required to do so.” Ibid. See also Colorado v. Connelly,
479 U. S. 157, 163, 167 (1986) (Where the “crucial element
of police overreaching” is missing, the admissibility of an
allegedly unreliable confession is “a matter to be governed
by the evidentiary laws of the forum, . . . and not by the
Due Process Clause.”).
Perry and the dissent place significant weight on United
States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218 (1967), describing it as a
decision not anchored to improper police conduct. See
Brief for Petitioner 12, 15, 21–22, 28; post, at 2–4, 8–10.
In fact, the risk of police rigging was the very danger to
which the Court responded in Wade when it recognized a
defendant’s right to counsel at postindictment, policeorganized identification procedures. 388 U. S., at 233,
235–236. “[T]he confrontation compelled by the State
between the accused and the victim or witnesses,” the
Court began, “is peculiarly riddled with innumerable
dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even
crucially, derogate from a fair trial.” Id., at 228 (emphasis
added). “A major factor contributing to the high incidence
of miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification,” the
Court continued, “has been the degree of suggestion inher-
