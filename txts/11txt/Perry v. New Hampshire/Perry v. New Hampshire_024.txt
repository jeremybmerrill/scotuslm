BARION PERRY, PETITIONER v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

NEW HAMPSHIRE

[January 11, 2012]


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.
The Court correctly concludes that its precedents establish a due process right to the pretrial exclusion of an
unreliable eyewitness identification only if the identification results from police suggestion. I therefore join its
opinion. I write separately because I would not extend
Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293 (1967), and its progeny

The Stovall line of cases is premised on a “substantive due
process” right to “fundamental fairness.” See, e.g., id., at
299 (concluding that whether a suggestive identification
“resulted in such unfairness that it infringed [the defendant’s] right to due process of law” is “open to all persons to

113 (1977) (“The standard, after all, is that of fairness
as required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment”). In my view, those cases are wrongly decided because the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process
Clause is not a “secret repository of substantive guarantees against ‘unfairness.’ ” BMW of North America, Inc. v.
Gore, 517 U. S. 559, 598–599 (1996) (SCALIA, J., joined by
THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also McDonald v. Chicago,
561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7) (“The notion
that a constitutional provision that guarantees only ‘process’ before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property
