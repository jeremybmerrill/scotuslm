PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ante, at 1–2, 10–11, 18–19. Still elsewhere it refers to “improper” police conduct, ante, at 1–2, 9–12, connoting bad
faith. Does police “arrangement” relate to the procedure, the
suggestiveness, or both? If it relates to the procedure, do
suggestive preprocedure encounters no longer raise the
same concerns? If the police need not “inten[d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive,” ante, at 2, n. 1, what
makes the police action “improper”? And does that mean
that good-faith, unintentional police suggestiveness in a
police-arranged lineup can be “impermissibly suggestive”? If no, the majority runs headlong into Wade. If
yes, on what basis—if not deterrence—does it distinguish
unintentional police suggestiveness in an accidental
confrontation?
The arrangement-focused inquiry will sow needless confusion. If the police had called Perry and Blandon to
the police station for interviews, and Blandon saw Perry
being questioned, would that be sufficiently “improper
police arrangement”? If Perry had voluntarily come to the
police station, would that change the result? Today’s
opinion renders the applicability of our ordinary inquiry
contingent on a murky line-drawing exercise. Whereas
our two-step inquiry focuses on overall reliability—and
could account for the spontaneity of the witness’ identification and degree of police manipulation under the totality of the circumstances—today’s opinion forecloses that
assessment by establishing a new and inflexible step zero.

as compelled by precedent. Its chief rationale, ante, at 7–
13, is that none of our prior cases involved situations
where the police “did not arrange the suggestive circumstances.” Ante, at 10; see also ante, at 2, n. 1. That is not
necessarily true, given the seemingly unintentional encounter highlighted in Wade. But even if it were true, it is
