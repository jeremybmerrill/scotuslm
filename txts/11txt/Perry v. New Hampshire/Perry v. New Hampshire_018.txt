PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

ample, or one who harbors a grudge against the defendant, should be regarded as inherently more reliable, less of
a “threat to the fairness of trial,” post, at 14, than the
identification Blandon made in this case. To embrace
Perry’s view would thus entail a vast enlargement of the
reach of due process as a constraint on the admission of
evidence.
Perry maintains that the Court can limit the due process check he proposes to identifications made under
“suggestive circumstances.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–14. Even
if we could rationally distinguish suggestiveness from
other factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perry’s limitation would still involve trial courts,
routinely, in preliminary examinations. Most eyewitness
identifications involve some element of suggestion. Indeed, all in-court identifications do. Out-of-court identifications volunteered by witnesses are also likely to involve
suggestive circumstances. For example, suppose a witness
identifies the defendant to police officers after seeing a
photograph of the defendant in the press captioned “theft
suspect,” or hearing a radio report implicating the defendant in the crime. Or suppose the witness knew that the
defendant ran with the wrong crowd and saw him on the
day and in the vicinity of the crime. Any of these circumstances might have “suggested” to the witness that the
defendant was the person the witness observed committing the crime.

In urging a broadly applicable due process check on
eyewitness identifications, Perry maintains that eyewitness identifications are a uniquely unreliable form of
evidence. See Brief for Petitioner 17–22 (citing studies
showing that eyewitness misidentifications are the leading
cause of wrongful convictions); Brief for American Psychological Association as Amicus Curiae 14–17 (describing
