Opinion of the Court

U. S., at 352–353. The constitutional requirement that
the government prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt also impedes convictions based on dubious identification evidence.
State and federal rules of evidence, moreover, permit
trial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its probative
value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact
or potential for misleading the jury. See, e.g., Fed. Rule
Evid. 403; N. H. Rule Evid. 403 (2011). See also Tr. of
Oral Arg. 19–22 (inquiring whether the standard Perry
seeks differs materially from the one set out in Rule 403).
In appropriate cases, some States also permit defendants
to present expert testimony on the hazards of eyewitness
identification evidence. See, e.g., State v. Clopten, 2009
UT 84, A33, 223 P. 3d 1103, 1113 (“We expect . . . that in
cases involving eyewitness identification of strangers or
near-strangers, trial courts will routinely admit expert
testimony [on the dangers of such evidence].”).
Many of the safeguards just noted were at work at
Perry’s trial. During her opening statement, Perry’s courtappointed attorney cautioned the jury about the vulnerability of Blandon’s identification. App. 115a (Blandon,
“the eyewitness that the State needs you to believe[,] can’t
pick [Perry] out of a photo array. How carefully did she
really see what was going on? . . . How well could she
really see him?”). While cross-examining Blandon and
Officer Clay, Perry’s attorney constantly brought up the
weaknesses of Blandon’s identification. She highlighted:
(1) the significant distance between Blandon’s window and
the parking lot, id., at 226a; (2) the lateness of the hour,
id., at 225a; (3) the van that partly obstructed Blandon’s
view, id., at 226a; (4) Blandon’s concession that she was
“so scared [she] really didn’t pay attention” to what Perry
was wearing, id., at 233a; (5) Blandon’s inability to describe Perry’s facial features or other identifying marks,
id., at 205a, 233a–235a; (6) Blandon’s failure to pick Perry
