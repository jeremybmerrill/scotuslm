SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

that the circumstances surrounding Blandon’s identification did not rise to an impermissibly suggestive level. It is
not at all clear, moreover, that there was a very substantial likelihood of misidentification, given Blandon’s lack of
equivocation on the scene, the short time between crime
and confrontation, and the “fairly well lit” parking lot.
App. 56. The New Hampshire Supreme Court, however,
never made findings on either point and, under the majority’s decision today, never will.

The Court’s opinion today renders the defendant’s due
process protection contingent on whether the suggestive
circumstances giving rise to the eyewitness identification
stem from improper police arrangement. That view lies
in tension with our precedents’ more holistic conception
of the dangers of suggestion and is untethered from the
evidentiary interest the due process right protects. In my
view, the ordinary two-step inquiry should apply, whether
the police created the suggestive circumstances intentionally or inadvertently. Because the New Hampshire Supreme Court truncated its inquiry at the threshold, I
would vacate the judgment and remand for a proper analysis. I respectfully dissent.
