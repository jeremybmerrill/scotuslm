Opinion of the Court

of the crime did not result from an unnecessarily suggestive procedure “manufacture[d] . . . by the police.” App.
86a–87a. Blandon pointed to Perry “spontaneously,” the
court noted, “without any inducement from the police.”
Id., at 85a–86a. Clay did not ask Blandon whether the
man standing in the parking lot was the man Blandon had
seen breaking into Clavijo’s car. Ibid. Nor did Clay ask
Blandon to move to the window from which she had observed the break-in. Id., at 86a.
The Superior Court recognized that there were reasons

parking lot was dark in some locations; Perry was standing next to a police officer; Perry was the only AfricanAmerican man in the vicinity; and Blandon was unable,
later, to pick Perry out of a photographic array. Id., at
86a–87a. But “[b]ecause the police procedures were not
unnecessarily suggestive,” the court ruled that the reliability of Blandon’s testimony was for the jury to consider.
Id., at 87a.
At the ensuing trial, Blandon and Clay testified to
Blandon’s out-of-court identification. The jury found Perry
guilty of theft and not guilty of criminal mischief.
On appeal, Perry repeated his challenge to the admissibility of Blandon’s out-of-court identification. The trial
court erred, Perry contended, in requiring an initial showing that the police arranged the suggestive identification
procedure. Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry argued,
suffice to trigger the court’s duty to evaluate the reliability
of the resulting identification before allowing presentation
of the evidence to the jury.
The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Perry’s
argument and affirmed his conviction. Id., at 9a–11a.
Only where the police employ suggestive identification
techniques, that court held, does the Due Process Clause
require a trial court to assess the reliability of identification evidence before permitting a jury to consider it. Id.,
