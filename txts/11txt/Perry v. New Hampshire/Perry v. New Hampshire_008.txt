PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

Clay asked Blandon for a more specific description of the
man. Blandon pointed to her kitchen window and said the
person she saw breaking into Clavijo’s car was standing in
the parking lot, next to the police officer. Perry’s arrest
followed this identification.
About a month later, the police showed Blandon a photographic array that included a picture of Perry and asked
her to point out the man who had broken into Clavijo’s car.
Blandon was unable to identify Perry.
B
Perry was charged in New Hampshire state court with
one count of theft by unauthorized taking and one count of
criminal mischief.3 Before trial, he moved to suppress
Blandon’s identification on the ground that admitting it at
trial would violate due process. Blandon witnessed what
amounted to a one-person showup in the parking lot,
Perry asserted, which all but guaranteed that she would
identify him as the culprit. Id., at 15a–16a.
The New Hampshire Superior Court denied the motion.
Id., at 82a–88a. To determine whether due process prohibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification at
trial, the Superior Court said, this Court’s decisions instruct a two-step inquiry. First, the trial court must decide whether the police used an unnecessarily suggestive
identification procedure. Id., at 85a. If they did, the court
must next consider whether the improper identification
procedure so tainted the resulting identification as to
render it unreliable and therefore inadmissible. Ibid.
(citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), and Manson v.
Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977)).
Perry’s challenge, the Superior Court concluded, failed
at step one: Blandon’s identification of Perry on the night
——————
3 The theft charge was based on the taking of items from Clavijo’s car,
while the criminal mischief count was founded on the shattering of
Clavijo’s car window.
