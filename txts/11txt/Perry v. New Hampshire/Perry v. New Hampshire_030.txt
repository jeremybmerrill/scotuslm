not in itself intrude upon a constitutionally protected interest.” Id., at 113, n. 13; see also Neil v. Biggers, 409
U. S. 188, 198–199 (1972) (rejecting the proposition that
“unnecessary suggestiveness alone requires the exclusion
of evidence”). “Suggestive confrontations are disapproved
because they increase the likelihood of misidentification”—and “[i]t is the likelihood of misidentification which
violates a defendant’s right to due process.” Id., at 198;
see also United States ex rel. Kirby v. Sturges, 510 F. 2d
397, 406 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.) (“The due process clause
applies only to proceedings which result in a deprivation of
life, liberty or property. . . . [I]f a constitutional violation
results from a showup, it occurs in the courtroom, not in
the police station”). In short, “ ‘what the Stovall due process right protects is an evidentiary interest.’ ” Brathwaite,
432 U. S., at 113, n. 14.
To protect that evidentiary interest, we have applied a
two-step inquiry: First, the defendant has the burden of
showing that the eyewitness identification was derived
through “impermissibly suggestive” means.3 Simmons,
390 U. S., at 384. Second, if the defendant meets that
burden, courts consider whether the identification was

3 Our precedents refer to “impermissibly,” “unnecessarily,” and “unduly” suggestive circumstances interchangeably. See, e.g., Brathwaite,
432 U. S., at 105, n. 8, 107–108, 110, 112–113 (“impermissibly” and
“unnecessarily”); Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 196–199 (1972) (“impermissibly” and “unnecessarily”); Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 3–
5 (1970) (“unduly” and “impermissibly”); Simmons v. United States, 390
U. S. 377, 383–384 (1968) (“unduly” and “impermissibly”). The Circuits
have followed suit. E.g., Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6
1986) (“unduly”); Green v. Loggins, 614 F. 2d 219, 223 (CA9 1980)
(“unnecessarily or impermissibly”). All reinforce our focus not on the
act of suggestion, but on whether the suggestiveness rises to such a
level that it undermines reliability. Police machinations can heighten
the likelihood of misidentification, but they are no prerequisite to
finding a confrontation “so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a
very substantial likelihood of . . . misidentification.” Simmons, 390
U. S., at 384.
