confront . . . witnesses”). So too does the majority’s appeal
to leave reliability to the rules of evidence. Compare ante,
at 17, with Foster, 394 U. S., at 448 (Black, J., dissenting)
(“ ‘Rules of evidence are designed in the interests of fair
trials’ ”), and Stovall, 388 U. S., at 306 (Black, J., dissenting) (“[T]he result . . . is to put into a constitutional mould
a rule of evidence”). Those arguments did not prevail
then; they should not prevail here.
Fourth, the majority suggests that applying our rule
beyond police-arranged suggestive circumstances would
entail a heavy practical burden, requiring courts to engage
in “preliminary judicial inquiry” into “most, if not all,
eyewitness identifications.” Ante, at 13, 18. But that is
inaccurate. The burden of showing “impermissibly suggestive” circumstances is the defendant’s, so the objection
falls to the defendant to raise. And as is implicit in the
majority’s reassurance that Perry may resort to the rules
of evidence in lieu of our due process precedents, trial
courts will be entertaining defendants’ objections, pretrial
or at trial, to unreliable eyewitness evidence in any event.
The relevant question, then, is what the standard of admissibility governing such objections should be. I see no
reason to water down the standard for an equally suggestive and unreliable identification simply because the
suggestive confrontation was unplanned.
It bears reminding, moreover, that we set a high bar for
suppression. The vast majority of eyewitnesses proceed to
testify before a jury. To date, Foster is the only case in
which we have found a due process violation. 394 U. S., at
443. There has been no flood of claims in the four Federal
Circuits that, having seen no basis for an arrangementbased distinction in our precedents, have long indicated
that due process scrutiny applies to all suggestive identification procedures. See Dunnigan v. Keane, 137 F. 3d 117,
128 (CA2 1998); United States v. Bouthot, 878 F. 2d 1506,
1516 (CA1 1989); Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6
