PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

stances do not stem from improper police arrangement.
C
The majority gives several additional reasons for why
applying our due process rule beyond improperly policearranged circumstances is unwarranted. In my view, none
withstands close inspection.
First, the majority insists that our precedents “aim to
deter police from rigging identification procedures,” so our
rule should be limited to applications that advance that
“primary aim” and “key premise.” Ante, at 2, 11 (citing
Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 112). That mischaracterizes our
cases. We discussed deterrence in Brathwaite because
Brathwaite challenged our two-step inquiry as lacking
deterrence value. Brathwaite argued that deterrence demanded a per se rule excluding all suggestive identifications. He said that our rule, which probes the reliability of
suggestive identifications under the totality of the circumstances, “cannot be expected to have a significant deterrent impact.” Id., at 111.
We rebutted Brathwaite’s criticism in language the
majority now wrenches from context: Upon summarizing
Brathwaite’s argument, we acknowledged “several interests to be considered.” Ibid. We then compared the two
rules under each interest: First, we noted the “driving
force” behind Wade and its companion cases—“the concern
that the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless that
evidence has aspects of reliability”—and found both approaches “responsive to this concern,” but the per se rule
to go “too far” in suppressing reliable evidence. 432 U. S.,
at 111–112. We noted a “second factor”—deterrence—
conceding that the per se rule had “more significant deterrent effect,” but noting that our rule “also has an influence
on police behavior.” Id., at 112. Finally, we noted a “third
factor”—“the effect on the administration of justice”—
describing the per se rule as having serious drawbacks on
