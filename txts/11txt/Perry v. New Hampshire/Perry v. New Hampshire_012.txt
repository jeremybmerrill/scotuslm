PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE
Opinion of the Court

fies the defendant in a police-organized photo lineup, the
Court ruled, the identification should be suppressed only
where “the photographic identification procedure was so
[unnecessarily] suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.” Id., at
384–385. Satisfied that the photo array used by Federal
Bureau of Investigation agents in Simmons was both
necessary and unlikely to have led to a mistaken identification, the Court rejected the defendant’s due process
challenge to admission of the identification. Id., at 385–
386. In contrast, the Court held in Foster v. California,
394 U. S. 440 (1969), that due process required the exclusion of an eyewitness identification obtained through
police-arranged procedures that “made it all but inevitable
that [the witness] would identify [the defendant].” Id., at
443.
Synthesizing previous decisions, we set forth in Neil v.
Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), and reiterated in Manson v.
Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977), the approach appropriately used to determine whether the Due Process Clause
requires suppression of an eyewitness identification tainted by police arrangement. The Court emphasized, first,
that due process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is both
suggestive and unnecessary. Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409
U. S., at 198. Even when the police use such a procedure,
the Court next said, suppression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable consequence. Brathwaite, 432
U. S., at 112–113; Biggers, 409 U. S., at 198–199.
A rule requiring automatic exclusion, the Court reasoned, would “g[o] too far,” for it would “kee[p] evidence
from the jury that is reliable and relevant,” and “may
result, on occasion, in the guilty going free.” Brathwaite,
432 U. S., at 112; see id., at 113 (when an “identification is
reliable despite an unnecessarily suggestive [police] identification procedure,” automatic exclusion “is a Draconian
