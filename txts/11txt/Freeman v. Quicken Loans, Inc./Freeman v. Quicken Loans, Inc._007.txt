Opinion of the Court

entirely unearned, a provider may also “be liable under
[§2607(b)] when it charges a fee that exceeds the reasonable value of goods, facilities, or services provided,” ibid., on
the theory that the excess over reasonable value constitutes a “portion” of the charge “other than for services
actually performed,” §2607(b).
The last mentioned point, however, is manifestly inconsistent with the statute HUD purported to construe.
When Congress enacted RESPA in 1974, it included a
directive that HUD make a report to Congress within five
years regarding the need for further legislation in the
area. See §2612(a) (1976 ed.). Among the topics required
to be included in the report were “recommendations on
whether Federal regulation of the charges for real estate
settlement services in federally related mortgage transactions is necessary and desirable,” and, if so, recommendations with regard to what reforms should be adopted.
§2612(b)(2). The directive for recommendations regarding
the desirability of price regulation would make no sense
if Congress had already resolved the issue—if §2607(b)
already carried with it authority for HUD to proscribe the
collection of unreasonably high fees for settlement services, i.e., to engage in price regulation.
No doubt recognizing as much, petitioners do not fully
adopt HUD’s construction of §2607(b). Noting that even
those Courts of Appeals which have found §2607(b) not to
be limited to fee-splitting situations have held that the
statute does not reach unreasonably high fees, see Kruse
v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc., 383 F. 3d 49, 56 (CA2
2004); Santiago v. GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc., 417 F. 3d
384, 387 (CA3 2005); Friedman v. Market Street Mortgage
Corp., 520 F. 3d 1289, 1297 (CA11 2008), petitioners acknowledge that the statute does not cover overcharges.
They nonetheless embrace HUD’s construction of §2607(b)
insofar as it holds that a provider violates the statute by
retaining a fee after providing no services at all in return.
