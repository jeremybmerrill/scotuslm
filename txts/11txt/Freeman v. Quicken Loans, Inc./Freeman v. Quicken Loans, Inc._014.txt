FREEMAN v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

(those agreed to in exchange for referrals) and subsection
(b) prohibits certain unearned fees (those paid from a part
of the charge to the customer).9
Petitioners also appeal to statutory purpose, arguing
that a prohibition against the charging of undivided unearned fees would fit comfortably with RESPA’s stated
goal of “insur[ing] that consumers . . . are protected from
unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain
abusive practices,” §2601(a). It bears noting that RESPA’s
declaration of purpose is by its terms limited to “certain
abusive practices”—making the statute an even worse
candidate than most for the expansion of limited text by
the positing of an unlimited purpose. RESPA’s particular
language ultimately serves to drive home a broader point:
“[N]o legislation pursues its purposes at all costs,” Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per
curiam), and “[e]very statute purposes, not only to achieve
certain ends, but also to achieve them by particular
means,” Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514
U. S. 122, 136 (1995). Vague notions of statutory purpose
——————
9 The United States, as amicus curiae, raises an additional argument
from the statutory context: that coverage of undivided unearned fees
in §2607(b) can be inferred from the text of §2607(d), which sets out
penalties for the “person or persons” who violate §2607(a) or §2607(b).
§2607(d)(1), (2), and (3) (emphasis added). But Congress’s use of
the singular “person” does not remotely establish that §2607(b) can be
violated by a single culpable actor who accepts an unearned charge
from a consumer. In fact, any such inference is negated by the history
of §2607. When RESPA was first enacted, §2607(d) separately provided
for damages liability of “any person or persons who violate the provisions of subsection (a)” and of “any person or persons who violate the
provisions of subsection (b).” §2607(d)(2) (1976 ed.). Because §2607(a),
with its reference to an “agreement or understanding,” has always
required two culpable parties for a violation, Congress’s use of the
phrase “any person or persons” in connection with that subsection
demonstrates that the phrase does not have the significance attributed
to it by the United States.
