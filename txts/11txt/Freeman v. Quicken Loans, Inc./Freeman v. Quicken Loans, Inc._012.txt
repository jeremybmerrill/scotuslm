FREEMAN v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

In the present statute, that meaning is confirmed by the
“commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis—which counsels
that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.” United States v.
Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294 (2008). For “portion” and
“percentage” do not stand in isolation, but are part of a
phrase in which they are joined together by the intervening word “split”—which, as petitioners acknowledge, Brief
for Petitioners 19, cannot possibly mean the entirety. We
think it clear that, in employing the phrase “portion, split,
or percentage,” Congress sought to invoke the words’
common “core of meaning,” Graham County Soil and
Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,
559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 7 (2010) (slip op., at 7, n. 7), which is
to say, a part of a whole. That is so even though the
phrase is preceded by “any”—a word that, we have observed, has an “ ‘expansive meaning,’ ” Department of
Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker, 535 U. S. 125,
131 (2002). Expansive, yes; transformative, no. It can
broaden to the maximum, but never change in the least,
the clear meaning of the phrase selected by Congress here.
Contrary to petitioners’ contention, the natural connotation of “portion, split, or percentage” is not undermined in
this context by our “general ‘reluctan[ce] to treat statutory
terms as surplusage.’ ” Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., 563
U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (quoting Duncan v.
Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001)). Petitioners rightly
point out that under our interpretation “portion,” “split,”
and “percentage” all mean the same thing—a perhaps
regrettable but not uncommon sort of lawyerly iteration
(“give, grant, bargain, sell, and convey”). But the canon
against surplusage merely favors that interpretation
which avoids surplusage, see Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd.
Partnership, 564 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 12–
13)—and petitioners’ interpretation no more achieves that
