Opinion of the Court

§1467a(m)(7)(B)(ii)(II) (same). But that is not the normal
meaning of “portion” when one speaks of “giv[ing]” or
“accept[ing]” a portion of the whole, as dictionary definitions uniformly show.6 Aesop’s fable would be just as
wryly humorous if the lion’s claim to the entirety of the
kill he hunted in partnership with less ferocious animals
had been translated into English as the “lion’s portion”
instead of the lion’s share. As for “percentage,” that word
can include 100 percent—or even 300 percent—when it
refers to merely a ratable measure (“unemployment claims
were up 300 percent”).7 But, like “portion,” it normally
means less than all when referring to a “percentage” of
a specific whole (“he demanded a percentage of the profits”).8 And it is normal usage that, in the absence of contrary indication, governs our interpretation of texts.
