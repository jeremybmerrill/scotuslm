Opinion of the Court

provide no warrant for expanding §2607(b)’s prohibition
beyond the field to which it is unambiguously limited: the
splitting of fees paid for settlement services.
Nor is there any merit to petitioners’ related contention
that §2607(b) should not be given its natural meaning
because doing so leads to the allegedly absurd result of
permitting a provider to charge and keep the entirety of a
$1,000 unearned fee, while imposing liability if the provider shares even a nickel of a $10 charge with someone else.
That result does not strike us as particularly anomalous.
Congress may well have concluded that existing remedies,
such as state-law fraud actions, were sufficient to deal
with the problem of entirely fictitious fees, whereas legislative action was required to deal with the problems posed
by kickbacks and fee splitting.
In any event, petitioners’ reading of the statute leads to
an “absurdity” of its own: Because §2607(b) manifestly
cannot be understood to prohibit unreasonably high fees,
see supra, at 5, a service provider could avoid liability by
providing just a dollar’s worth of services in exchange for
the $1,000 fee. Acknowledging that §2607(b)’s coverage is
limited to fee-splitting transactions at least has the virtue
of making it a coherent response to that particular problem, rather than an incoherent response to the broader
problem of unreasonably high fees.

In order to establish a violation of §2607(b), a plaintiff
must demonstrate that a charge for settlement services
was divided between two or more persons. Because petitioners do not contend that respondent split the challenged charges with anyone else, summary judgment was
properly granted in favor of respondent. We therefore
affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
It is so ordered.
