FREEMAN v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

HUD’s 2001 policy statement asserts that “HUD is, of
course, unlikely to direct any enforcement actions against
consumers for the payment of unearned fees,” 66 Fed. Reg.
53059, n. 6, but that assurance is cold comfort. Moreover,
even assuming (as seems realistic) that the Justice Department would be similarly reluctant to prosecute consumers for criminal violations of §2607(b), “prosecutorial
discretion is not a reason for courts to give improbable
breadth to criminal statutes.”
Abuelhawa v. United
States, 556 U. S. 816, 823, n. 3 (2009).
Nor is the problem of consumer criminal liability solved
by petitioners’ suggestion that an unstated mens rea
requirement be read into the criminal enforcement provision, §2607(d)(1), see, e.g., Staples v. United States, 511
U. S. 600, 605 (1994). If that would excuse only those
consumers who are unaware that they are paying for
unearned services, some consumers would remain criminally liable—those who know that the fee is unearned but
decide to pay it anyway, perhaps because the provider’s
proposal is still the best deal. And if it would immunize
all consumers, the statute’s criminalization of the entire
“giving” portion of consumer-provider transactions would
make little sense. We find it virtually unthinkable that
Congress would leave it to imputed mens rea to preserve
from criminal liability some or all of the class RESPA was
designed to protect—and entirely unthinkable that Congress would have created that strange disposition through
language as obscure as that relied upon here.
The phrase “portion, split, or percentage” reinforces
the conclusion that §2607(b) does not cover a situation in
which a settlement-service provider retains the entirety of
a fee received from a consumer. It is certainly true that
“portion” or “percentage” can be used to include the entirety,
or 100 percent. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §648 (“portion”); 5
U. S. C. §8348(g) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (“percentag[e]”);
5 U. S. C. §8351(b)(2)(B) (2006 ed.) (same); 12 U. S. C.
