Opinion of the Court

violated §2607(b) by charging them fees for which no
services were provided. In particular, the Freemans and
the Bennetts allege that they were charged loan discount
fees of $980 and $1,100, respectively, but that respondent
did not give them lower interest rates in return. The
Smiths’ allegations focus on a $575 loan “processing fee”
and a “loan origination” fee of more than $5,100.3
Respondent removed petitioners’ lawsuits to federal
court, where the cases were consolidated. Respondent
thereafter moved for summary judgment on the ground
that petitioners’ claims are not cognizable under §2607(b)
because the allegedly unearned fees were not split with
another party. The District Court agreed; and because
petitioners did not allege any splitting of fees it granted
summary judgment in favor of respondent.
A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 626 F. 3d 799 (2010). We
granted certiorari. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).
II
The question in this case pertains to the scope of
§2607(b), which as we have said provides that “[n]o person
shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or
percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service . . . other than for
services actually performed.” The dispute between the
parties boils down to whether this provision prohibits the

3 Respondent maintains that at least the “loan origination” fee
charged to the Smiths was in fact a mislabeled loan discount fee, like
the allegedly unearned fees charged to the Freemans and the Bennetts.
Respondent contends that loan discount fees fall outside the scope of
§2607(b) because they are not fees for settlement services, but rather,
as the Eleventh Circuit has held, are part of the pricing of a loan. See
Wooten v. Quicken Loans, Inc., 626 F. 3d 1187 (2010). Petitioners
dispute this point on the merits and further argue that respondent
forfeited the contention in the lower courts. We express no view on this
issue.
