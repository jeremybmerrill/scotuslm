SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

(1997) (statutory interpretation must consider “the
broader context of the statute as a whole”).4
The majority draws a different conclusion from the substantive provisions of the Privacy Act. It (correctly) infers from them that the Act “serves interests similar to
those protected by defamation and privacy torts.” Ante,
at 9. It then points to our observation in Doe v. Chao, 540
U. S. 614, 625 (2004), that the Act’s civil-remedies provision “parallels” the remedial scheme for the common-law
torts of defamation per quod, which permitted recovery
of “general damages” (i.e., presumed damages) only if a
plaintiff first establishes “special damages” (i.e., monetary
loss).5 Ante, at 10. That “parallel,” the majority concludes, “suggests the possibility that Congress intended
the term ‘actual damages’ in the Act to mean special damages.” Ante, at 11.
The majority reads too much into Doe. At issue in that

4 It bears noting that the Privacy Act does not authorize injunctive
relief when a suit is maintained under 5 U. S. C. §§552a(g)(1)(C) and
(D). Rather, injunctive relief is available under the Act only for a
limited category of suits: suits to amend a record and suits for access to
a record. See §§552a(g)(2), (g)(3). Thus an individual who, like petitioner, brings suit under subparagraph (g)(1)(C) or (D) for an intentional or willful violation of the Act will be without a remedy under
the majority’s reading of “actual damages.”
5 As the majority notes, “general damages” at common law refers to
damages “presumed” to accrue from the violation of the legally protected right. No proof of actual injury was required. See D. Dobbs,
Law of Remedies §7.2, p. 513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs); Doe, 540 U. S.,
at 621. “Special damages,” in contrast, “meant monetary loss.” Dobbs §7.2,
at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Common-law defamation actions falling
within the rubric of defamation per se allowed successful plaintiffs to
recover “general damages.” See Dobbs §7.2, at 513; Doe, 540 U. S., at
621. This stood in contrast to actions sounding in defamation per quod,
which permitted recovery only if the plaintiff established “special
damages.” See Dobbs, §7.2 at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Even in
defamation per quod cases, a plaintiff could recover nonpecuniary
injuries upon establishing some pecuniary loss. See Dobbs §7.2, at 521;
Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. See also ante, at 10.
