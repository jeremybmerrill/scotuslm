FAA v. COOPER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

B
Indeed, the relevant statutory context—the substantive
provisions whose breach may trigger suit under the civilremedies provision—only reinforces the ordinary meaning
of “actual damages.”
Congress established substantive duties in the Act that
are expressly designed to prevent agency conduct resulting in intangible harms to the individual. The Act requires agencies to “establish appropriate administrative,
technical, and physical safeguards” to ensure against
security breaches that could result in “substantial harm,
embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual.” 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(10). It also requires agencies
to “maintain all records” used in making a determination
about an individual in a manner that is “reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.” §552a(e)(5). Thus an agency violates the terms of
the Act if it fails, e.g., to maintain safeguards protecting
against “embarrassment”; there is no additional requirement that the pocketbook be implicated. An agency’s
intentional or willful violation of those duties triggers
liability for “actual damages” under §552a(g)(4) in the
event of an adverse impact. §§552a(g)(1)(C)–(D), (g)(4).
Adopting a reading of “actual damages” that permits
recovery for pecuniary loss alone creates a disconnect
between the Act’s substantive and remedial provisions. It
allows a swath of Government violations to go unremedied: A federal agency could intentionally or willfully forgo
establishing safeguards to protect against embarrassment
and no successful private action could be taken against it
for the harm Congress identified. Only an interpretation
of “actual damages” that permits recovery for nonpecuniary harms harmonizes the Act’s substantive and remedial
provisions. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341
