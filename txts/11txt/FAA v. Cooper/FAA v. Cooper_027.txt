SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

losses. Nothing in the use of that phrase indicates proven
injuries need be pecuniary in nature.
The majority discards all this on the asserted ground
that “the precise meaning of the term ‘changes with the
specific statute in which it is found.’ ” Ante, at 7 (quoting
622 F. 3d 1016, 1029 (CA9 2010)). Context, of course, is
relevant to statutory interpretation; it may provide clues
that Congress did not employ a word or phrase in its
ordinary meaning. That well-established interpretive rule
cannot, however, render irrelevant—as the majority would
have it—the ordinary meaning of “actual damages.”
Moreover, the authority the majority cites for its claim
that “actual damages” has no fixed meaning undermines—
rather than supports—its holding. Each cited authority
involves either a statute in which Congress expressly
directed that compensation be measured in strictly economic terms, or else a statute (e.g., the Copyright Act of
1909) in which economic loss is the natural and probable
consequence of a violation of the defined legal interest.3
Neither factor is present here. Notably absent from the
Privacy Act is any provision so much as hinting that “actual damages” should be limited to economic loss. And
while “ ‘ “hurt feelings” over the nature of the [copyright]
infringement’ ” may “have no place in the actual damages
calculus” under the Copyright Act of 1909, ante, at 8 (quoting in parenthetical Mackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917
(CA9 2002)), the majority provides no basis for concluding
that “hurt feelings” are equally invalid in an Act concerned with safeguarding individual privacy. Thus, while
context is no doubt relevant, the majority’s cited authority
does little to help its cause in the stated context of this
statute.
