FAA v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

done” are “called general damages, to distinguish them
from proof of actual economic harm,” which is called “spe­
cial damages.” Id., §3.2, at 139; see also supra, at 10, 12–
13, and nn. 6, 7, 9. Therefore, the converse of general
damages is special damages, not all proven damages, as
respondent would have it. Because Congress removed
“general damages” from the Act’s remedial provision, it is
reasonable to infer that Congress foreclosed recovery for
nonpecuniary harm, even if such harm can be proved, and
instead waived the Government’s sovereign immunity only
with respect to harm compensable as special damages.

Looking beyond the Privacy Act’s text, respondent
points to the use of the term “actual” damages in the
remedial provisions of the FHA, 42 U. S. C. §3613(c), and
the FCRA, 15 U. S. C. §§1681n, 1681o. As previously
mentioned, courts have held that “actual” damages within
the meaning of these statutes include compensation for
mental and emotional distress. Supra, at 7. Citing the
rule of construction that Congress intends the same lan­
guage in similar statutes to have the same meaning, see
Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412
U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per curiam), respondent argues that
the Privacy Act should also be interpreted as authorizing
damages for mental and emotional distress. See Brief for
Respondent 25–32.
Assuming for the sake of argument that these lower
court decisions are correct, they provide only weak support
for respondent’s argument here. Since the term “actual
damages” can mean different things in different contexts,
statutes other than the Privacy Act provide only limited
interpretive aid, and that is especially true here. Neither
the FHA nor the FCRA contains text that precisely mir­
