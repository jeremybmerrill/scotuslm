FAA v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

held that respondent could not recover damages because
he alleged only mental and emotional harm, not economic
loss. Finding that the term “actual damages” is “facially
ambiguous,” id., at 791, and relying on the sovereign
immunity canon, which provides that waivers of sovereign
immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the Gov­
ernment, the court concluded that the Act does not author­
ize the recovery of damages from the Government for
nonpecuniary mental or emotional harm.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir­
cuit reversed and remanded. 622 F. 3d 1016, 1024 (2010).
The court acknowledged that the term “actual damages”
is a “ ‘chameleon’ ” in that “its meaning changes with the
specific statute in which it is found.” Id., at 1029. But the
court nevertheless held that, as used in the Privacy Act,
the term includes damages for mental and emotional
distress. Looking to what it described as “[i]ntrinsic” and
“[e]xtrinsic” sources, id., at 1028, 1031, the court concluded
that the meaning of “actual damages” in the Privacy
Act is not ambiguous and that “a construction that limits
recovery to pecuniary loss” is not “plausible,” id., at 1034.
The Government petitioned for rehearing or rehearing
en banc, but a divided court denied the petition. Id., at
1019. The Government then petitioned for certiorari, and
we granted review. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).
II
Because respondent seeks to recover monetary compen­
sation from the Government for mental and emotional
harm, we must decide whether the civil remedies provi­
——————
nondisclosure requirement applies when the head of an agency makes a
written request for law enforcement purposes to the agency that
maintains the record. See §552a(b)(7). The agencies in this case could
easily have shared respondent’s medical records pursuant to the
procedures prescribed by the Privacy Act, but the District Court con­
cluded that they failed to do so.
