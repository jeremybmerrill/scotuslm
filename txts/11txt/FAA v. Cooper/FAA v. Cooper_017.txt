FAA v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

D
We do not claim that the contrary reading of the statute
accepted by the Court of Appeals and advanced now by
respondent is inconceivable. But because the Privacy Act
waives the Federal Government’s sovereign immunity, the
question we must answer is whether it is plausible to read
the statute, as the Government does, to authorize only
damages for economic loss. Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at
34, 37. When waiving the Government’s sovereign im­
munity, Congress must speak unequivocally. Lane, 518
U. S., at 192. Here, we conclude that it did not. As a
consequence, we adopt an interpretation of “actual dam­
ages” limited to proven pecuniary or economic harm. To
do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress’ sover­
eign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text
clearly requires.
III
None of respondent’s contrary arguments suffices to
overcome the sovereign immunity canon.

Respondent notes that the term “actual damages” has
often been defined broadly in common-law cases, and in
our own, to include all compensatory damages. See Brief
for Respondent 18–25. For example, in Birdsall v. Coo­
lidge, 93 U. S. 64 (1876), a patent infringement case, we
observed that “[c]ompensatory damages and actual dam­
ages mean the same thing.” Ibid. And in Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974), we wrote that actual
injury in the defamation context “is not limited to out-of­
pocket loss” and that it customarily includes “impairment
of reputation and standing in the community, personal
humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.” Id., at
350.
These cases and others cited by respondent stand for the
