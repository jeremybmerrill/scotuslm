Opinion of the Court

unremarkable point that the term “actual damages” can
include nonpecuniary loss. But this generic meaning does
not establish with the requisite clarity that the Privacy
Act, with its distinctive features, authorizes damages for

Comment a (noting that general damages compensate for
“harm which . . . is proved, or, in the absence of proof,
is assumed to have caused to [the plaintiff’s] reputation”).

proved or not, from the only other category of compensatory damages available in the relevant common-law suits is
the type of harm. In defamation and privacy cases, “the
