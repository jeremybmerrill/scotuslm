Opinion of the Court

sion of the Privacy Act waives the Government’s sovereign
immunity with respect to such a recovery.
A
We have said on many occasions that a waiver of sover­
eign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed” in
statutory text. See, e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192
(1996); United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,
33 (1992); Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498
U. S. 89, 95 (1990). Legislative history cannot supply a
waiver that is not clearly evident from the language of
the statute. Lane, supra, at 192. Any ambiguities in the
statutory language are to be construed in favor of immunity, United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995),
so that the Government’s consent to be sued is never enlarged beyond what a fair reading of the text requires,
Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 685–686 (1983)
(citing Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675,
686 (1927)). Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible inter­
pretation of the statute that would not authorize money
damages against the Government. Nordic Village, supra,
at 34, 37.
The question that confronts us here is not whether
Congress has consented to be sued for damages under the
Privacy Act. That much is clear from the statute, which
expressly authorizes recovery from the Government for
“actual damages.” Rather, the question at issue concerns
the scope of that waiver. For the same reason that we
refuse to enforce a waiver that is not unambiguously
expressed in the statute, we also construe any ambiguities
in the scope of a waiver in favor of the sovereign. Lane,
supra, at 192.
Although this canon of interpretation requires an un­
mistakable statutory expression of congressional intent to
waive the Government’s immunity, Congress need not
state its intent in any particular way. We have never
