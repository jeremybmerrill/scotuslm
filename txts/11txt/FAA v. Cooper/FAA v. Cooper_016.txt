Opinion of the Court

cause Congress declined to authorize “general damages,”
we think it likely that Congress intended “actual dam­
ages” in the Privacy Act to mean special damages for
proven pecuniary loss.
Not surprisingly, this interpretation was accepted by
the Privacy Protection Study Commission, an expert body
authorized by Congress and highly sensitive to the Act’s
goals. The Commission understood “actual damages” in
the Act to be “a synonym for special damages as that term
is used in defamation cases.” Personal Privacy in an
Information Society: The Report of the Privacy Protection
Study Commission 530 (July 1977); see also ibid. (“The
legislative history and language of the Act suggest that
Congress meant to restrict recovery to specific pecuniary
losses until the Commission could weigh the propriety of
extending the standard of recovery”). Although we are not
bound in any way by the Commission’s report, we think it
confirms the reasonableness of interpreting “actual dam­
ages” in the unique context of the Privacy Act as the
equivalent of special damages.
