Opinion of the Court

*
*
*
In sum, applying traditional rules of construction, we
hold that the Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize
an award of damages for mental or emotional distress.
Accordingly, the Act does not waive the Federal Govern­
ment’s sovereign immunity from liability for such harms.
We therefore reverse the judgment of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the
case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.

(noting that the absence of equitable relief in suits under
§§552a(g)(1)(C) or (D) may be explained by the availability of such relief
under the APA).
