FAA v. COOPER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

pecuniary losses to recover $1,000 while others suffering
severe mental anguish to recover nothing. But it concludes that “there is nothing absurd about a scheme that
limits the Government’s Privacy Act liability to harm that
can be substantiated by proof of tangible economic loss.”
Ante, at 18. Perhaps; it is certainly within Congress’
prerogative to enact the statute the majority envisions,
namely one that seeks to safeguard against invasions of
privacy without remedying the primary harm that results
from invasions of privacy. The problem for the majority is
that one looks in vain for any indication in the text of the
statute before us that Congress intended such a result.
Nowhere in the Privacy Act does Congress so much as hint
that it views a $5 hit to the pocketbook as more worthy of
remedy than debilitating mental distress, and the majority’s contrary assumption discounts the gravity of emotional harm caused by an invasion of the personal integrity that privacy protects.

After today, no matter how debilitating and substantial
the resulting mental anguish, an individual harmed by
a federal agency’s intentional or willful violation of the
Privacy Act will be left without a remedy unless he or she
is able to prove pecuniary harm. That is not the result
Congress intended when it enacted an Act with the express purpose of safeguarding individual privacy against
Government invasion. And it is not a result remotely
suggested by anything in the text, structure, or history of
the Act. For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.
