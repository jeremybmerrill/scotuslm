Opinion of the Court

damages” in the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U. S. C. §101(b)
(1970 ed.), as “the extent to which the market value of
a copyrighted work has been injured or destroyed by an
infringement.” Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-GoldwynMayer, Inc., 772 F. 2d 505, 512 (CA9 1985); see also
Mackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917 (CA9 2002) (holding
that “ ‘hurt feelings’ over the nature of the infringement”
have no place in the actual damages calculus). And some
courts have construed “actual damages” in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. §78bb(a), to mean “some
form of economic loss.” Ryan v. Foster & Marshall, Inc.,
556 F. 2d 460, 464 (CA9 1977); see also Osofsky v. Zipf,
645 F. 2d 107, 111 (CA2 1981) (stating that the purpose of
§78bb(a) “is to compensate civil plaintiffs for economic loss
suffered as a result of wrongs committed in violation of the
1934 Act”); Herpich v. Wallace, 430 F. 2d 792, 810 (CA5
1970) (noting that the “gist” of an action for damages
under the Act is “economic injury”).3
Because the term “actual damages” has this chameleon­

3 This narrow usage is reflected in contemporaneous state-court deci­
sions as well. See, e.g., Reist v. Manwiller, 231 Pa. Super. 444, 449,
n. 4, 332 A. 2d 518, 520, n. 4 (1974) (explaining that recovery for
intentional infliction of emotional distress is allowed “despite the total
absence of physical injury and actual damages”); Nalder v. Crest Corp.,
93 Idaho 744, 749, 472 P. 2d 310, 315 (1970) (noting that damages for
“mental anguish” due to the wrongful execution of a judgment “are
allowable only as an element of punitive but not of actual damages”). It
is also reflected in post-Privacy Act statutes and judicial decisions. See,
e.g., 17 U. S. C. §1009(d)(1)(A)(ii) (defining “actual damages” in the
Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 as “the royalty payments that
should have been paid”); 18 U. S. C. §2318(e)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)
(calculating “actual damages” for purposes of a counterfeit labeling
statute in terms of financial loss); Guzman v. Western State Bank of
Devils Lake, 540 F. 2d 948, 953 (CA8 1976) (stating that compensatory
damages in a civil rights suit “can be awarded for emotional and mental
distress even though no actual damages are proven”).
