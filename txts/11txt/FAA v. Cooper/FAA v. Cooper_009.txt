FAA v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

required that Congress use magic words. To the contrary,
we have observed that the sovereign immunity canon “is
a tool for interpreting the law” and that it does not “dis­
plac[e] the other traditional tools of statutory construc­
tion.” Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S.
571, 589 (2008). What we thus require is that the scope of
Congress’ waiver be clearly discernable from the statutory
text in light of traditional interpretive tools. If it is not,
then we take the interpretation most favorable to the
Government.

The civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act provides
that, for any “intentional or willful” refusal or failure to
comply with the Act, the United States shall be liable for
“actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of
the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled
to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.” 5 U. S. C.
§552a(g)(4)(A). Because Congress did not define “actual
damages,” respondent urges us to rely on the ordinary
meaning of the word “actual” as it is defined in standard
general-purpose dictionaries. But as the Court of Appeals
explained, “actual damages” is a legal term of art, 622
F. 3d, at 1028, and it is a “cardinal rule of statutory con­
struction” that, when Congress employs a term of art, “ ‘it
presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that
were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learn­
ing from which it was taken,’ ” Molzof v. United States, 502
U. S. 301, 307 (1992) (quoting Morissette v. United States,
342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)).
Even as a legal term, however, the meaning of “actual
damages” is far from clear. The latest edition of Black’s
Law Dictionary available when Congress enacted the
Privacy Act defined “actual damages” as “[r]eal, substan­
tial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a com­
plainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or
