injury, as opposed on the one hand to ‘nominal’ damages,
and on the other to ‘exemplary’ or ‘punitive’ damages.”
Black’s Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). But this
general (and notably circular) definition is of little value
here because, as the Court of Appeals accurately observed,
the precise meaning of the term “changes with the specific
statute in which it is found.” 622 F. 3d, at 1029.
The term is sometimes understood to include nonpecu­
niary harm. Take, for instance, some courts’ interpreta­
tions of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U. S. C. §3613(c),
and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U. S. C.
§§1681n, 1681o. A number of courts have construed “ac­
tual” damages in the remedial provisions of both statutes
to include compensation for mental and emotional dis­
tress. See, e.g., Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., 491 F. 2d 634,
636–638 (CA7 1974) (authorizing compensatory damages
under the FHA, 42 U. S. C. §3612, the predecessor to
§3613, for humiliation); Steele v. Title Realty Co., 478 F. 2d
380, 384 (CA10 1973) (stating that damages under the
FHA “are not limited to out-of-pocket losses but may
include an award for emotional distress and humiliation”);
Thompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchants Assn., 682
F. 2d 509, 513–514 (CA5 1982) (per curiam) (explaining
that, “[e]ven when there are no out-of-pocket expenses,
humiliation and mental distress do constitute recoverable
elements of damage” under the FCRA); Millstone v.
O’Hanlon Reports, Inc., 528 F. 2d 829, 834–835 (CA8 1976)
(approving an award of damages under the FCRA for “loss
of sleep, nervousness, frustration and mental anguish”).
In other contexts, however, the term has been used or
construed more narrowly to authorize damages for only
pecuniary harm. In the wrongful-death provision of the
Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), for example, Congress
authorized “actual or compensatory damages, measured
by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.” 28
U. S. C. §2674, ¶2. At least one court has defined “actual
