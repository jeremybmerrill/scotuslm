FAA v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

ards. See §61.23(d). When applying for renewal, pilots
must disclose any illnesses, disabilities, or surgeries they
have had, and they must identify any medications they are
taking. See 14 CFR pt. 67.
Respondent Stanmore Cooper has been a private pilot
since 1964. In 1985, he was diagnosed with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and began taking
antiretroviral medication. At that time, the FAA did not
issue medical certificates to persons with respondent’s
condition. Knowing that he would not qualify for renewal
of his medical certificate, respondent initially grounded
himself and chose not to apply. In 1994, however, he applied for and received a medical certificate, but he did so

In 2002, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the
FAA’s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga­
tion with the SSA, known as “Operation Safe Pilot,” to
identify medically unfit individuals who had obtained FAA
certifications to fly. The DOT gave the SSA a list of names
and other identifying information of 45,000 licensed pilots
in northern California. The SSA then compared the list
with its own records of benefit recipients and compiled a
spreadsheet, which it gave to the DOT.
The spreadsheet revealed that respondent had a current
medical certificate but had also received disability bene­
fits. After reviewing respondent’s FAA medical file and
his SSA disability file, FAA flight surgeons determined in
