FAA v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

niary in their nature”).8
Any doubt about the plausibility of construing “actual
damages” in the Privacy Act synonymously with “special
damages” is put to rest by Congress’ refusal to authorize
“general damages.” In an uncodified section of the Act,
Congress established the Privacy Protection Study Com­
mission to consider, among other things, “whether the
Federal Government should be liable for general damages.” §5(c)(2)(B)(iii), 88 Stat. 1907, note following 5 U. S. C.
§552a, p. 712. As we explained in Doe, “Congress left the
question of general damages . . . for another day.” 540
U. S., at 622. Although the Commission later recommended that general damages be allowed, ibid., n. 4,
Congress never amended the Act to include them. For
that reason, we held that it was “beyond serious doubt”
that general damages are not available for violations of
the Privacy Act. Id., at 622.
By authorizing recovery for “actual” but not for “gen­
eral” damages, Congress made clear that it viewed those
terms as mutually exclusive. In actions for defamation
and related dignitary torts, two categories of compensatory damages are recoverable: general damages and special
damages. Cooley §164, at 579; see also 4 Restatement
§867, Comment d (1939) (noting that damages for inter­
ference with privacy “can be awarded in the same way in
which general damages are given for defamation”).9 Be­

dissent disregards these precedents as the product of careless
imprecision. Post, at 8, n. 6. But just as we assume that Congress did
not act carelessly, we should not be so quick to assume that the courts
did. The better explanation for these precedents is not that the courts
were careless, but that the term “actual damages” has a varied mean­
ing that, depending on the context, can be limited to compensation for
only pecuniary harm.

damages, the plaintiff here is limited to a recovery of general damages
