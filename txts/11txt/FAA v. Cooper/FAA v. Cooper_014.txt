Opinion of the Court

This parallel between the Privacy Act and the common­
law torts of libel per quod and slander suggests the possi­
bility that Congress intended the term “actual damages”
in the Act to mean special damages. The basic idea is that
Privacy Act victims, like victims of libel per quod or slan­
der, are barred from any recovery unless they can first
show actual—that is, pecuniary or material—harm. Upon
showing some pecuniary harm, no matter how slight, they
can recover the statutory minimum of $1,000, presumably
for any unproven harm. That Congress would choose to
use the term “actual damages” instead of “special damages”
was not without precedent. The terms had occasionally
been used interchangeably. See, e.g., Wetzel v. Gulf Oil
Corp., 455 F. 2d 857, 862 (CA9 1972) (holding that plain­
tiff could not establish libel per quod because he “did not
introduce any valid and sufficient evidence of actual dam­
age”); Electric Furnace Corp. v. Deering Milliken Research
Corp., 325 F. 2d 761, 765 (CA6 1963) (stating that “libel
per quod standing alone without proof of actual damages
. . . will not support a verdict for the plaintiff ”); M & S
Furniture Sales Co. v. Edward J. De Bartolo Corp., 249
Md. 540, 544, 241 A. 2d 126, 128 (1968) (“In the case of
words or conduct actionable only per quod, the injurious
effect must be established by allegations and proof of
special damage and in such cases it is not only necessary
to plead and show that the words or actions were defama­
tory, but it must also appear that such words or conduct
caused actual damage”); Clementson v. Minnesota Tribune
Co., 45 Minn. 303, 47 N. W. 781 (1891) (distinguishing
“actual, or, as they are sometimes termed, ‘special,’ dam­
ages” from “general damages—that is, damages not pecu­
——————
resulting physical illness and pain, as well as estimated future dam­
ages of the same kind” (footnotes omitted)); 3 Restatement §621, Com­
ment a (stating that, in actions for defamation, a plaintiff may recover
general damages for “impairment of his reputation or, through loss of
reputation, to his other interests”).
