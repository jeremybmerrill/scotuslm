FAA v. COOPER
Opinion of the Court

tions of the Act, but only if they prove at least some
“actual damages.” Id., at 620, 627; see §552a(g)(4)(A).
Although we did not address the meaning of “actual dam­
ages,” id., at 622, n. 5, 627, n. 12, we observed that the
provision “parallels” the remedial scheme for the common­
law torts of libel per quod and slander, under which plain­
tiffs can recover “general damages,” but only if they prove
“special harm” (also known as “special damages”), id., at
625; see also 3 Restatement of Torts §575, Comments a
and b (1938) (hereinafter Restatement); D. Dobbs, Law of
Remedies §7.2, pp. 511–513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs).5
“Special damages” are limited to actual pecuniary loss,
which must be specially pleaded and proved. 1 D. Hag­
gard, Cooley on Torts §164, p. 580 (4th ed. 1932) (hereinaf­
ter Cooley).6 “General damages,” on the other hand, cover
“loss of reputation, shame, mortification, injury to the
feelings and the like and need not be alleged in detail and
require no proof.” Id., §164, at 579.7

5 Libel

per quod and slander (as opposed to libel and slander per se)
apply to a communication that is not defamatory on its face but that is
defamatory when coupled with some other extrinsic fact. Dobbs §7.2, at
512–513.
6 See also 3 Restatement §575, Comment b (“Special harm . . . is harm
of a material and generally of a pecuniary nature”); Dobbs §7.2, at 520
(“Special damages in defamation cases mean pecuniary damages, or at
least ‘material loss’ ” (footnote omitted)). Special damages do not
include mental or emotional distress. See 3 Restatement §575, Com­
ment c (“The emotional distress caused to the person slandered by his
knowledge that he has been defamed is not special harm and this is so
although the distress results in a serious illness”); Dobbs §7.2, at 520
(“Even under the more modern approach, special damages in defama­
tion cases must be economic in nature, and it is not enough that the
plaintiff has suffered harm to reputation, mental anguish or other
dignitary harm, unless he has also suffered the loss of something
having economic value”).
7 See also id., §3.2, at 139 (explaining that noneconomic harms “are
called general damages”); W. Prosser, Law of Torts §112, p. 761 (4th ed.
1971) (noting that “ ‘general’ damages may be recovered for the injury
to the plaintiff’s reputation, his wounded feelings and humiliation, and
