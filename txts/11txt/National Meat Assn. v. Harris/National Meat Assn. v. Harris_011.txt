NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS
Opinion of the Court

And other regulations contemplate that slaughterhouses
will in fact take, rather than refuse, receipt of nonambulatory swine. Recall that the FMIA’s regulations provide for
the inspection of all pigs at delivery, see supra, at 2—in
the case of nonambulatory pigs, often right on the truck,
see Humane Handling and Slaughter of Livestock, FSIS
Directive 6900.2, ch. II(I). They further instruct slaughterhouses to kill and dispose of any nonambulatory pigs
labeled “condemned,” and to slaughter separately those
marked “suspect.” See supra, at 3. In short, federal law
establishes rules for handling and slaughtering nonambulatory pigs brought to a slaughterhouse, rather than
ordering them returned to sender. So §599f(a) and the
FMIA require different things of a slaughterhouse confronted with a delivery truck containing nonambulatory swine. The former says “do not receive or buy them”;
the latter does not.
The Humane Society counters that at least §599f(a)’s
ban on buying nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because that provision applies no matter when or
where a purchase takes place. The argument proceeds in
three steps: (1) §599f(a)’s ban covers purchases of nonambulatory pigs made prior to delivery, away from the
slaughterhouse itself (say, at a farm or auction); (2) the
State may regulate such offsite purchases because they do
not involve a slaughterhouse’s “premises, facilities and
operations,” which is a condition of preemption under the
FMIA; and (3) no different result should obtain just because a slaughterhouse structures its swine purchases to
occur at delivery, on its own property. See Brief for NonState Respondents 43–45.
But this argument fails on two grounds. First, its preliminary steps have no foundation in the record. Until a
stray comment at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50,
neither the State nor the Humane Society had disputed
the NMA’s assertion that slaughterhouses buy pigs at
