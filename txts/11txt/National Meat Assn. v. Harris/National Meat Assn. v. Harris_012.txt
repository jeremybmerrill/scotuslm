delivery (or still later, upon successful ante-mortem inspection). See Brief for Petitioner 46, n. 18; Brief for NonState Respondents 44; Brief for State Respondents 16,
n. 5. Nor had the parties presented evidence that a significant number of pigs become nonambulatory before shipment, when any offsite purchases would occur. The record
therefore does not disclose whether §599f(a)’s ban on
purchase ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate,
much less how an application of that kind would affect
a slaughterhouse’s operations. And because that is so,
we have no basis for deciding whether the FMIA would
preempt it. Second, even assuming that a State could
regulate offsite purchases, the concluding step of the
Humane Society’s argument would not follow. The FMIA’s
preemption clause expressly focuses on “premises, facilities and operations”—at bottom, the slaughtering and
processing of animals at a given location. So the distinction between a slaughterhouse’s site-based activities and
its more far-flung commercial dealings is not, as the Humane Society contends, an anomaly that courts should
strain to avoid. It is instead a fundamental feature of the
FMIA’s preemption clause.
For that reason, the Humane Society’s stronger argument concerns California’s effort to regulate the last stage
of a slaughterhouse’s business—the ban in §599f(b) on
“sell[ing] meat or products of nonambulatory animals for
human consumption.” The Government acknowledges
that the FMIA’s preemption clause does not usually foreclose “state regulation of the commercial sales activities of
slaughterhouses.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 17. And the Humane Society asserts, in line with
that general rule, that §599f(b)’s ban on sales does not
regulate a slaughterhouse’s “operations” because it kicks
in only after they have ended: Once meat from a slaughtered pig has passed a post-mortem inspection, the Act
“is not concerned with whether or how it is ever actually
