Syllabus
even if the State could regulate off-site purchases, it does not follow
that on-site purchases would escape preemption, because the FMIA’s
preemption clause expressly focuses on slaughterhouse “premises, facilities and operations.” And while the Humane Society is correct
that the FMIA does not normally regulate slaughterhouse sales activities, §599f’s sales ban serves to regulate how slaughterhouses must
handle nonambulatory pigs on their premises. Its effect is to make
sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory pigs from the production process. It is therefore preempted by the FMIA. Pp. 6−10.
(b) Also rejected is the broad argument that §599f’s challenged provisions fall outside the FMIA’s scope because they exclude a class of
animals from the slaughtering process, while the FMIA extends only
to “animals that are going to be turned into meat.” In fact, the FMIA
regulates animals on slaughterhouse premises that will never be
turned into meat. For example, the Act’s implementing regulations
exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering process, e.g.,
swine with hog cholera, 9 CFR §309.5(a). The argument that §599f’s
exclusion avoids the FMIA’s scope because it is designed to ensure
the humane treatment of pigs, rather than meat safety, misunderstands the FMIA’s scope. The FMIA addresses not just food safety,
but humane treatment, as well. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §§603, 610(b).
Pp. 11−14.
