Opinion of the Court

(CA9 2010).
As amended, the California law—§599f of the state
penal code—provides in relevant part:
“(a) No slaughterhouse, stockyard, auction, market
agency, or dealer shall buy, sell, or receive a nonambulatory animal.
“(b) No slaughterhouse shall process, butcher, or
sell meat or products of nonambulatory animals for
human consumption.
“(c) No slaughterhouse shall hold a nonambulatory
animal without taking immediate action to humanely
euthanize the animal.” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §599f
(West 2010).
The maximum penalty for violating any of these prohibitions is one year in jail and a $20,000 fine. See §599f(h).
Petitioner National Meat Association (NMA) is a trade
association representing meatpackers and processors, including operators of swine slaughterhouses. It sued to
enjoin the enforcement of §599f against those slaughterhouses, principally on the ground that the FMIA preempts
application of the state law.4 The District Court granted
the NMA’s motion for a preliminary injunction, reasoning
that §599f is expressly preempted because it requires
swine “to be handled in a manner other than that prescribed by the FMIA” and its regulations. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 36a. But the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit vacated the injunction. According to that
court, the FMIA does not expressly preempt §599f because
the state law regulates only “the kind of animal that may
be slaughtered,” and not the inspection or slaughtering
process itself. 599 F. 3d, at 1098.
We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. __ (2011), and now
