NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS
Opinion of the Court

See 9 CFR §313.2(d). Under the regulations, slaughterhouse employees may not drag conscious, nonambulatory
animals, see §313.2(d)(2), and may move them only with
“equipment suitable for such purposes,” §313.2(d)(3).
Similarly, employees must place nonambulatory animals,
as well as other sick and disabled livestock, in covered
pens sufficient to protect the animals from “adverse climatic conditions.” See §313.2(d)(1); §313.1(c).
The FMIA contains an express preemption provision, at
issue here, addressing state laws on these and similar
matters. That provision’s first sentence reads:
“Requirements within the scope of this [Act] with respect to premises, facilities and operations of any establishment at which inspection is provided under . . .
this [Act] which are in addition to, or different than
those made under this [Act] may not be imposed by
any State.” 21 U. S. C. §678.3
B
In 2008, the Humane Society of the United States
released an undercover video showing workers at a slaughterhouse in California dragging, kicking, and electroshocking sick and disabled cows in an effort to move them.
The video led the Federal Government to institute the
largest beef recall in U. S. history in order to prevent
consumption of meat from diseased animals. Of greater
relevance here, the video also prompted the California
legislature to strengthen a pre-existing statute governing
the treatment of nonambulatory animals and to apply that
statute to slaughterhouses regulated under the FMIA.
See National Meat Assn. v. Brown, 599 F. 3d 1093, 1096

3 The preemption provision also includes a saving clause, which states
that the Act “shall not preclude any State . . . from making requirement[s] or taking other action, consistent with this [Act], with respect
to any other matters regulated under this [Act].” 21 U. S. C. §678; see
n. 10, infra.
