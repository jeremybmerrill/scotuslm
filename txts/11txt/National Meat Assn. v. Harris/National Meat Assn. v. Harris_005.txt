NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS
Opinion of the Court

Upton Sinclair’s muckraking novel The Jungle sparked an
uproar over conditions in the meatpacking industry, the
Act establishes “an elaborate system of inspecti[ng]” live
animals and carcasses in order “to prevent the shipment
of impure, unwholesome, and unfit meat and meat-food
products.” Pittsburgh Melting Co. v. Totten, 248 U. S. 1,
4–5 (1918). And since amended in 1978, see 92 Stat. 1069,
the FMIA requires all slaughterhouses to comply with the
standards for humane handling and slaughter of animals
set out in the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958,
(HMSA), 72 Stat. 862, 7 U. S. C. §1901 et seq., which
originally applied only to slaughterhouses selling meat to
the Federal Government.
The Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has responsibility for administering the FMIA to promote its dual goals of safe meat and
humane slaughter. Over the years, the FSIS has issued
extensive regulations to govern the inspection of animals
and meat, as well as other aspects of slaughterhouses’
operations and facilities. See 9 CFR §300.1 et seq. (2011).
The FSIS employs about 9,000 inspectors, veterinarians,
and investigators to implement its inspection regime and
enforce its humane-handling requirements. See Hearings
on 2012 Appropriations before the Subcommittee on Agriculture of the House Committee on Appropriations, 112th
Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1B, p. 921 (2011). In fiscal year 2010,
those personnel examined about 147 million head of livestock and carried out more than 126,000 “humane handling verification procedures.” Id., at 942–943.
The FSIS’s inspection procedure begins with an “antemortem” examination of each animal brought to a slaughterhouse. See 9 CFR §309.1. If the inspector finds no

the FMIA governs all slaughterhouses in the State (except for any 

limited to “custom slaughtering for personal, household, guest, and 

employee uses,” §623(a)).
