NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS
Opinion of the Court

reverse.
II
The FMIA’s preemption clause sweeps widely—and in
so doing, blocks the applications of §599f challenged here.
The clause prevents a State from imposing any additional
or different—even if non-conflicting—requirements that
fall within the scope of the Act and concern a slaughterhouse’s facilities or operations. And at every turn §599f
imposes additional or different requirements on swine
slaughterhouses: It compels them to deal with nonambulatory pigs on their premises in ways that the federal Act
and regulations do not. In essence, California’s statute
substitutes a new regulatory scheme for the one the FSIS
uses. Where under federal law a slaughterhouse may take
one course of action in handling a nonambulatory pig,
under state law the slaughterhouse must take another.
Consider first what the two statutes tell a slaughterhouse to do when (as not infrequently occurs) a pig becomes injured and thus nonambulatory sometime after
delivery to the slaughterhouse.5 Section 599f(c) prohibits
the slaughterhouse from “hold[ing]” such an animal “without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize” it.
And §599f(b) provides that no part of the animal’s carcass
may be “process[ed]” or “butcher[ed]” to make food. By
contrast, under the FMIA and its regulations, a slaughterhouse may hold (without euthanizing) any nonambulatory pig that has not been condemned. See supra, at 3.
And the slaughterhouse may process or butcher such an
——————
5 The percentage of pigs becoming nonambulatory after delivery varies by slaughterhouse from 0.1 percent to over 1 percent. See McGlone,
Fatigued Pigs: The Final Link, Pork Magazine 14 (Mar. 2006). About
100 million pigs are slaughtered each year in the United States, see
Dept. of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Livestock
Slaughter 13 (Jan. 2011), so those percentages work out to between
100,000 and 1,000,000 pigs.
