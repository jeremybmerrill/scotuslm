NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS
Opinion of the Court

and indeed at the very heart of—the FMIA’s scope.10
IV
The FMIA regulates slaughterhouses’ handling and
treatment of nonambulatory pigs from the moment of their
delivery through the end of the meat production process.
California’s §599f endeavors to regulate the same thing, at
the same time, in the same place—except by imposing
different requirements. The FMIA expressly preempts
such a state law. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of
the Ninth Circuit, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

——————
10 We

finally reject California’s argument, see Brief for State Respondents 20, that our reading of the FMIA’s preemption provision
renders its saving clause insignificant. That clause provides that
States may regulate slaughterhouses as to “other matters,” not addressed in the express preemption clause, as long as those laws are
“consistent with” the FMIA. 21 U. S. C. §678. So, for example, the
Government acknowledges that state laws of general application
(workplace safety regulations, building codes, etc.) will usually apply to
slaughterhouses. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. Moreover, because the
FMIA’s express preemption provision prevents States from imposing
only “addition[al]” or “different” requirements, §678, States may exact
civil or criminal penalties for animal cruelty or other conduct that also
violates the FMIA. See §678; cf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, LLC, 544
U. S. 431, 447 (2005) (holding that a preemption clause barring state
laws “in addition to or different” from a federal Act does not interfere
with an “equivalent” state provision). Although the FMIA preempts
much state law involving slaughterhouses, it thus leaves some room for
the States to regulate.
