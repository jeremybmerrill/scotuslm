Opinion of the Court

III
California’s and the Humane Society’s broadest argument against preemption maintains that all of §599f ’s
challenged provisions fall outside the “scope” of the FMIA
because they exclude a class of animals from the slaughtering process. See 21 U. S. C. §678 (preempting certain
requirements “within the scope of this [Act]”). According
to this view, the Act (and the FSIS’s authority under it)
extends only to “animals that are going to be turned into
meat,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 28—or to use another phrase,
animals that will “be slaughtered . . . for purposes of
human food production,” Brief for State Respondents 19
(emphasis deleted). Section 599f avoids the scope of the
Act, respondents claim, by altogether removing nonambulatory pigs from the slaughtering process.8 The Ninth
Circuit accepted this argument, analogizing §599f to state
laws upheld in two other Circuits banning the slaughter of
horses for human consumption. 599 F. 3d, at 1098 (discussing Cavel Int’l., Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F. 3d 551 (CA7
2007), and Empacadora de Carnes de Fresnillo, S. A. de
C.V. v. Curry, 476 F. 3d 326 (CA5 2007)). According to the
Court of Appeals, “states are free to decide which animals
may be turned into meat.” 599 F. 3d, at 1098, 1099.
We think not. The FMIA’s scope includes not only
“animals that are going to be turned into meat,” but ani——————
8 California’s

brief sometimes casts its argument in terms of the “operations” language of the FMIA’s preemption clause (although the State
appeared to abandon this phrasing at oral argument). In this version of
the claim, California contends that the “operations” of a slaughterhouse
are only those “of federal concern,” and that excluding a class of animals from the slaughtering process does not impinge on such operations. Brief for State Respondents 20, n. 9; see also id., at 20–21. We
see no real difference between saying that a categorical exclusion of
animals does not implicate “operations of federal concern” and saying
that it does not fall within the scope of the Act. Accordingly, our
answer to both forms of the argument is the same.
