Opinion of the Court

regulate. See Brief for United States 27, 31.
The Court discussed federal alien-registration require­
ments in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52. In 1940, as
international conflict spread, Congress added to federal
immigration law a “complete system for alien registra­
tion.” Id., at 70. The new federal law struck a careful
balance. It punished an alien’s willful failure to register
but did not require aliens to carry identification cards.
There were also limits on the sharing of registration rec­
ords and fingerprints. The Court found that Congress
intended the federal plan for registration to be a “single
integrated and all-embracing system.” Id., at 74. Because
this “complete scheme . . . for the registration of aliens”
touched on foreign relations, it did not allow the States to
“curtail or complement” federal law or to “enforce addi­
tional or auxiliary regulations.” Id., at 66–67. As a con­
sequence, the Court ruled that Pennsylvania could not
enforce its own alien-registration program. See id., at 59, 74.
The present regime of federal regulation is not identi­
cal to the statutory framework considered in Hines, but
it remains comprehensive. Federal law now includes a
requirement that aliens carry proof of registration. 8
U. S. C. §1304(e). Other aspects, however, have stayed the
same. Aliens who remain in the country for more than 30
days must apply for registration and be fingerprinted.
Compare §1302(a) with id., §452(a) (1940 ed.). Detailed
information is required, and any change of address has
to be reported to the Federal Government. Compare
§§1304(a), 1305(a) (2006 ed.), with id., §§455(a), 456 (1940
ed.). The statute continues to provide penalties for the
willful failure to register. Compare §1306(a) (2006 ed.),
with id., §457 (1940 ed.).
The framework enacted by Congress leads to the conclu­
sion here, as it did in Hines, that the Federal Government
has occupied the field of alien registration. See American
Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 419, n. 11 (2003)
