ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of ALITO, J.

arise. But such cases are possible, and therefore we must
decide whether there are circumstances under which federal law precludes a state officer from making an arrest
based on probable cause that the arrestee committed a
removable offense.

The idea that state and local officers may carry out
arrests in the service of federal law is not unprecedented.
As previously noted, our cases establish that state and
local officers may make warrantless arrests for violations
of federal law and that “in the absence of an applicable
federal statute the law of the state where an arrest without warrant takes place determines its validity.” Di Re,

to curtail or pre-empt that authority in this particular
case.
Neither the United States nor the Court goes so far as to
say that state and local officers have no power to arrest
criminal aliens based on their removability. To do so

formal agreements with States and municipalities under
which their officers may perform certain duties of a federal immigration officer. But §1357(g)(10)(B) makes clear
that States and municipalities need not enter into those
agreements “otherwise to cooperate . . . in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not
