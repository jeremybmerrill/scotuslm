ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

And the Court held that it remains. Id., at 139.
II
One would conclude from the foregoing that after the
adoption of the Constitution there was some doubt about
the power of the Federal Government to control immigra­
tion, but no doubt about the power of the States to do so.
Since the founding era (though not immediately), doubt
about the Federal Government’s power has disappeared.
Indeed, primary responsibility for immigration policy has
shifted from the States to the Federal Government. Con­
gress exercised its power “[t]o establish an uniform Rule of
Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, very early on, see An Act
to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, 1 Stat.
103. But with the fleeting exception of the Alien Act,
Congress did not enact any legislation regulating immi­
gration for the better part of a century. In 1862, Congress
passed “An Act to prohibit the ‘Coolie Trade’ by American
Citizens in American Vessels,” which prohibited “procur­
ing [Chinese nationals] . . . to be disposed of, or sold, or
transferred, for any term of years or for any time what­
ever, as servants or apprentices, or to be held to service or
labor.” 12 Stat. 340. Then, in 1875, Congress amended
that act to bar admission to Chinese, Japanese, and other
Asian immigrants who had “entered into a contract or
agreement for a term of service within the United States,
for lewd and immoral purposes.” An act supplementary to
the acts in relation to immigration, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477.
And in 1882, Congress enacted the first general immi­
gration statute. See An act to regulate Immigration, 22
Stat. 214. Of course, it hardly bears mention that Federal
immigration law is now extensive.
I accept that as a valid exercise of federal power—not
because of the Naturalization Clause (it has no necessary
connection to citizenship) but because it is an inherent
attribute of sovereignty no less for the United States than
