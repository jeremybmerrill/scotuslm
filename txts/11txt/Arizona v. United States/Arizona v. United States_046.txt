Opinion of SCALIA, J.

place or perform work as an employee or independent
contractor in this state.” S. B. 1070, §5(C), as amended,
Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C).
Here, the Court rightly starts with De Canas v. Bica,
424 U. S. 351 (1976), which involved a California law
providing that “ ‘[n]o employer shall knowingly employ an
alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United
States if such employment would have an adverse effect
on lawful resident workers.’ ” Id., at 352 (quoting Califor­
nia Labor Code Ann. §2805(a)). This Court concluded that
the California law was not pre-empted, as Congress had
neither occupied the field of “regulation of employment of
illegal aliens” nor expressed “the clear and manifest pur­
pose” of displacing such state regulation. Id., at 356–357
(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, at the time
De Canas was decided, §5(C) would have been indubitably
lawful.
The only relevant change is that Congress has since
enacted its own restrictions on employers who hire illegal
aliens, 8 U. S. C. §1324a, in legislation that also includes
some civil (but no criminal) penalties on illegal aliens who
accept unlawful employment. The Court concludes from
this (reasonably enough) “that Congress made a deliberate
choice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek,
or engage in, unauthorized employment,” ante, at 13. But
that is not the same as a deliberate choice to prohibit
the States from imposing criminal penalties. Congress’s
intent with regard to exclusion of state law need not be
guessed at, but is found in the law’s express pre-emption
provision, which excludes “any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licens­
ing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit
or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens,”
§1324a(h)(2) (emphasis added). Common sense, reflected
in the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius, suggests
