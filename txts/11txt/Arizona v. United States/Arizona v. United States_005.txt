ARIZONA, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF



APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT



[June 25, 2012] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
To address pressing issues related to the large number
of aliens within its borders who do not have a lawful right
to be in this country, the State of Arizona in 2010 enacted
a statute called the Support Our Law Enforcement and
Safe Neighborhoods Act. The law is often referred to as
S. B. 1070, the version introduced in the state senate. See
also H. 2162 (2010) (amending S. 1070). Its stated pur­
pose is to “discourage and deter the unlawful entry and
presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlaw­
fully present in the United States.” Note following Ariz.
Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051 (West 2012). The law’s provi­
sions establish an official state policy of “attrition through
enforcement.” Ibid. The question before the Court is
whether federal law preempts and renders invalid four
separate provisions of the state law.
I
The United States filed this suit against Arizona, seek­
ing to enjoin S. B. 1070 as preempted. Four provisions of
the law are at issue here. Two create new state offenses.
Section 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien­
registration requirements a state misdemeanor. Ariz.
