Opinion of SCALIA, J.

forcement program envisions, will necessarily be deducted
from immigration enforcement. The President said at a
news conference that the new program is “the right thing
to do” in light of Congress’s failure to pass the Administra­
tion’s proposed revision of the Immigration Act.7 Perhaps
it is, though Arizona may not think so. But to say, as the
Court does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforc­
ing applications of the Immigration Act that the President
declines to enforce boggles the mind.
The Court opinion’s looming specter of inutterable hor­
ror—“[i]f §3 of the Arizona statute were valid, every State
could give itself independent authority to prosecute federal registration violations,” ante, at 10—seems to me not
so horrible and even less looming. But there has come to
pass, and is with us today, the specter that Arizona and
the States that support it predicted: A Federal Govern­
ment that does not want to enforce the immigration laws
as written, and leaves the States’ borders unprotected
against immigrants whom those laws would exclude. So
the issue is a stark one. Are the sovereign States at the
mercy of the Federal Executive’s refusal to enforce the
Nation’s immigration laws?
A good way of answering that question is to ask: Would
the States conceivably have entered into the Union if the
Constitution itself contained the Court’s holding? Today’s
judgment surely fails that test. At the Constitutional
Convention of 1787, the delegates contended with “the
jealousy of the states with regard to their sovereignty.” 1
Records of the Federal Convention 19 (M. Farrand ed.
1911) (statement of Edmund Randolph). Through ratifica­
tion of the fundamental charter that the Convention pro­
duced, the States ceded much of their sovereignty to the
Federal Government. But much of it remained jealously
