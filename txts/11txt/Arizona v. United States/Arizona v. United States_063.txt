ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of ALITO, J.

also that the officer who makes the stop subsequently
acquires reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver
entered the country illegally, which is a federal crime. See
8 U. S. C. §1325(a).
It is well established that state and local officers generally have authority to make stops and arrests for violations of federal criminal laws. See, e.g., Miller v. United
States, 357 U. S. 301, 305 (1958); United States v. Di Re,
332 U. S. 581, 589 (1948). I see no reason why this principle should not apply to immigration crimes as well. Lower
courts have so held. See, e.g., Estrada v. Rhode Island,
594 F. 3d 56, 65 (CA1 2010) (upholding the lawfulness of
a detention because the officer had an objectively reasonable belief that the arrestees “had committed immigration violations”); United States v. Vasquez-Alvarez, 176
F. 3d 1294, 1296 (CA10 1999) (noting that “state lawenforcement officers have the general authority to investigate and make arrests for violations of federal immigration laws”); Gonzales v. Peoria, 722 F. 2d 468, 475 (CA9
1983), overruled on other grounds, Hodgers-Durgin v. de
la Vina, 199 F. 3d 1037 (1999) (en banc) (holding that
“federal law does not preclude local enforcement of the
criminal provisions” of federal immigration law). And the
United States, consistent with the position long taken by
the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of
Justice, does not contend otherwise. See Brief for United
States 55, n. 33; see also Memorandum from OLC to the
Attorney General (Apr. 3, 2002), App. 268–273; Assistance
by State and Local Police in Apprehending Illegal Aliens,
20 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 26 (1996).
More importantly, no federal statute casts doubt on this
authority. To be sure, there are a handful of statutes that
purport to authorize state and local officers to make immigration-related arrests in certain situations. See, e.g., 8
U. S. C. §1103(a)(10) (providing for the extension of “any”
immigration enforcement authority to state and local
