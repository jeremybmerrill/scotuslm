sponded to more than one million requests for information
in 2009 alone. App. 93.
The United States argues that making status verifica­
tion mandatory interferes with the federal immigration
scheme. It is true that §2(B) does not allow state officers
to consider federal enforcement priorities in deciding
whether to contact ICE about someone they have de­
tained. See Brief for United States 47–50. In other words,
the officers must make an inquiry even in cases where it
seems unlikely that the Attorney General would have
the alien removed. This might be the case, for example,
when an alien is an elderly veteran with significant and
longstanding ties to the community. See 2011 ICE Memo­
randum 4–5 (mentioning these factors as relevant).
Congress has done nothing to suggest it is inappropriate
to communicate with ICE in these situations, however.
Indeed, it has encouraged the sharing of information about
possible immigration violations. See 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)
(10)(A). A federal statute regulating the public benefits
provided to qualified aliens in fact instructs that “no State
or local government entity may be prohibited, or in any
way restricted, from sending to or receiving from [ICE]
information regarding the immigration status, lawful or
unlawful, of an alien in the United States.” §1644. The
federal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring
state officials to contact ICE as a routine matter. Cf.
Whiting, 563 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 23–24) (reject­
ing argument that federal law preempted Arizona’s re­
quirement that employers determine whether employees
were eligible to work through the federal E-Verify system
where the Federal Government had encouraged its use).
