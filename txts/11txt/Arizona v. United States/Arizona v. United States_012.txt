ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of
state laws on the same subject.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator
Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); see English v. General
Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79 (1990).
Second, state laws are preempted when they conflict
with federal law. Crosby, supra, at 372. This includes
cases where “compliance with both federal and state
regulations is a physical impossibility,” Florida Lime &
Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142–143
(1963), and those instances where the challenged state law
“stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu­

Hines, 312 U. S., at 67; see also Crosby, supra, at 373
(“What is a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment, to
be informed by examining the federal statute as a whole
and identifying its purpose and intended effects”). In
preemption analysis, courts should assume that “the
historic police powers of the States” are not superseded
“unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Con­
gress.” Rice, supra, at 230; see Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.
555, 565 (2009).
The four challenged provisions of the state law each
must be examined under these preemption principles.

Section 3
Section 3 of S. B. 1070 creates a new state misdemeanor. It forbids the “willful failure to complete or carry an
alien registration document . . . in violation of 8 United
States Code section 1304(e) or 1306(a).” Ariz. Rev. Stat.
Ann. §11–1509(A) (West Supp. 2011). In effect, §3 adds a
state-law penalty for conduct proscribed by federal law.
The United States contends that this state enforcement
mechanism intrudes on the field of alien registration, a
field in which Congress has left no room for States to
