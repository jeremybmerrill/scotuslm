Opinion of the Court

and Refugee Law and Policy 115–132 (5th ed. 2009). This
authority rests, in part, on the National Government’s
constitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and its inherent power as sovereign to control and conduct relations
with foreign nations, see Toll, supra, at 10 (citing United
States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 318
(1936)).
The federal power to determine immigration policy is
well settled. Immigration policy can affect trade, invest­
ment, tourism, and diplomatic relations for the entire
Nation, as well as the perceptions and expectations of
aliens in this country who seek the full protection of its
laws. See, e.g., Brief for Argentina et al. as Amici Curiae;
see also Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580,
588–589 (1952). Perceived mistreatment of aliens in the
United States may lead to harmful reciprocal treatment
of American citizens abroad. See Brief for Madeleine K.
Albright et al. as Amici Curiae 24–30.
It is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about
the status, safety, and security of their nationals in the
United States must be able to confer and communicate on
this subject with one national sovereign, not the 50 sepa­
rate States. See Chy Lung v. Freeman, 92 U. S. 275, 279–
280 (1876); see also The Federalist No. 3, p. 39 (C. Rossiter
ed. 2003) (J. Jay) (observing that federal power would be
necessary in part because “bordering States . . . under the
impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of appar­
ent interest or injury” might take action that would un­
dermine foreign relations). This Court has reaffirmed that
“[o]ne of the most important and delicate of all interna­
tional relationships . . . has to do with the protection of the
just rights of a country’s own nationals when those na­
tionals are in another country.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312
U. S. 52, 64 (1941).
