Opinion of SCALIA, J.

What this case comes down to, then, is whether the
Arizona law conflicts with federal immigration law—
whether it excludes those whom federal law would admit,
or admits those whom federal law would exclude. It does
not purport to do so. It applies only to aliens who neither
possess a privilege to be present under federal law nor
have been removed pursuant to the Federal Government’s

provisions in detail.
§2(B)
“For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a
law enforcement official . . . in the enforcement of any
other law or ordinance of a county, city or town or this
state where reasonable suspicion exists that the per­
son is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United
States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when
practicable, to determine the immigration status of
the person, except if the determination may hinder or
obstruct an investigation. Any person who is arrested
shall have the person’s immigration status deter­

§2(B), as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B)
(West 2012).
The Government has conceded that “even before Section

United States 47 (citing App. 62, 82); see also Brief for
United States 48–49. That concession, in my view, obviates the need for further inquiry. The Government’s
conflict-pre-emption claim calls on us “to determine
whether, under the circumstances of this particular case,
[the State’s] law stands as an obstacle to the accomplish­
ment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of
