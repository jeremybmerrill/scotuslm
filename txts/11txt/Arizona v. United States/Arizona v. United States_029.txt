Opinion of the Court

The history of the United States is in part made of the
stories, talents, and lasting contributions of those who
crossed oceans and deserts to come here.
The National Government has significant power to
regulate immigration. With power comes responsibility,
and the sound exercise of national power over immigration
depends on the Nation’s meeting its responsibility to base
its laws on a political will informed by searching, thought­
ful, rational civic discourse. Arizona may have under­
standable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal
immigration while that process continues, but the State
may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.

The United States has established that §§3, 5(C), and 6
of S. B. 1070 are preempted. It was improper, however, to
enjoin §2(B) before the state courts had an opportunity to
construe it and without some showing that enforcement of
the provision in fact conflicts with federal immigration law
and its objectives.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
