Opinion of SCALIA, J.

truth, it was most likely expressive of what inaction ordi­
narily expresses: nothing at all. It is a “naïve assumption
that the failure of a bill to make it out of committee, or
to be adopted when reported to the floor, is the same
as a congressional rejection of what the bill contained.”

quotation marks and alterations omitted).

The brief for the Government in this case asserted that
“the Executive Branch’s ability to exercise discretion and
set priorities is particularly important because of the need
to allocate scarce enforcement resources wisely.” Brief for
United States 21. Of course there is no reason why the
Federal Executive’s need to allocate its scarce enforcement
resources should disable Arizona from devoting its re­
sources to illegal immigration in Arizona that in its view
the Federal Executive has given short shrift. Despite
Congress’s prescription that “the immigration laws of the
United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly,”
IRCA §115, 100 Stat. 3384, Arizona asserts without
contradiction and with supporting citations:
“[I]n the last decade federal enforcement efforts have
focused primarily on areas in California and Texas,
leaving Arizona’s border to suffer from comparative
neglect. The result has been the funneling of an in­
creasing tide of illegal border crossings into Arizona.
Indeed, over the past decade, over a third of the Na­
tion’s illegal border crossings occurred in Arizona.”
Brief for Petitioners 2–3 (footnote omitted).
Must Arizona’s ability to protect its borders yield to the
reality that Congress has provided inadequate funding for
federal enforcement—or, even worse, to the Executive’s
unwise targeting of that funding?
