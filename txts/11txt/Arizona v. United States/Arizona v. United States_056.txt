ARIZONA, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF



APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT



[June 25, 2012] 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
This case concerns four provisions of Arizona’s Support
Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, S. B.
1070. Section 2(B) requires Arizona law enforcement
officers to make a “reasonable attempt,” “when practicable,” to ascertain the immigration status of any person
whom an officer lawfully stops, detains, or arrests “where
reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and
is unlawfully present in the United States.” Ariz. Rev.
Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (West 2012). Section 3 provides
that an alien who willfully fails “to complete or carry an
alien registration document” in violation of 8 U. S. C.
§1304(e) or §1306(a) is guilty of a misdemeanor. Ariz. Rev.
Stat. Ann. §13–1509(A) (West Supp. 2011). Section 5(C)
makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien who
is unlawfully present in the United States “to knowingly
apply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform
work as an employee or independent contractor.” Ariz.
Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C). And §6 authorizes Arizona
law enforcement officers to arrest without a warrant any
person who an officer has probable cause to believe “has
committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§13–3883(A)(5).
I agree with the Court that §2(B) is not pre-empted.
