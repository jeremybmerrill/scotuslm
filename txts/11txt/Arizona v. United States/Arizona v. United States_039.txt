ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)
(emphasis added). It is impossible to make such a finding
without a factual record concerning the manner in which
Arizona is implementing these provisions—something the
Government’s pre-enforcement challenge has pretermitted.
“The fact that [a law] might operate unconstitutionally
under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not
recognized an ‘overbreadth’ doctrine outside the limited
context of the First Amendment.” United States v. Sal­
erno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). And on its face, §2(B)
merely tells state officials that they are authorized to do
something that they were, by the Government’s con­
cession, already authorized to do.
The Court therefore properly rejects the Government’s
challenge, recognizing that, “[a]t this stage, without the
benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts,
it would be inappropriate to assume §2B will be construed
in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.” Ante, at
23. Before reaching that conclusion, however, the Court
goes to great length to assuage fears that “state officers
will be required to delay the release of some detainees for
no reason other than to verify their immigration status.”
Ante, at 22. Of course, any investigatory detention, in­
cluding one under §2(B), may become an “unreasonable
. . . seizur[e],” U. S. Const., Amdt. IV, if it lasts too long.
See Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005). But
that has nothing to do with this case, in which the Gov­
ernment claims that §2(B) is pre-empted by federal immi­
gration law, not that anyone’s Fourth Amendment rights
have been violated. And I know of no reason why a
protracted detention that does not violate the Fourth
Amendment would contradict or conflict with any federal
immigration law.
