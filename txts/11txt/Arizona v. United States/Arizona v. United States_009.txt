Some discretionary decisions involve policy choices that
bear on this Nation’s international relations. Returning
an alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate
even where he has committed a removable offense or fails
to meet the criteria for admission. The foreign state may
be mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or
enduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien
or his family will be harmed upon return. The dynamic
nature of relations with other countries requires the Exec­
utive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are con­
sistent with this Nation’s foreign policy with respect to
these and other realities.
Agencies in the Department of Homeland Security play
a major role in enforcing the country’s immigration laws.
United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for determining the admissibility of aliens and
securing the country’s borders. See Dept. of Homeland
Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, Immigration
Enforcement Actions: 2010, p. 1 (2011). In 2010, CBP’s
Border Patrol apprehended almost half a million people.
