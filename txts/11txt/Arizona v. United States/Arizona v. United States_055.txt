ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full
purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines, supra, at 67.
I have explained that the “purposes and objectives” theory
of implied pre-emption is inconsistent with the Constitution because it invites courts to engage in freewheeling
speculation about congressional purpose that roams well
beyond statutory text. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 604 (opinion concurring in judgment); see also Williamson v. Mazda
Motor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–3); Haywood v.
Drown, 556 U. S. 729, 767 (2009) (dissenting opinion).
Under the Supremacy Clause, pre-emptive effect is to be
given to congressionally enacted laws, not to judicially
divined legislative purposes. See Wyeth, supra, at 604
(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, even assuming the existence of some tension between Arizona’s law
and the supposed “purposes and objectives” of Congress, I
would not hold that any of the provisions of the Arizona
law at issue here are pre-empted on that basis.
