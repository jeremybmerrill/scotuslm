ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

has brought suit against a sovereign State to challenge the
provision even before the law has gone into effect. There
is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how
it will be enforced. At this stage, without the benefit of a
definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be
inappropriate to assume §2(B) will be construed in a way
that creates a conflict with federal law. Cf. Fox v. Washington, 236 U. S. 273, 277 (1915) (“So far as statutes fairly
may be construed in such a way as to avoid doubtful con­
stitutional questions they should be so construed; and it is
to be presumed that state laws will be construed in that
way by the state courts” (citation omitted)). As a result,
the United States cannot prevail in its current challenge.
See Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440,
446 (1960) (“To hold otherwise would be to ignore the
teaching of this Court’s decisions which enjoin seeking out
conflicts between state and federal regulation where none
clearly exists”). This opinion does not foreclose other
preemption and constitutional challenges to the law as
interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.

Immigration policy shapes the destiny of the Nation.
On May 24, 2012, at one of this Nation’s most distin­
guished museums of history, a dozen immigrants stood
before the tattered flag that inspired Francis Scott Key
to write the National Anthem. There they took the oath
to become American citizens. The Smithsonian, News
Release, Smithsonian Citizenship Ceremony Welcomes
a Dozen New Americans (May 24, 2012), online at
http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases. These naturalization ceremonies bring together men and women of different ori­
gins who now share a common destiny. They swear a
common oath to renounce fidelity to foreign princes, to
defend the Constitution, and to bear arms on behalf of the
country when required by law. 8 CFR §337.1(a) (2012).
