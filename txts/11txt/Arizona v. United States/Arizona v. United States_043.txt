ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

[U. S. C.] §1304(e) or §1306(a).” S. B. 1070, §3(A), as
amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509(A).
It is beyond question that a State may make violation of
federal law a violation of state law as well. We have held
that to be so even when the interest protected is a distinc­
tively federal interest, such as protection of the dignity of
the national flag, see Halter v. Nebraska, 205 U. S. 34
(1907), or protection of the Federal Government’s ability
to recruit soldiers, Gilbert v. Minnesota, 254 U. S. 325
(1920). “[T]he State is not inhibited from making the national
purposes its own purposes to the extent of exerting its
police power to prevent its own citizens from obstructing
the accomplishment of such purposes.” Id., at 331 (inter­
nal quotation marks omitted). Much more is that so when,
as here, the State is protecting its own interest, the integ­
rity of its borders. And we have said that explicitly with
regard to illegal immigration: “Despite the exclusive fed­
eral control of this Nation’s borders, we cannot conclude
that the States are without any power to deter the influx
of persons entering the United States against federal law,
and whose numbers might have a discernible impact on
traditional state concerns.” Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202,
228, n. 23 (1982).
The Court’s opinion relies upon Hines v. Davidowitz,
supra. Ante, at 9–10. But that case did not, as the Court
believes, establish a “field preemption” that implicitly
eliminates the States’ sovereign power to exclude those
whom federal law excludes. It held that the States are not
permitted to establish “additional or auxiliary” registra­
tion requirements for aliens. 312 U. S., at 66–67. But §3
does not establish additional or auxiliary registration
requirements. It merely makes a violation of state law the
very same failure to register and failure to carry evidence
of registration that are violations of federal law. Hines
does not prevent the State from relying on the federal
