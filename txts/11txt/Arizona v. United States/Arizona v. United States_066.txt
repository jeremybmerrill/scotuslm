Opinion of ALITO, J.

Section 3
I agree that §3 is pre-empted because, like the Court, I
read the opinion in Hines to require that result. Although
there is some ambiguity in Hines, the Court largely spoke
in the language of field pre-emption. The Court explained
that where Congress “has enacted a complete scheme of
regulation and has therein provided a standard for the
registration of aliens, states cannot, inconsistently with
the purpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail
or complement, the federal law, or enforce additional or
auxiliary regulations.” 312 U. S., at 66–67. In finding the
Pennsylvania alien-registration law pre-empted, the Court
observed that Congress had “provided a standard for
alien registration in a single integrated and all-embracing
system” and that its intent was “to protect the personal
liberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform national registration system.” Id., at 74. If we credit our
holding in Hines that Congress has enacted “a single integrated and all-embracing system” of alien registration
and that States cannot “complement” that system or “enforce additional or auxiliary regulations,” id., at 66–67, 74,
then Arizona’s attempt to impose additional, state-law
penalties for violations of federal registration requirements must be invalidated.
Section 5(C)
While I agree that §3 is pre-empted, I disagree with the
Court’s decision to strike down §5(C). I do so in large
measure because the Court fails to give the same solicitude to our decision in De Canas, 424 U. S. 351, as it is
willing to give our decision in Hines. In De Canas, the
Court upheld against a pre-emption challenge a state law
imposing fines on employers that hired aliens who were
—————— 

anticipate that most, if not all, States will eventually issue forms of



identification that suffice to establish lawful presence under §2(B).
