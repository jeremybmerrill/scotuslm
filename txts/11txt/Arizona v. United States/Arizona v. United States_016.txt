ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

B
Section 5(C)
Unlike §3, which replicates federal statutory require­
ments, §5(C) enacts a state criminal prohibition where no
federal counterpart exists. The provision makes it a state
misdemeanor for “an unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform
work as an employee or independent contractor” in Ari­
zona. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C) (West Supp. 2011).
Violations can be punished by a $2,500 fine and incarcera­
tion for up to six months. See §13–2928(F); see also
§§13–707(A)(1) (West 2010); 13–802(A); 13–902(A)(5). The
United States contends that the provision upsets the balance struck by the Immigration Reform and Control Act
of 1986 (IRCA) and must be preempted as an obstacle
to the federal plan of regulation and control.
When there was no comprehensive federal program
regulating the employment of unauthorized aliens, this
Court found that a State had authority to pass its own
laws on the subject. In 1971, for example, California
passed a law imposing civil penalties on the employment
of aliens who were “not entitled to lawful residence in the
United States if such employment would have an adverse
effect on lawful resident workers.” 1971 Cal. Stats. ch.
1442, §1(a). The law was upheld against a preemption
challenge in De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351 (1976). De
Canas recognized that “States possess broad authority
under their police powers to regulate the employment
relationship to protect workers within the State.” Id., at
356. At that point, however, the Federal Government had
expressed no more than “a peripheral concern with [the]
employment of illegal entrants.” Id., at 360; see Whiting,
563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).
Current federal law is substantially different from the
regime that prevailed when De Canas was decided. Con­
gress enacted IRCA as a comprehensive framework for
