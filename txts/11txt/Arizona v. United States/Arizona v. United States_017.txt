Opinion of the Court

“combating the employment of illegal aliens.” Hoffman
Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U. S. 137, 147
(2002). The law makes it illegal for employers to know­
ingly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized
workers. See 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2). It also
requires every employer to verify the employment authori­
zation status of prospective employees. See §§1324a(a)
(1)(B), (b); 8 CFR §274a.2(b) (2012). These requirements
are enforced through criminal penalties and an escalat­
ing series of civil penalties tied to the number of times
an employer has violated the provisions. See 8 U. S. C.
§§1324a(e)(4), (f); 8 CFR §274a.10.
This comprehensive framework does not impose federal
criminal sanctions on the employee side (i.e., penalties on
aliens who seek or engage in unauthorized work). Under
federal law some civil penalties are imposed instead. With
certain exceptions, aliens who accept unlawful employ­
ment are not eligible to have their status adjusted to
that of a lawful permanent resident. See 8 U. S. C.
§§1255(c)(2), (c)(8). Aliens also may be removed from the
country for having engaged in unauthorized work. See
§1227(a)(1)(C)(i); 8 CFR §214.1(e). In addition to specify­
ing these civil consequences, federal law makes it a crime
for unauthorized workers to obtain employment through
fraudulent means. See 18 U. S. C. §1546(b). Congress has
made clear, however, that any information employees
submit to indicate their work status “may not be used” for
purposes other than prosecution under specified federal
criminal statutes for fraud, perjury, and related conduct.
See 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(b)(5), (d)(2)(F)–(G).
The legislative background of IRCA underscores the fact
that Congress made a deliberate choice not to impose crim­

inal penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthor­
ized employment. A commission established by Congress
to study immigration policy and to make recommen­
dations concluded these penalties would be “unnecessary
