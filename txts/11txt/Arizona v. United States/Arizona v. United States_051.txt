ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

guarded—as reflected in the innumerable proposals that
never left Independence Hall. Now, imagine a provision—
perhaps inserted right after Art. I, §8, cl. 4, the Naturali­
zation Clause—which included among the enumerated
powers of Congress “To establish Limitations upon Immi­
gration that will be exclusive and that will be enforced
only to the extent the President deems appropriate.” The
delegates to the Grand Convention would have rushed to
the exits.
As is often the case, discussion of the dry legalities that
are the proper object of our attention suppresses the very
human realities that gave rise to the suit. Arizona bears
the brunt of the country’s illegal immigration problem. Its
citizens feel themselves under siege by large numbers of
illegal immigrants who invade their property, strain their
social services, and even place their lives in jeopardy.
Federal officials have been unable to remedy the problem,
and indeed have recently shown that they are unwilling to
do so. Thousands of Arizona’s estimated 400,000 illegal
immigrants—including not just children but men and
women under 30—are now assured immunity from en­
forcement, and will be able to compete openly with Ari­
zona citizens for employment.
Arizona has moved to protect its sovereignty—not in
contradiction of federal law, but in complete compliance
with it. The laws under challenge here do not extend or
revise federal immigration restrictions, but merely enforce
those restrictions more effectively. If securing its territory
in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we
should cease referring to it as a sovereign State. I dissent.
