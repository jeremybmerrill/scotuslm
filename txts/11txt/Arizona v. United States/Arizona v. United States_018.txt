ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

and unworkable.” U. S. Immigration Policy and the Na­
tional Interest: The Final Report and Recommendations of
the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy
with Supplemental Views by Commissioners 65–66 (1981);
see Pub. L. 95–412, §4, 92 Stat. 907. Proposals to make
unauthorized work a criminal offense were debated and
discussed during the long process of drafting IRCA. See
Brief for Service Employees International Union et al. as
Amici Curiae 9–12. But Congress rejected them. See, e.g.,
119 Cong. Rec. 14184 (1973) (statement of Rep. Dennis).
In the end, IRCA’s framework reflects a considered judg­
ment that making criminals out of aliens engaged in
unauthorized work—aliens who already face the possibil­
ity of employer exploitation because of their removable
status—would be inconsistent with federal policy and objectives. See, e.g., Hearings before the Subcommittee
No. 1 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 92d Cong.,
1st Sess., pt. 3, pp. 919–920 (1971) (statement of Rep.
Rodino, the eventual sponsor of IRCA in the House of
Representatives).
IRCA’s express preemption provision, which in most
instances bars States from imposing penalties on employ­
ers of unauthorized aliens, is silent about whether addi­
tional penalties may be imposed against the employees
themselves. See 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2); Whiting, supra,
at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2). But the existence of an “ex­
press pre-emption provisio[n] does not bar the ordinary
working of conflict pre-emption principles” or impose a
“special burden” that would make it more difficult to
establish the preemption of laws falling outside the clause.

The ordinary principles of preemption include the well­
settled proposition that a state law is preempted where it
“stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and exe­
