Opinion of SCALIA, J.

§6
“A peace officer, without a warrant, may arrest a per­
son if the officer has probable cause to believe . . .
[t]he person to be arrested has committed any public
offense that makes the person removable from the
United States.” S. B. 1070, §6(A)(5), Ariz. Rev. Stat.
Ann. §13–3883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011).
This provision of S. B. 1070 expands the statutory list of
offenses for which an Arizona police officer may make an
arrest without a warrant. See §13–3883. If an officer has
probable cause to believe that an individual is “removable”
by reason of a public offense, then a warrant is not re­
quired to make an arrest. The Government’s primary
contention is that §6 is pre-empted by federal immigration
law because it allows state officials to make arrests “with­
out regard to federal priorities.” Brief for United States
53. The Court’s opinion focuses on limits that Congress
has placed on federal officials’ authority to arrest remov­
able aliens and the possibility that state officials will
make arrests “to achieve [Arizona’s] own immigration policy”
and “without any input from the Federal Government.”
Ante, at 17.
Of course on this pre-enforcement record there is no
reason to assume that Arizona officials will ignore federal
immigration policy (unless it be the questionable policy of
not wanting to identify illegal aliens who have committed
offenses that make them removable). As Arizona points
out, federal law expressly provides that state officers may
“cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification,
apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully
present in the United States,” 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(B);
and “cooperation” requires neither identical efforts nor
prior federal approval. It is consistent with the Arizona
statute, and with the “cooperat[ive]” system that Congress
has created, for state officials to arrest a removable alien,
