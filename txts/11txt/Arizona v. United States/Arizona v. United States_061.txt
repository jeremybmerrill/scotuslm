ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of ALITO, J.

requirement is not contrary to federal law because the
Federal Government retains the discretion that matters
most––that is, the discretion to enforce the law in particular cases. If an Arizona officer contacts the Federal
Government to verify a person’s immigration status and
federal records reveal that the person is in the country unlawfully, the Federal Government decides, presumably based on its enforcement priorities, whether to have
the person released or transferred to federal custody.
Enforcement discretion thus lies with the Federal Government, not with Arizona. Nothing in §2(B) suggests
otherwise.
The United States’ attack on §2(B) is quite remarkable.
The United States suggests that a state law may be preempted, not because it conflicts with a federal statute or
regulation, but because it is inconsistent with a federal
agency’s current enforcement priorities. Those priorities,
however, are not law. They are nothing more than agency
policy. I am aware of no decision of this Court recognizing
that mere policy can have pre-emptive force. Cf. Barclays
Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., 512 U. S. 298, 330
(1994) (holding that “Executive Branch communications
that express federal policy but lack the force of law cannot
render unconstitutional” an “otherwise valid, congressionally condoned” state law). If §2(B) were pre-empted at
the present time because it is out of sync with the Federal
Government’s current priorities, would it be unpre-empted
at some time in the future if the agency’s priorities
changed?
Like most law enforcement agencies, ICE does not set
out inflexible rules for its officers to follow. To the contrary, it provides a list of factors to guide its officers’
enforcement discretion on a case-by-case basis. See Memorandum from John Morton, Director, ICE, to All Field
Office Directors et al., p. 4 (June 17, 2011) (“This list is not
exhaustive and no one factor is determinative. ICE offi-
