ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1038 (1984). If the police stop
someone based on nothing more than possible removabil­
ity, the usual predicate for an arrest is absent. When an
alien is suspected of being removable, a federal official
issues an administrative document called a Notice to Ap­
pear. See 8 U. S. C. §1229(a); 8 CFR §239.1(a) (2012).
The form does not authorize an arrest. Instead, it gives
the alien information about the proceedings, including the
time and date of the removal hearing. See 8 U. S. C.
§1229(a)(1). If an alien fails to appear, an in absentia
order may direct removal. §1229a(5)(A).
The federal statutory structure instructs when it is ap­
propriate to arrest an alien during the removal process.
For example, the Attorney General can exercise discretion
to issue a warrant for an alien’s arrest and detention
“pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed
from the United States.” 8 U. S. C. §1226(a); see Memo­
randum from John Morton, Director, ICE, to All Field
Office Directors et al., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion
Consistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Prior­
ities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and
Removal of Aliens (June 17, 2011) (hereinafter 2011 ICE
Memorandum) (describing factors informing this and re­
lated decisions). And if an alien is ordered removed after
a hearing, the Attorney General will issue a warrant.
See 8 CFR §241.2(a)(1). In both instances, the warrants
are executed by federal officers who have received training
in the enforcement of immigration law. See §§241.2(b),
287.5(e)(3). If no federal warrant has been issued, those
officers have more limited authority. See 8 U. S. C. §1357(a).
They may arrest an alien for being “in the United
States in violation of any [immigration] law or regulation,” for example, but only where the alien “is likely to
escape before a warrant can be obtained.” §1357(a)(2).
Section 6 attempts to provide state officers even greater
authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible remova­
