ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

immigration” in the first 100 years of the Republic, the
States enacted numerous laws restricting the immigration of certain classes of aliens, including convicted crimi­
nals, indigents, persons with contagious diseases, and (in
Southern States) freed blacks. Neuman, The Lost Century
of American Immigration (1776–1875), 93 Colum. L. Rev.
1833, 1835, 1841–1880 (1993). State laws not only pro­
vided for the removal of unwanted immigrants but also
imposed penalties on unlawfully present aliens and those
who aided their immigration.2 Id., at 1883.
In fact, the controversy surrounding the Alien and
Sedition Acts involved a debate over whether, under the
Constitution, the States had exclusive authority to enact
such immigration laws. Criticism of the Sedition Act has
become a prominent feature of our First Amendment
jurisprudence, see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U. S. 254, 273–276 (1964), but one of the Alien Acts3
also aroused controversy at the time:
“Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa­
tives of the United States of America in Congress as­
sembled, That it shall be lawful for the President of
the United States at any time during the continuance
of this act, to order all such aliens as he shall judge
dangerous to the peace and safety of the United
States, or shall have reasonable grounds to suspect
are concerned in any treasonable or secret machina­
tions against the government thereof, to depart out of
the territory of the United States . . . .” An Act con­
cerning Aliens, 1 Stat. 570, 570–571.

2 E.g., Va. Code Tit. 54, ch. 198, §39 (1849) (“If a master of a vessel or
other person, knowingly, import or bring into this state, from any place
out of the United States, any person convicted of crime . . . he shall be
confined in jail for three months, and be fined one hundred dollars”).
3 There were two Alien Acts, one of which dealt only with enemy
aliens. An Act respecting Alien Enemies, 1 Stat. 577.
