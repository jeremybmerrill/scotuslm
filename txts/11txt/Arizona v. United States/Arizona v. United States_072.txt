Opinion of ALITO, J.

lawfully present in the United States.” It goes without
saying that state and local officers could not provide
meaningful cooperation in the apprehension, detention,
and ultimate removal of criminal aliens without some
power to make arrests.
Although §1357(g)(10) contemplates state and local
authority to apprehend criminal aliens for the purpose of
removal, the Court rejects out of hand any possibility that
officers could exercise that authority without federal
direction. Despite acknowledging that there is “ambiguity
as to what constitutes cooperation,” the Court says that
“no coherent understanding of the term would incorporate
the unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an alien
for being removable absent any request, approval, or other
instruction from the Federal Government.” Ante, at 18.
The Court adopts an unnecessarily stunted view of cooperation. No one would say that a state or local officer
has failed to cooperate by making an on-the-spot arrest to
enforce federal law. Unsolicited aid is not necessarily
uncooperative.
To be sure, were an officer to persist in making an arrest that the officer knows is unwanted, such conduct
would not count as cooperation. But nothing in the relevant federal statutes suggests that Congress does not
want aliens who have committed removable offenses to be
arrested.2 To the contrary, §1226(c)(1) commands that the
Executive “shall take into custody any alien” who is deportable for having committed a specified offense. And
§1226(c)(2) substantially limits the circumstances under
which the Executive has discretion to release aliens held
in custody under paragraph (1). So if an officer arrests an
alien who is removable for having committed one of the
crimes listed in §1226(c)(1), the Federal Government is
——————
2 That goes for the Executive Branch as well, which has made the
apprehension and removal of criminal aliens a priority. See App. 108.
