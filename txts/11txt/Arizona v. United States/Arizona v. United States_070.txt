Opinion of ALITO, J.

(slip op., at 22) (internal quotation marks omitted). I do
not believe the United States has surmounted that barrier
here.
Section 6
I also disagree with the Court’s decision that §6 is preempted. This provision adds little to the authority that
Arizona officers already possess, and whatever additional
authority it confers is consistent with federal law. Section
6 amended an Arizona statute that authorizes warrantless
arrests. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13–3883 (West 2010). Before §6 was added, that statute already permitted arrests
without a warrant for felonies, misdemeanors committed
in the arresting officer’s presence, petty offenses, and
certain traffic-related criminal violations.
See §§13–
3883(A)(1)–(4). Largely duplicating the authority already
conferred by these prior subsections, §6 added a new
subsection, §13–3883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011), that authorizes officers to make warrantless arrests on probable
cause that the arrestee has committed a “public offense”
for which the arrestee is removable from the United
States. A “public offense” is defined as conduct that is
punishable by imprisonment or a fine according to the law
of the State where the conduct occurred and that would be
punishable under Arizona law had the conduct occurred in
Arizona. See §13–105(27).
In what way, if any, does §6 enlarge the arrest authority
of Arizona officers? It has been suggested that §6 confers
new authority in the following three circumstances: (1)
where the arrestee committed but has not been charged
with committing an offense in another State; (2) where the
officer has probable cause to believe the arrestee committed an offense for which he was previously arrested but
not prosecuted; and (3) where the arrestee committed but
has already served the sentence for a removable offense.
