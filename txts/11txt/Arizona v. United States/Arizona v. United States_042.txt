Opinion of SCALIA, J.

tations than there is to read them as implying that only
federal officials may arrest removable aliens. And in any
event neither implication would constitute the sort of clear
elimination of the States’ sovereign power that our cases
demand.
The Court raises concerns about “unnecessary harass­
ment of some aliens . . . whom federal officials determine
should not be removed.” Ante, at 17. But we have no
license to assume, without any support in the record, that
Arizona officials would use their arrest authority under §6
to harass anyone. And it makes no difference that federal
officials might “determine [that some unlawfully present
aliens] should not be removed,” ibid. They may well de­
termine not to remove from the United States aliens who
have no right to be here; but unless and until these aliens
have been given the right to remain, Arizona is entitled to
arrest them and at least bring them to federal officials’
attention, which is all that §6 necessarily entails. (In my
view, the State can go further than this, and punish them
for their unlawful entry and presence in Arizona.)
The Government complains that state officials might not
heed “federal priorities.” Indeed they might not, particu­
larly if those priorities include willful blindness or deliberate inattention to the presence of removable aliens in
Arizona. The State’s whole complaint—the reason this
law was passed and this case has arisen—is that the
citizens of Arizona believe federal priorities are too lax.
The State has the sovereign power to protect its borders
more rigorously if it wishes, absent any valid federal
prohibition. The Executive’s policy choice of lax federal
enforcement does not constitute such a prohibition.
