ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

more severely than a violation of federal law. Especially
where (as here) the State is defending its own sovereign
interests, there is no precedent for such a limitation. The
sale of illegal drugs, for example, ordinarily violates state
law as well as federal law, and no one thinks that the
state penalties cannot exceed the federal. As I have dis­
cussed, moreover, “field preemption” cannot establish a
prohibition of additional state penalties in the area of
immigration.
Finally, the Government also suggests that §3 poses an
obstacle to the administration of federal immigration law,
see Brief for United States 31–33, but “there is no conflict
in terms, and no possibility of such conflict, [if] the state
statute makes federal law its own,” California v. Zook, 336
U. S. 725, 735 (1949).
It holds no fear for me, as it does for the Court, that
“[w]ere §3 to come into force, the State would have the
power to bring criminal charges against individuals for
violating a federal law even in circumstances where federal officials in charge of the comprehensive scheme de­
termine that prosecution would frustrate federal policies.”
Ante, at 11. That seems to me entirely appropriate when
the State uses the federal law (as it must) as the criterion
for the exercise of its own power, and the implementation
of its own policies of excluding those who do not belong
there. What I do fear—and what Arizona and the States
that support it fear—is that “federal policies” of nonen­
forcement will leave the States helpless before those evil
effects of illegal immigration that the Court’s opinion
dutifully recites in its prologue (ante, at 6) but leaves
unremedied in its disposition.
