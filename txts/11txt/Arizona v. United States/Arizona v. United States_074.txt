Opinion of ALITO, J.

statutory grant of discretion in §1226(a) somehow indicates a congressional desire to pre-empt unilateral state
and local authority to arrest criminal aliens covered by
that provision, §6 is not pre-empted on its face given its
substantial overlap with §1226(c)(1).
It bears emphasizing that §6 does not mandate the
warrantless apprehension of all aliens who have committed crimes for which they are removable. Instead, it only
grants state and local officers permission to make such
arrests. The trouble with this premature, facial challenge
is that it affords Arizona no opportunity to implement
its law in a way that would avoid any potential conflicts
with federal law. For example, Arizona could promulgate
guidelines or regulations limiting the arrest authority
conferred by §6 to the crimes specified in §1226(c)(1). And
to the extent §1226(c)(1) is unclear about which exact
crimes are covered,3 Arizona could go even further and
identify specific crimes for which there is no doubt an
alien would be removable. The point is that there are
plenty of permissible applications of §6, and the Court
should not invalidate the statute at this point without at
least some indication that Arizona has implemented it in a
manner at odds with Congress’ clear and manifest intent.
We have said that a facial challenge to a statute is “the
most difficult challenge to mount successfully” because “the
challenger must establish that no set of circumstances
exists under which the [statute] would be valid.” United
States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987); see also
Anderson v. Edwards, 514 U. S. 143, 155, n. 6 (1995)
(applying the Salerno standard in a pre-emption case). As
to §6, I do not believe the United States has carried that

readily admit that it can be difficult to determine whether a
particular conviction will necessarily make an alien removable. See
Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (ALITO, J., concurring in
judgment) (slip op., at 4).
