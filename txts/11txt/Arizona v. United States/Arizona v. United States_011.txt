analysis that follows. The issue is whether, under pre­
emption principles, federal law permits Arizona to imple­
ment the state-law provisions in dispute.
III
Federalism, central to the constitutional design, adopts
the principle that both the National and State Govern­
ments have elements of sovereignty the other is bound to
respect. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457
(1991); U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,
838 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). From the existence
of two sovereigns follows the possibility that laws can be
in conflict or at cross-purposes. The Supremacy Clause
provides a clear rule that federal law “shall be the su­
preme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State
shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or
Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”
Art. VI, cl. 2. Under this principle, Congress has the
power to preempt state law. See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000); Gibbons
v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210–211 (1824). There is no doubt
that Congress may withdraw specified powers from the
States by enacting a statute containing an express
preemption provision. See, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of
United States of America v. Whiting, 563 U. S. ___, ___
(2011) (slip op., at 4).
State law must also give way to federal law in at least
two other circumstances. First, the States are precluded
from regulating conduct in a field that Congress, acting
within its proper authority, has determined must be regu­
lated by its exclusive governance. See Gade v. National
Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 115 (1992).
The intent to displace state law altogether can be inferred
from a framework of regulation “so pervasive . . . that
Congress left no room for the States to supplement it” or
where there is a “federal interest . . . so dominant that the
