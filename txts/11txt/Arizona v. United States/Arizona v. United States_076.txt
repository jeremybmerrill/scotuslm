Opinion of ALITO, J.

Where a state or local officer makes a warrantless arrest
to enforce federal law, we said that “the lawfulness of the
arrest without warrant is to be determined by reference to
state law.” Id., at 305. Under §6, an Arizona officer may
be authorized to make an arrest that a federal officer may
not be authorized to make under §1357(a)(2). As Miller
makes clear, that fact alone does not render arrests by
state or local officers pursuant to §6 unlawful. Nor does it
manifest a clear congressional intent to displace the exercise of state police powers that are brought to bear in aid
of federal law.
