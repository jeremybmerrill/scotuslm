ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of ALITO, J.

heavy burden.
B
Finally, the Court tells us that §6 conflicts with federal
law because it provides state and local officers with “even
greater authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible
removability than Congress has given to trained federal
immigration officers.” Ante, at 16–17. The Court points to
8 U. S. C. §1357(a)(2), which empowers “authorized” officers and employees of ICE to make arrests without a federal warrant if “the alien so arrested is in the United States
in violation of any [immigration] law or regulation and is
likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his
arrest.” Because §6 would allow Arizona officers to make
arrests “regardless of whether a federal warrant has
issued or the alien is likely to escape,” ante, at 17, the
Court concludes that §6 is an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress’ objectives. But §6 is an obstacle only to
the extent it conflicts with Congress’ clear and manifest
intent to preclude state and local officers from making
arrests except where a federal warrant has issued or the
arrestee is likely to escape. By granting warrantless
arrest authority to federal officers, Congress has not manifested an unmistakable intent to strip state and local
officers of their warrantless arrest authority under state
law.
Likewise, limitations on federal arrest authority do not
mean that the arrest authority of state and local officers
must be similarly limited. Our opinion in Miller, 357 U. S.
301, is instructive. In that case, a District of Columbia
officer, accompanied by a federal officer, made an arrest
based on a suspected federal narcotics offense. Id., at
303–304. The federal officer did not have statutory authorization to arrest without a warrant, but the local
officer did. Id., at 305. We held that District of Columbia
law dictated the lawfulness of the arrest. Id., at 305–306.
