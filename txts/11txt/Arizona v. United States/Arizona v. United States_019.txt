Opinion of the Court

cution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.”
Hines, 312 U. S., at 67. Under §5(C) of S. B. 1070, Arizona
law would interfere with the careful balance struck by
Congress with respect to unauthorized employment of
aliens. Although §5(C) attempts to achieve one of the
same goals as federal law—the deterrence of unlawful
employment—it involves a conflict in the method of en­
forcement. The Court has recognized that a “[c]onflict
in technique can be fully as disruptive to the system Con­
gress enacted as conflict in overt policy.” Motor Coach
Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 287 (1971). The
correct instruction to draw from the text, structure, and
history of IRCA is that Congress decided it would be inap­
propriate to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek
or engage in unauthorized employment. It follows that a
state law to the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory
system Congress chose. See Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., 485 U. S. 495, 503
(1988) (“Where a comprehensive federal scheme intention­
ally leaves a portion of the regulated field without con­
trols, then the pre-emptive inference can be drawn—not
from federal inaction alone, but from inaction joined with
action”). Section 5(C) is preempted by federal law.

Section 6
Section 6 of S. B. 1070 provides that a state officer,
“without a warrant, may arrest a person if the officer has
probable cause to believe . . . [the person] has committed
any public offense that makes [him] removable from the
United States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–3883(A)(5)
(West Supp. 2011). The United States argues that arrests
authorized by this statute would be an obstacle to the
removal system Congress created.
As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien
to remain present in the United States. See INS v. Lopez-
