ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of ALITO, J.

That provision does not authorize or require Arizona law
enforcement officers to do anything they are not already
allowed to do under existing federal law. The United
States’ argument that §2(B) is pre-empted, not by any
federal statute or regulation, but simply by the Executive’s
current enforcement policy is an astounding assertion of
federal executive power that the Court rightly rejects.
I also agree with the Court that §3 is pre-empted by
virtue of our decision in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S.
52 (1941). Our conclusion in that case that Congress had
enacted an “all-embracing system” of alien registration
and that States cannot “enforce additional or auxiliary
regulations,” id., at 66–67, 74, forecloses Arizona’s attempt
here to impose additional, state-law penalties for violations of the federal registration scheme.
While I agree with the Court on §2(B) and §3, I part
ways on §5(C) and §6. The Court’s holding on §5(C) is
inconsistent with De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351 (1976),
which held that employment regulation, even of aliens
unlawfully present in the country, is an area of traditional
state concern. Because state police powers are implicated
here, our precedents require us to presume that federal
law does not displace state law unless Congress’ intent to
do so is clear and manifest. I do not believe Congress has
spoken with the requisite clarity to justify invalidation of
§5(C). Nor do I believe that §6 is invalid. Like §2(B), §6
adds virtually nothing to the authority that Arizona law
enforcement officers already exercise. And whatever little
authority they have gained is consistent with federal law.
Section 2(B)
A
Although §2(B) of the Arizona law has occasioned much
controversy, it adds nothing to the authority that Arizona
law enforcement officers, like officers in all other States,
already possess under federal law. For that reason, I
