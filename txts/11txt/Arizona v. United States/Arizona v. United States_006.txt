ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509 (West Supp. 2011). Section 5, in
relevant part, makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthor­
ized alien to seek or engage in work in the State; this
provision is referred to as §5(C). See §13–2928(C). Two
other provisions give specific arrest authority and investigative duties with respect to certain aliens to state and
local law enforcement officers. Section 6 authorizes offic­
ers to arrest without a warrant a person “the officer has
probable cause to believe . . . has committed any public
offense that makes the person removable from the United
States.” §13–3883(A)(5). Section 2(B) provides that offic­
ers who conduct a stop, detention, or arrest must in some
circumstances make efforts to verify the person’s immi­
gration status with the Federal Government. See §11–
1051(B) (West 2012).
The United States District Court for the District of
Arizona issued a preliminary injunction preventing the
four provisions at issue from taking effect. 703 F. Supp.
2d 980, 1008 (2010). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit affirmed. 641 F. 3d 339, 366 (2011). It agreed that
the United States had established a likelihood of success
on its preemption claims. The Court of Appeals was unan­
imous in its conclusion that §§3 and 5(C) were likely
preempted. Judge Bea dissented from the decision to
uphold the preliminary injunction against §§2(B) and 6.
This Court granted certiorari to resolve important ques­
tions concerning the interaction of state and federal power
with respect to the law of immigration and alien status.

The Government of the United States has broad, un­
doubted power over the subject of immigration and the
status of aliens. See Toll v. Moreno, 458 U. S. 1, 10 (1982);
