ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

(characterizing Hines as a field preemption case); Pennsylvania v. Nelson, 350 U. S. 497, 504 (1956) (same); see also
Dinh, Reassessing the Law of Preemption, 88 Geo. L. J.
2085, 2098–2099, 2107 (2000) (same). The federal statu­
tory directives provide a full set of standards governing
alien registration, including the punishment for noncom­
pliance. It was designed as a “ ‘harmonious whole.’ ”
Hines, supra, at 72. Where Congress occupies an entire
field, as it has in the field of alien registration, even com­
plementary state regulation is impermissible. Field pre­
emption reflects a congressional decision to foreclose any
state regulation in the area, even if it is parallel to federal standards. See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464
U. S. 238, 249 (1984).
Federal law makes a single sovereign responsible for
maintaining a comprehensive and unified system to keep
track of aliens within the Nation’s borders. If §3 of the
Arizona statute were valid, every State could give itself
independent authority to prosecute federal registration
violations, “diminish[ing] the [Federal Government]’s control
over enforcement” and “detract[ing] from the ‘integrated
scheme of regulation’ created by Congress.” Wisconsin
Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 288–289
(1986). Even if a State may make violation of federal
law a crime in some instances, it cannot do so in a field
(like the field of alien registration) that has been occupied
by federal law. See California v. Zook, 336 U. S. 725, 730–
731, 733 (1949); see also In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372, 375–
376 (1890) (States may not impose their own punishment
for perjury in federal courts).
Arizona contends that §3 can survive preemption be­
cause the provision has the same aim as federal law and
adopts its substantive standards. This argument not only
ignores the basic premise of field preemption—that States
may not enter, in any respect, an area the Federal Gov­
ernment has reserved for itself—but also is unpersuasive
