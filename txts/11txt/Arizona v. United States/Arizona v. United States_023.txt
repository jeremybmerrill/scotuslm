Opinion of the Court

with federal officers, provide operational support in exe­
cuting a warrant, or allow federal immigration officials
to gain access to detainees held in state facilities. See
Dept. of Homeland Security, Guidance on State and Local
Governments’ Assistance in Immigration Enforcement
and Related Matters 13–14 (2011), online at http://
www.dhs.gov/files/resources/immigration.shtm (all Inter­
net materials as visited June 21, 2012, and available in
Clerk of Court’s case file). State officials can also assist
the Federal Government by responding to requests for
information about when an alien will be released from
their custody. See §1357(d). But the unilateral state
action to detain authorized by §6 goes far beyond these
measures, defeating any need for real cooperation.
Congress has put in place a system in which state offic­
ers may not make warrantless arrests of aliens based on
possible removability except in specific, limited circum­
stances. By nonetheless authorizing state and local officers to engage in these enforcement activities as a general
matter, §6 creates an obstacle to the full purposes and
objectives of Congress. See Hines, 312 U. S., at 67. Sec­
tion 6 is preempted by federal law.

Section 2(B)
Section 2(B) of S. B. 1070 requires state officers to make
a “reasonable attempt . . . to determine the immigration
status” of any person they stop, detain, or arrest on some
other legitimate basis if “reasonable suspicion exists that
the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the
United States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (West
2012). The law also provides that “[a]ny person who is
arrested shall have the person’s immigration status de­
termined before the person is released.” Ibid. The accepted
way to perform these status checks is to contact ICE,
which maintains a database of immigration records.
