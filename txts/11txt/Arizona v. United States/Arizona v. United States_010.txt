ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

B
The pervasiveness of federal regulation does not di­
minish the importance of immigration policy to the States.
Arizona bears many of the consequences of unlawful im­
migration. Hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens
are apprehended in Arizona each year. Dept. of Homeland
Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, 2010 Yearbook
of Immigration Statistics 93 (2011) (Table 35). Unauthor­
ized aliens who remain in the State comprise, by one estimate, almost six percent of the population. See Passel
& Cohn, Pew Hispanic Center, U. S. Unauthorized Immigration Flows Are Down Sharply Since Mid-Decade 3
(2010). And in the State’s most populous county, these
aliens are reported to be responsible for a disproportionate
share of serious crime. See, e.g., Camarota & Vaughan,
Center for Immigration Studies, Immigration and Crime:

population and are responsible for 21.8% of the felonies in
Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix).
Statistics alone do not capture the full extent of Arizo­

“epidemic of crime, safety risks, serious property damage,
and environmental problems” associated with the influx
of illegal migration across private land near the Mexican
border. Brief for Petitioners 6. Phoenix is a major city of
the United States, yet signs along an interstate highway
30 miles to the south warn the public to stay away. One
reads, “DANGER—PUBLIC WARNING—TRAVEL NOT
RECOMMENDED / Active Drug and Human Smuggling
Area / Visitors May Encounter Armed Criminals and
Smuggling Vehicles Traveling at High Rates of Speed.”
App. 170; see also Brief for Petitioners 5–6. The problems
posed to the State by illegal immigration must not be
underestimated.
These concerns are the background for the formal legal
