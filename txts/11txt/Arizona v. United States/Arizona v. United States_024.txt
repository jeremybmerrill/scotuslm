ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Three limits are built into the state provision. First, a
detainee is presumed not to be an alien unlawfully present
in the United States if he or she provides a valid Arizona
driver’s license or similar identification. Second, officers
“may not consider race, color or national origin . . . except
to the extent permitted by the United States [and] Ari­
zona Constitution[s].” Ibid. Third, the provisions must
be “implemented in a manner consistent with federal law
regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all
persons and respecting the privileges and immunities of
United States citizens.” §11–1051(L) (West 2012).
The United States and its amici contend that, even with
these limits, the State’s verification requirements pose an
obstacle to the framework Congress put in place. The first
concern is the mandatory nature of the status checks. The
second is the possibility of prolonged detention while the
checks are being performed.

important feature of the immigration system. Congress
has made clear that no formal agreement or special train­

with the [Federal Government] regarding the immigration
status of any individual, including reporting knowledge
that a particular alien is not lawfully present in the United
States.” 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(A). And Congress has
obligated ICE to respond to any request made by state
officials for verification of a person’s citizenship or immigration status. See §1373(c); see also §1226(d)(1)(A)
(requiring a system for determining whether individuals
arrested for aggravated felonies are aliens). ICE’s Law
Enforcement Support Center operates “24 hours a day,
seven days a week, 365 days a year” and provides, among
other things, “immigration status, identity information
and real-time assistance to local, state and federal law
