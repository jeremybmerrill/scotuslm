Opinion of SCALIA, J.

The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, written in denun­
ciation of these Acts, insisted that the power to exclude
unwanted aliens rested solely in the States. Jefferson’s
Kentucky Resolutions insisted “that alien friends are
under the jurisdiction and protection of the laws of the
state wherein they are [and] that no power over them has
been delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to
the individual states, distinct from their power over citi­
zens.” Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, reprinted in J. Powell,
Languages of Power: A Sourcebook of Early American
Constitutional History 131 (1991). Madison’s Virginia
Resolutions likewise contended that the Alien Act pur­
ported to give the President “a power nowhere delegated
to the federal government.” Virginia Resolutions of 1798,
reprinted in Powell, supra, at 134 (emphasis omitted).
Notably, moreover, the Federalist proponents of the Act
defended it primarily on the ground that “[t]he removal of
aliens is the usual preliminary of hostility” and could
therefore be justified in exercise of the Federal Govern­
ment’s war powers. Massachussets Resolutions in Reply
to Virginia, reprinted in Powell, supra, at 136.
In Mayor of New York v. Miln, this Court considered
a New York statute that required the commander of any
ship arriving in New York from abroad to disclose “the
name, place of birth, and last legal settlement, age and
occupation . . . of all passengers . . . with the intention of
proceeding to the said city.” 11 Pet., at 130–131. After
discussing the sovereign authority to regulate the en­
trance of foreigners described by De Vattel, the Court said:
“The power . . . of New York to pass this law having
undeniably existed at the formation of the constitu­
tion, the simply inquiry is, whether by that instru­
ment it was taken from the states, and granted to
congress; for if it were not, it yet remains with them.”
Id., at 132.
