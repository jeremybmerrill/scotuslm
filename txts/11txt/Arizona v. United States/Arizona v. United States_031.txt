ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

the state. There is nothing in all this, that does not
flow from the rights of domain and sovereignty: every
one is obliged to pay respect to the prohibition; and
whoever dares violate it, incurs the penalty decreed
to render it effectual.” The Law of Nations, bk. II,
ch. VII, §94, p. 309 (B. Kapossy & R. Whatmore eds.
2008).
See also I R. Phillimore, Commentaries upon Internation­
al Law, pt. III, ch. X, p. 233 (1854) (“It is a received maxim
of International Law that, the Government of a State may
prohibit the entrance of strangers into the country”).1
There is no doubt that “before the adoption of the consti­
tution of the United States” each State had the authority to “prevent [itself] from being burdened by an influx of
persons.” Mayor of New York v. Miln, 11 Pet. 102, 132–
133 (1837). And the Constitution did not strip the States
of that authority. To the contrary, two of the Constitu­
tion’s provisions were designed to enable the States to
prevent “the intrusion of obnoxious aliens through other
States.” Letter from James Madison to Edmund Randolph
(Aug. 27, 1782), in 1 The Writings of James Madison 226
(1900); accord, The Federalist No. 42, pp. 269–271 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The Articles of Confeder­

of the 17th-, 18th-, and 19th-century commentators main­
tained that states should exclude foreigners only for good reason.
Pufendorf, for example, maintained that states are generally expected
to grant “permanent settlement to strangers who have been driven
from their former home,” though acknowledging that, when faced with
the prospect of mass immigration, “every state may decide after its own
custom what privilege should be granted in such a situation.” 2 Of the
Law of Nature and Nations, bk. III, ch. III, §10, p. 366 (C. Oldfather &
W. Oldfather eds. 1934). See generally Cleveland, Powers Inherent in
Sovereignty: Indians, Aliens, Territories, and the Nineteenth Century
Origins of Plenary Power over Foreign Affairs, 81 Tex. L. Rev. 1, 83–87
(2002). But the authority to exclude was universally accepted as
inherent in sovereignty, whatever prudential limitations there might be
on its exercise.
