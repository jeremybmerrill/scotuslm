COLEMAN v. JOHNSON
Per Curiam

143. On cross-examination, Brown stated: “They walked
[Williams] in that alley. He stood inside the alley. He
walked him in the alley. I heard a boom.” Ibid.
The Commonwealth also called Aaron Dews, who testified that he was in a building bordering the alleyway at
12:45 a.m. on the morning of December 15. He heard a
loud boom that caused him to look out into the alley from
his second-story window, where he saw two silhouettes
fleeing.

who had been selling cocaine on a nearby street corner at

“I would say that [Williams] was forced in that alley.” Id.,
at 189.
The jury also heard testimony from police who searched
the alley shortly after the murder and found a shotgun
with the barrel missing. A medical examiner who examined Williams’ body testified that the cause of death was a
shotgun wound to the chest.

motion arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The court denied his motion, and
the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the conviction

(MD Pa. 2008). Finally, Johnson appealed to the Third

conviction overturned.
