Per Curiam

presence that he intended to kill Williams. Then, while
Walker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his
trenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley,
where Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled
out a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest.
On the basis of these facts, a rational jury could infer
that Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shotgun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped
usher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate. The
jury in this case was convinced, and the only question
under Jackson is whether that finding was so insupportable as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality. The
state court of last review did not think so, and that determination in turn is entitled to considerable deference
under AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d).
Affording due respect to the role of the jury and the
state courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnson’s
trial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under Jackson. The evidence was sufficient
to convict Johnson as an accomplice and a co-conspirator
in the murder of Taraja Williams. The Commonwealth’s
petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in forma
pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
