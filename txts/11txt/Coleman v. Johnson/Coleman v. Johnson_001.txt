SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
BRIAN COLEMAN, SUPERINTENDENT, STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT FAYETTE, ET AL.
v. LORENZO JOHNSON
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

No. 11–1053. Decided May 29, 2012


PER CURIAM.
Respondent Lorenzo Johnson was convicted as an accomplice and co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams, who was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest in
the early morning hours of December 15, 1995, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After his conviction was affirmed

Court denied habeas relief but the U. S. Court of Appeals

what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted
at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury’s verdict
on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational
trier of fact could have agreed with the jury.” Cavazos v.
Smith, 565 U. S. 1, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 1).
And second, on habeas review, “a federal court may not
overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of
the evidence challenge simply because the federal court
