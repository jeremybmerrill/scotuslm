COLEMAN v. JOHNSON
Per Curiam

only that jurors “draw reasonable inferences from basic
facts to ultimate facts.” Id., at 319. This deferential
standard does not permit the type of fine-grained factual
parsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged. For example, in addressing Brown and Ramsey’s testimony that
Williams was “walked” and “forced” into the alleyway, the
court objected that the witnesses did not describe any
“physical action” supporting the conclusion that force was
used. 446 Fed. Appx., at 541. Absent some specific testimony that “Johnson actively pushed, shoved, ordered or
otherwise forced the victim into the alley, or prevented
him from leaving it,” ibid., the court could see no reasonable basis for the jury’s conclusion that Johnson had a

That analysis is flawed for two reasons. First, the coercive nature of Johnson and Walker’s behavior could be
inferred from other circumstances not involving the direct
use of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon,
and he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams
after a violent confrontation earlier in the day. Johnson
and Walker kept Williams between them in a single-file
line on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the
entrance while the other two entered, suggesting that
Johnson may have been prepared to prevent Williams
from fleeing. And second, even if Williams was not coerced into the alley, the jury still could have concluded
that Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the
murder.

from Williams earlier on the day of the murder. Williams
resisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in
the process by giving him a public thrashing with a
broomstick. This enraged Walker to the point that he
repeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnson’s
