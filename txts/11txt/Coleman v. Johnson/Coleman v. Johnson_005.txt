viction if, “after viewing the evidence in the light most
favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact
could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” 443 U. S., at 319.
In light of the testimony at Johnson’s trial, the Court of
Appeals acknowledged that “[a] trier of fact could reasonably infer . . . that Johnson and Walker shared a common
intent to confront, threaten or harass Williams.” Johnson
v. Mechling, 446 Fed. Appx. 531, 540 (CA3 2011). As for
the notion that “Johnson shared Walker’s intent to kill
Williams,” however, the court concluded that was “mere
speculation” that no rational factfinder could accept as
true. Ibid. The court stated that “a reasonable inference
is one where the fact inferred is ‘more likely than not to
flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.’ ”
Id., at 539–540 (quoting Commonwealth v. McFarland,
452 Pa. 435, 439, 308 A. 2d 592, 594 (1973)). In order for a
jury’s inferences to be permissible, the court reasoned,
they must “ ‘flow from facts and circumstances proven in
the record’ ” that are “ ‘of such volume and quality as to
overcome the presumption of innocence.’ ” 446 Fed. Appx.,
at 539 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bostick, 958 A. 2d 543,
560 (Pa. Super. 2008)).
At the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of
Appeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what
distinguishes a reasoned inference from “mere speculation.” Under Jackson, federal courts must look to state
law for “the substantive elements of the criminal offense,”
443 U. S., at 324, n. 16, but the minimum amount of evidence that the Due Process Clause requires to prove the
offense is purely a matter of federal law.
Under the deferential federal standard, the approach
taken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it unduly impinged on the jury’s role as factfinder. Jackson
leaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences
to draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring
