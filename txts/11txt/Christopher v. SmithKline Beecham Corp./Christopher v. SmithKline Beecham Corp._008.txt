Opinion of the Court

duty.”3 §§541.500(a)(1)(2). The referenced statutory
provision, 29 U. S. C. §203(k), states that “ ‘[s]ale’ or ‘sell’
includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment
for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.” Thus, under the general regulation, an outside salesman is any
employee whose primary duty is making any sale, ex­
change, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for
sale, or other disposition.
The sales regulation restates the statutory definition of
sale discussed above and clarifies that “[s]ales within the
meaning of [29 U. S. C. §203(k)] include the transfer of
title to tangible property, and in certain cases, of tangible
and valuable evidences of intangible property.” 29 CFR
§541.501(b).
Finally, the promotion-work regulation identifies “[p]ro­
motion work” as “one type of activity often performed
by persons who make sales, which may or may not be
exempt outside sales work, depending upon the circum­
stances under which it is performed.” §541.503(a). Pro­
motion work that is “performed incidental to and in
conjunction with an employee’s own outside sales or
solicitations is exempt work,” whereas promotion work
that is “incidental to sales made, or to be made, by some­
one else is not exempt outside sales work.” Ibid.
Additional guidance concerning the scope of the outside
salesman exemption can be gleaned from reports issued in
connection with the DOL’s promulgation of regulations in
1940 and 1949, and from the preamble to the 2004 regu­
lations. See Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Division,
Report and Recommendations of the Presiding Officer at
Hearings Preliminary to Redefinition (1940) (hereinafter
