tion to employees “[w]hose primary duty is . . . making
sales” (emphasis added)). A detailer operating in accord
with the PhRMA Code “sells” the product only in the way

product: by creating demand for the product, not by taking

Second, a Labor Department Wage and Hour Division
Report written in 1940 further describes the work of “sales
promotion men.” See Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour
Division, Report and Recommendations of the Presiding
Officer at Hearings Preliminary to Redefinition (1940)
(1940 Report). The 1940 Report says that such individuals

the retailer, not to the retailer.” Ibid. “[T]hey do not make
actual sales,” and they “are admittedly not outside salesmen.” Ibid.

to the doctor. According to the 1940 Report, sales promotion men are not “outside salesmen,” primarily because
they seek to bring about, not their own sales, but sales by

to the employee’s own sales work.” See Dept. of Labor,
Wage and Hour Division, Report and Recommendations on
Proposed Revisions of Regulations, Part 541, p. 82 (1949)
(1949 Report). It adds that in borderline cases
