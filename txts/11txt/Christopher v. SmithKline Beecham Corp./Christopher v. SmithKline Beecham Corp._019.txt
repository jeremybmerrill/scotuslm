CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
Opinion of the Court

Judicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of Agency
Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612, 655668 (1996). It is one
thing to expect regulated parties to conform their conduct
to an agency’s interpretations once the agency announces
them; it is quite another to require regulated parties to
divine the agency’s interpretations in advance or else be
held liable when the agency announces its interpretations
for the first time in an enforcement proceeding and de­
mands deference.
Accordingly, whatever the general merits of Auer def­
erence, it is unwarranted here. We instead accord the
Department’s interpretation a measure of deference propor­

the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier
and later pronouncements, and all those factors which
give it power to persuade.’ ” United States v. Mead Corp.,
533 U. S. 218, 228 (2001) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift &
Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944)).

We find the DOL’s interpretation of its regulations quite
unpersuasive. The interpretation to which we are now
asked to defer—that a sale demands a transfer of title—
plainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.
Because the DOL first announced its view that pharma­
ceutical sales representatives do not qualify as outside
salesmen in a series of amicus briefs, there was no oppor­
tunity for public comment, and the interpretation that
initially emerged from the Department’s internal deci­
sionmaking process proved to be untenable. After arguing
successfully in the Second Circuit and then unsucessfully in the Ninth Circuit that a sale for present purposes
simply requires a “consummated transaction,” the DOL ad­
vanced a different interpretation in this Court. Here, the
DOL’s brief states unequivocally that “[a]n employee does
not make a ‘sale’ for purposes of the ‘outside salesman’
