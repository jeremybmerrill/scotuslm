CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
Opinion of the Court

Report and Recommendations on Proposed Revisions of
Regulations, Part 541 (1949) (hereinafter 1949 Report); 69
Fed. Reg. 2216022163 (hereinafter Preamble). Although
the DOL has rejected proposals to eliminate or dilute the
requirement that outside salesmen make their own sales,
the Department has stressed that this requirement is
met whenever an employee “in some sense make[s] a sale.”
1940 Report 46; see also Preamble 22162 (reiterating that
the exemption applies only to an employee who “in some
sense, has made sales”). And the DOL has made it clear
that “[e]xempt status should not depend” on technicalities,
such as “whether it is the sales employee or the customer
who types the order into a computer system and hits the
return button,” Preamble 22163, or whether “the order is
filled by [a] jobber rather than directly by [the employee’s]
own employer,” 1949 Report 83.
B
Respondent SmithKline Beecham Corporation is in the
business of developing, manufacturing, and selling pre­
scription drugs. The prescription drug industry is subject
to extensive federal regulation, including the now-familiar
requirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only
upon a physician’s prescription.4 In light of this require­
——————
4 Congress imposed this requirement in 1951 when it amended the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to provide that drugs
that are “not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner”
may be dispensed “only . . . upon a . . . prescription of a practitioner
licensed by law to administer such drug.” Durham-Humphrey Amend­
ment of 1951, ch. 578, 65 Stat. 648649 (codified at 21 U. S. C. §353(b)).
As originally enacted in 1938, the FDCA allowed manufacturers to
designate certain drugs as prescription only, but “it did not say which
drugs were to be sold by prescription or that there were any drugs that
could not be sold without a prescription.” Temin, The Origin of Com­
pulsory Drug Prescriptions, 22 J. Law & Econ. 91, 98 (1979). Prior to
Congress’ enactment of the FDCA, a prescription was not needed to
obtain any drug other than certain narcotics. See id., at 97.
