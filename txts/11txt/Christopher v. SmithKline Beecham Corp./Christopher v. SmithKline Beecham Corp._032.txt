CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
BREYER, J., dissenting

detailers work with “only minimal supervision” and beyond normal business hours “attending events, reviewing
product information, returning phone calls, responding to
e-mails, and performing other miscellaneous tasks.” Ante,
at 6.
As summarized, I agree with the Court’s description
of the job. In light of important, near-contemporaneous
differences in the Justice Department’s views as to the
meaning of relevant Labor Department regulations, see

U. S. C. §213(a)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, we must look
to relevant Labor Department regulations to answer the
question. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984); see also Long
Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 165
(2007) (explaining that “the FLSA explicitly leaves gaps”
to be filled by regulations).
There are three relevant regulations. The first is entitled “General rule for outside sales employees,” 29 CFR
§541.500 (2011); the second is entitled “Making sales or
obtaining orders,” §541.501; and the third is entitled
