Opinion of the Court

to enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a
number of factors which are peculiarly within its exper­
tise”). But where, as here, an agency’s announcement of
its interpretation is preceded by a very lengthy period of
conspicuous inaction, the potential for unfair surprise is
acute. As the Seventh Circuit has noted, while it may be
“possible for an entire industry to be in violation of the
[FLSA] for a long time without the Labor Department
noticing,” the “more plausible hypothesis” is that the De­
partment did not think the industry’s practice was un­
lawful. Yi v. Sterling Collision Centers, Inc., 480 F. 3d
505, 510511 (2007). There are now approximately 90,000
pharmaceutical sales representatives; the nature of their
work has not materially changed for decades and is well
known; these employees are well paid; and like quintes­
sential outside salesmen, they do not punch a clock and
often work more than 40 hours per week. Other than
acquiescence, no explanation for the DOL’s inaction is
plausible.
Our practice of deferring to an agency’s interpretation
of its own ambiguous regulations undoubtedly has im­
portant advantages,17 but this practice also creates a risk
that agencies will promulgate vague and open-ended
regulations that they can later interpret as they see fit,
thereby “frustrat[ing] the notice and predictability pur­
poses of rulemaking.” Talk America, Inc. v. Michigan Bell
Telephone Co., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (SCALIA, J., con­
curring) (slip op., at 3); see also Stephenson & Pogoriler,

17 For instance, it “makes the job of a reviewing court much easier,
and since it usually produces affirmance of the agency’s view without
conflict in the Circuits, it imparts (once the agency has spoken to clarify
the regulation) certainty and predictability to the administrative
process.” Talk America, Inc. v. Michigan Bell Telephone Co., 564 U. S.
___, ___ (2011) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).
