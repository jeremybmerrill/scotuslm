CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
BREYER, J., dissenting
Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.

outside sales work. An employee who does not satisfy
the requirements of this subpart may still qualify as
an exempt employee under other subparts of this rule.
“(b) A manufacturer’s representative, for example,
may perform various types of promotional activities
such as putting up displays and posters, removing
damaged or spoiled stock from the merchant’s shelves
or rearranging the merchandise. Such an employee
can be considered an exempt outside sales employee
if the employee’s primary duty is making sales or
contracts. Promotion activities directed toward consummation of the employee’s own sales are exempt.
Promotional activities designed to stimulate sales that
will be made by someone else are not exempt outside
sales work.
“(c) Another example is a company representative who
visits chain stores, arranges the merchandise on
shelves, replenishes stock by replacing old with new
merchandise, sets up displays and consults with the
store manager when inventory runs low, but does not
obtain a commitment for additional purchases. The
arrangement of merchandise on the shelves or the replenishing of stock is not exempt work unless it is incidental to and in conjunction with the employee's
own outside sales. Because the employee in this instance does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts
toward the consummation of a sale, the work is not
exempt outside sales work.”
