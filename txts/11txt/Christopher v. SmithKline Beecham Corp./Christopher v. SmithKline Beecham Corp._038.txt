CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
BREYER, J., dissenting

“the test is whether the person is actually engaged
in activities directed toward the consummation of his
own sales, at least to the extent of obtaining a commitment to buy from the person to whom he is selling.
If his efforts are directed toward stimulating the sales
of his company generally rather than the consummation of his own specific sales his activities are not exempt.” Id., at 83 (emphasis added).
The 1949 Report also refers to a
“company representative who visits chain stores, arranges the merchandise on shelves, replenishes stock
. . . , consults with the manager as to the requirements of the store, fills out a requisition for the quantity wanted and leaves it with the store manager
to be transmitted to the central warehouse of the
chain-store company which later ships the quantity requested.” Id., at 84.
It says this company representative is not an “outside
salesman” because he
“does not consummate the sale nor direct his efforts
toward the consummation of a sale (the store manager
often has no authority to buy).” Ibid.
See also 29 CFR §541.503(c) (explaining that if an employee “does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts toward the consummation of a sale, the work is not exempt
outside sales work”)
A detailer does not take orders, he does not consummate
a sale, and he does not direct his efforts towards the consummation of any eventual sale (by the pharmacist) any

Report’s example. The doctor whom the detailer visits,
like the example’s store manager, “has no authority to
buy.”
Taken together, the statute, regulations, ethical codes,
