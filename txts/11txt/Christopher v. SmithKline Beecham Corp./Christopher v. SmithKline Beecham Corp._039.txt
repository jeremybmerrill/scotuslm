BREYER, J., dissenting

and Labor Department Reports indicate that the drug
detailers do not promote their “own sales,” but rather
“sales made, or to be made, by someone else.” Therefore,
detailers are not “outside salesmen.”

The Court’s different conclusion rests primarily upon its
interpretation of the statutory words “other disposition” as
“including those arrangements that are tantamount, in a

might preclude an industry from selling its products
through an outside salesman without thereby leading the
legal term “outside salesman” to apply to whatever is the
next best thing. In any event, the Court would be wrong
to assume, if it does assume, that there is in nearly every
