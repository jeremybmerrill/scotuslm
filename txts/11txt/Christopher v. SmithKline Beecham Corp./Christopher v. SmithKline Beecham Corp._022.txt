Opinion of the Court

anyone “employed . . . in the capacity of [an] outside
salesman.” 29 U. S. C. §213(a)(1) (emphasis added). “Ca­
pacity,” used in this sense, means “[o]utward condition
or circumstances; relation; character; position.” Webster’s
New International Dictionary 396 (2d ed. 1934); see also 2
Oxford English Dictionary 89 (def. 9) (1933) (“Position,
condition, character, relation”). The statute’s emphasis on
the “capacity” of the employee counsels in favor of a func­
tional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an
employee’s responsibilities in the context of the particular
industry in which the employee works.
The DOL’s regulations provide additional guidance. The
general regulation defines an outside salesman as an
employee whose primary duty is “making sales,” and
it adopts the statutory definition of “sale.” 29 CFR
§541.500(a)(1)(i). This definition contains at least three
important textual clues. First, the definition is introduced
with the verb “includes” instead of “means.” This word
choice is significant because it makes clear that the exam­
ples enumerated in the text are intended to be illustrative,
not exhaustive. See Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S.
124, 131, n. 3 (2008) (explaining that “[a] term whose
statutory definition declares what it ‘includes’ is more
susceptible to extension of meaning . . . than where . . . the
definition declares what a term ‘means’ ” (alteration in
original; some internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed,
Congress used the narrower word “means” in other provi­
sions of the FLSA when it wanted to cabin a definition to
a specific list of enumerated items. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C.
§203(a) (“ ‘Person’ means an individual, partnership, asso­
ciation, corporation, business trust, legal representative,
or any organized group of persons” (emphasis added)).
Second, the list of transactions included in the statu­
tory definition of sale is modified by the word “any.” We
have recognized that the modifier “any” can mean “differ­
ent things depending upon the setting,” Nixon v. Missouri
