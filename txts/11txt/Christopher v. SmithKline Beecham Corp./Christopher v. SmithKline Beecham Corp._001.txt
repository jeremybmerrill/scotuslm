CHRISTOPHER ET AL. v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM 

CORP., DBA GLAXOSMITHKLINE

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 11–204.

Argued April 16, 2012—Decided June 18, 2012

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay employees overtime wages, see 29 U. S. C. §207(a), but this requirement
does not apply with respect to workers employed “in the capacity of
outside salesman,” §213(a)(1). Congress did not elaborate on the
meaning of “outside salesman,” but it delegated authority to the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue regulations to define the term.
Three of the DOL’s regulations are relevant to this case. First, 29
CFR §541.500 defines “outside salesman” to mean “any employee . . .
[w]hose primary duty is . . . making sales within the meaning of [29
U. S. C. §203(k)].” §§541.500(a)(1)(2). Section 203(k), in turn, states
that “ ‘[s]ale’ or ‘sell’ includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell,
consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.” Second, §541.501 clarifies that “[s]ales within the meaning of [§203(k)]
include the transfer of title to tangible property.” §541.501(b). Third,
§541.503 provides that promotion work that is “performed incidental
to and in conjunction with an employee’s own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work,” whereas promotion work that is “incidental
to sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not.” §541.503(a).
The DOL provided additional guidance in connection with its promulgation of these regulations, stressing that an employee is an “outside salesman” when the employee “in some sense, has made sales.”

The prescription drug industry is subject to extensive federal regulation, including the requirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only upon a physician’s prescription. In light of this requirement, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct
marketing efforts on physicians. Pharmaceutical companies promote
