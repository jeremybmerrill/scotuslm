CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
Opinion of the Court

years,” id., at 399.
The Ninth Circuit’s decision conflicts with the Second
Circuit’s decision in In re Novartis Wage and Hour Litigation, 611 F. 3d 141, 153155 (2010) (holding that the
DOL’s interpretation is entitled to controlling deference).
We granted certiorari to resolve this split, 565 U. S. ___
(2011), and we now affirm the judgment of the Ninth
Circuit.
II
We must determine whether pharmaceutical detailers
are outside salesmen as the DOL has defined that term in
its regulations. The parties agree that the regulations
themselves were validly promulgated and are therefore
entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).
But the parties disagree sharply about whether the DOL’s
interpretation of the regulations is owed deference under
Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997). It is to that ques­
tion that we now turn.
A
The DOL first announced its view that pharmaceutical
detailers are not exempt outside salesmen in an amicus
brief filed in the Second Circuit in 2009, and the Depart­
ment has subsequently filed similar amicus briefs in other
cases, including the case now before us.11 While the DOL’s
ultimate conclusion that detailers are not exempt has
remained unchanged since 2009, the same cannot be said
of its reasoning. In both the Second Circuit and the Ninth
——————
11 The DOL invites “interested parties to inform it of private cases
involving the misclassification of employees in contravention of the new
Part 541 rule” so that it may file amicus briefs “in appropriate cases to
share with courts the Department’s view of the proper application of
the new Part 541 rule.” See Dept. of Labor, Office of Solicitor, Overtime
Security Amicus Program, http://www.dol.gov/sol/541amicus.htm (as visited
June 15, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).
