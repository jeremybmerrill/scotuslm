CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
Opinion of the Court

FLSA obligates employers to compensate employees for
hours in excess of 40 per week at a rate of 1½ times
the employees’ regular wages. See §207(a). The overtime
compensation requirement, however, does not apply with
respect to all employees. See §213. As relevant here, the
statute exempts workers “employed . . . in the capacity of
outside salesman.” §213(a)(1).1
Congress did not define the term “outside salesman,”
but it delegated authority to the DOL to issue regulations
“from time to time” to “defin[e] and delimi[t]” the term.
Ibid. The DOL promulgated such regulations in 1938,
1940, and 1949. In 2004, following notice-and-comment
procedures, the DOL reissued the regulations with minor
amendments. See 69 Fed. Reg. 22122 (2004). The current
regulations are nearly identical in substance to the regula­
tions issued in the years immediately following the FLSA’s
enactment. See 29 CFR §§541.500541.504 (2011).
Three of the DOL’s regulations are directly relevant to
this case: §§541.500, 541.501, and 541.503. We refer to
these three regulations as the “general regulation,” the
“sales regulation,” and the “promotion-work regulation,”
respectively.
The general regulation sets out the definition of the
statutory term “employee employed in the capacity of
outside salesman.” It defines the term to mean “any
employee . . . [w]hose primary duty is . . . making sales
within the meaning of [29 U. S. C. §203(k)]”2 and “[w]ho is
customarily and regularly engaged away from the employ­
er’s place or places of business in performing such primary
——————
1 This provision also exempts workers “employed in a bona fide execu­
tive, administrative, or professional capacity.” 29 U. S. C. §213(a)(1).
2 The definition also includes any employee “[w]hose primary duty is
. . . obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities
for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer.” 29
CFR §541.500(a)(1)(ii). That portion of the definition is not at issue in
this case.
