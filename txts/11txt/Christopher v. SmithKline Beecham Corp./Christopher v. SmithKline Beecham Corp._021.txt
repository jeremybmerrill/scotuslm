CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
Opinion of the Court

“consignment for sale” qualifies as a sale. Since a con­
signment for sale does not involve a transfer of title, it is
apparent that the sales regulation does not mean that a
sale must include a transfer of title, only that transactions
involving a transfer of title are included within the term
“sale.”
Petitioners invite us to look past the DOL’s “determina­
tion that a sale must involve the transfer of title” and
instead defer to the Department’s “explanation that ob­
taining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug
constitutes promotion, and not sales.” Reply Brief for
Petitioners 17. The problem with the DOL’s interpreta­
tion of the promotion-work regulation, however, is that it
depends almost entirely on the DOL’s flawed transfer-of­
title interpretation. The promotion-work regulation does
not distinguish between promotion work and sales; rather,
it distinguishes between exempt promotion work and
nonexempt promotion work. Since promotion work that is
performed incidental to an employee’s own sales is ex­
empt, the DOL’s conclusion that pharmaceutical detailers
perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong
as the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those
employees do not make sales. For the reasons already
discussed, we find this reasoning wholly unpersuasive.
In light of our conclusion that the DOL’s interpretation
is neither entitled to Auer deference nor persuasive in its
own right, we must employ traditional tools of interpreta­
tion to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside
salesmen.

We begin with the text of the FLSA. Although the
provision that establishes the overtime salesman exemp­
tion does not furnish a clear answer to the question before
us, it provides at least one interpretive clue: It exempts
