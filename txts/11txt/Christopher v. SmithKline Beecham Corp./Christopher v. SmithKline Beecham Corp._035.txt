BREYER, J., dissenting

mitment” to advise his patient to take the drug (or perhaps a generic equivalent) as well as to write any necessary prescription. I put to the side the fact that neither
the Court nor the record explains exactly what a “nonbinding commitment” is. Like a “definite maybe,” an “impossible solution,” or a “theoretical experience,” a “nonbinding
commitment” seems to claim more than it can deliver.
Regardless, other than in colloquial speech, to obtain a
commitment to advise a client to buy a product is not to
obtain a commitment to sell that product, no matter how
often the client takes the advice (or the patient does what
the doctor recommends).
The third regulation, entitled “Promotion work,” lends
support to this view. That is because the detailer’s work
as described above is best viewed as promotion work. The
regulation makes clear that promotion work falls within
the statutory exemption only when the promotion work “is
actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with
an employee’s own outside sales or solicitations.” 29 CFR
§541.503(a) (emphasis added). But it is not exempt if it is
“incidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else.”

The detailer’s work, in my view, is more naturally characterized as involving “[p]romotional activities designed to
stimulate sales . . . made by someone else,” §541.503, e.g.,
the pharmacist or the wholesaler, than as involving
“[p]romotional activities designed to stimulate” the detailer’s “own sales.”
Three other relevant documents support this reading.

of America (PhRMA), of which respondent is a member, publishes a “Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals.”
