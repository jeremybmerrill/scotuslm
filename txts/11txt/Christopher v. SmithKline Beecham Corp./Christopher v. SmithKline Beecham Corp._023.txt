CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
Opinion of the Court

Municipal League, 541 U. S. 125, 132 (2004), but in the
context of 29 U. S. C. §203(k), it is best read to mean “ ‘one
or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,’ ” United States
v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster’s Third
New International Dictionary 97 (1976)). That is so
because Congress defined “sale” to include both the un­
modified word “sale” and transactions that might not be
considered sales in a technical sense, including exchanges
and consignments for sale.18
Third, Congress also included a broad catchall phrase:
“other disposition.” Neither the statute nor the regula­
tions define “disposition,” but dictionary definitions of the
term range from “relinquishment or alienation” to “ar­
rangement.” See Webster’s New International Dictionary
644 (def. 1(b)) (1927) (“[t]he getting rid, or making over, of
anything; relinquishment or alienation”); ibid. (def. 1(a))
(“[t]he ordering, regulating, or administering of any­
thing”); 3 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 493 (def. 4)
(“[t]he action of disposing of, putting away, getting rid of,
making over, etc.”); ibid. (def. 1) (“[t]he action of setting in
order, or condition of being set in order; arrangement,
order”). We agree with the DOL that the rule of ejusdem
generis should guide our interpretation of the catchall
phrase, since it follows a list of specific items.19 But the
limit the DOL posits, one that would confine the phrase to
dispositions involving “contract[s] for the exchange of
goods or services in return for value,” see U. S. Brief 20, is
——————
18 Given that the FLSA provides its own definition of “sale” that is
more expansive than the term’s ordinary meaning, the DOL’s reliance
on dictionary definitions of the word “sale” is misplaced. See, e.g.,
Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130 (2008) (noting that “[w]hen
a statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition”
(internal quotation marks omitted)).
19 The canon of ejusdem generis “limits general terms [that] follow
specific ones to matters similar to those specified.” CSX Transp., Inc. v.
Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16)
(alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted).
