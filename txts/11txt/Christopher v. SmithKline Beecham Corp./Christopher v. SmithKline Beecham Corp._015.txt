CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.
Opinion of the Court

Although Auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agen­
cy’s interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation, even
when that interpretation is advanced in a legal brief, see
Chase Bank USA, N. A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)
(slip op., at 12); Auer, 519 U. S., at 461462, this general
rule does not apply in all cases. Deference is undoubtedly
inappropriate, for example, when the agency’s interpreta­
tion is “ ‘plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regu­
lation.’ ” Id., at 461 (quoting Robertson v. Methow Valley
Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 359 (1989)). And defer­
ence is likewise unwarranted when there is reason to
suspect that the agency’s interpretation “does not reflect
the agency’s fair and considered judgment on the matter
in question.” Auer, supra, at 462; see also, e.g., Chase
Bank, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). This might occur
when the agency’s interpretation conflicts with a prior
interpretation, see, e.g., Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 515 (1994), or when it appears that the
interpretation is nothing more than a “convenient litigat­
ing position,” Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488
U. S. 204, 213 (1988), or a “ ‘post hoc rationalizatio[n]’
advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency
action against attack,” Auer, supra, at 462 (quoting Bowen,
supra, at 212; alteration in original).
In this case, there are strong reasons for withholding
the deference that Auer generally requires. Petitioners in­
voke the DOL’s interpretation of ambiguous regulations
to impose potentially massive liability on respondent for
conduct that occurred well before that interpretation was
announced. To defer to the agency’s interpretation in this
circumstance would seriously undermine the principle
that agencies should provide regulated parties “fair warn­
—————— 

(1992) (noting that “it would be quite inappropriate to defer to an

interpretation which has been abandoned by the policymaking agency 

itself ”).
