MICHAEL SHANE CHRISTOPHER, ET AL., PETITION-

ERS v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORPORATION

DBA GLAXOSMITHKLINE

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 18, 2012] 


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) imposes mini­
mum wage and maximum hours requirements on employ­
ers, see 29 U. S. C. §§206207 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), but
those requirements do not apply to workers employed “in
the capacity of outside salesman,” §213(a)(1). This case
requires us to decide whether the term “outside sales­
man,” as defined by Department of Labor (DOL or De­
partment) regulations, encompasses pharmaceutical sales
representatives whose primary duty is to obtain nonbinding
commitments from physicians to prescribe their employer’s prescription drugs in appropriate cases. We conclude
that these employees qualify as “outside salesm[e]n.”
