SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

tence imposed below that otherwise applicable maximum,
at least if the resulting guidelines were not mandatory.
See Booker, 543 U. S., at 245. But the majority held that
where a sentencing fact increased the otherwise applicable
maximum penalty, that fact had to be found by a jury.
Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490.
As I have said, the dissenters thought that the Sixth
Amendment did not require a jury to find any of these
sentencing facts. Why, asked the dissenters, should Con­
gress’ or a State’s desire for greater sentencing uniformity
achieved through statutes seeking more uniform treat­
ment (of similar offenders committing similar offenses in
similar ways) suddenly produce new Sixth Amendment
jury trial requirements?
Those requirements would work against greater sen­
tencing fairness. To treat all sentencing facts (where so
specified in a statute or rule) as if they were elements of
the offense could lead Congress simply to set high maxi­
mum ranges for each crime, thereby avoiding Apprendi’s jury trial requirement. Alternatively, Congress might
enact statutes that more specifically tied particular pun­
ishments to each crime (limiting or removing judicial
discretion), for example, mandatory minimum statutes.
But this system would threaten disproportionality by insisting that similar punishments be applied to very dif­
ferent kinds of offense behavior or offenders. Apprendi’s
jury trial requirements might also prove unworkable. Consider the difficulty of juries’ having to find the different facts in the bank robbery example I have set forth
above. Moreover, how is a defendant, arguing that he did
not have a gun, alternatively to argue that, in any event,
he did not fire the gun?
Finally, the dissenters took a different view of Sixth
Amendment history. They believed that under the com­
mon law and at the time the Constitution was ratified,
judges, not juries, often found sentencing facts, i.e., facts
