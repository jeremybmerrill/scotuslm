SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

those made by the dissents in our prior Apprendi cases.
See Booker, 543 U. S., at 329 (BREYER, J., dissenting
in part); Blakely, 542 U. S., at 318–320 (O’Connor, J.,
dissenting); id., at 330–340 (BREYER, J., dissenting); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 555–559 (same). Here, as there, they
must be rejected. For even if these predictions are accurate, the rule the Government espouses is unconstitutional. That “should be the end of the matter.” Blakely, 542
U. S., at 313.
But here there is particular reason to doubt the strength
of these policy concerns. Apprendi is now more than a
decade old. The reliance interests that underlie many of
the Government’s arguments are by this point attenuated.
Nor, in our view, does applying Apprendi’s rule to criminal
fines mark an unexpected extension of the doctrine. Most
Circuits to have addressed the issue already embrace this
position, see Pfaff, 619 F. 3d, at 175–176; LaGrou Distribution Sys., 466 F. 3d, at 594; United States v. Yang, 144
Fed. Appx. 521, 524 (CA6 2005), as did the Government
prior to Ice, see Brief in Opposition 11, n. 2. In light of the
reasons given in this opinion, the dramatic departure from
precedent would be to hold criminal fines exempt from
Apprendi.

We hold that the rule of Apprendi applies to the imposition of criminal fines. The judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
