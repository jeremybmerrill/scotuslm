SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

causing harm to others or to the environment. App. 129–
130; see Brief for Petitioner 30.
The number of “day[s] of each violation,” however, is not
an additional element of the crime. The statute says that
the number of days becomes relevant only “upon convic­
tion” of the crime as previously defined. Moreover, the
number of days is relevant to application of only one of
two kinds of punishment that the statute mentions (fine
and imprisonment); one cannot easily read this statute as
creating two separate crimes identical but for the punish­
ment. Finally, Congress did not include here, as it some­
times has done, statutory words such as “each day of
violation shall constitute a separate offense.” E.g., 47
U. S. C. §223(b); see also 42 U. S. C. §4910(b). Rather, as
in many other similar statutes, the statute here sets forth
the crime and kinds of punishments (fine and imprison­
ment), while separately specifying facts that determine
the maximum punishment of one kind (fines).
In this particular case, the indictment set forth a viola­
tion period of 762 days (from “on or about September 19,
2002 until on or about October 19, 2004”). App. 104. The
jury’s guilty verdict did not specify the number of days on
which the defendant committed the offense. Id., at 141.
But after the conviction and sentencing hearing, the judge
found that, among other things, the “clear and essentially
irrefutable evidence” at trial supported the conclusion set
forth in the presentence report, namely, that the maxi­
mum fine available amounted to $50,000 per day for 762
days—or $38.1 million. App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a–48a.
The judge imposed a fine of $6 million along with a $12
million community service obligation. App. 162–163.

for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum
must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reason­
