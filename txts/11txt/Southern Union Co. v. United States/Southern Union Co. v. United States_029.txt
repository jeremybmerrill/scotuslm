SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

That is because
“the quantum, in particular, of pecuniary fines neither
can, nor ought to be, ascertained by any invariable
law. The value of money itself changes from a thou­
sand causes; and, at all events, what is ruin to one
man’s fortune, may be a matter of indifference to an­
other.” Id., at 371.
Moreover, the “quantum” of pecuniary fines
“must frequently vary, from aggravations or otherwise
of the offense [i.e., the manner in which the crime was
committed], the quality and conditions of the parties
[e.g., the offender’s characteristics], and from innu­
merable other circumstances.” Ibid.
Similarly, the 18th-century statesman and treatise­
writer Baron Auckland pointed out that in 10th-century
England pre-Norman law had attached a fixed financial
penalty to each specific crime. Principles of Penal Law 69
(2d ed. 1771). That law, for example, imposed a penalty of
3 cows for perjury and 12 cows for the rape of a maid.
Ibid. This system, Baron Auckland added, ignored varia­
tions in, for example, the differing value of a fixed fine, say
a cow, over time and among individuals; it also ignored
the manner in which the offense was committed and the
characteristics of the offender. Id., at 69–72. For those
reasons, 18th-century English law ordinarily left “the
quantum of the fine” to “the discretion of the Judges.” Id.,
at 68 (emphasis deleted).
“[Because t]he enormity and tendency of the crime,
the malice and wilfulness of the intention, the incon­
siderateness and suddenness of the act, the age, facul­
ties, and fortune of the offender, form a chain of
complex questions; which can be resolved only by
the evidence of each separate charge, and for which no
human foresight can provide . . . then arises a neces­
