BREYER, J., dissenting

p. 3 (Nov. 2011) (USSG).
In respect to characteristics of the offender, a current bank
robbery conviction might be that offender’s first (or his
fourth) criminal conviction.
Traditionally, sentencing facts help the sentencing judge
determine where, within say a broad statutory range of,
say, up to 20 years of imprisonment, the particular bank
robber’s punishment should lie. The Apprendi dissenters
concluded that the Constitution did not require the jury
to find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable
doubt. Rather the law, through its rules, statutes, and
the Constitution’s Due Process Clause would typically offer
the defendant factfinding protection. See, e.g., Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 32 (federal presentence report prepared by
probation office sets forth facts, which defendant may
contest at sentencing proceeding); Almendarez-Torres v.
United States, 523 U. S. 224, 239–247 (1998) (constitu­
tional inquiry).
The dispute in Apprendi and its line of cases arose after
Congress and many States codified these sentencing facts
during the sentencing reform movement of the 1970’s and
1980’s. Congress, for example, concluded that too many
different judges were imposing too many different sen­
tences upon too many similar offenders who had committed similar crimes in similar ways. It subsequently
enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, creating a
federal Sentencing Commission which would produce greater
uniformity in sentencing through the promulgation of
mandatory uniform Guidelines structuring how judges, in
ordinary cases, should typically use sentencing facts to
determine sentences. 28 U. S. C. §§991, 994 (2006 ed. and
Supp. IV); see also 18 U. S. C. §§3553(b)(1), 3742(e). The
Apprendi-line majority agreed that, where a statute set a
higher maximum sentence, a Commission might structure
how a judge found sentencing facts relevant to the sen­
