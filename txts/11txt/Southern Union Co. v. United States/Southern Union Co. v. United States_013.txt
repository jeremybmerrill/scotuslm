SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

the value “must be proved precisely as it is laid [in the
indictment], and any variance will be fatal”); see also
id., at 188 (“[I]n the case of usury, where the judgment
depends upon the quantum taken, the usurious contract
must be averred according to the fact; and a variance from
it, in evidence, would be fatal, because the penalty is
apportioned to the value” (emphasis in original)); 2 W.
Hawkins, A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown, ch. 25, §75,
pp. 234–235 (3d ed. 1739) (doubting whether “it be needful to set forth the Value of the Goods in an Indictment
of Trespass for any other Purpose than to aggravate the
Fine”).
In any event, the salient question here is what role the
jury played in prosecutions for offenses that did peg the
amount of a fine to the determination of specified facts—
often, the value of damaged or stolen property. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 502, n. 2 (THOMAS, J., concurring).
Our review of state and federal decisions discloses that the
predominant practice was for such facts to be alleged in
the indictment and proved to the jury. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. 245, 247 (1804) (declining to
award judgment of treble damages for all stolen items in
larceny prosecution when indictment alleged value of only
some of the items); Clark v. People, 2 Ill. 117, 120–121
(1833) (arson indictment must allege value of destroyed
building because statute imposed “a fine equal in value to
the property burned”); State v. Garner, 8 Port. 447, 448
(Ala. 1839) (same in malicious mischief prosecution where
punishment was fine “not exceeding four fold the value of
the property injured or destroyed”); Ritchey v. State, 7
Blackf. 168, 169 (Ind. 1844) (same in arson prosecution
because, “[i]n addition to imprisonment in the penitentiary, the guilty person is liable to a fine not exceeding
double the value of the property destroyed”); Hope v.
Commonwealth, 50 Mass. 134, 137 (1845) (the “value of
the property alleged to be stolen must be set forth in the
