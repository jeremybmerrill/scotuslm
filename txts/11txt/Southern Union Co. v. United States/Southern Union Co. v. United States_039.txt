SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

113). The Illinois Supreme Court subsequently wrote
that, even though “at common law . . . juries . . . never
were invested with the power of determining the character
or extent of the punishment . . . , we are to be governed
entirely the provisions and enactments of our code of
criminal jurisprudence.” Blevings v. People, 1 Scam. 172
(1835). And in Clark v. People, 1 Scam. 117 (1833), see
ante, at 10, the court made clear that the arson statute at
issue
“ha[d] changed the common law, . . . [that the] fine
equal in value to the property burne[d] is imposed as
part of the punishment[; hence,] [t]he indictment . . .
should have charged the value of the property de­
stroyed, [for] otherwise it could not properly have
been inquired into by the jury.” 1 Scam., at 117.
Indiana was another jury-sentencing State. Iontcheva,
supra, at 317, n. 28; King, supra, at 937. Indiana case law
decided before Indiana changed its system indicates that
the judge could decide certain facts required to set the
applicable maximum fine. E.g., Morris v. State, 1 Blackf.
37 (1819). But after Indiana became a jury-sentencing
State, its courts held, not surprisingly, that under Indiana
law the jury must determine sentencing facts. See Ritchey
v. State, 7 Blackf. 168, 169 (1844); ante, at 10.
Massachusetts presents a special circumstance. The
two Massachusetts cases that the majority cites, ante, at
10–11, are larceny cases. Value traditionally was an
element of the crime of larceny—both because larceny was
theft of goods that had some intrinsic value and because
value distinguished grand larceny from petit larceny—and
thus juries traditionally had to determine at least some
facts about the value of the property stolen. See Black­
stone 229, 234. Massachusetts had abolished the distinc­
tion between grand and petit larceny before its courts
decided the two cases the majority cites. See Common-
