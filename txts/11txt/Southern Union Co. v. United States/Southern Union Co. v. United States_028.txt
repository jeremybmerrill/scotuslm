BREYER, J., dissenting

IV 

A

Apprendi relied heavily upon the fact that in “England
before the founding of our Nation” the prescribed punish­
ment for more serious crimes, i.e., felonies, was typically
fixed—indeed, fixed at death. 530 U. S., at 478–480; see J.
Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 512 (4th
ed. 2007); J. Beattie, Crime and the Courts in England,
1660–1800, pp. 409, 450–451 (1986) (hereinafter Beattie);
Langbein, The English Criminal Trial on the Eve of the
French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England, France,
Germany 1700–1900, pp. 13, 16, 36–37 (A. Schioppa ed.
1987). The facts related to the application of that pun­
ishment were typically elements of the crime. And the
jury, not the judge, determined the existence of those
facts. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws
of England 343 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); see also
Baker, supra, at 512–518 (in practice, the jury or judge
could ameliorate capital punishment through application
of doctrines such as “pious perjury,” “benefit of clergy,”
and reprieves, or the King could grant a royal pardon);
Beattie 419–435 (same).
Punishment for lesser crimes, however, included fines.
And under the common law, the judge, not the jury, de­
termined the amount of the fine and the sentencing facts
relevant to the setting of that amount. See Baker, supra,
at 512; Beattie 459. Pertinent sentencing facts typically
concerned the manner in which the offender committed
the crime and the characteristics of that offender. See id.,
at 456–460. Thus, in 1769, Blackstone wrote:
“Our statute law has not therefore often ascertained
the quantity of fines, nor the common law ever; it di­
recting such an offense to be punished by fine, in gen­
eral, without specifying the certain sum.” Blackstone
372 (emphasis added).
