SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

the character of the offence to be stated.” 46 N. H., at
187–188.
The court wrote nothing to suggest that its holding rested
on generally applicable constitutional grounds. And it was
in the New Hampshire federal circuit court a half-century
earlier when Justice Story had indicated that the Federal
Constitution did not impose any such requirement. See
Mann, 26 F. Cas., at 1155 (No. 15,718).
That leaves the majority’s puzzling 1895 Federal Dis­
trict Court case from Kansas. United States v. Woodruff,
68 F. 536 (D. Kan. 1895); ante, at 11. The circumstances
of this case are highly unusual, and the District Court’s
reasoning as to why no fine could be set seems to have
rested on a combination of statutory construction and
constitutional principle. See Woodruff v. United States, 58
F. 766, 767–768 (CC Kan. 1893); Woodruff, 68 F., at 538–
539. Still, I concede this case to the majority—as the lone
swallow that cannot make the majority’s summer.
Taken together, the 19th-century cases upon which the
majority rests its holding do not show anything about
practice in the vast majority of States. They concede that
common-law practice was to the contrary. And they tell us
little about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Even
were that not so, I do not understand why these mid-19th­
century cases should tell us more about the Constitution’s
meaning than, say, the common 20th-century practice
of leaving sentencing fact determinations to the judge.
This Court apparently once approved the latter practice as
constitutional. E.g., McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.
79 (1986); Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S. 224. And these
cases seem more closely related to the present topic.

The upshot is that both 18th-century English common
law and 18th-century American law typically provided
judges with broad discretion to assess fines. The judge,
