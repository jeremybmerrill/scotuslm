BREYER, J., dissenting

E.g., N. Y. Penal Law Ann. §80.00(3) (West 2009); N. J.
Stat. Ann. §2C:43–3(e) (West 2005).
The Federal Government followed suit. In some in­
stances, such as RCRA, where environmental harm likely
varies with the length of the violation period, Congress
advanced its uniformity and deterrence goals by tying a
dollar-limited fine to the length of time during which that
violation took place. 42 U. S. C. §6928(d)(2)(A). In other
instances, it did so through a new general gain-or-loss
provision, applying to all offenses, including such crimes
as corporate fraud, antitrust violations, and environmen­
tal pollution. That provision says:
“ALTERNATIVE FINE BASED ON GAIN OR LOSS.—If any
person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if
the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other
than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not
more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice
the gross loss, unless imposition of a fine under this
subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the
sentencing process.” 18 U. S. C. §3571(d).
To apply Apprendi’s rule to the fines set forth in such
statutes, no less than in Ice, would weaken or destroy the
States’ and Federal Government’s efforts “to rein in the
discretion judges possessed at common law,” Ice, 555 U. S.,
at 171, over fines. Congress, in enacting such statutes,
expected judges, not juries, to determine fine-related sen­
tencing facts because doing so will often involve highly
complex determinations. Where, say, major fraud is at
issue, the full extent of the loss (or gain) may be unknown
at the time of indictment or at any other time prior to the
conclusion of the trial. And in an antitrust or an environ­
mental pollution case, the jury may have particular diffi­
culty assessing different estimates of resulting losses.
The consequence of the majority’s holding, insisting that
juries make such determinations, is likely to diminish the
