Opinion of the Court

upon organizational defendants who cannot be imprisoned.2 And the amount of a fine, like the maximum term
of imprisonment or eligibility for the death penalty, is often calculated by reference to particular facts. Sometimes,
as here, the fact is the duration of a statutory violation;3
under other statutes it is the amount of the defendant’s
gain or the victim’s loss, or some other factor.4 In all
such cases, requiring juries to find beyond a reasonable
doubt facts that determine the fine’s maximum amount is
necessary to implement Apprendi’s “animating principle”:
the “preservation of the jury’s historic role as a bulwark
between the State and the accused at the trial for an
alleged offense.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 168. In stating Apprendi’s rule, we have never distinguished one form of punishment from another. Instead, our decisions broadly
prohibit judicial factfinding that increases maximum
criminal “sentence[s],” “penalties,” or “punishment[s]”—
terms that each undeniably embrace fines. E.g., Blakely,
542 U. S., at 304; Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490; Ring, 536
U. S., at 589.

punishment until a later time.” Preyer 329; see also Lillquist 641–643.
2 In 2011, a fine was imposed on 9.0% of individual defendants and on
70.6% of organizational defendants in the federal system. See United
States Sentencing Commission, 2011 Annual Report, ch. 5, pp. 34, 40.

Laws, ch. 21, §34C (West 2010); N. J. Stat. Ann. §13:1E–99.89(f) (West
Supp. 2012).

twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss”); Fla. Stat. §775.083(1)(f)
