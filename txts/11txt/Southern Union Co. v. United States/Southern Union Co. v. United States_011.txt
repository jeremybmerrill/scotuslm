SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

the court imposed. Brief for United States 28. This is
exactly what Apprendi guards against: judicial factfinding
that enlarges the maximum punishment a defendant faces
beyond what the jury’s verdict or the defendant’s admissions allow.
B
In concluding that the rule of Apprendi does not apply to
criminal fines, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision
in Ice. Ice addressed the question whether, when a defendant is convicted of multiple offenses, Apprendi forbids
judges to determine facts that authorize the imposition of
consecutive sentences. 555 U. S., at 164. In holding that
Apprendi does not, Ice emphasized that juries historically
played no role in deciding whether sentences should run
consecutively or concurrently. See 555 U. S., at 168–169.
The Court of Appeals reasoned that juries were similarly
uninvolved in setting criminal fines. 630 F. 3d, at 35.5
The Court of Appeals was correct to examine the historical record, because “the scope of the constitutional jury
right must be informed by the historical role of the jury
at common law.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170. See also, e.g.,
Blakely, 542 U. S., at 301–302; Apprendi, 530 U. S., at
477–484. But in our view, the record supports applying
——————
5 Ice also stated in dicta that applying Apprendi to consecutiveversus-concurrent sentencing determinations might imperil a variety of
sentencing decisions judges commonly make, including “the imposition
of statutorily prescribed fines.” 555 U. S., at 171. The Court of Appeals
read this statement to mean that Apprendi does not apply to criminal
fines. 630 F. 3d, at 34. We think the statement is at most ambiguous,
and more likely refers to the routine practice of judges’ imposing fines
from within a range authorized by jury-found facts. Such a practice
poses no problem under Apprendi because the penalty does not exceed
what the jury’s verdict permits. See 530 U. S., at 481. In any event,
our statement in Ice was unnecessary to the judgment and is not
binding. Central Va. Community College v. Katz, 546 U. S. 356, 363
(2006).
