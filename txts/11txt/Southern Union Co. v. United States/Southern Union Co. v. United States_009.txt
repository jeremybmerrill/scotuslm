SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

onerous than incarceration and the death sentence. The
Government notes that Apprendi itself referred to the
physical deprivation of liberty that imprisonment occasions, see 530 U. S., at 484, and that we have placed more
weight on imprisonment than on fines when construing
the scope of the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel and
jury trial. See Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538,
542–543 (1989) (jury trial); Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367,
373–374 (1979) (counsel). Therefore, the Government
concludes, fines categorically “do not implicate” the “primary concerns motivating Apprendi.” Brief for United
States 23–25.
This argument fails because its conclusion does not follow from its premise. Where a fine is so insubstantial that
the underlying offense is considered “petty,” the Sixth
Amendment right of jury trial is not triggered, and no
Apprendi issue arises. See, e.g., Muniz v. Hoffman, 422
U. S. 454, 477 (1975) ($10,000 fine imposed on labor union
does not entitle union to jury trial); see also Blanton,
489 U. S., at 541 (no jury trial right for “petty” offenses,
as measured by the “severity of the maximum authorized
penalty” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The same,
of course, is true of offenses punishable by relatively brief
terms of imprisonment—these, too, do not entitle a defendant to a jury trial. See id., at 543 (establishing a
rebuttable presumption that offenses punishable by six
months’ imprisonment or less are petty); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 159–162 (1968).
But not all fines are insubstantial, and not all offenses
punishable by fines are petty. See, e.g., Mine Workers v.
Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 838, n. 5 (1994) (criminal contempt
fine of $52 million imposed on union “unquestionably is
a serious contempt sanction” that triggers right of jury
trial). The federal twice-the-gain-or-loss statute, in particular, see 18 U. S. C. §3571(d), has been used to obtain
substantial judgments against organizational defendants.
