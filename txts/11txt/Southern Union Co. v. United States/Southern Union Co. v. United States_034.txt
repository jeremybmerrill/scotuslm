BREYER, J., dissenting

of 1790, ch. 9, §21, 1 Stat. 117 (any person who bribes a
judge “on conviction thereof shall be fined and imprisoned
at the discretion of the court”); §28, 1 Stat. 118 (any per­
son who does violence to an ambassador or public minister, “on conviction, shall be imprisoned not exceeding
three years, and fined at the discretion of the court”).
Others set only a maximum limitation. E.g., Act of Mar. 3,
1791, ch. 15, §39, 1 Stat. 208 (officer of inspection convicted of oppression or extortion “shall be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisoned not exceeding six
months, or both, at the discretion of the court”). In respect
to these statutes, Justice Iredell wrote in 1795 that the
“common law practice . . . must be adhered to; that is to
say, the jury are to find whether the prisoner be guilty,
and . . . the court must assess the fine.” United States v.
Mundell, 27 F. Cas. 23, 24 (No. 15,834) (CC Va.).
Still other statutes, as in England, specifically keyed the
amount of the fine to a specific factual finding. A section
of the Crimes Act of 1790, for example, said that any
person who upon United States property or the high seas
“shall take and carry away, with an intent to steal or
purloin the personal goods of another . . . shall, on convic­
tion, be fined not exceeding the fourfold value of the prop­
erty so stolen.” §16, 1 Stat. 116. This crime has several
elements: (1) taking and (2) carrying away (3) with intent
to steal (4) personal goods (5) belonging to another (6) on
United States property or the high seas. The jury must
find the existence of these facts beyond a reasonable doubt
to establish a conviction. But the statute also says that
the fine cannot exceed “the fourfold value of the property
so stolen.” And it thereby requires the finding of a sen­
tencing fact, namely the value of the stolen property. Who
would make this determination—judge or jury?
Unlike in 18th-century England, in the United States
there is case law directly answering the question. In
United States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch 285 (1812), this Court
