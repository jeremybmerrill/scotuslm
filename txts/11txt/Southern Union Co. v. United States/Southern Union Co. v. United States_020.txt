BREYER, J., dissenting

SOUTHERN UNION COMPANY, PETITIONER v.

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[June 21, 2012] 


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY and
JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
Where a criminal fine is at issue, I believe the Sixth
Amendment permits a sentencing judge to determine sentencing facts—facts that are not elements of the crime
but are relevant only to the amount of the fine the judge
will impose. Those who framed the Bill of Rights under­
stood that “the finding of a particular fact” of this kind
was ordinarily a matter for a judge and not necessarily
“within ‘the domain of the jury.’ ” Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S.
160, 168 (2009) (quoting Harris v. United States, 536 U. S.
545, 557 (2002) (plurality opinion)). The Court’s contrary
conclusion, I believe, is ahistorical and will lead to in­
creased problems of unfairness in the administration of
our criminal justice system.

Although this dissent does not depend upon the dissents
in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and
its progeny, summarizing those earlier dissents will help
the reader understand this one. See id., at 523–554
(O’Connor, J., dissenting); id., at 555–556 (BREYER, J.,
dissenting); see also United States v. Booker, 543 U. S.
220, 327 (2005) (BREYER, J., dissenting in part) (citing
cases); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 329 (2004)
