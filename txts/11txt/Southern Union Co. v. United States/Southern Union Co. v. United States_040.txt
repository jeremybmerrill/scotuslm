BREYER, J., dissenting

wealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. 245, 246 (1804). But those deci­
sions nonetheless rest in significant part upon the jury’s
traditional larceny factfinding role. In Hope v. Commonwealth, 9 Metcalf 134 (1845), for example, the Massachu­

“The well settled practice, familiar to us all, has been
that of stating in the indictment the value of the arti­

to adhere to the well established doctrine in such
cases . . . . It may also be suggested, that, in the case
of simple larceny, the respondent may be sentenced
to pay the owner of the goods stolen, treble the value
thereof, which is an additional reason for requiring
