SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

(BREYER, J., dissenting) (same). The Apprendi dissenters
argued that the law had long distinguished between (1)
facts that constitute elements of the offense and (2) facts
relevant only to sentencing. The term “elements of the
offense” means “constituent parts of a crime . . . that the
prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.” Black’s
Law Dictionary 597 (9th ed. 2009). The statute that cre­
ates the crime in question typically sets forth those con­
stituent parts. And a jury must find the existence of
each such element “beyond a reasonable doubt.” See, e.g.,
United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995); In re
Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970).
Thus, a bank robbery statute might prohibit an offender
from (1) taking by force or by intimidation (2) in the pres­
ence of another person (3) a thing of value (4) belonging to,
or in custody of, a bank. In that case, the jury can convict
only if it finds the existence of each of these four factual
“elements” beyond a reasonable doubt. But it need not
find other facts beyond a reasonable doubt, for these four
factual elements alone constitute the crime.
Other facts may be relevant to the length or kind of
sentence the court will impose upon a convicted offender.
These sentencing facts typically characterize the manner
in which the offender carried out the crime or set forth
relevant features characterizing the offender. For exam­
ple, in respect to manner, an offender might have carried
out a particular bank robbery
“with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hid­
den (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely
warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up
(or simply pushed) a guard, teller, or customer, at
night (or at noon), in an effort to obtain money for
other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of
a few (or many) other robbers . . . .” United States
Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §1A1.3,
