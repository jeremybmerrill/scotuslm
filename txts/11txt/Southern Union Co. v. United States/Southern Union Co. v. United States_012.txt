Opinion of the Court

Apprendi to criminal fines. To be sure, judges in the colonies and during the founding era “possessed a great deal
of discretion” in determining whether to impose a fine
and in what amount. Lillquist 640–641; see also Preyer
350. Often, a fine’s range “was apparently without limit
except insofar as it was within the expectation on the part
of the court that it would be paid.” Ibid. For some other
offenses, the maximum fine was capped by statute. See,
e.g., id., at 333 (robbery, larceny, burglary, and other
offenses punishable in Massachusetts Bay Colony “by
fines of up to £5”); Act of Feb. 28, 1803, ch. 9, §7, 2 Stat.
205 (any consul who gives a false certificate shall “forfeit
and pay a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, at the
discretion of the court”); K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of
Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9
(1998) (describing federal practice).
The exercise of such sentencing discretion is fully consistent with Apprendi, which permits courts to impose
“judgment within the range prescribed by statute.” 530
U. S., at 481 (emphasis in original). Nor, a fortiori, could
there be an Apprendi violation where no maximum is
prescribed. Indeed, in surveying the historical record that
formed the basis of our holding in Apprendi, we specifically considered the English practice with respect to fines,
which, as was true of many colonial offenses, made sentencing largely “dependent upon judicial discretion.” See
id., at 480, n. 7; see also Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.
227, 244–245 (1999); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on
the Laws of England 372–373 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone). And even then, as the dissent acknowledges, post,
at 11–12 (opinion of BREYER, J.), there is authority suggesting that English juries were required to find facts that
determined the authorized pecuniary punishment. See
1 T. Starkie, A Treatise on Criminal Pleading 187–188
(1814) (In cases “where the offence, or its defined measure
of punishment, depends upon” property’s specific value,
