BREYER, J., dissenting

prison term but also the amount of a fine. See Iontcheva,
Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice, 89 Va. L. Rev.
311, 317 (2003); King, Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing
in the United States 78 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 937, 963 (2003).
The courts that considered this practice, however, did
not believe that the constitutional right to jury trial com­
pelled it.
Alabama’s Supreme Court, for example, explained that
its State’s jury-sentencing system, which allowed the jury
“to determine both the fine and imprisonment,” was in
derogation of, and created “an innovation upon[,] the rules
of the common law, so far as it transfers [those] powers
from the court to the jury.” Hawkins v. State, 3 Stew. & P.
63 (1832). Thus, in State v. Garner, 8 Port. 447 (1839), see
ante, at 10, the malicious mischief statute at issue said
that the offender would “ ‘be fined in such sum as the jury
trying the same may assess, not exceeding four fold the
value of the property injured or destroyed.’ ” 8 Port., at
448 (emphasis added). The statute, in other words, trans­
ferred all sentencing facts to the jury and was not illus­
trative of 18th-century practice. Further, the statute said
that the “ ‘fine shall be paid to the party injured.’ ” Ibid.
The court held that it was consequently proper to allege
the amount of the property’s value in the indictment, not
because the State’s constitution required any such thing,
but because “the fine thus assesse[d] is for the benefit of
the injured party”; the case “is, therefore, a quasi civil
proceeding”; and for that reason “it would be more consonant to the rules of pleading, and to the principles
which govern analogous cases, that the indictment should
contain an averment of the value of the property.” Ibid.;
Ord, Law of Usury, at 122–123 (usury as quasi-civil
proceeding).
Illinois law was similar.
Illinois became a jury­
sentencing State in 1831. See Iontcheva, supra, at 317,
n. 28 (citing Act of Feb. 15, 1831, §42, 1830 Ill. Laws 103,
