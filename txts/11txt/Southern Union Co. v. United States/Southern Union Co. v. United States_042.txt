BREYER, J., dissenting

not the jury, would normally determine fine-related sen­
tencing facts. In this respect, ordinary 18th-century sen­
tencing practice related to fines was unlike sentencing
practice in respect to felonies. In the latter case, in Apprendi’s view, punishment was normally “fixed” and the
judge’s sentencing role was consequently minimal. 530
U. S., at 478–480. In the former case, namely fines, the
judge’s role was not normally minimal, but the opposite.
For these reasons, I believe that allowing a judge to de­
termine sentencing facts related to imposition of a fine
does not invade the historic province of the jury. The
historical test that we set forth in Ice is satisfied.

In Ice, we also took account of the practical extent
to which extending Apprendi’s rule beyond the “ ‘central
sphere of [its] concern’ ” would “diminish” the States’ “role”
in “devising solutions to difficult legal problems . . . absent
impelling reason to do so.” 555 U. S., at 171–172. In
particular, we feared that insisting that juries determine
the relevant sentencing facts (concerning concurrent, as
opposed to consecutive, punishment) would unjustifiably
interfere with a State’s legislative efforts “to rein in the
discretion judges possessed at common law to impose
consecutive sentences at will.” Id., at 171. It would inhibit (indeed “straightjacke[t]”) States seeking to make
“concurrent sentences the rule, and consecutive sentences
the exception.” Ibid. We said that we were “unclear how
many other state initiatives would fall” if Apprendi were
extended, and that expansion would be “difficult for
States to administer.” Id., at 171–172. We believed that
these considerations argued strongly against any such
“expansion.”
Here, the same kinds of considerations similarly argue
against “expansion” of Apprendi’s rule. Today’s decision
applies to the States. In the 1950’s and thereafter, States
