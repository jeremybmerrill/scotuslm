Opinion of the Court

App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. The court therefore set a
maximum potential fine of $38.1 million, from which
it imposed a fine of $6 million and a “community service
obligatio[n]” of $12 million. App. 154.
On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit rejected the District Court’s conclusion that
the jury necessarily found a violation of 762 days. 630
F. 3d 17, 36 (2010). But the Court of Appeals affirmed
the sentence because it also held, again in contrast to the
District Court, that Apprendi does not apply to criminal
fines. 630 F. 3d, at 33–36. Other Circuits have reached
the opposite conclusion. See United States v. Pfaff, 619
F. 3d 172 (CA2 2010) (per curiam); United States v.
LaGrou Distribution Sys., Inc., 466 F. 3d 585 (CA7 2006).
We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 565 U. S. ___
(2011), and now reverse.

This case requires us to consider the scope of the Sixth
Amendment right of jury trial, as construed in Apprendi.
Under Apprendi, “[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond
the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a
jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U. S., at
490. The “ ‘statutory maximum’ for Apprendi purposes is
the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the
basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted
by the defendant.” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis
deleted). Thus, while judges may exercise discretion in
sentencing, they may not “inflic[t] punishment that the
jury’s verdict alone does not allow.” Id., at 304.
Apprendi’s rule is “rooted in longstanding common-law
practice.” Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 281
(2007). It preserves the “historic jury function” of “determining whether the prosecution has proved each element
