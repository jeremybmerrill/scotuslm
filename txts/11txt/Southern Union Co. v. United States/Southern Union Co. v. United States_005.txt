SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

tiple counts of violating federal environmental statutes.
As relevant here, the first count alleged that the company
knowingly stored liquid mercury without a permit at the
Pawtucket facility “[f ]rom on or about September 19, 2002
until on or about October 19, 2004,” App. 104, in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of
1976 (RCRA). See 90 Stat. 2812, as amended, 42 U. S. C.
§6928(d)(2)(A). A jury convicted Southern Union on this
count following a trial in the District Court for the District
of Rhode Island. The verdict form stated that Southern
Union was guilty of unlawfully storing liquid mercury
“on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004.”
App. 140.
Violations of the RCRA are punishable by, inter alia,
“a fine of not more than $50,000 for each day of violation.”
§6928(d). At sentencing, the probation office set a maximum fine of $38.1 million, on the basis that Southern
Union violated the RCRA for each of the 762 days from
September 19, 2002, through October 19, 2004. Southern
Union objected that this calculation violated Apprendi
because the jury was not asked to determine the precise
duration of the violation. The company noted that the verdict form listed only the violation’s approximate start
date (i.e., “on or about”), and argued that the court’s instructions permitted conviction if the jury found even a
1-day violation. Therefore, Southern Union maintained, the
only violation the jury necessarily found was for one day,
and imposing any fine greater than the single-day penalty
of $50,000 would require factfinding by the court, in contravention of Apprendi.
The Government acknowledged the jury was not asked
to specify the duration of the violation, but argued that
Apprendi does not apply to criminal fines. The District
Court disagreed and held that Apprendi applies. But the
court concluded from the “content and context of the verdict all together” that the jury found a 762-day violation.
