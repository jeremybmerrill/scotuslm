SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus

SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIRST CIRCUIT
No. 11–94. Argued March 19, 2012—Decided June 21, 2012
Petitioner Southern Union Company was convicted by a jury in federal
court on one count of violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) for having knowingly stored liquid mercury
without a permit at a subsidiary’s facility “on or about September 19,
2002 to October 19, 2004.” Violations of the RCRA are punishable by,
inter alia, a fine of not more than $50,000 for each day of violation.
42 U. S. C. §6928(d). At sentencing, the probation office calculated a
maximum fine of $38.1 million, on the basis that Southern Union violated the RCRA for each of the 762 days from September 19, 2002,
through October 19, 2004. Southern Union argued that imposing any
fine greater than the 1-day penalty of $50,000 would be unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, which holds that
the Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee requires that any fact
(other than the fact of a prior conviction) that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular crime be proved to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt. Southern Union contended that, based
on the jury verdict and the District Court’s instructions, the only violation the jury necessarily found was for one day. The District Court
held that Apprendi applies to criminal fines, but concluded from the
“content and context of the verdict all together” that the jury found a
762-day violation. The court therefore set a maximum potential fine
of $38.1 million, from which it imposed a fine of $6 million and a
“community service obligation” of $12 million. On appeal, the First
Circuit disagreed with the District Court that the jury necessarily
found a violation of 762 days. But the First Circuit affirmed the sentence because it held that Apprendi does not apply to criminal fines.
Held: The rule of Apprendi applies to the imposition of criminal fines.
