SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

necessary to enable the Circuit Court to impose the proper
fine.” Ibid. The Court’s reasoning is somewhat opaque,
but appears to rest on the text of the embargo statute,
which directed that the defendant “shall, upon conviction,
be . . . fined a sum by the Court.” Ibid. In any event,
nothing in the decision purports to construe the Sixth
Amendment. And, insofar as Tyler reflects prevailing
practice, it bears noting that both the indictment and verdict identified the value of the property at issue. See

(1962), roll 18 (indictment: “nineteen barrels of pearlashes,
which were then and there of the value of six hundred
dollars”). Whatever the precise meaning of this decision,
it does not outweigh the ample historical evidence showing
that juries routinely found facts that set the maximum
amounts of fines.
III
The Government’s remaining arguments, echoed by the
dissent (see post, at 23–28), are unpersuasive. The Government first submits that, when it comes to fines, “the
judicially found facts typically involve only quantifying
the harm caused by the defendant’s offense”—for example,
how long did the violation last, or how much money did the
defendant gain (or the victim lose)?—“as opposed to defining a separate set of acts for punishment.” Brief for
United States 25. Only the latter determination, the
Government contends, implicates Apprendi’s concerns.
This argument has two defects. First, it rests on an
assumption that Apprendi and its progeny have uniformly
rejected: that in determining the maximum punishment
for an offense, there is a constitutionally significant difference between a fact that is an “element” of the offense and
one that is a “sentencing factor.” See, e.g., 530 U. S., at
