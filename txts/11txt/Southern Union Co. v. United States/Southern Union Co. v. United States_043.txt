SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

as well as the Federal Government recognized a serious
problem in respect to the sentencing of corporations.
Fines, imposed as a punishment upon corporate offenders,
were both nonuniform (treating identical offenders differ­
ently) and too often they were set too low. Judges would
frequently fine corporations in amounts that failed to
approximate the harm a corporation had caused or the
gain that it had obtained through its illegal activity, both
because often the statutory maximums were low and because often the fines imposed tended to be substantially
lower than those maximums. See Gruner, Towards an
Organizational Jurisprudence: Transforming Corporate
Criminal Law Through Federal Sentencing Reform, 36
Ariz. L. Rev. 407, 408 (1994); Kadish, Some Observa­
tions on the Use of Criminal Sanctions in Enforcing Eco­
nomic Regulations, 30 U. Chi. L. Rev. 423, 435, n. 55 (1963);

U. L. Q. 205, 215 (1993).
Consequently, the authors of the Model Penal Code
adopted a model provision stating that, in respect to of­
fenses involving financial gain, a court could impose an
alternative “higher” fine “equal to double the pecuniary
gain derived from the offense by the offender.” Model
Penal Code §6.03(5), 10A U. L. A. 259 (2001). New York
soon thereafter adopted such a provision. N. Y. Penal Law
Ann. §80.10(2)(b) (West 2009). And other States followed
New York’s example with similar provisions permitting
judges to set fines equal to twice the gain to the offender
or twice the loss to the victim, thereby helping to diminish
disparity while helping potential victims by increasing
deterrence. E.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. §53a–44 (West
2007); Fla. Stat. §775.083(1)(f) (2010). Many of these
statutes say in particular that the “court” shall make the
finding of gain or loss, in a separate hearing if necessary.
