Opinion of the Court

See, e.g., Amended Judgment in United States v. LG Display Co., Ltd., No. 08–CR–803–SI (ND Cal.), pp. 1–2 ($400
million fine for conviction of single count of violating
Sherman Antitrust Act); Judgment in United States v.
Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, No. 08–CR–367–RJL (D DC),
pp. 1–2, 5 ($448.5 million fine for two violations of Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act); United States Sentencing Commission, 2010 Annual Report, ch. 5, p. 38 (noting fine of
$1.195 billion imposed on pharmaceutical corporation for
violations of food and drug laws). And, where the defendant is an individual, a large fine may “engender ‘a significant infringement of personal freedom.’ ” Blanton, 489
U. S., at 542 (quoting Frank v. United States, 395 U. S.
147, 151 (1969)); see also 18 U. S. C. §3572(a)(2) (requiring
court to consider “the burden that the fine will impose
upon the defendant” in determining whether to impose a
fine and in what amount).
The Government thus asks the wrong question by comparing the severity of criminal fines to that of other punishments. So far as Apprendi is concerned, the relevant
question is the significance of the fine from the perspective
of the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial guarantee. Where a
fine is substantial enough to trigger that right, Apprendi
applies in full. As we said in Cunningham, “Asking
whether a defendant’s basic jury-trial right is preserved,
though some facts essential to punishment are reserved
for determination by the judge, . . . is the very inquiry
Apprendi’s ‘bright-line rule’ was designed to exclude.” 549
U. S., at 291.
This case is exemplary. The RCRA subjects Southern
Union to a maximum fine of $50,000 for each day of
violation. 42 U. S. C. §6928(d). The Government does not
deny that, in light of the seriousness of that punishment,
the company was properly accorded a jury trial. And the
Government now concedes the District Court made factual
findings that increased both the “potential and actual” fine
