BREYER, J., dissenting

value” of the money borrowed—with half to the King and
the other half “to him or them that will sue for the same.”

on the Law of Usury 122–123 (3d ed. 1809) (treble-value
forfeitures recovered through information qui tam but discretionary fines recovered through criminal indictment).
Thus, the statutes at issue were what American courts
would later call quasi-civil statutes—part civil, part crimi­
nal; see also Beattie 457.
Parliament consequently would have had a special rea­

the pecuniary penalty. And Parliament had the authority
to depart from the common law and to insist that juries
determine sentencing facts without establishing a generally
applicable principle. The relevant question here is how
often and for what purposes Parliament did so. Black­
stone himself wrote that such statutes fixing fines in
amounts were both in derogation of the common law and
uncommon. Blackstone 372. Finally, no one here argues
that we adopt the rule actually suggested by the treatises.
That rule is not that sentencing is to be done according to
value found by the jury but instead that a discrepancy
between the value alleged and value found by the jury
might render the entire case fatal. See Starkie, supra,
at 188.
Thus, I cannot place great weight upon these statutes.
The parties did not refer to them in their briefs. And in
any event, the historical sources taken together make
clear that the predominant practice in 18th-century Eng­
land was for a judge, not a jury, to find sentencing facts
related to the imposition of a fine.
Indeed, the Court in Apprendi conceded the point. It
distinguished 18th-century punishments for greater
crimes (fixed punishments) from punishments for lesser
