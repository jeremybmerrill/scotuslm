Opinion of the Court

the value of the stolen property, and the Court remarked
that “the fine is, as to its amount, purely in the discretion
of the Court.” Id., at 209. But this statement is best
read as permitting the court to select a fine from within
the maximum authorized by jury-found facts—a practice,
as noted, that accords with Apprendi. Such a reading is
consistent with the fact that the indictment in Murphy
alleged the value of the stolen items, see 16 Pet., at 207–
208, and with the practice of contemporary courts addressing the same statute, see United States v. Holland, 26
F. Cas. 343, 345 (No. 15,378) (CC SDNY 1843) (trial court
instructs jury “to assess the value of the property taken”
in order to determine maximum fine); Pye v. United
States, 20 F. Cas. 99 (No. 11,488) (CC DC 1842) (value of
stolen items alleged in indictment).
The Government and dissent place greater reliance on
United States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch 285 (1812). But like
Murphy, this decision involved no constitutional question.
Rather, it construed a federal embargo statute that imposed a fine of four times the value of the property intended
to be exported. The indictment identified the property at
issue as “pearl-ashes,” but the jury’s guilty verdict referred instead to “ ‘pot-ashes [that] were worth two hundred and eighty dollars.’ ” Tyler, 7 Cranch, at 285.7 The
question was whether the discrepancy rendered the verdict “not sufficiently certain as to the value of the property
charged in the indictment,” i.e., pearl-ashes. Ibid. The
Court held that the discrepancy was immaterial, on the
ground that “under this law, no valuation by the jury was
