SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

to extend Apprendi’s rule to a new category of sentence­
related facts for two basic reasons.
First, we considered a historical question, namely,
whether “the finding of a particular fact was understood
as within ‘the domain of the jury . . . by those who framed
the Bill of Rights.’ ” 555 U. S., at 168 (quoting Harris, 536
U. S., at 557). And we read the “historical record” as
showing that “in England before the founding of our Na­
tion, and in the early American States,” the jury “played
no role in the decision to impose sentences consecutively
or concurrently.” 555 U. S., at 168–169 (footnote omitted).
Rather, that decision “rested exclusively with the judge.”
Id., at 168.
Second, recognizing that “administration of a discrete
criminal justice system is among the [States’] basic sover­
eign prerogatives,” we considered the need to “respect . . .
state sovereignty.” Ibid. We expressed concern lest appli­
cation of Apprendi to this kind of decision inhibit state
legislative efforts to establish a fairer sentencing system
by helping to bring about more uniform sentencing. Ice,
555 U. S., at 171. We concluded that “[n]either Apprendi
nor our Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacket­
ing the States” in this respect. Ibid.
This case presents another new category of fact-related
sentencing decisions, namely, decisions about the amount
of a fine. Thus, as the majority recognizes, we must begin with a historical question. Ante, at 8. Who—judge or
jury—found the facts that determine the amount of a
criminal fine “in England before the founding of our
Nation, and in the early American States?” Ice, supra, at
169 (footnote omitted). Unlike the majority, I believe
the answer to this question is that, in most instances, the
judge made that determination.
