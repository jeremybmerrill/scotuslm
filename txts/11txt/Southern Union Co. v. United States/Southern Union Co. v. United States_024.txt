BREYER, J., dissenting

relevant only to the determination of the offender’s pun­
ishment. See, e.g., Booker, supra, at 329 (BREYER, J.,
dissenting in part); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 527–529
(O’Connor, J., dissenting).
The dissenters lost the argument. The Court in Apprendi held that (other than the fact of a prior conviction)
“any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the
prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a
jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at 490.
But the dissenters’ views help to explain why I continue to
believe this Court should not extend Apprendi’s rule be­
yond “ ‘the central sphere of [its] concern.’ ” Ice, 555 U. S.,
at 172 (quoting Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270,
295 (2007) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)). That is the Court’s
view, too, as set forth in Ice. And I base my dissent here
primarily upon Ice.

. . . shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not
more than $50,000 for each day of violation, or im­
prisonment not to exceed . . . five years . . . , or both.”
§6928(d)(2)(A).
No one here denies that this statute creates a crime with
four elements: (1) knowing treatment, storage, or disposal
of a waste (2) that is hazardous, (3) without a permit, and
(4) knowing that the waste has a substantial potential of
