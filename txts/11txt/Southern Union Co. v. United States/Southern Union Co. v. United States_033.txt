SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

crimes (included fines). 530 U. S., at 480, n. 7. And it
wrote that “judges most commonly imposed discretionary
‘sentences’ of fines . . . upon misdemeanants.” Ibid. (em­
phasis added). Insofar as 18th-century English practice
helps determine what the Framers would have thought
about the scope of the Constitution’s terms—here, the
Sixth Amendment’s right to trial by an impartial jury—
that practice suggests they would not have expected that
right to include determination of sentencing facts relevant
only to the imposition of a fine.
B
Practice in the “early American States” is even less ambiguous. In the colonial era, judges would normally
determine the amount of a fine (within an unlimited or
otherwise broad range) while also determining related
sentencing facts (say, about the manner in which the
offender committed the crime and the offender’s character­
istics). Legal historians tell us that in the American
colonies a criminal fine was “overwhelmingly the most
common of the non-capital punishments,” that in most
instances the range of the fine was “apparently without
limit except insofar as it was within the expectation of the
court that it would be paid,” that the judge established the
precise amount of the fine, and that the amount was “tai­
lored individually to the particular case.” Preyer, Penal
Measures in the American Colonies: An Overview, 26 Am.
J. Legal Hist. 326, 350 (1982). “[C]olonial judges, like
their English brethren, possessed a great deal of discre­
tion” and could set the amount of fine “depending upon
the nature of the defendant and the crime.” Lillquist, 82
N. C. L. Rev., at 640–641.
Enactment of the Constitution and Bill of Rights did not
change this practice. Some early American statutes speci­
fied that the judge has discretion to set the amount of the
fine while saying nothing about amount. E.g., Crimes Act
