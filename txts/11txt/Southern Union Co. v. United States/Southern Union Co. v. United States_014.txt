indictment” in part because “[o]ur statutes . . . prescribe
the punishment for larceny, with reference to the value
of the property stolen”); State v. Goodrich, 46 N. H. 186,
188 (1865) (“It may also be suggested, that, in the case of
simple larceny, the respondent may be sentenced to pay
the owner of the goods stolen, treble the value thereof,
which is an additional reason for requiring the [value of
the stolen items] to be stated [in the indictment]”); United
States v. Woodruff, 68 F. 536, 538 (Kan. 1895) (“[T]he
defendant is entitled to his constitutional right of trial by
jury” to ascertain “the exact sum for which a fine may be
imposed”).6

6 The dissent believes these decisions are inapposite because some of
them arose in States that authorized juries, rather than judges, to impose sentence. See post, at 18–20. But this fact was not the basis of
the decisions; rather, the courts required value to be alleged and proved
to the jury because “the extent of the punishment . . . depend[s] upon
the value of the property consumed or injured.” Ritchey, 7 Blackf.,
at 169; see also, e.g., Clark, 2 Ill., at 120–121 (same). And as Bishop
explained, this requirement of proof originated not from a unique feature of jury sentencing, but from longstanding common-law principles—a point to which the dissent notably does not respond. 1 J.
Bishop, Criminal Procedure §§81, 540 (2d ed. 1872). See infra, at 12.
Nor, for that matter, do larceny cases “presen[t] a special circumstance.” Post, at 20. Such decisions invoked the same reasoning as the
other cases just mentioned. See, e.g., Hope, 50 Mass., at 137 (value
must be proved because, among other things, “[o]ur statutes . . . prescribe the punishment for larceny . . . with reference to the value of the
property stolen”); Goodrich, 46 N. H., at 188 (same). Bishop made this
point explicit: “[Value] must be alleged wherever it is an element to
be considered by the court in determining the punishment, and it is
immaterial whether the particular crime is larceny or any other crime.”
Criminal Procedure §541, at 331 (footnote omitted and emphasis
added). At the end of the day, the only evidence the dissent musters
that judges found fine-enhancing facts are United States v. Tyler, 7
Cranch 285 (1812), and one lower-court decision restating Tyler’s
holding. See post, at 15–17. We address Tyler below. See infra, at
13–14.
