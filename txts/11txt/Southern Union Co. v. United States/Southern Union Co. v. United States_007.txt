SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.” Oregon v. Ice,
555 U. S. 160, 163 (2009). We have repeatedly affirmed
this rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes
that allowed judges to find facts that increased a defendant’s maximum authorized sentence. See Cunningham,
549 U. S., at 274–275 (elevated “upper term” of imprisonment); United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 226–
227, 233–234 (2005) (increased imprisonment range for
defendant under then-mandatory Federal Sentencing
Guidelines); Blakely, 542 U. S., at 299–300 (increased imprisonment above statutorily prescribed “standard range”);
Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 588–589 (2002) (death
penalty authorized upon finding existence of aggravating
factors); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 468–469 (extended term
of imprisonment based on violation of a “hate crime”
statute).
While the punishments at stake in those cases were
imprisonment or a death sentence, we see no principled
basis under Apprendi for treating criminal fines differently. Apprendi’s “core concern” is to reserve to the jury
“the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a
specific statutory offense.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170. That
concern applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or
imprisonment or death. Criminal fines, like these other
forms of punishment, are penalties inflicted by the sovereign for the commission of offenses. Fines were by far the
most common form of noncapital punishment in colonial
America.1 They are frequently imposed today, especially
