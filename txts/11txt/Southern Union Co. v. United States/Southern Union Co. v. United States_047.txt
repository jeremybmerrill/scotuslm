SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

party’s bargaining position rather than the conduct of
many actual trials.
At the same time, the prosecutor in such a system,
perhaps armed with statutes providing for mandatory
minimum sentences, can become the ultimate adjudicator.
The prosecutor/adjudicator plays an important role in
many “European inquisitorial” systems. But those prose­
cutors, unlike ours, typically are trained formally to be
more like neutral adjudicators than advocates. Cf. Lang­
bein & Weinreb, Continental Criminal Procedure: “Myth”
and Reality, 87 Yale L. J. 1549, 1559 (1978); see, e.g.,
Ècole Nationale de la Magistrature. Today’s holding, by
unnecessarily complicating the trial process, may prove
workable only because it nudges our system slightly fur­
ther in this direction. I see no virtue in doing so.
For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.
