BREYER, J., dissenting

Circuit Court to impose the proper fine.” Ibid. (emphasis
added). The Court did not say explicitly that the Sixth
Amendment permitted the judge to find the relevant sen­
tencing fact. See ante, at 14. But it seems unlikely
that a Court that included Chief Justice John Marshall,
Justice Joseph Story, and others familiar with both the
common law and the Constitution would have interpreted
a federal statute as they did if either contemporary legal
practice or the Constitution suggested or required a differ­

Nor can we say that the Court did not fully consider the
matter. Justice Story later authoritatively interpreted
Tyler. Sitting as a Circuit Justice in United States v.
Mann, 26 F. Cas. 1153 (No. 15,717) (CCNH 1812), he
considered the same judge/jury question in respect to the
same embargo statute. His court wrote that in “Tyler, 7
Cranch 285, in a prosecution on this same clause, the court
held that the fine and quadruple value must be assessed
and adjudged by the court, and not by the jury.” Id., at
1153 (emphasis added); see also 26 F. Cas. 1153, 1155
(No. 15,718) (CCNH 1812) (Story, J.) (noting that the Supreme Court would not have reached its result unless
satisfied “that the fine was to be imposed by the court, and
not found by the jury”).
Thus, nothing in early American practice suggests that
the Framers thought that the Sixth Amendment jury trial
right encompassed a right to have a jury determine fine­
related sentencing facts. But, to the contrary, there is a
Supreme Court opinion, namely Tyler, that holds, or at
least strongly indicates, the opposite.

The majority reaches a different conclusion. But the
majority does not pose what I believe to be the relevant
historical question, namely whether traditionally “in
England before the founding of our Nation, and in the
