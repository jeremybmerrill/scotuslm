ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

Under our case law, determining the constitutionality of
an Act of Congress may present a political question, but I
do not think that the narrow question presented here falls
within that category. Delineating the precise dividing line
between the powers of Congress and the President with
respect to the contents of a passport is not an easy matter,
but I agree with the Court that it does not constitute a
political question that the Judiciary is unable to decide.
