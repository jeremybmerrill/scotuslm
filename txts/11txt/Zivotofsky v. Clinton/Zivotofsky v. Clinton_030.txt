ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
BREYER, J., dissenting

at 243–247.
Second, if the courts must answer the constitutional
question before us, they may well have to evaluate the
foreign policy implications of foreign policy decisions. The
constitutional question focuses upon a statutory provision,
§214(d), that says: The Secretary of State, upon the request of a U. S. citizen born in Jerusalem (or upon the
request of the citizen’s legal guardian), shall “record” in
the citizen’s passport or consular birth report “the place
of birth as Israel.” 116 Stat. 1366. And the question is
whether this statute unconstitutionally seeks to limit the
President’s inherent constitutional authority to make certain kinds of foreign policy decisions. See American Ins.
Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414–415 (2003)
(citing cases); Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417,
445 (1998) (“[T]his Court has recognized that in the foreign affairs arena, the President has ‘a degree of discretion
and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be
admissible were domestic affairs alone involved’ ” (quoting
United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S.
304, 320 (1936))); cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.
v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 637–638 (1952) (Jackson, J.,
concurring).
The Secretary of State argues that the President’s constitutional authority to determine foreign policy includes
the power to recognize foreign governments, that this
Court has long recognized that the latter power belongs
to the President exclusively, that the power includes the
power to determine claims over disputed territory as well
as the policy governing recognition decisions, and that the
statute unconstitutionally limits the President’s exclusive
authority to exercise these powers. See U. S. Const., Art.
II, §2, cl. 2; Art. II, §3; e.g., Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How.
38, 50–51 (1852) (recognition); Williams, supra, at 420
(disputed territory); Pink, supra, at 229 (recognition policy); see also Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (execu-
