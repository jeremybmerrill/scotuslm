Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

ble standards,’ ” ante, at 8, because the parties’ arguments
rely on textual, structural, and historical evidence of the
kind that courts routinely consider. But that was equally
true in Nixon, a case in which we found that “the use of
the word ‘try’ in the first sentence of the Impeachment
Trial Clause lacks sufficient precision to afford any judicially manageable standard of review of the Senate’s
actions.” 506 U. S., at 230. We reached that conclusion
even though the parties’ briefs focused upon the text of the
Impeachment Trial Clause, “the Constitution’s drafting
history,” “contemporaneous commentary,” “the unbroken
practice of the Senate for 150 years,” contemporary dictionary meanings, “Hamilton’s Federalist essays,” and the
practice in the House of Lords prior to ratification. Such
evidence was no more or less unfamiliar to courts than
that on which the parties rely here.
In my view, it is not whether the evidence upon which
litigants rely is common to judicial consideration that
determines whether a case lacks judicially discoverable
and manageable standards. Rather, it is whether that
evidence in fact provides a court a basis to adjudicate
meaningfully the issue with which it is presented. The
answer will almost always be yes, but if the parties’ textual, structural, and historical evidence is inapposite or
wholly unilluminating, rendering judicial decision no more
than guesswork, a case relying on the ordinary kinds of
arguments offered to courts might well still present justiciability concerns.
In this case, however, the Court of Appeals majority
found a political question solely on the basis that this case
required resolution of an issue “textually committed” to
the Executive Branch. Because there was no such textual
commitment, I respectfully concur in the Court’s decision
to reverse the Court of Appeals.
