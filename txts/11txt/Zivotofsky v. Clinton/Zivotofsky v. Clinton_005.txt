Opinion of the Court

Sept. 30, 2002, p. 1698 (2005). He added that if the section is “construed as mandatory,” then it would “interfere
with the President’s constitutional authority to formulate
the position of the United States, speak for the Nation in
international affairs, and determine the terms on which
recognition is given to foreign states.” Ibid. He concluded
by emphasizing that “U. S. policy regarding Jerusalem has
not changed.” Ibid. The President made no specific reference to the passport mandate in §214(d).
B
Petitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in
Jerusalem on October 17, 2002, shortly after §214(d) was
enacted. Zivotofsky’s parents were American citizens and
he accordingly was as well, by virtue of congressional
enactment. 8 U. S. C. §1401(c); see Rogers v. Bellei, 401
U. S. 815, 835 (1971) (foreign-born children of American
citizens acquire citizenship at birth through “congressional generosity”). Zivotofsky’s mother filed an application
for a consular report of birth abroad and a United States
passport. She requested that his place of birth be listed as
“Jerusalem, Israel” on both documents. U. S. officials
informed Zivotofsky’s mother that State Department
policy prohibits recording “Israel” as Zivotofsky’s place of
birth. Pursuant to that policy, Zivotofsky was issued a
passport and consular report of birth abroad listing only
“Jerusalem.” App. 19–20.
Zivotofsky’s parents filed a complaint on his behalf
against the Secretary of State. Zivotofsky sought a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction ordering
the Secretary to identify his place of birth as “Jerusalem,
Israel” in the official documents. Id., at 17–18. The District Court granted the Secretary’s motion to dismiss the
complaint on the grounds that Zivotofsky lacked standing
and that his complaint presented a nonjusticiable political
question.
