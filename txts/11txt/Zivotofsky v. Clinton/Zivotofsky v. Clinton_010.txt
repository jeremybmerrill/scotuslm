Perhaps. But there is, of course, no exclusive commitment
to the Executive of the power to determine the constitutionality of a statute. The Judicial Branch appropriately
exercises that authority, including in a case such as this,
where the question is whether Congress or the Executive
is “aggrandizing its power at the expense of another
branch.” Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878
(1991); see, e.g., Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 176
(1926) (finding a statute unconstitutional because it encroached upon the President’s removal power); Bowsher v.
Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 734 (1986) (finding a statute unconstitutional because it “intruded into the executive
function”); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 685 (1988)
(upholding a statute’s constitutionality against a charge
that it “impermissibly interfere[d] with the President’s
exercise of his constitutionally appointed functions”).
Our precedents have also found the political question
doctrine implicated when there is “ ‘a lack of judicially
discoverable and manageable standards for resolving’ ” the
question before the court. Nixon, supra, at 228 (quoting
Baker, supra, at 217). Framing the issue as the lower
courts did, in terms of whether the Judiciary may decide
the political status of Jerusalem, certainly raises those
concerns. They dissipate, however, when the issue is
recognized to be the more focused one of the constitutionality of §214(d). Indeed, both sides offer detailed legal
arguments regarding whether §214(d) is constitutional in
light of powers committed to the Executive, and whether
Congress’s own powers with respect to passports must be
weighed in analyzing this question.
For example, the Secretary reprises on the merits her
argument on the political question issue, claiming that the
Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to
formulate recognition policy. She roots her claim in the
