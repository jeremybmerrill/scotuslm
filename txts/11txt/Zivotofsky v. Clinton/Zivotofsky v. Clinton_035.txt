BREYER, J., dissenting

tee hearings, and a host of more informal contacts, which,
taken together, ensure that, in practice, Members of Congress as well as the President play an important role in
the shaping of foreign policy. Indeed, both the Legislative
Branch and the Executive Branch typically understand
the need to work each with the other in order to create
effective foreign policy. In that understanding, those
related contacts, and the continuous foreign policy-related
relationship lies the possibility of working out the kind of
disagreement we see before us. Moreover, if application of
the political-question “doctrine ultimately turns, as
Learned Hand put it, on ‘how importunately the occasion
demands an answer,’ ” Nixon, 506 U. S., at 253 (Souter, J.,
concurring in judgment) (quoting L. Hand, The Bill of
Rights 15 (1958)), the ability of the political branches to
work out their differences minimizes the need for judicial
intervention here.
The upshot is that this case is unusual both in its minimal need for judicial intervention and in its more serious
risk that intervention will bring about “embarrassment,”
show lack of “respect” for the other branches, and potentially disrupt sound foreign policy decisionmaking. For
these prudential reasons, I would hold that the politicalquestion doctrine bars further judicial consideration of
this case. And I would affirm the Court of Appeals’ similar conclusion.
With respect, I dissent.
