Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 672–673 (1892) (deeming “forbidden
by the respect due to a coordinate branch of the government” “[j]udicial action” requiring a belief in a “deliberate
conspiracy” by the Senate and House of Representatives
“to defeat an expression of the popular will”); see also
Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S., at 409–410 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (“Mutual regard between the coordinate
branches, and the interest of certainty, both demand that
official representations regarding . . . matters of internal
process be accepted at face value”). Likewise, we have
long acknowledged that courts are particularly ill suited
to intervening in exigent disputes necessitating unusual
need for “attributing finality to the action of the political
departments,” Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454
(1939), or creating acute “risk [of] embarrassment of our
government abroad, or grave disturbance at home,” Baker,
369 U. S., at 226. See, e.g., Luther, 7 How., at 43 (“After
the President has acted and called out the militia, is a
Circuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire
whether his decision was right? . . . If the judicial power
extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and
not of order”).1 Finally, it may be appropriate for courts to
stay their hand in cases implicating delicate questions
concerning the distribution of political authority between
coordinate branches until a dispute is ripe, intractable,
and incapable of resolution by the political process. See

1 See also Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 29–30 (1827) (Story, J.) (declining to review the President’s determination that an “exigency has
arisen,” necessitating the “call [of] the militia into actual service,”
recognizing need for “[a] prompt and unhesitating obedience to orders is
indispensable”); Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199, 260 (1796) (Iredell, J.,
concurring) (to declare treaty with Great Britain void would turn on
“considerations of policy, considerations of extreme magnitude, [which
are] certainly entirely incompetent to the examination and decision of a
Court of Justice”).
