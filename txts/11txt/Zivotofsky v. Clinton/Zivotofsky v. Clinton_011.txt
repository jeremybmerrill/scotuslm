Opinion of the Court

Constitution’s declaration that the President shall “receive
Ambassadors and other public Ministers.” U. S. Const.,
Art. II, §3. According to the Secretary, “[c]enturies-long
Executive Branch practice, congressional acquiescence,
and decisions by this Court” confirm that the “receive
Ambassadors” clause confers upon the Executive the
exclusive power of recognition. Brief for Respondent 18.
The Secretary observes that “President Washington and
his cabinet unanimously decided that the President could
receive the ambassador from the new government of
France without first consulting Congress.” Id., at 19
(citing Letter from George Washington to the Cabinet
(Apr. 18, 1793), reprinted in 25 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 568–569 (J. Catanzariti ed. 1992); Thomas Jefferson,

24–27 (citing, e.g., United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203
(1942)).
The Secretary further contends that §214(d) constitutes
an impermissible exercise of the recognition power because “the decision as to how to describe the place of birth
. . . operates as an official statement of whether the United
States recognizes a state’s sovereignty over a territorial
area.” Brief for Respondent 38. The Secretary will not
“list[] as a place of birth a country whose sovereignty over
the relevant territory the United States does not recognize.” Id., at 39. Therefore, she claims, “listing ‘Israel’ as
the place of birth would constitute an official decision by
