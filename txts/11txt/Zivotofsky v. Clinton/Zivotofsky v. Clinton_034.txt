ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
BREYER, J., dissenting

were clear that his imprisonment was closely bound up
with our relations to the Chinese government.” 74 Harv.
L. Rev., at 1304; see also T. Franck, Political Questions/
Judicial Answers 63–64 (1992); cf. Boumediene v. Bush,
553 U. S. 723, 755 (2008).
The interest that Zivotofsky asserts, however, is akin to
an ideological interest. See Brief for Petitioner 54 (citizen
born in Jerusalem, unlike citizen born in Tel Aviv or
Haifa, does not have the “option” to “specify or suppress the
name of a country that accords with his or her ideology”);
see also id., at 19 (State Department policy bars citizens
born in Jerusalem “from identifying their birthplace in a
manner that conforms with their convictions”). And insofar as an individual suffers an injury that is purely ideological, courts have often refused to consider the matter,
leaving the injured party to look to the political branches
for protection. E.g., Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 66–
67 (1986); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 739–740
(1972). This is not to say that Zivotofsky’s claim is unimportant or that the injury is not serious or even that it is
purely ideological. It is to point out that those suffering
somewhat similar harms have sometimes had to look to
the political branches for resolution of relevant legal issues. Cf. United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179
(1974); Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972).
Fourth, insofar as the controversy reflects different
foreign policy views among the political branches of Government, those branches have nonjudicial methods of
working out their differences. Cf. Goldwater, 444 U. S., at
1002, 1004 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and
Stewart and Stevens, JJ., concurring in judgment) (finding
in similar fact strong reason for Judiciary not to decide
treaty power question). The Executive and Legislative
Branches frequently work out disagreements through
ongoing contacts and relationships, involving, for example,
budget authorizations, confirmation of personnel, commit-
