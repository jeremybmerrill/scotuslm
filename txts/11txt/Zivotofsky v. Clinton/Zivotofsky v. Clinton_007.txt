Opinion of the Court

the issue before the court was whether §214(d) “impermissibly intrude[s] on the President’s exclusive power to
recognize foreign sovereigns.” Id., at 1234. That question,
he observed, involves “commonplace issues of statutory
and constitutional interpretation” plainly within the constitutional authority of the Judiciary to decide. Id., at
1235. Reaching the merits, Judge Edwards determined
that designating Israel as a place of birth on a passport is
a policy “in furtherance of the recognition power.” Id., at
1243. Because in his view the Constitution gives that
power exclusively to the President, Judge Edwards found
§214(d) unconstitutional. For this reason, he concluded
that Zivotofsky had no viable cause of action, and concurred in affirming the dismissal of the complaint.
Zivotofsky petitioned for certiorari, and we granted
review. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).
II
The lower courts concluded that Zivotofsky’s claim
presents a political question and therefore cannot be adjudicated. We disagree.
In general, the Judiciary has a responsibility to decide
cases properly before it, even those it “would gladly avoid.”
Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821). Our precedents have identified a narrow exception to that rule,
known as the “political question” doctrine. See, e.g., Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S.
221, 230 (1986). We have explained that a controversy
“involves a political question . . . where there is ‘a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue
to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially
discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.’ ”
Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228 (1993) (quoting
Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962)). In such a case,
we have held that a court lacks the authority to decide the
dispute before it.
