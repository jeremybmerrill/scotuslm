BREYER, J., dissenting

tive passport authority).
Zivotofsky, supported by several Members of Congress,
points out that the Constitution also grants Congress
powers related to foreign affairs, such as the powers to
declare war, to regulate foreign commerce, and to regulate
naturalization. See Art. I, §8, cls. 3, 4, 11; see also American Ins. Assn., supra, at 414. They add that Congress may
share some of the recognition power and its attendant
power of determining claims over disputed territory. E.g.,
Palmer, supra, at 634 (recognition); Jones v. United States,
137 U. S. 202, 212 (1890) (disputed territory). And they
add that Congress may enact laws concerning travel into
this country and concerning the citizenship of children
born abroad to U. S. citizens. See Henderson v. Mayor of
New York, 92 U. S. 259, 270–271 (1876) (travel); Fong Yue
Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 714 (1893) (immigration); United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688
(1898) (citizenship). They argue that these powers include
the power to specify the content of a passport (or consular
birth report). And when such a specification takes the
form of statutory law, they say, the Constitution requires
the President (through the Secretary of State) to execute
that statute. See Art. II, §3.
Were the statutory provision undisputedly concerned
only with purely administrative matters (or were its enforcement undisputedly to involve only major foreign
policy matters), judicial efforts to answer the constitutional question might not involve judges in trying to answer questions of foreign policy. But in the Middle East,
administrative matters can have implications that extend
far beyond the purely administrative. Political reactions
in that region can prove uncertain. And in that context it
may well turn out that resolution of the constitutional
argument will require a court to decide how far the statute, in practice, reaches beyond the purely administrative,
determining not only whether but also the extent to
