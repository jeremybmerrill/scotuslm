BREYER, J., dissenting

as beyond the power of the Judiciary to review). And that
fact is not surprising. Decisionmaking in this area typically is highly political. It is “delicate” and “complex.” Chicago & Southern Air Lines, 333 U. S., at 111. It often
rests upon information readily available to the Executive
Branch and to the intelligence committees of Congress,
but not readily available to the courts. Ibid. It frequently
is highly dependent upon what Justice Jackson called
“prophecy.” Ibid. And the creation of wise foreign policy
typically lies well beyond the experience or professional
capacity of a judge. Ibid. At the same time, where foreign
affairs is at issue, the practical need for the United States
to speak “with one voice and ac[t] as one,” is particularly
important. See United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 242
(1942) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also R. Fallon,
J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and
Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System

The result is a judicial hesitancy to make decisions that
have significant foreign policy implications, as reflected in
the fact that many of the cases in which the Court has invoked the political-question doctrine have arisen in this

upon the partner state’s constitutional authority, Doe v.
Braden, 16 How. 635, 657 (1854), or upon its continuing
existence, Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 285 (1902);
cases concerning the existence of foreign states, governments, belligerents, and insurgents, Oetjen v. Central
Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297, 302 (1918); United States v.
Klintock, 5 Wheat. 144, 149 (1820); United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634–635 (1818); and cases concerning
the territorial boundaries of foreign states, Williams v.
Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420 (1839); Foster v. Neilson,
2 Pet. 253, 307 (1829). See Baker, supra, at 186, 211–213
(citing these cases as the Court’s principal foreignrelations political-question cases); see also Fallon, supra,
