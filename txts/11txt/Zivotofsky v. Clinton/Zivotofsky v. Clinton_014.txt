ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
Opinion of the Court

judicial application.” Baker, 369 U. S., at 211. Resolution of
Zivotofksy’s claim demands careful examination of the textual, structural, and historical evidence put forward by the
parties regarding the nature of the statute and of the passport and recognition powers. This is what courts do. The
political question doctrine poses no bar to judicial review of
this case.
III
To say that Zivotofsky’s claim presents issues the Judiciary is competent to resolve is not to say that reaching a
decision in this case is simple. Because the District Court
and the D. C. Circuit believed that review was barred by
the political question doctrine, we are without the benefit
of thorough lower court opinions to guide our analysis of
the merits. Ours is “a court of final review and not first
view.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S.
103, 110 (2001) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Ordinarily, “we do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.” National Collegiate
Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999). In
particular, when we reverse on a threshold question, we
typically remand for resolution of any claims the lower
courts’ error prevented them from addressing. See, e.g.,
Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,
at 1–2) (reversing the Court of Appeals’ determination on
standing and remanding because the “merits of petitioner’s challenge to the statute’s validity are to be considered,
in the first instance, by the Court of Appeals”). We see no
reason to depart from this approach in this case. Having
determined that this case is justiciable, we leave it to the
lower courts to consider the merits in the first instance.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D. C.
Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
