ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

ious pronouncements by various departments on one
question,” would express a “lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government,” or because there exists an
“unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political
decision already made.” 369 U. S., at 217. We have repeatedly rejected the view that these thresholds are met
whenever a court is called upon to resolve the constitutionality or propriety of the act of another branch of Government. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495
U. S. 385, 390–391 (1990); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S.
486, 548, 549 (1969). A court may not refuse to adjudicate
a dispute merely because a decision “may have significant
political overtones” or affect “the conduct of this Nation’s
foreign relations,” Japan Whaling Assn. v. American
Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221, 230 (1986). Nor may courts
decline to resolve a controversy within their traditional
competence and proper jurisdiction simply because the
question is difficult, the consequences weighty, or the
potential real for conflict with the policy preferences of
the political branches. The exercise of such authority is
among the “gravest and most delicate dut[ies] that this
Court is called on to perform,” Blodgett v. Holden, 275
U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring), but it is
the role assigned to courts by the Constitution. “Questions
may occur which we would gladly avoid; but we cannot
avoid them. All we can do is, to exercise our best judgment, and conscientiously to perform our duty.” Cohens v.
Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821).
Rare occasions implicating Baker’s final factors, however, may present an “ ‘unusual case’ ” unfit for judicial
disposition. 369 U. S., at 218 (quoting the argument of
Daniel Webster in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 29 (1849)).
Because of the respect due to a coequal and independent
department, for instance, courts properly resist calls to
question the good faith with which another branch attests
to the authenticity of its internal acts. See, e.g., Field v.
