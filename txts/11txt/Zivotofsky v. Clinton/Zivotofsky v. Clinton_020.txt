ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U. S. 996, 997 (1979) (Powell, J.,
concurring in judgment). Abstention merely reflects that
judicial intervention in such cases is “legitimate only in
the last resort,” Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U. S. 339, 345 (1892), and is disfavored relative
to the prospect of accommodation between the political
branches.
When such unusual cases arise, abstention accommodates considerations inherent in the separation of powers
and the limitations envisioned by Article III, which conferred authority to federal courts against a common-law
backdrop that recognized the propriety of abstention in
exceptional cases. New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v.
Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 359 (1989);
see generally Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60
N. Y. U. L. Rev. 543 (1985) (hereinafter Shapiro). The
political questions envisioned by Baker’s final categories
find common ground, therefore, with many longstanding
doctrines under which considerations of justiciability or
comity lead courts to abstain from deciding questions
whose initial resolution is better suited to another time,
see, e.g., National Park Hospitality Assn. v. Department of
Interior, 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003) (ripeness); United
States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 397
(1980) (mootness); or another forum, see, e.g., Gulf Oil
Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, 507 (1947) (forum non
conveniens); Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312
U. S. 496, 498–500 (1941); Louisiana Power & Light Co. v.
City of Thibodaux, 360 U. S. 25, 25–30 (1959); Burford v.
Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315, 333–334 (1943) (abstention in
favor of a state forum); United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 59, 63–64 (1956) (primary jurisdiction doctrine). See also DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547
U. S. 332, 352 (2006) (“The doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and political question all originate in Article III’s
‘case’ or ‘controversy’ language”); Shapiro 550–557, 580–
