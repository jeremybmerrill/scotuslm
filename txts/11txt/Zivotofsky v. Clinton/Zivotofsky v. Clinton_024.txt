ZIVOTOFSKY, PETITIONER v. HILLARY

RODHAM CLINTON, SECRETARY 

OF STATE

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

[March 26, 2012]


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.
This case presents a narrow question, namely, whether
the statutory provision at issue infringes the power of the
President to regulate the contents of a passport. This case
does not require the Judiciary to decide whether the power
to recognize foreign governments and the extent of their
territory is conferred exclusively on the President or is
shared with Congress. Petitioner does not claim that the
statutory provision in question represents an attempt by
Congress to dictate United States policy regarding the
status of Jerusalem. Instead, petitioner contends in effect
that Congress has the power to mandate that an American
citizen born abroad be given the option of including in his
passport and Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA)
what amounts to a statement of personal belief on the
status of Jerusalem.
Powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution certainly give Congress a measure of authority to prescribe
the contents of passports and CRBAs. The Constitution
gives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce,
Art. I, §8, cl. 3, and this power includes the power to regulate the entry of persons into this country, see Henderson
