ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
Opinion of the Court

the United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city
located within Israel. ” Id., at 38–39 (some internal quotation marks omitted).
For his part, Zivotofsky argues that, far from being an
exercise of the recognition power, §214(d) is instead a
“legitimate and permissible” exercise of Congress’s “authority to legislate on the form and content of a passport.”
Brief for Petitioner 53. He points the Court to Professor
Louis Henkin’s observation that “ ‘in the competition for
power in foreign relations,’ Congress has ‘an impressive
array of powers expressly enumerated in the Constitution.’ ” Id., at 45 (quoting L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and
the United States Constitution 63 (2d ed. 1996)). Zivotofsky suggests that Congress’s authority to enact §214(d)
derives specifically from its powers over naturalization,
U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and foreign commerce, id., §8,
cl. 3. According to Zivotofsky, Congress has used these
powers to pass laws regulating the content and issuance of
passports since 1856. See Brief for Petitioner 52 (citing
Act of Aug. 18, 1856, §23, 11 Stat. 60).
Zivotofsky contends that §214(d) fits squarely within

litigation that the “place of birth” entry is included only
as “an element of identification.” App. 76 (Deposition of
Catherine Barry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
Overseas Citizens Services); see Brief for Petitioner 10.
Moreover, Zivotofsky argues, the “place of birth” entry
cannot be taken as a means for recognizing foreign sovereigns, because the State Department authorizes recording
unrecognized territories—such as the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank—as places of birth. Brief for Petitioner 43
(citing 7 Foreign Affairs Manual §1383.5–5, App. 109–
110).
Further, Zivotofsky claims that even if §214(d) does
implicate the recognition power, that is not a power the
