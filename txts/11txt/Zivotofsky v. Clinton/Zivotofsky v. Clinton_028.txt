Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 253 (1993) (Souter,
J., concurring in judgment) (the political-question doctrine
“deriv[es] in large part from prudential concerns about the
respect we owe the political departments”); Goldwater v.
Carter, 444 U. S. 996, 1000 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring
in judgment) (“[T]he political-question doctrine rests in
part on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect

Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat.
1365 (“United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as
the Capital of Israel”).) The Constitution primarily delegates the foreign affairs powers “to the political departments of the government, Executive and Legislative,” not
to the Judiciary. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.
