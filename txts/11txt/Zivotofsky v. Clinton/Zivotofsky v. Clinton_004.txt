ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
Opinion of the Court

thorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat. 1350. Section
214 of the Act is entitled “United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.” Id., at 1365.
The first two subsections express Congress’s “commitment” to relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to
Jerusalem. Id., at 1365–1366. The third bars funding for
the publication of official Government documents that do
not list Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Id., at 1366.
The fourth and final provision, §214(d), is the only one at
stake in this case. Entitled “Record of Place of Birth as
Israel for Passport Purposes,” it provides that “[f]or purposes of the registration of birth, certification of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born
in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizen’s legal guardian, record
the place of birth as Israel.” Ibid.
The State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual states
that “[w]here the birthplace of the applicant is located
in territory disputed by another country, the city or area
of birth may be written in the passport.” 7 Foreign Affairs
Manual §1383.5–2, App. 108. The manual specifically
directs that passport officials should enter “JERUSALEM”
and should “not write Israel or Jordan” when recording
the birthplace of a person born in Jerusalem on a passport. Id., §1383, Exh. 1383.1, App. 127; see also id.,
§§1383.1, 1383.5–4, .5–5, .5–6, App. 106, 108–110.
Section 214(d) sought to override this instruction by
allowing citizens born in Jerusalem to have “Israel” recorded on their passports if they wish. In signing the Foreign Relations Authorization Act into law, President
George W. Bush stated his belief that §214 “impermissibly
interferes with the President’s constitutional authority to
conduct the Nation’s foreign affairs and to supervise the
unitary executive branch.” Statement on Signing the
