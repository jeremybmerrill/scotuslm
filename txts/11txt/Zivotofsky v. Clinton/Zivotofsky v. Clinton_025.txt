ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

v. Mayor of New York, 92 U. S. 259, 270–271 (1876). The
Constitution also gives Congress the power to make a
“uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and
pursuant to this power, Congress has enacted laws concerning the citizenship of children born abroad to parents
who are citizens of this country, see United States v. Wong
Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688 (1898). These powers allow
Congress to mandate that identifying information be included in passports and CRBAs.
The President also has a measure of authority concerning the contents of passports and CRBAs. The President
has broad authority in the field of foreign affairs, see, e.g.,
American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414
(2003), and, historically, that authority has included the
power to issue passports, even in the absence of any formal congressional conferral of authority to do so. See
Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (explaining that
“[p]rior to 1856, when there was no statute on the subject,
the common perception was that the issuance of a passport was committed to the sole discretion of the Executive
and that the Executive would exercise this power in the
interests of the national security and foreign policy of the
United States”). We have described a passport as “a letter
of introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for
the bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bearer.” Id., at 292. This is apparent from the first page of
petitioner’s passport, which reads as follows:
“The Secretary of State of the United States of America hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit
the citizen / national of the United States named herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of
need to give all lawful aid and protection.” App. 19.
Similarly, a CRBA is a certification made by a consular official that the bearer acquired United States citizenship
at birth. See id., at 20.
