peals and §2253(b)’s clear limit on that grant—the extent
to which Congress intended the COA process outlined in
§2253(c) to further limit the courts of appeals’ jurisdiction
over habeas appeals.
Here, the only “clear” jurisdictional language in §2253(c)
appears in §2253(c)(1). As we explained in Miller-El v.
Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 (2003), §2253(c)(1)’s plain terms—
“Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of
appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of
appeals”—establish that “until a COA has been issued
federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the
merits of appeals from habeas petitioners.” Id., at 336.
The parties thus agree that §2253(c)(1) is jurisdictional.
The parties also agree that §2253(c)(2) is nonjurisdictional.4 That is for good reason. Section 2253(c)(2) speaks
only to when a COA may issue—upon “a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” It does not
contain §2253(c)(1)’s jurisdictional terms. See Russello v.
United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (“[W]here Congress
includes particular language in one section of a statute but
omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally
presumed that Congress acts intentionally . . .”). And it
would be passing strange if, after a COA has issued, each
court of appeals adjudicating an appeal were dutybound to
revisit the threshold showing and gauge its “substantial[ity]” to verify its jurisdiction. That inquiry would be
largely duplicative of the merits question before the court.
It follows that §2253(c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well.
Like §2253(c)(2), it too reflects a threshold condition for
the issuance of a COA—the COA’s indication of “which
specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by
paragraph (2).” It too “does not speak in jurisdictional
terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [ap——————
4 The United States as amicus curiae contends that §2253(c)(2) is
jurisdictional, but the State concedes that it is not. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.
