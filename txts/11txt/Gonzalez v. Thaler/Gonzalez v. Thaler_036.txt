GONZALEZ v. THALER
SCALIA, J., dissenting

ly invoking the ever-judge-friendly principles of equity.
What began as an effort to “ ‘bring some discipline’ to the
use of the term ‘jurisdictional,’ ” ante, at 5 (quoting Henderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5)), shows signs of
becoming a libertine, liberating romp through our established jurisprudence.
II
A few remaining points raised by the Court’s opinion
warrant response.
The Court holds that the requirement imposed by paragraph (c)(2) (that a COA may issue “only if the applicant has
made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right”) is not jurisdictional, and says that “[i]t follows
that §2253(c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well.” Ante, at 7.
I need not reach the issue whether (c)(2) is jurisdictional—
though it seems to me that the Court disposes rather
summarily of the Solicitor General’s view that it is. And I
need not confront the Court with the back-at-you argument that if (c)(3) is jurisdictional (as I think) then (c)(2) is
as well. For whether one runs it backwards or forwards,
the argument is a bad one. Assuming that (c)(2) is nonjurisdictional, it does not at all “follow” that (c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well. Paragraph (c)(3) is jurisdictional not
because it is located in subsection (c), but because it describes the required content of a COA. Paragraph (c)(2)
does not; it sets forth the criterion for a COA’s issuance. A
judge may apply that criterion erroneously but still produce a COA that (as paragraph (c)(3) requires) “indicate[s]
which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required
by paragraph (2).” It no more follows that the erroneousness of the judge’s indication must destroy the jurisdiction
that the COA creates, than it followed under the predecessor statute that the erroneousness of the certification of
probable cause for an appeal destroyed the jurisdiction
