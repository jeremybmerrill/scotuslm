GONZALEZ v. THALER
SCALIA, J., dissenting

and lengthy provision into manageable subsections.
Stare Decisis Effect of Torres
In addition to the fact that conditions attached to courtto-court appeal have always been held jurisdictional, and
the fact that this statute’s predecessor was held to be so,
we have considered, and found to be jurisdictional, a statute presenting precisely what is at issue here: a provision
governing court-to-court appeals which made particular
content a required element of a document that the statute
said was necessary for jurisdiction; and which did that in a
separate section that “excluded the jurisdictional terms,”
ante, at 10. That case flatly contradicts today’s holding.
In Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, we
dealt with Rule 3(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure. Rule 3(a) of those Rules makes a notice of
appeal necessary to appellate jurisdiction—just as
§2253(c)(1) makes a certificate of appealability necessary.
And Rule 3(c)(1), which, like §2253(c)(3), does not contain
jurisdictional language, says what the requisite notice of
appeal must contain—just as §2253(c)(3) says what the
requisite certificate of appealability must contain:
“The notice of appeal must:
“(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal
by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice . . . ;
“(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof
being appealed; and
“(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.”
In Torres we held that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over the appeal of a party not properly named in
the notice of appeal. 487 U. S., at 314–315. The parallel
is perfect.
The Court claims that the jurisdictional consequences of
Rule 3(c) were “ ‘imposed by the legislature,’ ” ante, at 12
