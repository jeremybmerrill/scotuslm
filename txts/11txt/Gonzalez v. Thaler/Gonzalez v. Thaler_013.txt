GONZALEZ v. THALER
Opinion of the Court 


B

The State, aided by the United States as amicus curiae,
makes several arguments in support of jurisdictional
treatment of §2253(c)(3). None is persuasive.
First, the State notes that although §2253(c)(3) does not
speak in jurisdictional terms, it refers back to §2253(c)(1),
which does. The State argues that it is as if §2253(c)(1)
provided: “Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability that shall indicate the specific issue or
issues that satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2),
an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals.” The
problem is that the statute provides no such thing. Instead, Congress set off the requirements in distinct paragraphs and, rather than mirroring their terms, excluded
the jurisdictional terms in one from the other. Notably,
the State concedes that §2253(c)(2) is nonjurisdictional,
even though it too cross-references §2253(c)(1) and is
cross-referenced by §2253(c)(3).
Second, the State seizes on the word “shall” in
§2253(c)(3), arguing that an omitted indication renders the
COA no COA at all. But calling a rule nonjurisdictional
does not mean that it is not mandatory or that a timely
objection can be ignored. If a party timely raises the
COA’s failure to indicate a constitutional issue, the court
of appeals panel must address the defect by considering an
amendment to the COA or remanding to the district judge
for specification of the issues.7 This Court, moreover, has

to treating this rule as mandatory, post, at 4, ignores the real world.
Courts of appeals regularly amend COAs or remand for specification of
issues, notwithstanding the supposed potential to “embarras[s] a
colleague.” Post, at 5; see, e.g., Saunders v. Senkowski, 587 F. 3d 543,
545 (CA2 2009) (per curiam) (amending COA to add issue); United
States v. Weaver, 195 F. 3d 52, 53 (CADC 1999) (remanding for specification of issues). The government frequently alleges COA defects as
grounds for dismissal (as the State did here, at this late stage), appar-
