GONZALEZ v. THALER
Syllabus
further direct review in the state court expires. The Fifth Circuit did
not mention, and the State did not raise, the §2253(c)(3) defect.
When Gonzalez petitioned this Court for review, the State argued for
the first time that the Fifth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate
Gonzalez’s appeal based on the §2253(c)(3) defect.

Held:
1. Section 2253(c)(3) is a mandatory but nonjurisdictional rule. A
COA’s failure to “indicate” a constitutional issue does not deprive a
Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal. Pp. 4−13.
(a) A rule is jurisdictional “[i]f the Legislature clearly states that
a threshold limitation on a statute’s scope shall count as jurisdictional,” Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515. Here, the only clear
jurisdictional language in §2253(c) appears in §2253(c)(1). The parties agree that §2253(c)(1)’s plain terms make the issuance of a COA
a jurisdictional prerequisite. The parties also agree that §2253(c)(2),
which speaks only to when a COA may issue and does not contain
§2253(c)(1)’s jurisdictional terms, is nonjurisdictional. It follows that
§2253(c)(3) is also nonjurisdictional. Like §2253(c)(2), it reflects a
threshold condition for issuing a COA, and “does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer . . . to the jurisdiction of the [appeals] courts.”
Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515. Jurisdictional treatment also would
thwart Congress’s intent in AEDPA “to eliminate delays in the federal habeas review process.” Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___.
Once a judge has determined that a COA is warranted and resources
are deployed in briefing and argument, the COA has fulfilled its
gatekeeping function. Pp. 4−9.
(b) The State’s contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Section
2253(c)(3)’s cross-reference to §2253(c)(1) does not mean §2253(c)(3)
can be read as part of §2253(c)(1), as Congress set off the requirements in distinct paragraphs with distinct terms. The word “shall” in
§2253(c)(3), meanwhile, underscores the rule’s mandatory nature, but
not all mandatory rules are jurisdictional. Nor does §2253(c)(3)’s
mere proximity to other jurisdictional provisions turn a rule that
speaks in nonjurisdictional terms into a jurisdictional hurdle. Finally, the Court rejects the State’s attempt to analogize a COA to a notice of appeal. Pp. 10−13.
2. For a state prisoner who does not seek review in a State’s highest court, the judgment becomes “final” for purposes of §2244(d)(1)(A)
on the date that the time for seeking such review expires. Pp. 13−19.
(a) In Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, the Court held that a
federal conviction becomes final “when this Court affirms a conviction
on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari,” or, if a petitioner does not seek certiorari, “when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.” Id., at 527. In Jimenez v. Quarter-
