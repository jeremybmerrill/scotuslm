ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[January 10, 2012]


JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.
The obvious, undeniable, purpose of 28 U. S. C. §2253(c)
is to spare three-judge courts of appeals the trouble of
entertaining (and the prosecution the trouble of defending
against) appeals from the denials of relief in habeas and
§2255 proceedings, unless a district or circuit judge has
identified an issue on which the applicant has made a
substantial showing of a constitutional violation. Where
no such constitutional issue has been identified, an appeal
on other, nonconstitutional, issues (such as the statute of
limitations issue that the Court decides today) will not lie.
Today’s opinion transforms this into a provision that
allows appeal so long as a district or circuit judge, for
whatever reason or for no reason at all, approves it. This
makes a hash of the statute. The opinion thinks this
alchemy required by the Court’s previously expressed
desire to “ ‘bring some discipline’ to the use of the term
‘jurisdictional,’ ” ante, at 5 (quoting Henderson v. Shinseki,
562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5)). If that is true,
discipline has become a code word for eliminating inconvenient statutory limits on our jurisdiction. I would reverse the judgment below for want of jurisdiction.
