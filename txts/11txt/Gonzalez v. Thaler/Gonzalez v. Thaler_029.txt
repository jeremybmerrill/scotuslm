SCALIA, J., dissenting

So strict has been the rule enforcing as jurisdictional
those requirements attached to court-from-court appeals,
that we have applied it to a requirement contained in a
statute not even addressed to the courts. Section 518(a) of
Title 28 charges the Solicitor General with “conduct[ing]
and argu[ing] suits and appeals in the Supreme Court . . .
in which the United States is interested.” We held that,
absent independent statutory authority, an agency’s petition for certiorari filed without authorization from the
Solicitor General does not suffice to invoke our jurisdiction. NRA Political Victory Fund, supra, at 98–99.3
Jurisdictional enforcement of procedural requirements
for appeal has deep roots in our jurisprudence. Chief
Justice Taney dismissed an appeal in which the citation
was not issued and served in time, because “we have no
power to receive an appeal in any other mode than that
provided by law.” Villabolos, supra, at 90. And Chief
Justice Chase wrote, in a case dismissing an appeal for
failure to file in time:
“In the Judiciary Act of 1789, and in many acts since,
Congress has provided for [appellate courts’] exercise
——————
cases are “not enacted by Congress but [are] promulgated by this Court
under authority of Congress to prescribe rules,” we have held that they
may “be relaxed by the Court in the exercise of its discretion when the
ends of justice so require.” Schacht v. United States, 398 U. S. 58, 64
(1970). The indication requirement of §2253(c)(3), of course, has been
“imposed by the legislature and not by the judicial process.” Schiavone
v. Fortune, 477 U. S. 21, 31 (1986).
3 The Court cites Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S. 757 (2001), as a
counter-example. Ante, at 9, n. 6. We held there that an appellant’s
failure to sign his notice of appeal, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11(a),
within the time prescribed for filing a notice of appeal, see Fed. Rule
App. Proc. 4(a)(1), did not require dismissal where the notice itself was
timely filed. 532 U. S., at 762–763. We did not hold, however, that the
signing requirement was nonjurisdictional; we had no occasion to do so.
We held that Becker had complied with Civil Rule 11(a) because the
error was “ ‘corrected promptly after being called to [his] attention,’ ”
id., at 764 (quoting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11(a)).
