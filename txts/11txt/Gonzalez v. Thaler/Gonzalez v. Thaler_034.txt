GONZALEZ v. THALER
SCALIA, J., dissenting

Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 33–34 (1992). Or abrogate the sovereign immunity of the States? See Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985). Or give retroactive effect to new legislation? See Greene v. United
States, 376 U. S. 149, 160 (1964). Or foreclose review of
agency actions? See Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387
U. S. 136, 141 (1967). Today’s opinion is in this respect a

To make matters worse, the Advisory Committee Note
considered by the Torres Court—as “support for [its]

“ ‘Rule 3 and Rule 4 combine to require that a notice
of appeal be filed with the clerk of the district court

361 U. S. 220, 224 (1960), compliance with the provisions of those rules is of the utmost importance.’ ” 487

To say that timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and that placing within the notice of appeal what
Rule 3 says it must contain is “of the utmost importance,”
does not remotely add up to a clear statement that placing
within the notice of appeal what Rule 3 says it must contain is jurisdictional. There is simply no principled basis
for saying that Torres satisfies the “clear-statement principle,” ante, at 6, except the commonsense notion that
when a document is made jurisdictional, and the required
contents of that document specified, a document that does
not contain those contents cannot confer jurisdiction.7

to comply with Rule 3 presented a different “possibility of gamesman-
