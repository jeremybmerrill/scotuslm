Opinion of the Court

Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 277 (2005).
Finally, Gonzalez argues, as an alternative to his laterin-time construction, that his petition should be considered timely because it was filed within a year of when his
time for seeking this Court’s review—as opposed to the
Texas CCA’s review—expired. We can review, however,
only judgments of a “state court of last resort” or of a lower
state court if the “state court of last resort” has denied
discretionary review. This Court’s Rule 13.1; see also 28
U. S. C. §1257(a) (2006 ed.). Because Gonzalez did not
appeal to the Texas CCA, this Court would have lacked
jurisdiction over a petition for certiorari from the Texas
Court of Appeals’ decision affirming Gonzalez’s conviction.
We therefore decline to incorporate the 90-day period for
seeking certiorari in determining when Gonzalez’s judgment became final.

In sum, we hold that §2253(c)(3) is a mandatory but
nonjurisdictional rule. Here, the COA’s failure to “indicate” a constitutional issue did not deprive the Court of
Appeals of jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez’s appeal.
We further hold that, with respect to a state prisoner who
does not seek review in a State’s highest court, the judgment becomes “final” under §2244(d)(1)(A) when the time
for seeking such review expires—here, August 11, 2006.
We thus agree with the Court of Appeals that Gonzalez’s
federal habeas petition was time barred.
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is
Affirmed.
