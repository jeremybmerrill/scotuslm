SCALIA, J., dissenting

At the end of the day, the indication requirement in
§2253(c)(3) is “ ‘imposed by the legislature and not by
the judicial process.’ ” Torres, 487 U. S., at 318 (quoting
Schiavone v. Fortune, 477 U. S., 21, 31 (1986)). Whether
or not its enforcement leads to a harsh result, wastes time
in this particular case, or (though the Court does not give
this as a reason) prevents us from reaching a circuit
conflict we are dying to resolve, we are obliged to enforce it.
I respectfully dissent.

—————— 

today’s decision, the overruling of Torres and Browder v. Director, Dept. 

of Corrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257 (1978), and the elimination of

jurisdictional treatment for all procedural requirements for appeal.

That the announcement has not been heeded is demonstrated by

Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007) (decided after Kontrick), which

(over the dissent of the author of Kontrick) reaffirmed Browder. 
 I
confess error in joining the quoted portion of Kontrick.
