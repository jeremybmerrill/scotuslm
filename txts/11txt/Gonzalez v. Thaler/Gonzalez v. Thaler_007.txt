Opinion of the Court

rari to decide two questions, both of which implicate splits
in authority: (1) whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez’s appeal, notwithstanding
the §2253(c)(3) defect;1 and (2) whether Gonzalez’s habeas
petition was time barred under §2244(d)(1) due to the
date on which his judgment became final.2 564 U. S. ___
(2011).
II
We first consider whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez’s appeal.
A
Section 2253, as amended by AEDPA, governs appeals
in habeas corpus proceedings.
The first subsection,
§2253(a), is a general grant of jurisdiction, providing that
district courts’ final orders in habeas proceedings “shall be
subject to review, on appeal, by the court of appeals.” 28
U. S. C. §2253(a). The second, §2253(b), limits jurisdiction

1 The Circuits have divided over whether a defect in a COA is a jurisdictional bar. Compare, e.g., Phelps v. Alameda, 366 F. 3d 722, 726
(CA9 2004) (no); Porterfield v. Bell, 258 F. 3d 484, 485 (CA6 2001) (no);
Young v. United States, 124 F. 3d 794, 798–799 (CA7 1997) (no), with
United States v. Cepero, 224 F. 3d 256, 259–262 (CA3 2000) (en banc)
(yes).
2 The Circuits have divided over when a judgment becomes final if a
petitioner forgoes review in a State’s highest court. Compare, e.g., 623
F. 3d 222, 226 (CA5 2010) (case below) (date when time for seeking
such review expires); Hemmerle v. Schriro, 495 F. 3d 1069, 1073–1074
(CA9 2007) (same), with Riddle v. Kemna, 523 F. 3d 850, 855–856 (CA8
2008) (en banc) (date when state court issues its mandate).
