Opinion of the Court

long “rejected the notion that ‘all mandatory prescriptions,
however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional.’ ”
Henderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see also Dolan
v. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5)
(statute’s reference to “shall” alone does not render statutory deadline jurisdictional). Nothing in §2253(c)(3)’s
prescription establishes that an omitted indication should
remain an open issue throughout the case.
Third, the United States argues that the placement of
§2253(c)(3) in a section containing jurisdictional provisions
signals that it too is jurisdictional. In characterizing
certain requirements as nonjurisdictional, we have on
occasion observed their “ ‘separat[ion]’ ” from jurisdictional
provisions. E.g., Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S.
___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7); Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515.
The converse, however, is not necessarily true: Mere proximity will not turn a rule that speaks in nonjurisdictional
terms into a jurisdictional hurdle. In fact, §2253(c)(3)’s
proximity to §§2253(a), (b), and (c)(1) highlights the absence of clear jurisdictional terms in §2253(c)(3).
Finally, the State analogizes a COA to a notice of appeal, pointing out that both a notice and its contents are
jurisdictional prerequisites. Federal Rule of Appellate
Procedure 3(c)(1) provides that a notice of appeal must:
“(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal”; “(B)
designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed”; and “(C) name the court to which the appeal is
taken.” We have held that “Rule 3’s dictates are jurisdictional in nature.” Smith v. Barry, 502 U. S. 244, 248 (1992).

ently not sharing the dissent’s concern that such efforts “yield nothing
but additional litigation expenses.” Post, at 5; see, e.g., Porterfield, 258
F. 3d, at 485; Cepero, 224 F. 3d, at 257. Habeas petitioners, too, have
every incentive to request that defects be resolved, not only to defuse
potential problems later in the litigation, but also to ensure that the
issue on which they sought appeal is certified and will receive full
briefing and consideration.
