GONZALEZ v. THALER
Opinion of the Court

timely because his direct review “concluded” when the
mandate issued (on September 26, 2006), later than the
date on which his time for seeking Texas CCA review
“expired” (August 11, 2006). We find his construction of
the statute unpersuasive.
First, Gonzalez lacks a textual anchor for his laterin-time approach. The words “latest of” do not appear
anywhere in §2244(d)(1)(A).
Rather, they appear in
§2244(d)(1) and refer to the “latest of” the dates in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D)—the latter three of which
are inapplicable here. Nothing in §2244(d)(1)(A) contemplates any conflict between the “conclusion of direct review” and the “expiration of the time for seeking such
review,” much less instructs that the later of the two shall
prevail.
Nor is Gonzalez’s later-in-time reading necessary to give
both prongs of §2244(d)(1)(A) full effect. Our reading does
so by applying one “or” the other, depending on whether
the direct review process concludes or expires. Treating
the judgment as final on one date “or” the other is consistent with the disjunctive language of the provision.
Second, Gonzalez misreads our precedents. Gonzalez
asserts that in Jimenez, we made a later-in-time choice
between the two prongs. That is mistaken. Rather, we
chose between two “expiration” dates corresponding to
different appeals: Jimenez initially failed to appeal to the
Texas Court of Appeals and that appeal became final
when his “time for seeking discretionary review . . . expired.” 555 U. S., at 117, 119. When Jimenez was later
allowed to file an out-of-time appeal, he pursued appeals
with both the Texas Court of Appeals and Texas CCA; the
out-of-time appeal thus became final when his “[t]ime for
seeking certiorari review . . . with this Court expired.” Id.,
at 116, 120. We adopted the out-of-time appeal’s date of
finality over the initial appeal’s date of finality. Id., at
119–121. Critically, by deeming the initial appeal final at
