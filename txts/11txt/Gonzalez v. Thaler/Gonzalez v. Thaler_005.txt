GONZALEZ v. THALER
Opinion of the Court

review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.” We hold that, for a state prisoner who does not
seek review in a State’s highest court, the judgment becomes “final” on the date that the time for seeking such
review expires.
I
Petitioner Rafael Gonzalez was convicted of murder in
Texas state court. The intermediate state appellate court,
the Texas Court of Appeals, affirmed Gonzalez’s conviction
on July 12, 2006. Gonzalez then allowed his time for
seeking discretionary review with the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals (Texas CCA)—the State’s highest court
for criminal appeals—to expire on August 11, 2006. Tex.
Rule App. Proc. 68.2(a) (2011). The Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate on September 26, 2006.
After Gonzalez, proceeding pro se, petitioned unsuccessfully for state habeas relief, he filed a federal habeas
petition under 28 U. S. C. §2254 on January 24, 2008, in
the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.
His petition alleged, inter alia, that the nearly 10-year
delay between his indictment and trial violated his Sixth
Amendment right to a speedy trial. The District Court,
without discussing Gonzalez’s constitutional claims, dismissed Gonzalez’s petition as time barred by the 1-year
statute of limitations in §2244(d)(1)(A). Although Gonzalez argued that his judgment had not become final until
the Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate, the District Court held that Gonzalez’s judgment had become
final when his time for seeking discretionary review in the
Texas CCA expired on August 11, 2006. Counting from
that date, and tolling the limitations period for the time
during which Gonzalez’s state habeas petition was pending, Gonzalez’s limitations period elapsed on December 17,
2007—over a month before he filed his federal habeas
petition. The District Court denied a COA.
