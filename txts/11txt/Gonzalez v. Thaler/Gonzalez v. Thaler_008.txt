“(2) A certificate of appealability may issue under
paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.
“(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph
(1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy
the showing required by paragraph (2).”
When, as here, the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the petitioner seeking a COA must show both
“that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the
petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable
whether the district court was correct in its procedural
ruling.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000).
In this case, the Court of Appeals judge granted a COA
that identified a debatable procedural ruling, but did not
“indicate” the issue on which Gonzalez had made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as
required by §2253(c)(3). The question before us is whether
that defect deprived the Court of Appeals of the power to
adjudicate Gonzalez’s appeal. We hold that it did not.
This Court has endeavored in recent years to “bring

Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,
at 5). Recognizing our “less than meticulous” use of the
term in the past, we have pressed a stricter distinction
between truly jurisdictional rules, which govern “a court’s
adjudicatory authority,” and nonjurisdictional “claimprocessing rules,” which do not. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540
U. S. 443, 454–455 (2004). When a requirement goes to
subject-matter jurisdiction, courts are obligated to consider sua sponte issues that the parties have disclaimed or
have not presented. See United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S.
625, 630 (2002). Subject-matter jurisdiction can never be
