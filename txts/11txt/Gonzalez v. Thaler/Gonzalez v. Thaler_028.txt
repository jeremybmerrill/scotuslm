GONZALEZ v. THALER
SCALIA, J., dissenting

exception—held that procedural conditions for appealing a
case from one Article III court to another are jurisdictional. When an appeal is “not taken within the time
prescribed by law,” the “Court of Appeals [is] without jurisdiction.” George v. Victor Talking Machine Co., 293 U. S.
377, 379 (1934) (per curiam); see also United States v.
Robinson, 361 U. S. 220, 229–230 (1960). When a party’s
name is not listed in the notice of appeal, as the Federal
Rules of Appellate Procedure require, the court has no
jurisdiction over that party’s appeal. Torres v. Oakland
Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 314–315 (1988).
When this Court reviewed cases by writ of error, the law
re quired that the lower-court record be filed with the
Court “before the end of the term next succeeding the
issue of the writ.” Edmonson v. Bloomshire, 7 Wall. 306,
309 (1869). The Court routinely dismissed cases that did
not comply with that requirement. See, e.g., Mesa v.
United States, 2 Black 721, 721–722 (1863) (per curiam);
Edmonson, supra, at 309–310; Steamer Virginia v. West,
19 How. 182, 183 (1857). The same jurisdictional treatment was accorded to failure to serve notice on the defendant in error within the succeeding term, see, e.g.,
United States v. Curry, 6 How. 106, 112–113 (1848); Villabolos v. United States, 6 How. 81, 88, 91 (1848), and to
failure to file the writ of error with the clerk of the lower
court, see, e.g., Credit Co. v. Arkansas Central R. Co., 128
U. S. 258, 261 (1888); Scarborough v. Pargoud, 108 U. S.
567 (1883). Today, when a petition for certiorari in a civil
case is not filed within the time prescribed by 28 U. S. C.
§2101(c), this Court lacks jurisdiction. Federal Election
Comm’n v. NRA Political Victory Fund, 513 U. S. 88, 90
(1994) (citing Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 45 (1990));
see also Matton S. S. Co. v. Murphy, 319 U. S. 412, 415
(1943) (per curiam).2
