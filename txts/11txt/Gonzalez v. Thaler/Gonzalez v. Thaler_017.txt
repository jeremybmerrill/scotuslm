GONZALEZ v. THALER
Opinion of the Court

us is when the judgment becomes “final” if a petitioner
does not appeal to a State’s highest court.
A
In construing the language of §2244(d)(1)(A), we do not
write on a blank slate. In Clay v. United States, 537 U. S.
522 (2003), we addressed AEDPA’s statute of limitations
for federal prisoners seeking postconviction relief. See
§2255(f)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (beginning 1-year period of
limitations from “the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final”). We held that the federal judgment
becomes final “when this Court affirms a conviction on the
merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of
certiorari,” or, if a petitioner does not seek certiorari,
“when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.” Id.,
at 527. In so holding, we rejected the argument that, if a
petitioner declines to seek certiorari, the limitations period “starts to run on the date the court of appeals issues its
mandate.” Id., at 529.
In Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113 (2009), we
described Clay’s interpretation as comporting “with the
most natural reading of the statutory text” and saw “no
reason to depart” from it in “construing the similar language of §2244(d)(1)(A).” 555 U. S., at 119. The state
court had permitted Jimenez to file an out-of-time direct
appeal. We held that this “reset” the limitations period;
Jimenez’s judgment would now become final at “the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of
the time for seeking review of that [out-of-time] appeal.”
Id., at 120–121. Because Jimenez did not seek certiorari,
we made no mention of when the out-of-time appeal “conclu[ded].” Rather, we held that his judgment became final
when his “time for seeking certiorari review in this Court
expired.” Id., at 120. Nor did we mention the date on
which the state court issued its mandate. Both Clay and
Jimenez thus suggested that the direct review process
