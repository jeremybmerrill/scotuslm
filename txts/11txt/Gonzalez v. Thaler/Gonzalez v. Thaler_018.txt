Opinion of the Court

either “concludes” or “expires,” depending on whether the
petitioner pursues or forgoes direct appeal to this Court.
We now make clear what we suggested in those cases:
The text of §2244(d)(1)(A), which marks finality as of “the
conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time
for seeking such review,” consists of two prongs. Each
prong—the “conclusion of direct review” and the “expiration of the time for seeking such review”—relates to a
distinct category of petitioners. For petitioners who pursue direct review all the way to this Court, the judgment
becomes final at the “conclusion of direct review”—when
this Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a
petition for certiorari. For all other petitioners, the judgment becomes final at the “expiration of the time for seeking such review”—when the time for pursuing direct
review in this Court, or in state court, expires. We thus
agree with the Court of Appeals that because Gonzalez did
not appeal to the State’s highest court, his judgment became final when his time for seeking review with the
State’s highest court expired.

Gonzalez offers an alternative reading of §2244(d)(1)(A):
Courts should determine both the “conclusion of direct
review” and the “expiration of the time for seeking such
review” for every petitioner who does not seek certiorari,
then start the 1-year clock from the “latest of ” the two
dates. Gonzalez rejects our uniform definition of the
“conclusion of direct review” as the date on which this
Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a petition for certiorari. In his view, whenever a petitioner does
not seek certiorari, the “conclusion of direct review” is the
date on which state law marks finality—in Texas, the date
on which the mandate issues. Ex parte Johnson, 12 S. W.
3d 472, 473 (Crim. App. 2000) (per curiam). Applying this
approach, Gonzalez contends that his habeas petition was
