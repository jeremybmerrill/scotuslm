GONZALEZ v. THALER
Opinion of the Court

Petitioner 40, that still leaves half with either different
rules or no settled rules at all.11
Fourth, Gonzalez speculates that our reading will rob
some habeas petitioners of the full 1-year limitations period. Gonzalez asserts that our reading starts the clock
running from the date that his time for seeking Texas
CCA review expired, even though, under Texas law, he
could not file for state habeas relief until six weeks later,
on the date the Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.07, §3(a)
(Vernon Supp. 2011). His inability to initiate state habeas
proceedings during those six weeks, he argues, reduced his
1-year federal habeas filing period by six weeks. We
expect, however, that it will be a rare situation where a
petitioner confronting similar state laws faces a delay in
the mandate’s issuance so excessive that it prevents him
or her from filing a federal habeas petition within a year.12
A petitioner who has exhausted his or her claims in state
court need not await state habeas proceedings to seek
federal habeas relief on those claims. To the extent a
petitioner has had his or her federal filing period severely
truncated by a delay in the mandate’s issuance and has
unexhausted claims that must be raised on state habeas
review, such a petitioner could file a request for a stay and
abeyance from the federal district court. See Rhines v.

11 Compare, e.g., PSL Realty Co. v. Granite Inv. Co., 86 Ill. 2d 291,
304, 427 N. E. 2d 563, 569 (1981) (judgment is final “when entered”);
Gillis v. F & A Enterprises, 934 P. 2d 1253, 1256 (Wyo. 1997) (judgment
is final when “opinion is filed with the clerk”), with Ex parte Johnson,
12 S. W. 3d 472, 473 (Texas CCA 2000) (per curiam) (judgment is final
at “issuance of the mandate”).
12 We note that Gonzalez waited four months from the date of the
mandate’s issuance before filing a state habeas petition. See 623 F. 3d,
at 223. When that petition was dismissed as improperly filed, Gonzalez
waited another three months before refiling. Ibid. Even then, his state
habeas proceedings concluded several weeks before his 1-year federal
deadline elapsed. Id., at 225.
