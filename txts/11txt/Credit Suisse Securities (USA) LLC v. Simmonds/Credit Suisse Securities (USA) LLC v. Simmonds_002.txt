CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS
Syllabus
his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstances
stood in his way.” Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418. Tolling
therefore ceases when fraudulently concealed facts are, or should
have been, discovered by the plaintiff. Allowing tolling to continue
beyond that point would be inequitable and inconsistent with the
general purpose of statutes of limitations: “to protect defendants
against stale or unduly delayed claims.” John R. Sand & Gravel Co.
v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133. The Whittaker rule’s inequity is
especially apparent here, where the theory of §16(b) liability is so
novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware
they had to file a §16(a) statement. Under the Whittaker rule, alleged insiders who disclaim the necessity of filing are compelled either to file or to face the prospect of §16(b) litigation in perpetuity.
Had Congress intended the possibility of such endless tolling, it
would have said so. Simmonds’ arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. The lower courts should consider in the first instance
how usual equitable tolling rules apply in this case. Pp. 4–8.
