Opinion of the Court

whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the conduct at issue.” 638 F. 3d, at 1095. Judge Milan Smith, Jr.,
the author of the panel opinion, also specially concurred,
expressing his disagreement with the Whittaker rule, but
noting that the court was compelled to follow Circuit
precedent. Id., at 1099–1101. We granted certiorari, 564
U. S. ___ (2011).
II
Petitioners maintain that these suits were properly
dismissed because they were filed more than two years after the alleged profits were realized. Pointing to dictum
in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson,
501 U. S. 350 (1991), petitioners argue that §16(b)’s limitations period is a period of repose, which is not to be
“extended to account for a plaintiff ’s discovery of the facts
underlying a claim.” Brief for Petitioners 17. See Lampf,
supra, at 360, n. 5 (“Section 16(b) . . . sets a 2-year . . .

period can be extended, the Ninth Circuit erred in determining that it is tolled until the filing of a §16(a)
statement.
In adopting its rule in Whittaker, the Ninth Circuit expressed its concern that “[i]t would be a simple matter
for the unscrupulous to avoid the salutary effect of Section
16(b) . . . simply by failing to file . . . reports in violation of
subdivision (a) and thereby concealing from prospective
plaintiffs the information they would need” to bring a
§16(b) action. 639 F. 2d, at 528 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Assuming that is correct, it does not follow that
the limitations period is tolled until the §16(a) statement
is filed. Section 16 itself quite clearly does not extend the
period in that manner. The 2-year clock starts from “the
date such profit was realized.” §78p(b). Congress could
have very easily provided that “no such suit shall be
