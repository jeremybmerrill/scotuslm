Opinion of the Court

profit from the aftermarket sale. App. 59. She further
alleged that, as a group, the underwriters and the insiders
owned in excess of 10% of the outstanding stock during
the relevant time period, which subjected them to both
disgorgement of profits under §16(b) and the reporting
requirements of §16(a). Id., at 61. See 15 U. S. C.
§78m(d)(3); 17 CFR §§240.13d–5(b)(1) and 240.16a–1(a)(1)

§240.16a–7(a). We express no view on this issue.
