CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC ET AL. v. 

SIMMONDS 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 10–1261. Argued November 29, 2011—Decided March 26, 2012
Under §16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a corporation or
security holder of that corporation may sue corporate insiders who
realize profits from the purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of
the corporation’s securities within any 6-month period. The Act provides that such suits must be brought within “two years after the
date such profit was realized.” 15 U. S. C. §78p(b).
In 2007, respondent Simmonds filed numerous §16(b) actions,
claiming that, in underwriting various initial public offerings in the
late 1990’s and 2000, petitioners and others inflated the stocks’ aftermarket prices, allowing them to profit from the aftermarket sales.
She also claimed that petitioners had failed to comply with §16(a)’s
requirement that insiders disclose any changes to their ownership interests. That failure, according to Simmonds, tolled §16(b)’s 2-year
time period. The District Court dismissed the complaints as untimely. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Citing its decision in Whittaker v.
Whittaker Corp., 639 F. 2d 516, it held that the limitations period is
tolled until an insider files the §16(a) disclosure statement “regardless of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the conduct at issue.”
Held: Even assuming that the 2-year period can be extended (a question on which the Court is equally divided), the Ninth Circuit erred in
determining that it is tolled until a §16(a) statement is filed. The
text of §16(b)—which starts the clock from “the date such profit was
realized,” §78p(b)—simply does not support the Whittaker rule. The
rule is also not supported by the background rule of equitable tolling
for fraudulent concealment. Under long-settled equitable-tolling
principles, a litigant must establish “(1) that he has been pursuing
