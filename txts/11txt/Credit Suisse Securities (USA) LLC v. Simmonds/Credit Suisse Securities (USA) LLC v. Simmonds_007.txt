Opinion of the Court

brought more than two years after the filing of a statement
under subsection (a)(2)(C).” But it did not. The text of §16
simply does not support the Whittaker rule.
The Whittaker court suggested that the background rule
of equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment6 operates
to toll the limitations period until the §16(a) statement is
filed. See 639 F. 2d, at 527, and n. 9. Even accepting that
equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment is triggered
by the failure to file a §16(a) statement, the Whittaker rule
is completely divorced from long-settled equitable-tolling
principles. “Generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling
bears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he
has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some
extraordinary circumstances stood in his way.” Pace v.
DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005) (emphasis added).
It is well established, moreover, that when a limitations
period is tolled because of fraudulent concealment of facts,
the tolling ceases when those facts are, or should have
been, discovered by the plaintiff. 2 C. Corman, Limitation
of Actions §9.7.1, pp. 55–57 (1991). Thus, we have explained that the statute does not begin to run until discov——————
6 Relying on our decision in American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah,
414 U. S. 538 (1974), Simmonds argues that the Whittaker rule is
best understood as applying legal—rather than equitable—tolling. In
American Pipe, we held that “commencement of a class action suspends
the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the
class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to
continue as a class action.” 414 U. S., at 554. We based our conclusion
on “the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose
of [Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23 class actions].” Id., at 553. Although we did
not employ the term “legal tolling,” some federal courts have used that
term to describe our holding on the ground that the rule “is derived
from a statutory source,” whereas equitable tolling is “judicially created.” Arivella v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 623 F. Supp. 2d 164, 176
(Mass. 2009). The label attached to the Whittaker rule does not matter.
As we proceed to explain, neither general equitable-tolling principles
nor the “statutory source” of §16 supports the conclusion that the
limitations period is tolled until the filing of a §16(a) statement.
