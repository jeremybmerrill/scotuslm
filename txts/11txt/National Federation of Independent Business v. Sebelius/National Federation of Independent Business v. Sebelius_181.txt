It would be particularly destructive of sound government
to apply such a rule with regard to a multifaceted piece of
legislation like the ACA. It would take years, perhaps

and the employer responsibility assessment (C–1–d).

provisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected burdens on patients, the health-care community, and the
federal budget. That consequence would be in absolute
conflict with the ACA’s design of “shared responsibility,”
and would pose a threat to the Nation that Congress did
