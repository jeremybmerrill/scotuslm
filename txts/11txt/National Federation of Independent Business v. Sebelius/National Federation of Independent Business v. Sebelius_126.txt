Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

ACA. It prohibits only the “application” of the Secretary’s
authority to withhold Medicaid funds from States that
decline to conform their Medicaid plans to the ACA’s
requirements. Thus the ACA’s authorization of funds to
finance the expansion remains intact, and the Secretary’s
authority to withhold funds for reasons other than non­
compliance with the expansion remains unaffected.
Even absent §1303’s command, we would have no war­
rant to invalidate the Medicaid expansion, contra post, at
46–48 (joint opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and
ALITO, JJ.), not to mention the entire ACA, post, at 49–64
(same). For when a court confronts an unconstitutional
statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy,
the legislature’s dominant objective. See, e.g., Ayotte v.
Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320,
328–330 (2006). In this case, that objective was to in­
crease access to health care for the poor by increasing the
States’ access to federal funds. THE CHIEF JUSTICE is
undoubtedly right to conclude that Congress may offer
States funds “to expand the availability of health care, and
requir[e] that States accepting such funds comply with the
conditions on their use.” Ante, at 55. I therefore concur
in the judgment with respect to Part IV–B of THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s opinion.

For the reasons stated, I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE
that, as to the validity of the minimum coverage provi­
sion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit should be reversed. In my view, the provision encounters no constitutional obstruction. Further, I would
uphold the Eleventh Circuit’s decision that the Medicaid
expansion is within Congress’ spending power.
