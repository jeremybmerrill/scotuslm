NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

tive resources necessary to support the expansion. Other
States, however, may voluntarily sign up, finding the idea
of expanding Medicaid coverage attractive, particularly
given the level of federal funding the Act offers at the
outset.
We have no way of knowing how many States will accept the terms of the expansion, but we do not believe
Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply
because some may choose not to participate. The other
reforms Congress enacted, after all, will remain “fully

function in a way “consistent with Congress’ basic objectives in enacting the statute,” Booker, supra, at 259.
Confident that Congress would not have intended anything different, we conclude that the rest of the Act need
not fall in light of our constitutional holding.

The Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and
unconstitutional in part. The individual mandate cannot
be upheld as an exercise of Congress’s power under the
Commerce Clause. That Clause authorizes Congress to

Congress may offer the States grants and require the
States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the
States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the
offer. The States are given no such choice in this case:
