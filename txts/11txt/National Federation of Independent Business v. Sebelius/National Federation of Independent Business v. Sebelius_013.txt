Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.
Opinion R the Court

I
In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, 124 Stat. 119. The Act aims to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care. The Act’s 10
titles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of
provisions. This case concerns constitutional challenges to
two key provisions, commonly referred to as the individual
mandate and the Medicaid expansion.
The individual mandate requires most Americans to
maintain “minimum essential” health insurance coverage.
26 U. S. C. §5000A. The mandate does not apply to some
individuals, such as prisoners and undocumented aliens.
§5000A(d). Many individuals will receive the required coverage through their employer, or from a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare. See §5000A(f). But
for individuals who are not exempt and do not receive
health insurance through a third party, the means of
satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a
private company.
Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the
mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment”
to the Federal Government. §5000A(b)(1). That payment,
which the Act describes as a “penalty,” is calculated as a
percentage of household income, subject to a floor based on
a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the average annual premium the individual would have to pay for
qualifying private health insurance. §5000A(c). In 2016,
for example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individual’s household income, but no less than $695 and no more
than the average yearly premium for insurance that covers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services (e.g.,
prescription drugs and hospitalization). Ibid.; 42 U. S. C.
§18022. The Act provides that the penalty will be paid to
the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s taxes,
and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner”
