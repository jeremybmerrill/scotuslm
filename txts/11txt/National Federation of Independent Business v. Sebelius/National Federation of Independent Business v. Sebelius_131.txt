SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


(16th ed. 1777).1 It can mean to direct the manner of
something but not to direct that something come into
being. There is no instance in which this Court or Congress (or anyone else, to our knowledge) has used “regulate”
in that peculiar fashion. If the word bore that meaning,
Congress’ authority “[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,” U. S.
Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 14, would have made superfluous
the later provision for authority “[t]o raise and support
Armies,” id., §8, cl. 12, and “[t]o provide and maintain a
Navy,” id., §8, cl. 13.
We do not doubt that the buying and selling of health
insurance contracts is commerce generally subject to
federal regulation. But when Congress provides that
(nearly) all citizens must buy an insurance contract, it
goes beyond “adjust[ing] by rule or method,” Johnson,
supra, or “direct[ing] according to rule,” Ash, supra; it
directs the creation of commerce.
In response, the Government offers two theories as to
why the Individual Mandate is nevertheless constitutional. Neither theory suffices to sustain its validity.
A
First, the Government submits that §5000A is “integral
to the Affordable Care Act’s insurance reforms” and “necessary to make effective the Act’s core reforms.” Brief
for Petitioners in No. 11–398 (Minimum Coverage Provision) 24 (hereinafter Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief).
Congress included a “finding” to similar effect in the Act

1 The most authoritative legal dictionaries of the founding era lack
any definition for “regulate” or “regulation,” suggesting that the term
bears its ordinary meaning (rather than some specialized legal meaning) in the constitutional text. See R. Burn, A New Law Dictionary 281
(1792); G. Jacob, A New Law Dictionary (10th ed. 1782); 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).
