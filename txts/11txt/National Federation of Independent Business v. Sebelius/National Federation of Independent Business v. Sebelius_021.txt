Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

§§860(h)(1), 6324A(a), 6601(e)(1)–(2), 6602, 7122(b). There
would, for example, be no need for §6671(a) to deem “tax”
to refer to certain assessable penalties if the Code already included all such penalties in the term “tax.” Indeed, amicus’s earlier observation that the Code requires
assessable penalties to be assessed and collected “in the
same manner as taxes” makes little sense if assessable
penalties are themselves taxes. In light of the Code’s
consistent distinction between the terms “tax” and “assessable penalty,” we must accept the Government’s interpretation: §6201(a) instructs the Secretary that his
authority to assess taxes includes the authority to assess
penalties, but it does not equate assessable penalties to
taxes for other purposes.
The Affordable Care Act does not require that the penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be
treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.
The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this
suit, and we may proceed to the merits.
III
The Government advances two theories for the proposition that Congress had constitutional authority to enact
the individual mandate. First, the Government argues
that Congress had the power to enact the mandate under
the Commerce Clause. Under that theory, Congress may
order individuals to buy health insurance because the
failure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could undercut the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms. Second,
the Government argues that if the commerce power does
not support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it
as an exercise of Congress’s power to tax. According to the
Government, even if Congress lacks the power to direct
individuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the individual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so,
and thus the law may be upheld as a tax.
