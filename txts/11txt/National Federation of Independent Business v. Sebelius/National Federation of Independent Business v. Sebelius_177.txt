SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting

gress would not, those provisions, too, must be invalidated.
See Alaska Airlines, supra, at 685 (“[T]he unconstitutional provision must be severed unless the statute created in its absence is legislation that Congress would not
have enacted”); see also Free Enterprise Fund, supra, at
___ (slip op., at 29) (“[N]othing in the statute’s text or
historical context makes it ‘evident’ that Congress, faced
with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, would
have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members
are removable at will”); Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of
Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 330 (2006) (“Would the
legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no
statute at all”); Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications
Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 767 (1996) (plurality opinion) (“Would Congress still have passed §10(a) had
it known that the remaining provisions were invalid”
(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).
The two inquiries—whether the remaining provisions
will operate as Congress designed them, and whether
Congress would have enacted the remaining provisions
standing alone—often are interrelated. In the ordinary
course, if the remaining provisions cannot operate according to the congressional design (the first inquiry), it almost
necessarily follows that Congress would not have enacted
them (the second inquiry). This close interaction may
explain why the Court has not always been precise in
distinguishing between the two. There are, however,
occasions in which the severability standard’s first inquiry
(statutory functionality) is not a proxy for the second
inquiry (whether the Legislature intended the remaining
provisions to stand alone).
