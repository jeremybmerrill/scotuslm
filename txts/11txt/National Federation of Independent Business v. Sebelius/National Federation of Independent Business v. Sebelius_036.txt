NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

the natural limit of its authority and draw within its
regulatory scope those who otherwise would be outside of
it. Even if the individual mandate is “necessary” to the
Act’s insurance reforms, such an expansion of federal
power is not a “proper” means for making those reforms
effective.
The Government relies primarily on our decision in
Gonzales v. Raich. In Raich, we considered “comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market” in marijuana. 545 U. S., at 22. Certain individuals sought an
exemption from that regulation on the ground that they
engaged in only intrastate possession and consumption.
We denied any exemption, on the ground that marijuana
is a fungible commodity, so that any marijuana could
be readily diverted into the interstate market. Congress’s
attempt to regulate the interstate market for marijuana
would therefore have been substantially undercut if it
could not also regulate intrastate possession and consumption. Id., at 19. Accordingly, we recognized that
“Congress was acting well within its authority” under the
Necessary and Proper Clause even though its “regulation
ensnare[d] some purely intrastate activity.” Id., at 22; see
also Perez, 402 U. S., at 154. Raich thus did not involve
the exercise of any “great substantive and independent
power,” McCulloch, supra, at 411, of the sort at issue here.
Instead, it concerned only the constitutionality of “individual applications of a concededly valid statutory
scheme.” Raich, supra, at 23 (emphasis added).
Just as the individual mandate cannot be sustained as
a law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to
purchase health insurance, neither can it be upheld as
a “necessary and proper” component of the insurance reforms. The commerce power thus does not authorize the
mandate. Accord, post, at 4–16 (joint opinion of SCALIA,
KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting).
