Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

affect interstate commerce can be expansive. That power
has been held to authorize federal regulation of such seemingly local matters as a farmer’s decision to grow wheat
for himself and his livestock, and a loan shark’s extortionate collections from a neighborhood butcher shop.
See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942); Perez v.
United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971).
Congress may also “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the
common Defence and general Welfare of the United
States.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1. Put simply, Congress may tax and spend. This grant gives the Federal
Government considerable influence even in areas where
it cannot directly regulate. The Federal Government may
enact a tax on an activity that it cannot authorize, forbid,
or otherwise control. See, e.g., License Tax Cases, 5 Wall.
462, 471 (1867). And in exercising its spending power,
Congress may offer funds to the States, and may condition
those offers on compliance with specified conditions. See,
e.g., College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999). These
offers may well induce the States to adopt policies that
the Federal Government itself could not impose. See, e.g.,
South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 205–206 (1987) (conditioning federal highway funds on States raising their
drinking age to 21).
The reach of the Federal Government’s enumerated
powers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes
Congress to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and
proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.”
Art. I, §8, cl. 18. We have long read this provision to give
Congress great latitude in exercising its powers: “Let the
end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are
plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but
consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are
