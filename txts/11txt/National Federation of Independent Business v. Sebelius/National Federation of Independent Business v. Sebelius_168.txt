NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


potentially lose all federal Medicaid funding—is quite
unlike anything that we have seen in a prior spendingpower case. In South Dakota v. Dole, the total amount
that the States would have lost if every single State
had refused to comply with the 21-year-old drinking
age was approximately $614.7 million—or about 0.19%
of all state expenditures combined.
See Nat. Assn.
of State Budget Officers, 1989 (Fiscal Years 1987–
1989 Data) State Expenditure Report 10, 84 (1989),
http://www.nasbo.org/publications-data/state-expenditurereport/archives. South Dakota stood to lose, at most,
funding that amounted to less than 1% of its annual state
expenditures. See ibid. Under the ACA, by contrast, the
Federal Government has threatened to withhold 42.3% of
all federal outlays to the states, or approximately $233
billion. See NASBO Report 7, 10, 47. South Dakota
stands to lose federal funding equaling 28.9% of its annual
state expenditures. See id., at 7, 47. Withholding $614.7
million, equaling only 0.19% of all state expenditures
combined, is aptly characterized as “relatively mild encouragement,” but threatening to withhold $233 billion,
equaling 21.86% of all state expenditures combined, is a
different matter.

What the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goal
and structure of the ACA. In crafting the ACA, Congress
clearly expressed its informed view that no State could
possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.
The stated goal of the ACA is near-universal health care
coverage. To achieve this goal, the ACA mandates that
every person obtain a minimum level of coverage. It attempts to reach this goal in several different ways. The
guaranteed issue and community-rating provisions are
designed to make qualifying insurance available and
affordable for persons with medical conditions that may
