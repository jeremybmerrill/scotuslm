ishment a “tax.” See Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., 259
U. S. 20, 36–37 (1922); Department of Revenue of Mont. v.
Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 779 (1994).
The Anti-Injunction Act and the Affordable Care Act,
however, are creatures of Congress’s own creation. How
they relate to each other is up to Congress, and the best
evidence of Congress’s intent is the statutory text. We
have thus applied the Anti-Injunction Act to statutorily
described “taxes” even where that label was inaccurate.
See Bailey v. George, 259 U. S. 16 (1922) (Anti-Injunction
Act applies to “Child Labor Tax” struck down as exceeding
Congress’s taxing power in Drexel Furniture).
Congress can, of course, describe something as a penalty
but direct that it nonetheless be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. For example, 26 U. S. C.
§6671(a) provides that “any reference in this title to ‘tax’
imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to the
penalties and liabilities provided by” subchapter 68B of
the Internal Revenue Code. Penalties in subchapter 68B
are thus treated as taxes under Title 26, which includes
the Anti-Injunction Act. The individual mandate, however, is not in subchapter 68B of the Code. Nor does any
other provision state that references to taxes in Title 26
shall also be “deemed” to apply to the individual mandate.
Amicus attempts to show that Congress did render the
Anti-Injunction Act applicable to the individual mandate,
albeit by a more circuitous route. Section 5000A(g)(1) specifies that the penalty for not complying with the mandate “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner
as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter
68.” Assessable penalties in subchapter 68B, in turn,
“shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as
taxes.” §6671(a). According to amicus, by directing that
the penalty be “assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes,” §5000A(g)(1) made the Anti-Injunction Act
applicable to this penalty.
