Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

657–659 (1890) (similar reliance on the commerce power
regarding mandated sale of private property for railroad
construction).
In concluding that the Commerce Clause does not per­
mit Congress to regulate commercial “inactivity,” and therefore does not allow Congress to adopt the practical solu­
tion it devised for the health-care problem, THE CHIEF
JUSTICE views the Clause as a “technical legal conception,”
precisely what our case law tells us not to do. Wickard,
317 U. S., at 122 (internal quotation marks omitted). See
also supra, at 14–16. This Court’s former endeavors to
impose categorical limits on the commerce power have not
fared well. In several pre-New Deal cases, the Court
attempted to cabin Congress’ Commerce Clause authority
by distinguishing “commerce” from activity once conceived
to be noncommercial, notably, “production,” “mining,” and
“manufacturing.” See, e.g., United States v. E. C. Knight
Co., 156 U. S. 1, 12 (1895) (“Commerce succeeds to manu­
facture, and is not a part of it.”); Carter v. Carter Coal Co.,
298 U. S. 238, 304 (1936) (“Mining brings the subject
matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of
it.”). The Court also sought to distinguish activities hav­
ing a “direct” effect on interstate commerce, and for that
reason, subject to federal regulation, from those having
only an “indirect” effect, and therefore not amenable to
federal control. See, e.g., A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.
v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 548 (1935) (“[T]he distinction between direct and indirect effects of intrastate
transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized
as a fundamental one.”).
These line-drawing exercises were untenable, and the
Court long ago abandoned them. “[Q]uestions of the power
of Congress [under the Commerce Clause],” we held in
Wickard, “are not to be decided by reference to any formula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such
as ‘production’ and ‘indirect’ and foreclose consideration of
