BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


had the power to frame the minimum-coverage provision
as a tax, but whether it did so.
In answering that question we must, if “fairly possible,”
Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932), construe the
provision to be a tax rather than a mandate-with-penalty,
since that would render it constitutional rather than unconstitutional (ut res magis valeat quam pereat). But we
cannot rewrite the statute to be what it is not. “ ‘ “[A]lthough this Court will often strain to construe legislation so as to save it against constitutional attack, it
must not and will not carry this to the point of perverting
the purpose of a statute . . .” or judicially rewriting it.’ ”
Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S.
833, 841 (1986) (quoting Aptheker v. Secretary of State,
378 U. S. 500, 515 (1964), in turn quoting Scales v. United
States, 367 U. S. 203, 211 (1961)). In this case, there is
simply no way, “without doing violence to the fair meaning
of the words used,” Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden, 112 U. S. 261, 269 (1884), to escape what Congress
enacted: a mandate that individuals maintain minimum
essential coverage, enforced by a penalty.
Our cases establish a clear line between a tax and a
penalty: “ ‘[A] tax is an enforced contribution to provide for
the support of government; a penalty . . . is an exaction
imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act.’ ”
United States v. Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah,
Inc., 518 U. S. 213, 224 (1996) (quoting United States v. La
Franca, 282 U. S. 568, 572 (1931)). In a few cases, this
Court has held that a “tax” imposed upon private conduct
was so onerous as to be in effect a penalty. But we have
never held—never—that a penalty imposed for violation of
the law was so trivial as to be in effect a tax. We have
never held that any exaction imposed for violation of
the law is an exercise of Congress’ taxing power—even
when the statute calls it a tax, much less when (as here)
the statute repeatedly calls it a penalty. When an act
