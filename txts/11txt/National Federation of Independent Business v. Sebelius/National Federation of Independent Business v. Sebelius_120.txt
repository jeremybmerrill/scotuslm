Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

provision giving States this option expressly permitted
them to withdraw from the program. Ibid.
Beginning in the late 1970’s, States increasingly exer­
cised the option to withdraw. Id., at 46. Concerned that
withdrawals were threatening the integrity of Social
Security, Congress repealed the termination provision.
Congress thereby changed Social Security from a program
voluntary for the States to one from which they could not
escape. Id., at 48. California objected, arguing that the
change impermissibly deprived it of a right to withdraw
from Social Security. Id., at 49–50. We unanimously
rejected California’s argument. Id., at 51–53. By includ­
ing in the Act “a clause expressly reserving to it ‘[t]he
right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision’ of the Act,”
we held, Congress put States on notice that the Act
“created no contractual rights.” Id., at 51–52. The States
therefore had no law-based ground on which to complain
about the amendment, despite the significant character of
the change.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE nevertheless would rewrite §1304
to countenance only the “right to alter somewhat,” or
“amend, but not too much.” Congress, however, did not so
qualify §1304. Indeed, Congress retained discretion to
“repeal” Medicaid, wiping it out entirely. Cf. Delta Air
Lines, Inc. v. August, 450 U. S. 346, 368 (1981) (Rehnquist,
J., dissenting) (invoking “the common-sense maxim that
the greater includes the lesser”). As Bowen indicates, no
State could reasonably have read §1304 as reserving to
Congress authority to make adjustments only if modestly
sized.
In fact, no State proceeded on that understanding. In com­
pliance with Medicaid regulations, each State expressly
undertook to abide by future Medicaid changes. See 42
CFR §430.12(c)(1) (2011) (“The [state Medicaid] plan must
provide that it will be amended whenever necessary to
reflect . . . [c]hanges in Federal law, regulations, policy
