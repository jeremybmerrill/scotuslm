of “shared responsibility.” It would leave employers as the
only parties bearing any significant responsibility. That
was not the congressional intent.

The Act’s Minor Provisions
The next question is whether the invalidation of the
ACA’s major provisions requires the Court to invalidate
the ACA’s other provisions. It does.
The ACA is over 900 pages long. Its regulations include
requirements ranging from a break time and secluded
place at work for nursing mothers, see 29 U. S. C. §207(r)(1)
(2006 ed., Supp. IV), to displays of nutritional content
at chain restaurants, see 21 U. S. C. §343(q)(5)(H).
The Act raises billions of dollars in taxes and fees, including exactions imposed on high-income taxpayers, see ACA
§§9015, 10906; HCERA §1402, medical devices, see 26

that provide benefits to the State of a particular legislator.
For example, §10323, 124 Stat. 954, extends Medicare
coverage to individuals exposed to asbestos from a mine in
Libby, Montana. Another provision, §2006, id., at 284,
increases Medicaid payments only in Louisiana.
Such provisions validate the Senate Majority Leader’s
statement, “ ‘I don’t know if there is a senator that doesn’t
have something in this bill that was important to them.
. . . [And] if they don’t have something in it important to
them, then it doesn’t speak well of them. That’s what this
legislation is all about: It’s the art of compromise.’ ” Pear,
