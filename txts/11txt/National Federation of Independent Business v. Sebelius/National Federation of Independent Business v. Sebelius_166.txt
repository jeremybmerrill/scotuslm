NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


$5 billion, NASBO Report 47. These federal dollars total
nearly two thirds—64.6%—of all Medicaid expenditures
nationwide.15 Id., at 46.
The Court of Appeals concluded that the States failed to
establish coercion in this case in part because the “states
have the power to tax and raise revenue, and therefore can
create and fund programs of their own if they do not like
Congress’s terms.” 648 F. 3d 1235, 1268 (CA11 2011); see
Brief for Sen. Harry Reid et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–
400, p. 21 (“States may always choose to decrease expenditures on other programs or to raise revenues”). But the
sheer size of this federal spending program in relation to
state expenditures means that a State would be very hard
pressed to compensate for the loss of federal funds by
cutting other spending or raising additional revenue.
Arizona, for example, commits 12% of its state expenditures to Medicaid, and relies on the Federal Government
to provide the rest: $5.6 billion, equaling roughly one-third
of Arizona’s annual state expenditures of $17 billion. See
NASBO Report 7, 47. Therefore, if Arizona lost federal
Medicaid funding, the State would have to commit an
additional 33% of all its state expenditures to fund an
equivalent state program along the lines of pre-expansion
Medicaid. This means that the State would have to allocate 45% of its annual expenditures for that one purpose.
See ibid.
The States are far less reliant on federal funding for any
other program. After Medicaid, the next biggest federal

to Medicaid.gov, in Fiscal Year 2010, the Federal Government made
Medicaid payments in the amount of nearly $260 billion, representing 67.79% of total Medicaid payments of $383 billion. See
