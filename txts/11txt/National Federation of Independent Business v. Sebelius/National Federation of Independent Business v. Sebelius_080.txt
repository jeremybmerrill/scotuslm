Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

Co., 327 U. S., at 705 (“Commerce itself is an intensely
practical matter. To deal with it effectively, Congress
must be able to act in terms of economic and financial
realities.” (citation omitted)). We afford Congress the
leeway “to undertake to solve national problems directly
and realistically.” American Power & Light Co. v. SEC,
329 U. S. 90, 103 (1946).
Until today, this Court’s pragmatic approach to judging
whether Congress validly exercised its commerce power
was guided by two familiar principles. First, Congress has
the power to regulate economic activities “that substan­
tially affect interstate commerce.” Gonzales v. Raich, 545
U. S. 1, 17 (2005). This capacious power extends even to
local activities that, viewed in the aggregate, have a sub­
stantial impact on interstate commerce. See ibid. See
also Wickard, 317 U. S., at 125 (“[E]ven if appellee’s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as com­
merce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by
Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on
interstate commerce.” (emphasis added)); Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S., at 37.
Second, we owe a large measure of respect to Congress
when it frames and enacts economic and social legislation.
See Raich, 545 U. S., at 17. See also Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717,
729 (1984) (“[S]trong deference [is] accorded legislation in
the field of national economic policy.”); Hodel v. Indiana,
452 U. S. 314, 326 (1981) (“This [C]ourt will certainly not
substitute its judgment for that of Congress unless the
relation of the subject to interstate commerce and its ef­
fect upon it are clearly non-existent.” (internal quotation
marks omitted)). When appraising such legislation, we
ask only (1) whether Congress had a “rational basis” for
concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects
interstate commerce, and (2) whether there is a “reasona­
ble connection between the regulatory means selected and
