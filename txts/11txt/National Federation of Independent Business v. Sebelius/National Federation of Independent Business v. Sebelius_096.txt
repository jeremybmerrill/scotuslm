Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

3
To bolster his argument that the minimum coverage
provision is not valid Commerce Clause legislation, THE
CHIEF JUSTICE emphasizes the provision’s novelty. See
ante, at 18 (asserting that “sometimes the most telling
indication of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the
lack of historical precedent for Congress’s action” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). While an insurance-purchase
mandate may be novel, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s argument
certainly is not. “[I]n almost every instance of the exercise of the [commerce] power differences are asserted from
previous exercises of it and made a ground of attack.”
Hoke v. United States, 227 U. S. 308, 320 (1913). See, e.g.,
Brief for Petitioner in Perez v. United States, O. T. 1970,
No. 600, p. 5 (“unprecedented exercise of power”); Supplemental Brief for Appellees in Katzenbach v. McClung,
O. T. 1964, No. 543, p. 40 (“novel assertion of federal
power”); Brief for Appellee in Wickard v. Filburn, O. T.
1941, No. 59, p. 6 (“complete departure”). For decades,
the Court has declined to override legislation because of
its novelty, and for good reason. As our national economy
grows and changes, we have recognized, Congress must
adapt to the changing “economic and financial realities.”
See supra, at 14–15. Hindering Congress’ ability to do so
is shortsighted; if history is any guide, today’s constriction
of the Commerce Clause will not endure. See supra, at
25–26.

For the reasons explained above, the minimum coverage
provision is valid Commerce Clause legislation. See supra, Part II. When viewed as a component of the entire
ACA, the provision’s constitutionality becomes even plain­
er.
