NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 


funding on compliance with the terms Congress set for
participation in the program. See, e.g., Harris, 448 U. S.,
at 301 (“[O]nce a State elects to participate [in Medicaid],
it must comply with the requirements of [the Medicaid
Act].”); Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human Servs. v.
Ahlborn, 547 U. S. 268, 275 (2006); Frew v. Hawkins, 540
U. S. 431, 433 (2004); Atkins v. Rivera, 477 U. S. 154, 156–
157 (1986).
Congress’ authority to condition the use of federal funds
is not confined to spending programs as first launched.
The legislature may, and often does, amend the law, im­
posing new conditions grant recipients henceforth must
meet in order to continue receiving funds. See infra, at 54
(describing Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S.
656, 659–660 (1985) (enforcing restriction added five years
after adoption of educational program)).
Yes, there are federalism-based limits on the use of
Congress’ conditional spending power. In the leading
decision in this area, South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203
(1987), the Court identified four criteria. The conditions
placed on federal grants to States must (a) promote the
“general welfare,” (b) “unambiguously” inform States what
is demanded of them, (c) be germane “to the federal inter­
est in particular national projects or programs,” and (d)
not “induce the States to engage in activities that would
themselves be unconstitutional.” Id., at 207–208, 210
(internal quotation marks omitted).18
The Court in Dole mentioned, but did not adopt, a fur­
ther limitation, one hypothetically raised a half-century
earlier: In “some circumstances,” Congress might be pro­
hibited from offering a “financial inducement . . . so coer­

18 Although

the plaintiffs, in the proceedings below, did not contest
the ACA’s satisfaction of these criteria, see 648 F. 3d 1235, 1263 (CA11
2011), THE CHIEF JUSTICE appears to rely heavily on the second criterion. Compare ante, at 52, 54, with infra, at 52–54.
