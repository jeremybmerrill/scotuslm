Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 9 (1965). See also §121(a),
79 Stat. 343 (The purpose of Medicaid is to enable States
“to furnish . . . medical assistance on behalf of [certain
persons] whose income and resources are insufficient to
meet the costs of necessary medical services.”). By bring­
ing health care within the reach of a larger population of
Americans unable to afford it, the Medicaid expansion is
an extension of that basic aim.
The Medicaid Act contains hundreds of provisions gov­
erning operation of the program, setting conditions rang­
ing from “Limitation on payments to States for expenditures attributable to taxes,” 42 U. S. C. §1396a(t) (2006
ed.), to “Medical assistance to aliens not lawfully admitted
for permanent residence,” §1396b(v) (2006 ed. and Supp.
IV). The Medicaid expansion leaves unchanged the vast
majority of these provisions; it adds beneficiaries to the
existing program and specifies the rate at which States
will be reimbursed for services provided to the added beneficiaries. See ACA §§2001(a)(1), (3), 124 Stat. 271–272.
The ACA does not describe operational aspects of the
program for these newly eligible persons; for that infor­
mation, one must read the existing Medicaid Act. See 42
U. S. C. §§1396–1396v(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).
Congress styled and clearly viewed the Medicaid expan­
sion as an amendment to the Medicaid Act, not as a “new”
health-care program. To the four categories of beneficiar­
ies for whom coverage became mandatory in 1965, and the
three mandatory classes added in the late 1980’s, see
supra, at 41–42, the ACA adds an eighth: individuals
under 65 with incomes not exceeding 133% of the federal
poverty level. The expansion is effectuated by §2001 of the
ACA, aptly titled: “Medicaid Coverage for the Lowest
Income Populations.” 124 Stat. 271. That section amends
Title 42, Chapter 7, Subchapter XIX: Grants to States for
Medical Assistance Programs. Commonly known as the
Medicaid Act, Subchapter XIX filled some 278 pages in
