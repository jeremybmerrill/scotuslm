Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

officials in fact fear is punishment at the ballot box for
turning down a politically popular federal grant?
The coercion inquiry, therefore, appears to involve political judgments that defy judicial calculation. See Baker
v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962). Even commentators
sympathetic to robust enforcement of Dole’s limitations,
see supra, at 46, have concluded that conceptions of
“impermissible coercion” premised on States’ perceived
inability to decline federal funds “are just too amorphous
to be judicially administrable.” Baker & Berman, Getting
off the Dole, 78 Ind. L. J. 459, 521, 522, n. 307 (2003)
(citing, e.g., Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56
U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989)).
At bottom, my colleagues’ position is that the States’
reliance on federal funds limits Congress’ authority to
alter its spending programs. This gets things backwards:
Congress, not the States, is tasked with spending federal
money in service of the general welfare. And each succes­
sive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees
fit. When the 110th Congress reached a conclusion about
Medicaid funds that differed from its predecessors’ view,
it abridged no State’s right to “existing,” or “pre-existing,”
funds. But see ante, at 51–52; post, at 47–48 (joint opinion
of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.). For, in

relationship” to the people. Id., at 838.
A State therefore has no claim on the money its residents pay in
federal taxes, and federal “spending programs need not help people in
all states in the same measure.” See Brief for David Satcher et al. as
Amici Curiae 19. In 2004, for example, New Jersey received 55 cents
in federal spending for every dollar its residents paid to the Federal
Government in taxes, while Mississippi received $1.77 per tax dollar
paid. C. Dubay, Tax Foundation, Federal Tax Burdens and Expendi­
tures by State: Which States Gain Most from Federal Fiscal Opera­
tions? 2 (Mar. 2006). Thus no constitutional problem was created when
Arizona declined for 16 years to participate in Medicaid, even though
its residents’ tax dollars financed Medicaid programs in every other
State.
