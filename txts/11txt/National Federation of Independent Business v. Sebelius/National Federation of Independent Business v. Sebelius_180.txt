NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


sion offset insurance regulations and taxes, which offset
reduced reimbursements to hospitals, which offset increases in federal spending. So, the Act’s major provisions
are interdependent.
The Act then refers to these interdependencies as
“shared responsibility.” See ACA Subtitle F, Title I, 124
Stat. 242 (“Shared Responsibility”); ACA §1501, ibid.
(same); ACA §1513, id., at 253 (same); ACA §4980H, ibid.
(same). In at least six places, the Act describes the Individual Mandate as working “together with the other provisions of this Act.” 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(C) (2006 ed.,
Supp. IV) (working “together” to “add millions of new
consumers to the health insurance market”); §18091(2)(E)
(working “together” to “significantly reduce” the economic
cost of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured); §18091(2)(F) (working “together” to “lower health
insurance premiums”); §18091(2)(G) (working “together” to
“improve financial security for families”); §18091(2)(I)
(working “together” to minimize “adverse selection and
broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy
individuals”); §18091(2)(J) (working “together” to “significantly reduce administrative costs and lower health
insurance premiums”). The Act calls the Individual Mandate “an essential part” of federal regulation of health
insurance and warns that “the absence of the requirement
would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance
market.” §18091(2)(H).

One preliminary point should be noted before applying
severability principles to the Act. To be sure, an argument
can be made that those portions of the Act that none of the
parties has standing to challenge cannot be held nonseverable. The response to this argument is that our cases
do not support it. See, e.g., Williams v. Standard Oil Co.
of La., 278 U. S. 235, 242–244 (1929) (holding nonsever-
