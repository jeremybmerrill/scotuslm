Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

see, e.g., United States v. Fox, 95 U. S. 670, 672 (1878); the
power to imprison, including civil imprisonment, see, e.g.,
Comstock, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1); and the power
to create a national bank, see McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 425.
See also Jinks, 538 U. S., at 463 (affirming Congress’
power to alter the way a state law is applied in state court,
where the alteration “promotes fair and efficient operation
of the federal courts”).10
In failing to explain why the individual mandate threat­
ens our constitutional order, THE CHIEF JUSTICE disserves
future courts. How is a judge to decide, when ruling on
the constitutionality of a federal statute, whether Con­
gress employed an “independent power,” ante, at 28, or
merely a “derivative” one, ante, at 29. Whether the power
used is “substantive,” ante, at 30, or just “incidental,” ante,
at 29? The instruction THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in effect,
provides lower courts: You will know it when you see it.
It is more than exaggeration to suggest that the mini­
mum coverage provision improperly intrudes on “essential
attributes of state sovereignty.” Ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted). First, the Affordable Care Act does not
operate “in [an] are[a] such as criminal law enforcement or
education where States historically have been sovereign.”
Lopez, 514 U. S., at 564. As evidenced by Medicare, Medi­
caid, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA), and the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Federal Govern­

10 Indeed, Congress regularly and uncontroversially requires individ­
uals who are “doing nothing,” see ante, at 20, to take action. Exam­
ples include federal requirements to report for jury duty, 28 U. S. C.
§1866(g) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); to register for selective service, 50
U. S. C. App. §453; to purchase firearms and gear in anticipation of
service in the Militia, 1 Stat. 271 (Uniform Militia Act of 1792); to turn
gold currency over to the Federal Government in exchange for paper
currency, see Nortz v. United States, 294 U. S. 317, 328 (1935); and to
file a tax return, 26 U. S. C. §6012 (2006 ed., Supp. IV).
