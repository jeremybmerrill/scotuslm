NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


the true interpretation of the phrase” “the general welfare.” Butler, 297 U. S., at 65. Madison, it has been said,
thought that the phrase “amounted to no more than a
reference to the other powers enumerated in the subsequent clauses of the same section,” while Hamilton “maintained the clause confers a power separate and distinct
from those later enumerated [and] is not restricted in
meaning by the grant of them.” Ibid.
The Court resolved this dispute in Butler. Writing for
the Court, Justice Roberts opined that the Madisonian
view would make Article I’s grant of the spending power a
“mere tautology.” Ibid. To avoid that, he adopted Hamilton’s approach and found that “the power of Congress to
authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative
power found in the Constitution.” Id., at 66. Instead, he
wrote, the spending power’s “confines are set in the clause
which confers it, and not in those of section 8 which bestow and define the legislative powers of the Congress.”
Ibid.; see also Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S.
548, 586–587 (1937); Helvering v. Davis, 301 U. S. 619,
640 (1937).
The power to make any expenditure that furthers “the
general welfare” is obviously very broad, and shortly after
Butler was decided the Court gave Congress wide leeway
to decide whether an expenditure qualifies. See Helvering,
301 U. S., at 640–641. “The discretion belongs to Congress,” the Court wrote, “unless the choice is clearly
wrong, a display of arbitrary power, not an exercise of
judgment.” Id., at 640. Since that time, the Court has
never held that a federal expenditure was not for “the
general welfare.”

One way in which Congress may spend to promote the
general welfare is by making grants to the States. Mone-
