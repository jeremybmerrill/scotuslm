NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

Syllabus

expanded Medicaid program. But given the majority view, she
agrees with THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s conclusion in Part IV–B that the
Medicaid Act’s severability clause, 42 U. S. C. §1303, determines the
appropriate remedy. Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the withholding—not the granting—of federal funds incompatible with the Spending Clause, Congress’ extension of Medicaid remains available to any
State that affirms its willingness to participate. Even absent §1303’s
command, the Court would have no warrant to invalidate the funding
offered by the Medicaid expansion, and surely no basis to tear down
the ACA in its entirety. When a court confronts an unconstitutional
statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy, the legislation.

U. S. 320, 328–330. Pp. 60–61.
