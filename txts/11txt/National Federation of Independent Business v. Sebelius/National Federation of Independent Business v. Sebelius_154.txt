NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


these cases is that the very same textual indications that
show this is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act show
that it is a tax under the Constitution. That carries verbal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of the

The Medicaid Expansion
We now consider respondents’ second challenge to the
constitutionality of the ACA, namely, that the Act’s dramatic expansion of the Medicaid program exceeds Congress’ power to attach conditions to federal grants to the
States.
The ACA does not legally compel the States to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, but the Act authorizes a severe sanction for any State that refuses to go
along: termination of all the State’s Medicaid funding. For
the average State, the annual federal Medicaid subsidy is
equal to more than one-fifth of the State’s expenditures.7
A State forced out of the program would not only lose this
huge sum but would almost certainly find it necessary to
increase its own health-care expenditures substantially,
requiring either a drastic reduction in funding for other
programs or a large increase in state taxes. And these
new taxes would come on top of the federal taxes already
paid by the State’s citizens to fund the Medicaid program
in other States.
The States challenging the constitutionality of the ACA’s
Medicaid Expansion contend that, for these practical
reasons, the Act really does not give them any choice at
all. As proof of this, they point to the goal and the struc——————

the States’ own funding sources, and it excludes federal grants unless
otherwise noted.
