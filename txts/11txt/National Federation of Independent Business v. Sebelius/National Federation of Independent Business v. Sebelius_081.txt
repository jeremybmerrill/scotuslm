Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152–153 (1938). In answering these
questions, we presume the statute under review is consti­
tutional and may strike it down only on a “plain showing”
that Congress acted irrationally. United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000).

Straightforward application of these principles would
require the Court to hold that the minimum coverage
provision is proper Commerce Clause legislation. Beyond
dispute, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that
the uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate
commerce. Those without insurance consume billions of
dollars of health-care products and services each year. See
supra, at 5. Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered
largely by national and regional companies who routinely
transact business across state lines. The uninsured also
cross state lines to receive care. Some have medical emer­
gencies while away from home. Others, when sick, go to a
neighboring State that provides better care for those who
have not prepaid for care. See supra, at 7–8.
Not only do those without insurance consume a large
amount of health care each year; critically, as earlier
explained, their inability to pay for a significant portion of
that consumption drives up market prices, foists costs on
other consumers, and reduces market efficiency and sta­
bility. See supra, at 5–7. Given these far-reaching effects
on interstate commerce, the decision to forgo insurance is
hardly inconsequential or equivalent to “doing nothing,”
ante, at 20; it is, instead, an economic decision Congress
