Opinion R the Court

not just to raise more money, but to encourage people to
quit smoking. And we have upheld such obviously regulatory measures as taxes on selling marijuana and sawed-off
shotguns. See United States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42, 44–
45 (1950); Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S. 506, 513

Indeed, it is estimated that four million people each year
will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance. See
Congressional Budget Office, supra, at 71. We would
expect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such
conduct were unlawful. That Congress apparently regards
such extensive failure to comply with the mandate as
