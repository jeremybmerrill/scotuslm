Expenditure Data, National Health Expenditures: Selected Calendar Years 1960–2010 (Table 1). Over a life­
time, costs mount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. See
Alemayahu & Warner, The Lifetime Distribution of
Health Care Costs, in 39 Health Service Research 627, 635
(June 2004). When a person requires nonroutine care, the
cost will generally exceed what he or she can afford to pay.
A single hospital stay, for instance, typically costs up­
wards of $10,000. See Dept. of Health and Human Ser­
vices, Office of Health Policy, ASPE Research Brief: The
Value of Health Insurance 5 (May 2011). Treatments for
many serious, though not uncommon, conditions similarly
cost a substantial sum. Brief for Economic Scholars as
Amici Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 10 (citing a study indicat­
ing that, in 1998, the cost of treating a heart attack for the
first 90 days exceeded $20,000, while the annual cost of
treating certain cancers was more than $50,000).
Although every U. S. domiciliary will incur significant
medical expenses during his or her lifetime, the time when
care will be needed is often unpredictable. An accident, a
heart attack, or a cancer diagnosis commonly occurs with­
out warning. Inescapably, we are all at peril of needing
medical care without a moment’s notice. See, e.g., Camp­
bell, Down the Insurance Rabbit Hole, N. Y. Times, Apr. 5,
2012, p. A23 (telling of an uninsured 32-year-old woman
who, healthy one day, became a quadriplegic the next due
to an auto accident).
To manage the risks associated with medical care—
its high cost, its unpredictability, and its inevitability—
most people in the United States obtain health insurance.
Many (approximately 170 million in 2009) are insured by
private insurance companies. Others, including those
over 65 and certain poor and disabled persons, rely on
government-funded insurance programs, notably Medicare
and Medicaid. Combined, private health insurers and
State and Federal Governments finance almost 85% of the
