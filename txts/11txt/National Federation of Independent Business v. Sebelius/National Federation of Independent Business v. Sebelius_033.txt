Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

The Government argues that the individual mandate
can be sustained as a sort of exception to this rule, because
health insurance is a unique product. According to the
Government, upholding the individual mandate would
not justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or
broccoli because, as the Government puts it, “[h]ealth insurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or
broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consumption and covering universal risks.” Reply Brief for United
States 19. But cars and broccoli are no more purchased
for their “own sake” than health insurance. They are
purchased to cover the need for transportation and food.
The Government says that health insurance and health
care financing are “inherently integrated.” Brief for United
States 41. But that does not mean the compelled purchase
of the first is properly regarded as a regulation of the
second. No matter how “inherently integrated” health
insurance and health care consumption may be, they are
not the same thing: They involve different transactions,
entered into at different times, with different providers.
And for most of those targeted by the mandate, significant
health care needs will be years, or even decades, away.
The proximity and degree of connection between the
mandate and the subsequent commercial activity is too lacking to justify an exception of the sort urged by the Government.
The individual mandate forces individuals
into commerce precisely because they elected to refrain
from commercial activity. Such a law cannot be sustained under a clause authorizing Congress to “regulate
Commerce.”

The Government next contends that Congress has the
power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the
individual mandate because the mandate is an “integral
part of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation”—
