NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

After all, it states that individuals “shall” maintain health
insurance. 26 U. S. C. §5000A(a). Congress thought it
could enact such a command under the Commerce Clause,
and the Government primarily defended the law on that
basis. But, for the reasons explained above, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power. Under
our precedent, it is therefore necessary to ask whether the
Government’s alternative reading of the statute—that it
only imposes a tax on those without insurance—is a reasonable one.
Under the mandate, if an individual does not maintain
health insurance, the only consequence is that he must
make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his
taxes. See §5000A(b). That, according to the Government,
means the mandate can be regarded as establishing a
condition—not owning health insurance—that triggers a
tax—the required payment to the IRS. Under that theory,
the mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance.
Rather, it makes going without insurance just another
thing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earning income. And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike
on certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance, it
may be within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.
The question is not whether that is the most natural
interpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a
“fairly possible” one. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62
(1932). As we have explained, “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from
unconstitutionality.” Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,
657 (1895). The Government asks us to interpret the
mandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate
the Constitution. Granting the Act the full measure of
deference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for
the reasons set forth below.
