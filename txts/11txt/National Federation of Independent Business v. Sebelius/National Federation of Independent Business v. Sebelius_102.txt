Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

IV
In the early 20th century, this Court regularly struck
down economic regulation enacted by the peoples’ repre­
sentatives in both the States and the Federal Government.
See, e.g., Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S., at 303–304, 309–310;
Dagenhart, 247 U. S., at 276–277; Lochner v. New York,
198 U. S. 45, 64 (1905). THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s Commerce
Clause opinion, and even more so the joint dissenters’
reasoning, see post, at 4–16, bear a disquieting resem­
blance to those long-overruled decisions.
Ultimately, the Court upholds the individual mandate
as a proper exercise of Congress’ power to tax and spend
“for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.” Art. I,
§8, cl. 1; ante, at 43–44. I concur in that determination,
which makes THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s Commerce Clause
essay all the more puzzling. Why should THE CHIEF
JUSTICE strive so mightily to hem in Congress’ capacity to
meet the new problems arising constantly in our ever­
developing modern economy? I find no satisfying response
to that question in his opinion.12

But even assuming there were “practicable” alternatives to the
minimum coverage provision, “we long ago rejected the view that the
Necessary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress be
‘absolutely necessary’ to the exercise of an enumerated power.” Jinks
v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462 (2003) (quoting McCulloch
v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 414–415 (1819)). Rather, the statutory
provision at issue need only be “conducive” and “[reasonably] adapted”
to the goal Congress seeks to achieve. Jinks, 538 U. S., at 462 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The minimum coverage provision meets this
requirement. See supra, at 31–33.
12 THE CHIEF JUSTICE states that he must evaluate the constitution­
ality of the minimum coverage provision under the Commerce Clause
because the provision “reads more naturally as a command to buy
insurance than as a tax.” Ante, at 44. THE CHIEF JUSTICE ultimately
concludes, however, that interpreting the provision as a tax is a “fairly
possible” construction. Ante, at 32 (internal quotation marks omitted).
That being so, I see no reason to undertake a Commerce Clause analy­
sis that is not outcome determinative.
