NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 


Supplementing these legal restraints is a formidable
check on congressional power: the democratic process. See
Raich, 545 U. S., at 33; Wickard, 317 U. S., at 120 (repeat­
ing Chief Justice Marshall’s “warning that effective re­
straints on [the commerce power’s] exercise must proceed
from political rather than judicial processes” (citing Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 197 (1824)). As the controversy
surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act at­
tests, purchase mandates are likely to engender political
resistance. This prospect is borne out by the behavior of
state legislators. Despite their possession of unquestioned
authority to impose mandates, state governments have
rarely done so. See Hall, Commerce Clause Challenges to
Health Care Reform, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1825, 1838 (2011).
When contemplated in its extreme, almost any power
looks dangerous. The commerce power, hypothetically,
would enable Congress to prohibit the purchase and home
production of all meat, fish, and dairy goods, effectively
compelling Americans to eat only vegetables. Cf. Raich,
545 U. S., at 9; Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127–129. Yet no one
would offer the “hypothetical and unreal possibilit[y],”
Pullman Co. v. Knott, 235 U. S. 23, 26 (1914), of a vegetar­
ian state as a credible reason to deny Congress the author­
ity ever to ban the possession and sale of goods. THE
CHIEF JUSTICE accepts just such specious logic when he
cites the broccoli horrible as a reason to deny Congress
the power to pass the individual mandate. Cf. R. Bork,
The Tempting of America 169 (1990) (“Judges and lawyers
live on the slippery slope of analogies; they are not supposed
to ski it to the bottom.”). But see, e.g., post, at 3 (joint opin­
ion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.) (assert­
ing, outlandishly, that if the minimum coverage provision
is sustained, then Congress could make “breathing in and
out the basis for federal prescription”).
