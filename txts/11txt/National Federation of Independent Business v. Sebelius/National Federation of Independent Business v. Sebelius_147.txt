of a penalty—such as “license” (License Tax Cases, 5 Wall.
462 (1867)) or “surcharge” (New York v. United States,
supra.). But we have never—never—treated as a tax an
exaction which faces up to the critical difference between
a tax and a penalty, and explicitly denominates the exaction a “penalty.” Eighteen times in §5000A itself and elsewhere throughout the Act, Congress called the exaction in
§5000A(b) a “penalty.”
That §5000A imposes not a simple tax but a mandate to
which a penalty is attached is demonstrated by the fact
that some are exempt from the tax who are not exempt from the mandate—a distinction that would make
no sense if the mandate were not a mandate. Section
5000A(d) exempts three classes of people from the definition of “applicable individual” subject to the minimum
coverage requirement: Those with religious objections or
who participate in a “health care sharing ministry,”
§5000A(d)(2); those who are “not lawfully present” in the
United States, §5000A(d)(3); and those who are incarcerated, §5000A(d)(4). Section 5000A(e) then creates a separate set of exemptions, excusing from liability for the
penalty certain individuals who are subject to the minimum coverage requirement: Those who cannot afford
coverage, §5000A(e)(1); who earn too little income to require filing a tax return, §5000A(e)(2); who are members
of an Indian tribe, §5000A(e)(3); who experience only short
gaps in coverage, §5000A(e)(4); and who, in the judgment
of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, “have
suffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain
coverage,” §5000A(e)(5). If §5000A were a tax, these two
classes of exemption would make no sense; there being no
requirement, all the exemptions would attach to the penalty (renamed tax) alone.
In the face of all these indications of a regulatory requirement accompanied by a penalty, the Solicitor General
assures us that “neither the Treasury Department nor the
