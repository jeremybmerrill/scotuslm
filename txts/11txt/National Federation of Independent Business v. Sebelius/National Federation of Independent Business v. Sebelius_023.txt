Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

The reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on
insurers, who are required to accept unhealthy individuals
but prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay
for their coverage. This will lead insurers to significantly
increase premiums on everyone. See Brief for America’s
Health Insurance Plans et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–
393 etc. 8–9.
The individual mandate was Congress’s solution to
these problems. By requiring that individuals purchase
health insurance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by
those who would otherwise go without it. In addition, the
mandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy
individuals, whose premiums on average will be higher
than their health care expenses. This allows insurers to
subsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals
the reforms require them to accept. The Government
claims that Congress has power under the Commerce and
Necessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution.

The Government contends that the individual mandate
is within Congress’s power because the failure to purchase insurance “has a substantial and deleterious effect
on interstate commerce” by creating the cost-shifting problem. Brief for United States 34. The path of our Commerce Clause decisions has not always run smooth, see
United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 552–559 (1995), but
it is now well established that Congress has broad authority under the Clause. We have recognized, for example,
that “[t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is
not confined to the regulation of commerce among the
states,” but extends to activities that “have a substantial
effect on interstate commerce.” United States v. Darby,
312 U. S. 100, 118–119 (1941). Congress’s power, moreover, is not limited to regulation of an activity that by itself
substantially affects interstate commerce, but also extends
