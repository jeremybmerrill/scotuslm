Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

fits offered therefore does not set apart post-ACA Medicaid
recipients from all those entitled to benefits pre-ACA.
Third, THE CHIEF JUSTICE correctly notes that the
reimbursement rate for participating States is differ­
ent regarding individuals who became Medicaid-eligible
through the ACA. Ibid. But the rate differs only in its
generosity to participating States. Under pre-ACA Medi­
caid, the Federal Government pays up to 83% of the costs
of coverage for current enrollees, §1396d(b) (2006 ed. and
Supp. IV); under the ACA, the federal contribution starts
at 100% and will eventually settle at 90%, §1396d(y).
Even if one agreed that a change of as little as 7 percent­
age points carries constitutional significance, is it not
passing strange to suggest that the purported incursion on
state sovereignty might have been averted, or at least
mitigated, had Congress offered States less money to carry
out the same obligations?
Consider also that Congress could have repealed Medi­
caid. See supra, at 38–39 (citing 42 U. S. C. §1304); Brief
for Petitioners in No. 11–400, p. 41. Thereafter, Congress
could have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combin­
ing the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage
required by the ACA. By what right does a court stop
Congress from building up without first tearing down?

THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the Medicaid expansion vul­
nerable because it took participating States by surprise.
Ante, at 54. “A State could hardly anticipate that Con­
gres[s]” would endeavor to “transform [the Medicaid pro­
gram] so dramatically,” he states. Ante, at 54–55. For the
notion that States must be able to foresee, when they sign
up, alterations Congress might make later on, THE CHIEF

Medicaid populations. See §6044, 120 Stat. 88, 42 U. S. C. §1396u–7
(2006 ed. and Supp. IV). States may offer the same level of coverage to
persons newly eligible under the ACA. See §1396a(k).
