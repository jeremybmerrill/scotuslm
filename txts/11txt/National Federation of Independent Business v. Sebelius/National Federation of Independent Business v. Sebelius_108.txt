Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

IV); Dept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, C. Truffer et al., 2010
Actuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for Medicaid,
p. 20.
Nor will the expansion exorbitantly increase state Medi­
caid spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
projects that States will spend 0.8% more than they would
have, absent the ACA. See CBO, Spending & Enrollment
Detail for CBO’s March 2009 Baseline. But see ante, at
44–45 (“[T]he Act dramatically increases state obligations
under Medicaid.”); post, at 45 (joint opinion of SCALIA,
KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.) (“[A]cceptance of the
[ACA expansion] will impose very substantial costs on
participating States.”). Whatever the increase in state
obligations after the ACA, it will pale in comparison to the
increase in federal funding.15
Finally, any fair appraisal of Medicaid would require
acknowledgment of the considerable autonomy States
enjoy under the Act. Far from “conscript[ing] state agen­
cies into the national bureaucratic army,” ante, at 55
(citing FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775 (1982)
(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent­
ing in part) (brackets in original and internal quotation
marks omitted)), Medicaid “is designed to advance cooper­
ative federalism.” Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family
Servs. v. Blumer, 534 U. S. 473, 495 (2002) (citing Harris
v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 308 (1980)). Subject to its basic
——————
15 Even the study on which the plaintiffs rely, see Brief for Petitioners
10, concludes that “[w]hile most states will experience some increase in
spending, this is quite small relative to the federal matching payments
and low relative to the costs of uncompensated care that [the states]
would bear if the[re] were no health reform.” See Kaiser Commission
on Medicaid & the Uninsured, Medicaid Coverage & Spending in
Health Reform 16 (May 2010). Thus there can be no objection to the
ACA’s expansion of Medicaid as an “unfunded mandate.” Quite the
contrary, the program is impressively well funded.
