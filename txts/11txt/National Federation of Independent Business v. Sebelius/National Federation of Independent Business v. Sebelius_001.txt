NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS ET AL. v. SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF 

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 11–393.

Argued March 26, 27, 28, 2012—Decided June 28, 2012*

In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act in order to increase the number of Americans covered by health
insurance and decrease the cost of health care. One key provision is
the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain
“minimum essential” health insurance coverage. 26 U. S. C. §5000A.
For individuals who are not exempt, and who do not receive health
insurance through an employer or government program, the means of
satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private
company. Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the
mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment” to the Federal Government. §5000A(b)(1). The Act provides that this “penalty”
will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s taxes, and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner” as tax
penalties. §§5000A(c), (g)(1).
Another key provision of the Act is the Medicaid expansion. The
current Medicaid program offers federal funding to States to assist
pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and
the disabled in obtaining medical care. 42 U. S. C. §1396d(a). The
Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and
increases the number of individuals the States must cover. For ex——————
* Together with No. 11–398, Department of Health and Human Services et al. v. Florida et al., and No. 11–400, Florida et al. v. Department
of Health and Human Services et al., also on certiorari to the same
court.
