universal” health insurance coverage. §18091(2)(D) (2006
ed., Supp. IV). The two pillars of the Act are the Individual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid.
In our view, both these central provisions of the Act—the
Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion—are invalid.
It follows, as some of the parties urge, that all other provisions of the Act must fall as well. The following section
explains the severability principles that require this conclusion. This analysis also shows how closely interrelated
the Act is, and this is all the more reason why it is judicial

withdrawal of Medicaid funding, see Part IV–F, supra,
which is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act

more comprehensive statute, the question arises as to the

(1803), when the Court severed an unconstitutional provision from the Judiciary Act of 1789. And while the Court
has sometimes applied “at least a modest presumption in

172, 190–195 (1999).
An automatic or too cursory severance of statutory

effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole.” Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton
R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 362 (1935). The Judiciary, if it
orders uncritical severance, then assumes the legislative
function; for it imposes on the Nation, by the Court’s
decree, its own new statutory regime, consisting of poli-
