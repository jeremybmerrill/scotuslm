A
In enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (ACA), Congress comprehensively reformed the
national market for health-care products and services.
By any measure, that market is immense. Collectively,
Americans spent $2.5 trillion on health care in 2009,
accounting for 17.6% of our Nation’s economy. 42 U. S. C.

The health-care market’s size is not its only distinctive
feature. Unlike the market for almost any other product
or service, the market for medical care is one in which all
individuals inevitably participate. Virtually every person
residing in the United States, sooner or later, will visit
a doctor or other health-care professional. See Dept. of
Health and Human Services, National Center for Health
Statistics, Summary Health Statistics for U. S. Adults:
National Health Interview Survey 2009, Ser. 10, No. 249,
p. 124, Table 37 (Dec. 2010) (Over 99.5% of adults above
65 have visited a health-care professional.). Most people
will do so repeatedly. See id., at 115, Table 34 (In 2009
alone, 64% of adults made two or more visits to a doctor’s
office.).
When individuals make those visits, they face another
reality of the current market for medical care: its high
cost. In 2010, on average, an individual in the United
States incurred over $7,000 in health-care expenses.
