Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

B
That is not the end of the matter. Because the Commerce Clause does not support the individual mandate, it
is necessary to turn to the Government’s second argument:
that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s
enumerated power to “lay and collect Taxes.” Art. I, §8,
cl. 1.
The Government’s tax power argument asks us to view
the statute differently than we did in considering its commerce power theory. In making its Commerce Clause
argument, the Government defended the mandate as a
regulation requiring individuals to purchase health insurance. The Government does not claim that the taxing
power allows Congress to issue such a command. Instead,
the Government asks us to read the mandate not as ordering individuals to buy insurance, but rather as imposing a
tax on those who do not buy that product.
The text of a statute can sometimes have more than one
possible meaning. To take a familiar example, a law that
reads “no vehicles in the park” might, or might not, ban
bicycles in the park. And it is well established that if
a statute has two possible meanings, one of which violates
the Constitution, courts should adopt the meaning that
does not do so. Justice Story said that 180 years ago: “No
court ought, unless the terms of an act rendered it unavoidable, to give a construction to it which should involve
a violation, however unintentional, of the constitution.”
Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448–449 (1830). Justice
Holmes made the same point a century later: “[T]he rule is
settled that as between two possible interpretations of a
statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and
by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which
will save the Act.” Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148
(1927) (concurring opinion).
The most straightforward reading of the mandate is
that it commands individuals to purchase insurance.
