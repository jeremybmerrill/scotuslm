SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting

would be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion. However,
the Government proposes—in two cursory sentences at
the very end of its brief—preserving the Expansion. Under
its proposal, States would receive the additional Medicaid funds if they expand eligibility, but States would
keep their pre-existing Medicaid funds if they do not
expand eligibility. We cannot accept the Government’s
suggestion.
The reality that States were given no real choice but to
expand Medicaid was not an accident. Congress assumed
States would have no choice, and the ACA depends on
States’ having no choice, because its Mandate requires
low-income individuals to obtain insurance many of them
can afford only through the Medicaid Expansion. Furthermore, a State’s withdrawal might subject everyone in
the State to much higher insurance premiums. That is
because the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the
cost to the insurance industry imposed by the ACA’s insurance regulations and taxes, a point that is explained in
more detail in the severability section below. To make the
Medicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA’s structure
and design “ ‘would be to make a new law, not to enforce
an old one. This is no part of our duty.’ ” Trade-Mark
Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 99 (1879).
Worse, the Government’s proposed remedy introduces a
new dynamic: States must choose between expanding
Medicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for
the sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States. If
this divisive dynamic between and among States can be
introduced at all, it should be by conscious congressional
choice, not by Court-invented interpretation. We do not
doubt that States are capable of making decisions when
put in a tight spot. We do doubt the authority of this
Court to put them there.
The Government cites a severability clause codified with
Medicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating
