Katzenbach, 379 U. S., at 303–304. Congress’ enactment
of the minimum coverage provision, which addresses a
specific interstate problem in a practical, experience­
informed manner, easily meets this criterion.

Rather than evaluating the constitutionality of the
minimum coverage provision in the manner established by
our precedents, THE CHIEF JUSTICE relies on a newly
minted constitutional doctrine. The commerce power does
not, THE CHIEF JUSTICE announces, permit Congress
to “compe[l] individuals to become active in commerce
by purchasing a product.” Ante, at 20 (emphasis deleted).

THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s novel constraint on Congress’
commerce power gains no force from our precedent and for
that reason alone warrants disapprobation. See infra, at
23–27. But even assuming, for the moment, that Congress
lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to “compel
individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an
unwanted product,” ante, at 18, such a limitation would be
inapplicable here. Everyone will, at some point, consume
health-care products and services. See supra, at 3. Thus,
if THE CHIEF JUSTICE is correct that an insurance­
purchase requirement can be applied only to those who
“actively” consume health care, the minimum coverage
provision fits the bill.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE does not dispute that all U. S. resi­
dents participate in the market for health services over
the course of their lives. See ante, at 16 (“Everyone will
eventually need health care at a time and to an extent
they cannot predict.”). But, THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists,
the uninsured cannot be considered active in the market
