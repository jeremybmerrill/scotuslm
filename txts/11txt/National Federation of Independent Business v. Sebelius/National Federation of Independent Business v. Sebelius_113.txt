NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 


care. See supra, at 44.
That is what makes this such a simple case, and the
Court’s decision so unsettling. Congress, aiming to assist
the needy, has appropriated federal money to subsidize
state health-insurance programs that meet federal stand­
ards. The principal standard the ACA sets is that the
state program cover adults earning no more than 133% of
the federal poverty line. Enforcing that prescription en­
sures that federal funds will be spent on health care for
the poor in furtherance of Congress’ present perception of
the general welfare.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts that the Medicaid expan­
sion creates a “new health care program.” Ante, at 54.
Moreover, States could “hardly anticipate” that Congress
would “transform [the program] so dramatically.” Ante,
at 55. Therefore, THE CHIEF JUSTICE maintains, Congress’
threat to withhold “old” Medicaid funds based on a State’s
refusal to participate in the “new” program is a “threa[t] to
terminate [an]other . . . independent gran[t].” Ante, at 50,
52–53. And because the threat to withhold a large amount
of funds from one program “leaves the States with no real
option but to acquiesce [in a newly created program],” THE
CHIEF JUSTICE concludes, the Medicaid expansion is un­
constitutionally coercive. Ante, at 52.

The starting premise on which THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
coercion analysis rests is that the ACA did not really
“extend” Medicaid; instead, Congress created an entirely
new program to co-exist with the old. THE CHIEF JUSTICE
calls the ACA new, but in truth, it simply reaches more of
America’s poor than Congress originally covered.
Medicaid was created to enable States to provide medi­
cal assistance to “needy persons.” See S. Rep. No. 404,
