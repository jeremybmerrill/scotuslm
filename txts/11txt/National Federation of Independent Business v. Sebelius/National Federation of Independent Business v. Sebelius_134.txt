NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


Here, however, Congress has impressed into service
third parties, healthy individuals who could be but are not
customers of the relevant industry, to offset the undesirable consequences of the regulation. Congress’ desire to
force these individuals to purchase insurance is motivated
by the fact that they are further removed from the market
than unhealthy individuals with pre-existing conditions,
because they are less likely to need extensive care in
the near future. If Congress can reach out and command
even those furthest removed from an interstate market to

regulate the distribution of firearms in the interstate market, compel state law-enforcement officials to perform
background checks. Id., at 933–935. In United States v.
Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), we held that Congress could
not, as a means of fostering an educated interstate labor
market through the protection of schools, ban the possession of a firearm within a school zone. Id., at 559–563.
And in United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000), we
held that Congress could not, in an effort to ensure the full
participation of women in the interstate economy, subject
private individuals and companies to suit for gendermotivated violent torts. Id., at 609–619. The lesson of
