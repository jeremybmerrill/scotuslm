NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 


the Commonwealth suffered no surprise after accepting
the federal funds. Kentucky was therefore obliged to return the money. 470 U. S., at 665–666, 673–674. The
conditions imposed were to be assessed as of 1974, in light
of “the legal requirements in place when the grants were
made,” id., at 670, not as of 1965, when Title I was origi­
nally enacted.
As these decisions show, Pennhurst’s rule demands that
conditions on federal funds be unambiguously clear at the
time a State receives and uses the money—not at the time,
perhaps years earlier, when Congress passed the law
establishing the program. See also Dole, 483 U. S., at 208
(finding Pennhurst satisfied based on the clarity of the
Federal Aid Highway Act as amended in 1984, without
looking back to 1956, the year of the Act’s adoption).
In any event, from the start, the Medicaid Act put
States on notice that the program could be changed: “The
right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of [Medi­
caid],” the statute has read since 1965, “is hereby reserved
to the Congress.” 42 U. S. C. §1304. The “effect of these
few simple words” has long been settled. See National
Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R.
Co., 470 U. S. 451, 467–468, n. 22 (1985) (citing Sinking
Fund Cases, 99 U. S. 700, 720 (1879)). By reserving the
right to “alter, amend, [or] repeal” a spending program,
Congress “has given special notice of its intention to retain
. . . full and complete power to make such alterations and
amendments . . . as come within the just scope of legisla­
tive power.” Id., at 720.
Our decision in Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to
Social Security Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41, 51–52 (1986), is
guiding here. As enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act
did not cover state employees. Id., at 44. In response to
pressure from States that wanted coverage for their em­
ployees, Congress, in 1950, amended the Act to allow
States to opt into the program. Id., at 45. The statutory
