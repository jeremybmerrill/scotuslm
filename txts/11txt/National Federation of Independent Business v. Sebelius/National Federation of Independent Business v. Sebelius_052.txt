NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

“[e]ssential health benefits” package, which States must
provide to all new Medicaid recipients—a level sufficient
to satisfy a recipient’s obligations under the individual mandate. §§1396a(k)(1), 1396u–7(b)(5), 18022(b). The Affordable Care Act provides that the Federal Government
will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these newly
eligible individuals through 2016. §1396d(y)(1). In the
following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent. Ibid. In light of

used by the States to “provide for the . . . general Welfare”
in the manner Congress intended.
At the same time, our cases have recognized limits on
Congress’s power under the Spending Clause to secure
state compliance with federal objectives. “We have repeatedly characterized . . . Spending Clause legislation as
‘much in the nature of a contract.’ ” Barnes v. Gorman,
536 U. S. 181, 186 (2002) (quoting Pennhurst State School
