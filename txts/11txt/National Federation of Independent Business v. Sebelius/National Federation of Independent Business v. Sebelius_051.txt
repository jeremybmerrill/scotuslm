come with it. This, they argue, violates the basic principle
that the “Federal Government may not compel the States

considerable flexibility with respect to the coverage levels
for parents of needy families. §1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii). On
average States cover only those unemployed parents who
make less than 37 percent of the federal poverty level, and
only those employed parents who make less than 63 percent of the poverty line. Kaiser Comm’n on Medicaid and

The Medicaid provisions of the Affordable Care Act, in
contrast, require States to expand their Medicaid programs by 2014 to cover all individuals under the age of 65
with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty line.
