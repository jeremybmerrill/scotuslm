NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 


Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 15 (noting that, in 2009, Massa­
chusetts’ emergency rooms served thousands of uninsured,
out-of-state residents). An influx of unhealthy individuals
into a State with universal health care would result in
increased spending on medical services. To cover the

Aware that a national solution was required, Congress
could have taken over the health-insurance market by

Security. Such a program, commonly referred to as a
single-payer system (where the sole payer is the Federal
Government), would have left little, if any, room for pri­
vate enterprise or the States. Instead of going this route,
Congress enacted the ACA, a solution that retains a ro­
bust role for private insurers and state governments. To
make its chosen approach work, however, Congress had to
