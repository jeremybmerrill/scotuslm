See §1396c (2006 ed.).
Medicaid has long been the largest federal program of
grants to the States. See Brief for Respondents in No. 11–
400, at 37. In 2010, the Federal Government directed
more than $552 billion in federal funds to the States. See
Nat. Assn. of State Budget Officers, 2010 State Expenditure Report: Examining Fiscal 2009–2011 State Spending,
p. 7 (2011) (NASBO Report). Of this, more than $233

2013, Table 12.3—Total Outlays for Grants to State and Local Governments by Function, Agency, and Program: 1940–2013, http://
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals. In that Fiscal Year, total
federal outlays for grants to state and local governments amounted to
over $608 billion, see Table 12.1, and state and local government
expenditures from their own sources amounted to $1.6 trillion, see
Table 15.2. Using these numbers, 44.8% of all federal outlays to both
state and local governments was allocated to Medicaid, amounting to
16.8% of all state and local expenditures from their own sources.
