NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

THOMAS, J., dissenting


‘substantial effects’ test under the Commerce Clause is
inconsistent with the original understanding of Congress’
powers and with this Court’s early Commerce Clause
cases.” United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 627
(2000) (THOMAS, J., concurring); see also Lopez, supra, at
584–602 (THOMAS, J., concurring); Gonzales v. Raich, 545
U. S. 1, 67–69 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). As I have
explained, the Court’s continued use of that test “has
encouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view
that the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits.” Morrison, supra, at 627. The Government’s unprecedented
claim in this suit that it may regulate not only economic
activity but also inactivity that substantially affects interstate commerce is a case in point.
