NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

constitutional.” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421.
Our permissive reading of these powers is explained in
part by a general reticence to invalidate the acts of the
Nation’s elected leaders. “Proper respect for a co-ordinate
branch of the government” requires that we strike down
an Act of Congress only if “the lack of constitutional
authority to pass [the] act in question is clearly demonstrated.” United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 635 (1883).
Members of this Court are vested with the authority to
interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor
the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions
are entrusted to our Nation’s elected leaders, who can be
thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is
not our job to protect the people from the consequences of
their political choices.
Our deference in matters of policy cannot, however,
become abdication in matters of law. “The powers of the
legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is
written.” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803).
Our respect for Congress’s policy judgments thus can
never extend so far as to disavow restraints on federal
power that the Constitution carefully constructed. “The
peculiar circumstances of the moment may render a
measure more or less wise, but cannot render it more or
less constitutional.” Chief Justice John Marshall, A
Friend of the Constitution No. V, Alexandria Gazette, July
5, 1819, in John Marshall’s Defense of McCulloch v. Maryland 190–191 (G. Gunther ed. 1969). And there can be no
question that it is the responsibility of this Court to enforce the limits on federal power by striking down acts of
Congress that transgress those limits. Marbury v. Madison, supra, at 175–176.
The questions before us must be considered against the
background of these basic principles.
