C
The exaction the Affordable Care Act imposes on those
without health insurance looks like a tax in many respects. The “[s]hared responsibility payment,” as the
statute entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by “taxpayer[s]” when they file their tax returns. 26 U. S. C.
§5000A(b). It does not apply to individuals who do not
pay federal income taxes because their household income
is less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue
Code. §5000A(e)(2). For taxpayers who do owe the payment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as
taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing
status. §§5000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4). The requirement to
pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by
the IRS, which—as we previously explained—must assess
and collect it “in the same manner as taxes.” Supra, at

it produces at least some revenue for the Government.

Indeed, the payment is expected to raise about $4 billion

It is of course true that the Act describes the payment as
a “penalty,” not a “tax.” But while that label is fatal to the
application of the Anti-Injunction Act, supra, at 12–13, it
does not determine whether the payment may be viewed
as an exercise of Congress’s taxing power. It is up to Congress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any
particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress’s choice of label on that question. That choice does
not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.
Our precedent reflects this: In 1922, we decided two
