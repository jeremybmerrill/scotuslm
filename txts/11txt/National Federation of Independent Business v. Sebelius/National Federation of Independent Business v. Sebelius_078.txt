Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

rise to the Constitution itself.” EEOC v. Wyoming, 460
U. S. 226, 244, 245, n. 1 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring)
(citing sources). Under the Articles of Confederation, the
Constitution’s precursor, the regulation of commerce was
left to the States. This scheme proved unworkable, be­
cause the individual States, understandably focused on
their own economic interests, often failed to take actions
critical to the success of the Nation as a whole. See Vices
of the Political System of the United States, in James
Madison: Writings 69, 71, ¶5 (J. Rakove ed. 1999) (As a
result of the “want of concert in matters where common
interest requires it,” the “national dignity, interest, and revenue [have] suffered.”).3
What was needed was a “national Government . . .
armed with a positive & compleat authority in all cases
where uniform measures are necessary.” See Letter from
James Madison to Edmund Randolph (Apr. 8, 1787), in 9
Papers of James Madison 368, 370 (R. Rutland ed. 1975).
See also Letter from George Washington to James Madi­
son (Nov. 30, 1785), in 8 id., at 428, 429 (“We are either a
United people, or we are not. If the former, let us, in all
matters of general concern act as a nation, which ha[s]
national objects to promote, and a national character
to support.”). The Framers’ solution was the Commerce
Clause, which, as they perceived it, granted Congress the
authority to enact economic legislation “in all Cases for
the general Interests of the Union, and also in those Cases
to which the States are separately incompetent.” 2 Rec­
ords of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 131–132, ¶8

3 Alexander Hamilton described the problem this way:
“[Often] it
would be beneficial to all the states to encourage, or suppress[,] a
particular branch of trade, while it would be detrimental . . . to attempt
it without the concurrence of the rest.” The Continentalist No. V, in 3
Papers of Alexander Hamilton 75, 78 (H. Syrett ed. 1962). Because the
concurrence of all States was exceedingly difficult to obtain, Hamilton
observed, “the experiment would probably be left untried.” Ibid.
