Opinion R the Court 


challenges to the “Child Labor Tax” on the same day. In
the first, we held that a suit to enjoin collection of the socalled tax was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act. George,
259 U. S., at 20. Congress knew that suits to obstruct
taxes had to await payment under the Anti-Injunction
Act; Congress called the child labor tax a tax; Congress
therefore intended the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. In
the second case, however, we held that the same exaction,
although labeled a tax, was not in fact authorized by Congress’s taxing power. Drexel Furniture, 259 U. S., at 38.
That constitutional question was not controlled by Congress’s choice of label.
We have similarly held that exactions not labeled taxes
nonetheless were authorized by Congress’s power to tax.
In the License Tax Cases, for example, we held that federal
licenses to sell liquor and lottery tickets—for which the
licensee had to pay a fee—could be sustained as exercises
of the taxing power. 5 Wall., at 471. And in New York v.
United States we upheld as a tax a “surcharge” on out-ofstate nuclear waste shipments, a portion of which was
paid to the Federal Treasury. 505 U. S., at 171. We thus
ask whether the shared responsibility payment falls
within Congress’s taxing power, “[d]isregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its substance and application.” United States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 294
(1935); cf. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298, 310

otherwise constitutional levy” (internal quotation marks

363 (1941) (“In passing on the constitutionality of a tax
law, we are concerned only with its practical operation,
not its definition or the precise form of descriptive words
which may be applied to it” (internal quotation marks
omitted)); United States v. Sotelo, 436 U. S. 268, 275
