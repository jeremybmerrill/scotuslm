NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


U. S. C. §§7734(b)(2), 8313(b)(2); 12 U. S. C. §§1701q–1(d)(3),
1723i(c)(3), 1735f–14(c)(3), 1735f–15(d)(3), 4585(c)(2); 15
U. S. C. §§45(m)(1)(C), 77h–1(g)(3), 78u–2(d), 80a–9(d)(4),
80b–3(i)(4), 1681s(a)(2)(B), 1717a(b)(3), 1825(b)(1), 2615(a)
(2)(B), 5408(b)(2); 33 U. S. C. §2716a(a).
The last of the feeble arguments in favor of petitioners that we will address is the contention that what this
statute repeatedly calls a penalty is in fact a tax because it
contains no scienter requirement. The presence of such a
requirement suggests a penalty—though one can imagine
a tax imposed only on willful action; but the absence of
such a requirement does not suggest a tax. Penalties for
absolute-liability offenses are commonplace. And where a
statute is silent as to scienter, we traditionally presume
a mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a “severe
penalty.” Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 618
(1994). Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing
when it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred
from a penalty, it is quite illogical to suggest that a
penalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienter
requirement.
And the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and penalty are located in Title I of the Act, its operative core,
rather than where a tax would be found—in Title IX,
containing the Act’s “Revenue Provisions.” In sum, “the
terms of [the] act rende[r] it unavoidable,” Parsons v.
Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448 (1830), that Congress imposed a
regulatory penalty, not a tax.
For all these reasons, to say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute
but to rewrite it. Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubling. Taxes have never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act
of 1765, and in part for that reason, the Constitution
requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives. See Art. I, §7, cl. 1. That is to say, they must
originate in the legislative body most accountable to the
