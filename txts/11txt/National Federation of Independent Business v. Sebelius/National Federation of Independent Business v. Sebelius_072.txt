Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

person may need medical care at any moment and because
health-care companies must account for that risk, every
uninsured person impacts the market price of medical care
and medical insurance.
The failure of individuals to acquire insurance has other
deleterious effects on the health-care market. Because
those without insurance generally lack access to preventa­
tive care, they do not receive treatment for conditions—
like hypertension and diabetes—that can be successfully
and affordably treated if diagnosed early on. See Institute
of Medicine, National Academies, Insuring America’s
Health: Principles and Recommendations 43 (2004). When
sickness finally drives the uninsured to seek care, once
treatable conditions have escalated into grave health
problems, requiring more costly and extensive interven­
tion. Id., at 43–44. The extra time and resources provid­
ers spend serving the uninsured lessens the providers’
ability to care for those who do have insurance. See Kliff,
High Uninsured Rates Can Kill You—Even if You Have
Coverage, Washington Post (May 7, 2012) (describing a
study of California’s health-care market which found
that, when hospitals divert time and resources to provide
uncompensated care, the quality of care the hospitals
deliver to those with insurance drops significantly), available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/

C
States cannot resolve the problem of the uninsured on
their own. Like Social Security benefits, a universal
health-care system, if adopted by an individual State,
would be “bait to the needy and dependent elsewhere,
encouraging them to migrate and seek a haven of repose.”
