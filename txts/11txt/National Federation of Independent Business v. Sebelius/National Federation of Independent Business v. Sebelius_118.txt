Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

of the size and shape potential changes to Medicaid might

made mandatory. Our decisions do not support such a
requirement.21
In Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632 (1985), the
Secretary of Education sought to recoup Title I funds22
based on the State’s noncompliance, from 1970 to 1972,
with a 1978 amendment to Title I. Relying on Pennhurst,
we rejected the Secretary’s attempt to recover funds based
on the States’ alleged violation of a rule that did not exist
when the State accepted and spent the funds. See 470
U. S., at 640 (“New Jersey[,] when it applied for and re­

21 THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes that “Spending Clause legislation

THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.) (same). But the Court previously has recognized that “[u]nlike normal contractual undertakings, federal grant
programs originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions
expressing the judgment of Congress concerning desirable public
policy.” Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 669 (1985).
22 Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965
provided federal grants to finance supplemental educational programs
in school districts with high concentrations of children from low-income
families. See Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632, 634–635 (1985)
(citing Pub. L. No. 89–10, 79 Stat. 27).
