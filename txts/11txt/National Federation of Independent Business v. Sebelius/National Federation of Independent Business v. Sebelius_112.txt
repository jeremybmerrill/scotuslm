Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

cive as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into
compulsion.’ ” Id., at 211 (quoting Steward Machine Co. v.
Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 590 (1937)). Prior to today’s deci­
sion, however, the Court has never ruled that the terms of
any grant crossed the indistinct line between temptation
and coercion.
Dole involved the National Minimum Drinking Age Act,
23 U. S. C. §158, enacted in 1984. That Act directed the
Secretary of Transportation to withhold 5% of the federal
highway funds otherwise payable to a State if the State
permitted purchase of alcoholic beverages by persons
less than 21 years old. Drinking age was not within the
authority of Congress to regulate, South Dakota argued,
because the Twenty-First Amendment gave the States
exclusive power to control the manufacture, transporta­
tion, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The small
percentage of highway-construction funds South Dakota
stood to lose by adhering to 19 as the age of eligibility to
purchase 3.2% beer, however, was not enough to qualify as
coercion, the Court concluded.
This case does not present the concerns that led the
Court in Dole even to consider the prospect of coercion. In
Dole, the condition—set 21 as the minimum drinking age—
did not tell the States how to use funds Congress provided for highway construction. Further, in view of the
Twenty-First Amendment, it was an open question whether
Congress could directly impose a national minimum
drinking age.
The ACA, in contrast, relates solely to the federally
funded Medicaid program; if States choose not to comply,
Congress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked
for any other program. Nor does the ACA use Medicaid
funding to induce States to take action Congress itself
could not undertake. The Federal Government undoubt­
edly could operate its own health-care program for poor
persons, just as it operates Medicare for seniors’ health
