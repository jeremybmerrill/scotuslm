NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting

entire statute is inoperative.
I
The Individual Mandate
Article I, §8, of the Constitution gives Congress the
power to “regulate Commerce . . . among the several
States.” The Individual Mandate in the Act commands
that every “applicable individual shall for each month
beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any
dependent of the individual who is an applicable individual, is covered under minimum essential coverage.” 26
U. S. C. §5000A(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). If this provision
“regulates” anything, it is the failure to maintain minimum essential coverage. One might argue that it regulates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by
payment of a penalty. But that failure—that abstention
from commerce—is not “Commerce.” To be sure, purchasing insurance is ”Commerce”; but one does not regulate
commerce that does not exist by compelling its existence.
In Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196 (1824), Chief
Justice Marshall wrote that the power to regulate commerce is the power “to prescribe the rule by which
commerce is to be governed.” That understanding is consistent with the original meaning of “regulate” at the time
of the Constitution’s ratification, when “to regulate” meant
“[t]o adjust by rule, method or established mode,” 2 N.
Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828); “[t]o adjust by rule or method,” 2 S. Johnson,
A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785); “[t]o
adjust, to direct according to rule,” 2 J. Ash, New and
Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1775); “to
put in order, set to rights, govern or keep in order,” T.
