NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


State’s federal highway funds on the State’s adoption of
a minimum drinking age of 21 years. South Dakota argued that the program was impermissibly coercive, but we
disagreed, reasoning that “Congress ha[d] directed only
that a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age
lower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain
federal highway funds.” 483 U. S., at 211. Because “all
South Dakota would lose if she adhere[d] to her chosen
course as to a suitable minimum drinking age [was] 5%
of the funds otherwise obtainable under specified highway grant programs,” we found that “Congress ha[d] offered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact
higher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise
choose.” Ibid. Thus, the decision whether to comply with
the federal condition “remain[ed] the prerogative of the
States not merely in theory but in fact,” and so the program at issue did not exceed Congress’ power. Id., at 211–
212 (emphasis added).
The question whether a law enacted under the spending
power is coercive in fact will sometimes be difficult, but
where Congress has plainly “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion,” New York, supra, at
175, a federal program that coopts the States’ political
processes must be declared unconstitutional. “[T]he federal balance is too essential a part of our constitutional
structure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for
us to admit inability to intervene.” Lopez, 514 U. S., at
578 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).

The Federal Government’s argument in this case at best
pays lip service to the anticoercion principle. The Federal
Government suggests that it is sufficient if States are
“free, as a matter of law, to turn down” federal funds.
