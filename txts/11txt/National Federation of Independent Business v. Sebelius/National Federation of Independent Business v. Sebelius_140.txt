NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


of reasoning the failure to buy a car can be called participation in the non-private-car-transportation market. Commerce becomes everything.
The dissent claims that we “fai[l] to explain why the
individual mandate threatens our constitutional order.”
Ante, at 35. But we have done so. It threatens that order
because it gives such an expansive meaning to the Commerce Clause that all private conduct (including failure to
act) becomes subject to federal control, effectively destroying the Constitution’s division of governmental powers.
Thus the dissent, on the theories proposed for the validity
of the Mandate, would alter the accepted constitutional
relation between the individual and the National Government. The dissent protests that the Necessary and Proper
Clause has been held to include “the power to enact criminal laws, . . . the power to imprison, . . . and the power to
create a national bank,” ante, at 34–35. Is not the power
to compel purchase of health insurance much lesser? No,
not if (unlike those other dispositions) its application rests
upon a theory that everything is within federal control
simply because it exists.
The dissent’s exposition of the wonderful things the Federal Government has achieved through exercise of its
assigned powers, such as “the provision of old-age and
survivors’ benefits” in the Social Security Act, ante, at 2,
is quite beside the point. The issue here is whether the
federal government can impose the Individual Mandate
through the Commerce Clause. And the relevant history
is not that Congress has achieved wide and wonderful
results through the proper exercise of its assigned powers
in the past, but that it has never before used the Commerce Clause to compel entry into commerce.3 The dissent
