NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 


2006. Section 2001 of the ACA would add approximately
three pages.19
Congress has broad authority to construct or adjust
spending programs to meet its contemporary understand­
ing of “the general Welfare.” Helvering v. Davis, 301 U. S.
619, 640–641 (1937). Courts owe a large measure of re­
spect to Congress’ characterization of the grant programs
it establishes. See Steward Machine, 301 U. S., at 594.
Even if courts were inclined to second-guess Congress’
conception of the character of its legislation, how would
reviewing judges divine whether an Act of Congress, pur­

but a new creation? At what point does an extension
become so large that it “transforms” the basic law?
Endeavoring to show that Congress created a new pro­
gram, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites three aspects of the ex­

no more than 133% of the federal poverty line, the Medi­
caid expansion, unlike pre-ACA Medicaid, does not “care
for the neediest among us.” Ante, at 53. What makes

year—133% of the current federal poverty level—surely
rank among the Nation’s poor.
Second, according to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, “Congress
mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of
coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional
Medicaid benefit package.” Ibid. That less comprehensive
benefit package, however, is not an innovation introduced
by the ACA; since 2006, States have been free to use it for
many of their Medicaid beneficiaries.20 The level of bene­
