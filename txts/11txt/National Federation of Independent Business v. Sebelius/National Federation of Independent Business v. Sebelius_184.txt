health insurance premiums.” 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(F)
(2006 ed., Supp. IV). See also §18091(2)(I) (goal of
“lower[ing] health insurance premiums”); §18091(2)(J)
(same). Other hospitals, particularly safety-net hospitals that
serve a large number of uninsured patients, may be forced
to shut down. Cf. National Assn. of Public Hospitals, 2009

Fulfill Mission in Uncertain Times 5–6 (Feb. 2011). Like
the effect of preserving the insurance regulations and
taxes, the precise degree of risk to hospitals is unknowable. It is not the proper role of the Court, by severing
part of a statute and allowing the rest to stand, to impose
unknowable risks that Congress could neither measure
nor predict. And Congress could not have intended that
result in any event.
There is a second, independent reason why the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and the ACA’s other
Medicare cuts must be invalidated. The ACA’s $455 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings offset the $434billion cost of the Medicaid Expansion. See CBO Estimate, Table 2 (Mar. 20, 2010). The reductions allowed
Congress to find that the ACA “will reduce the Federal
deficit between 2010 and 2019” and “will continue to
reduce budget deficits after 2019.” ACA §§1563(a)(1), (2),
124 Stat. 270.
That finding was critical to the ACA. The Act’s “shared
responsibility” concept extends to the federal budget.
Congress chose to offset new federal expenditures with
budget cuts and tax increases. That is why the United
States has explained in the course of this litigation that
“[w]hen Congress passed the ACA, it was careful to ensure
that any increased spending, including on Medicaid, was
offset by other revenue-raising and cost-saving provisions.” Memorandum in Support of Government’s Motion
