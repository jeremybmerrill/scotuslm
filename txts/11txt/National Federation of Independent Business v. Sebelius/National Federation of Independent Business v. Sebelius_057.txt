her highway funds. Ibid. In fact, the federal funds at
stake constituted less than half of one percent of South
Dakota’s budget at the time. See Nat. Assn. of State
Budget Officers, The State Expenditure Report 59 (1987);
South Dakota v. Dole, 791 F. 2d 628, 630 (CA8 1986). In

Dole, 483 U. S., at 212. Whether to accept the drinking
age change “remain[ed] the prerogative of the States not

trillion between 2010 and 2019 in order to cover the costs
of pre-expansion Medicaid. Brief for United States 10,
n. 6. In addition, the States have developed intricate
statutory and administrative regimes over the course of
many decades to implement their objectives under existing
Medicaid. It is easy to see how the Dole Court could conclude that the threatened loss of less than half of one
percent of South Dakota’s budget left that State with a
