NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 


both cases, however, compelled state officials to act on the
Federal Government’s behalf. 521 U. S., at 925–933 (hold­
ing unconstitutional a statute obligating state law en­
forcement officers to implement a federal gun-control law);
New York, 505 U. S., at 176–177 (striking down a statute
requiring state legislators to pass regulations pursuant to
Congress’ instructions). “[Federal] laws conscripting state
officers,” the Court reasoned, “violate state sovereignty
and are thus not in accord with the Constitution.” Printz,
521 U. S., at 925, 935; New York, 505 U. S., at 176.
The minimum coverage provision, in contrast, acts
“directly upon individuals, without employing the States
as intermediaries.” New York, 505 U. S., at 164. The
provision is thus entirely consistent with the Consti­
tution’s design. See Printz, 521 U. S., at 920 (“[T]he
Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon
Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States.”
(internal quotation marks omitted)).
Lacking case law support for his holding, THE CHIEF
JUSTICE nevertheless declares the minimum coverage
provision not “proper” because it is less “narrow in scope”
than other laws this Court has upheld under the Neces­
sary and Proper Clause. Ante, at 29 (citing United States
v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___ (2010); Sabri v. United States,
541 U. S. 600 (2004); Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S.
456 (2003)). THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s reliance on cases in
which this Court has affirmed Congress’ “broad authority
to enact federal legislation” under the Necessary and
Proper Clause, Comstock, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5),
is underwhelming.
Nor does THE CHIEF JUSTICE pause to explain why the
power to direct either the purchase of health insurance or,
alternatively, the payment of a penalty collectible as a tax
is more far-reaching than other implied powers this Court
has found meet under the Necessary and Proper Clause.
These powers include the power to enact criminal laws,
