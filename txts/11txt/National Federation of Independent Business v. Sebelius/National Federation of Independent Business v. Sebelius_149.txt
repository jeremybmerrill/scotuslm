SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


Revenue Code.” Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 53.
The manner of collection could perhaps suggest a tax if
IRS penalty-collection were unheard-of or rare. It is not.
See, e.g., 26 U. S. C. §527(j) (2006 ed.) (IRS-collectible penalty for failure to make campaign-finance disclosures);
§5761(c) (IRS-collectible penalty for domestic sales of tobacco products labeled for export); §9707 (IRS-collectible
penalty for failure to make required health-insurance
premium payments on behalf of mining employees). In
Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S.
213, we held that an exaction not only enforced by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue but even called a “tax”
was in fact a penalty. “[I]f the concept of penalty means
anything,” we said, “it means punishment for an unlawful
act or omission.” Id., at 224. See also Lipke v. Lederer,
259 U. S. 557 (1922) (same). Moreover, while the penalty
is assessed and collected by the IRS, §5000A is administered both by that agency and by the Department of
Health and Human Services (and also the Secretary of
Veteran Affairs), see §5000A(e)(1)(D), (e)(5), (f)(1)(A)(v),
(f)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), which is responsible for
defining its substantive scope—a feature that would be
quite extraordinary for taxes.
The Government points out that “[t]he amount of the
penalty will be calculated as a percentage of household
income for federal income tax purposes, subject to a floor
and [a] ca[p],” and that individuals who earn so little
money that they “are not required to file income tax returns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty”
(though they are, as we discussed earlier, subject to the
mandate). Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 12, 53.
But varying a penalty according to ability to pay is an
utterly familiar practice. See, e.g., 33 U. S. C. §1319(d)
(2006 ed., Supp. IV) (“In determining the amount of a civil
penalty the court shall consider . . . the economic impact of
the penalty on the violator”); see also 6 U. S. C. §488e(c); 7
