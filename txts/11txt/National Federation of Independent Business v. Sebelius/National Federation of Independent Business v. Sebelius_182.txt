Insurance Regulations and Taxes
Without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion, the Affordable Care Act’s insurance regulations and
insurance taxes impose risks on insurance companies and
their customers that this Court cannot measure. Those
risks would undermine Congress’ scheme of “shared responsibility.” See 26 U. S. C. §4980I (2006 ed., Supp.
IV) (high-cost insurance plans); 42 U. S. C. §§300gg(a)(1)
(2006 ed., Supp. IV), 300gg–4(b) (community rating);
§§300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4(a) (guaranteed issue);
§300gg–11 (elimination of coverage limits); §300gg–14(a)
(dependent children up to age 26); ACA §§9010, 10905,
124 Stat. 865, 1017 (excise tax); HCERA §1401, 124 Stat.
1059 (excise tax).
The Court has been informed by distinguished economists that the Act’s Individual Mandate and Medicaid
Expansion would each increase revenues to the insurance
industry by about $350 billion over 10 years; that this
combined figure of $700 billion is necessary to offset the
approximately $700 billion in new costs to the insurance
industry imposed by the Act’s insurance regulations and
taxes; and that the new $700-billion burden would otherwise dwarf the industry’s current profit margin. See Brief
for Economists as Amici Curiae in No. 11–393 etc. (Severability), pp. 9–16, 10a.
If that analysis is correct, the regulations and taxes will
mean higher costs for insurance companies. Higher costs
may mean higher premiums for consumers, despite the
Act’s goal of “lower[ing] health insurance premiums.” 42
U. S. C. §18091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Higher costs
also could threaten the survival of health-insurance companies, despite the Act’s goal of “effective health insurance
markets.” §18091(2)(J).
