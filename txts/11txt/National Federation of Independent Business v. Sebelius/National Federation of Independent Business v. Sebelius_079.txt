NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 


(M. Farrand rev. 1966). See also North American Co. v.
SEC, 327 U. S. 686, 705 (1946) (“[The commerce power]
is an affirmative power commensurate with the national
needs.”).
The Framers understood that the “general Interests of
the Union” would change over time, in ways they could not
anticipate. Accordingly, they recognized that the Consti­
tution was of necessity a “great outlin[e],” not a detailed
blueprint, see McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407
(1819), and that its provisions included broad concepts, to
be “explained by the context or by the facts of the case,”
Letter from James Madison to N. P. Trist (Dec. 1831), in 9
Writings of James Madison 471, 475 (G. Hunt ed. 1910).
“Nothing . . . can be more fallacious,” Alexander Hamilton
emphasized, “than to infer the extent of any power, proper
to be lodged in the national government, from . . . its
immediate necessities. There ought to be a CAPACITY to
provide for future contingencies[,] as they may happen;
and as these are illimitable in their nature, it is impossible
safely to limit that capacity.” The Federalist No. 34,
pp. 205, 206 (John Harvard Library ed. 2009). See also
McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415 (The Necessary and Proper
Clause is lodged “in a constitution[,] intended to endure
for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the
various crises of human affairs.”).
B
Consistent with the Framers’ intent, we have repeatedly
emphasized that Congress’ authority under the Commerce
Clause is dependent upon “practical” considerations,
including “actual experience.” Jones & Laughlin Steel
Corp., 301 U. S., at 41–42; see Wickard v. Filburn, 317
U. S. 111, 122 (1942); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.
549, 573 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (emphasizing
“the Court’s definitive commitment to the practical con­
ception of the commerce power”). See also North American
