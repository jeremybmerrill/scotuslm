NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


dorf, CBO’s Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation
Enacted in March 2010, p. 24 (Mar. 30, 2011); see also R.
Bovbjerg, B. Ormond, & V. Chen, Kaiser Commission on
Medicaid and the Uninsured, State Budgets under Federal
Health Reform: The Extent and Causes of Variations in
Estimated Impacts 4, n. 27 (Feb. 2011) (estimating new
state spending at $43.2 billion through 2019). After 2019,
state spending is expected to increase at a faster rate; the
CBO estimates new state spending at $60 billion through
2021. Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf, supra, at 24.
And these costs may increase in the future because of
the very real possibility that the Federal Government will
change funding terms and reduce the percentage of funds
it will cover. This would leave the States to bear an increasingly large percentage of the bill. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 74–76 (Mar. 28, 2012). Finally, after 2015, the States
will have to pick up the tab for 50% of all administrative
costs associated with implementing the new program, see
§§1396b(a)(2)–(5), (7) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), costs that could
approach $12 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2020,
see Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, 2010 Actuarial Report on the
Financial Outlook for Medicaid 30.
In sum, it is perfectly clear from the goal and structure
of the ACA that the offer of the Medicaid Expansion was
one that Congress understood no State could refuse. The
Medicaid Expansion therefore exceeds Congress’ spending
power and cannot be implemented.
F
Seven Members of the Court agree that the Medicaid
Expansion, as enacted by Congress, is unconstitutional.
See Part IV–A to IV–E, supra; Part IV–A, ante, at 45–55
(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J., joined by BREYER and KAGAN,
JJ.). Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional,
the question of remedy arises. The most natural remedy
