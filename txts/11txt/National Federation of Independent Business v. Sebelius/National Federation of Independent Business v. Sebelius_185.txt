Congress intended. They would lose their justification and
foundation. In addition, to preserve them would be “to
eliminate a significant quid pro quo of the legislative compromise” and create a statute Congress did not enact.
Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533,

Health Insurance Exchanges and Their Federal
Subsidies
The ACA requires each State to establish a healthinsurance “exchange.” Each exchange is a one-stop marketplace for individuals and small businesses to compare
community-rated health insurance and purchase the
policy of their choice. The exchanges cannot operate in the
manner Congress intended if the Individual Mandate,
Medicaid Expansion, and insurance regulations cannot
remain in force.
The Act’s design is to allocate billions of federal dollars
to subsidize individuals’ purchases on the exchanges. Individuals with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of
the poverty level receive tax credits to offset the cost of
insurance to the individual purchaser. 26 U. S. C. §36B
(2006 ed., Supp. IV); 42 U. S. C. §18071 (2006 ed., Supp.
IV). By 2019, 20 million of the 24 million people who will
obtain insurance through an exchange are expected to
receive an average federal subsidy of $6,460 per person.
