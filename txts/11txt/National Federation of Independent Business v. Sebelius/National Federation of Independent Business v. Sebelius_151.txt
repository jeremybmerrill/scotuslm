SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


people, where legislators must weigh the need for the tax
against the terrible price they might pay at their next
election, which is never more than two years off. The
Federalist No. 58 “defend[ed] the decision to give the
origination power to the House on the ground that the
Chamber that is more accountable to the people should
have the primary role in raising revenue.” United States
v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S. 385, 395 (1990). We have no
doubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing
when it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that
imposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty. See
Affordable Health Care for America Act, H. R. 3962, 111th
Cong., 1st Sess., §501 (2009); America’s Healthy Future
Act of 2009, S. 1796, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., §1301. Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of
government least accountable to the citizenry.
Finally, we must observe that rewriting §5000A as a tax
in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to
confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is
a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States
according to their population. Art. I, §9, cl. 4. Perhaps it
is not (we have no need to address the point); but the
meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and
its application here is a question of first impression that
deserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-anda-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters.
The Government’s opening brief did not even address the
question—perhaps because, until today, no federal court
has accepted the implausible argument that §5000A is
an exercise of the tax power. And once respondents raised
the issue, the Government devoted a mere 21 lines of its
reply brief to the issue. Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage
Reply Brief 25. At oral argument, the most prolonged
statement about the issue was just over 50 words. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 79 (Mar. 27, 2012). One would expect this Court
