Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

ers’ “view that an individual cannot be subject to Com­
merce Clause regulation absent voluntary, affirmative acts
that enter him or her into, or affect, the interstate mar­
ket expresses a concern for individual liberty that [is]
more redolent of Due Process Clause arguments.” SevenSky, 661 F. 3d, at 19. See also Troxel v. Granville, 530
U. S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion) (“The [Due Process]
Clause also includes a substantive component that pro­
vides heightened protection against government interfer­
ence with certain fundamental rights and liberty inter­
ests.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Plaintiffs have
abandoned any argument pinned to substantive due pro­
cess, however, see 648 F. 3d 1235, 1291, n. 93 (CA11
2011), and now concede that the provisions here at issue
do not offend the Due Process Clause.8

Underlying THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s view that the Com­
merce Clause must be confined to the regulation of active
participants in a commercial market is a fear that the
commerce power would otherwise know no limits. See,
e.g., ante, at 23 (Allowing Congress to compel an individual not engaged in commerce to purchase a product would
“permi[t] Congress to reach beyond the natural extent
of its authority, everywhere extending the sphere of its
activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.”

substantive due process rights. See McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S.
___, ___ (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 7) (The notion that
the Due Process Clause “could define the substance of th[e] righ[t to
liberty] strains credulity.”); Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994)
(SCALIA, J., concurring) (“I reject the proposition that the Due Process
Clause guarantees certain (unspecified) liberties[.]”). Given these
Justices’ reluctance to interpret the Due Process Clause as guarantee­
ing liberty interests, their willingness to plant such protections in the
Commerce Clause is striking.
