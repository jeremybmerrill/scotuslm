“adopt[s] the criteria of wrongdoing” and then imposes a
monetary penalty as the “principal consequence on those
who transgress its standard,” it creates a regulatory penalty, not a tax. Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S. 20, 38
(1922).
So the question is, quite simply, whether the exaction
here is imposed for violation of the law. It unquestionably is. The minimum-coverage provision is found in 26
U. S. C. §5000A, entitled “Requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.” (Emphasis added.) It commands
that every “applicable individual shall . . . ensure that the
individual . . . is covered under minimum essential coverage.” Ibid. (emphasis added). And the immediately following provision states that, “[i]f . . . an applicable
individual . . . fails to meet the requirement of subsection
(a) . . . there is hereby imposed . . . a penalty.” §5000A(b)
(emphasis added). And several of Congress’ legislative
“findings” with regard to §5000A confirm that it sets forth
a legal requirement and constitutes the assertion of regulatory power, not mere taxing power. See 42 U. S. C.
§18091(2)(A) (“The requirement regulates activity . . .”);
§18091(2)(C) (“The requirement . . . will add millions of
new consumers to the health insurance market . . .”);
§18091(2)(D) (“The requirement achieves near-universal
coverage”); §18091(2)(H) (“The requirement is an essential
part of this larger regulation of economic activity, and the
absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market”); §18091(3) (“[T]he
Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance
is interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation”).
The Government and those who support its view on the
tax point rely on New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,
to justify reading “shall” to mean “may.” The “shall” in
that case was contained in an introductory provision—a
recital that provided for no legal consequences—which
said that “[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing
