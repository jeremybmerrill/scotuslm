medical care administered to U. S. residents. See Con­
gressional Budget Office, CBO’s 2011 Long-Term Budget
Outlook 37 (June 2011).
Not all U. S. residents, however, have health insurance.
In 2009, approximately 50 million people were uninsured,
either by choice or, more likely, because they could not
afford private insurance and did not qualify for govern­
ment aid. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, C.
DeNavas-Walt, B. Proctor, & J. Smith, Income, Poverty,
and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2009,
p. 23, Table 8 (Sept. 2010). As a group, uninsured individ­
uals annually consume more than $100 billion in healthcare services, nearly 5% of the Nation’s total. Hidden
Health Tax: Americans Pay a Premium 2 (2009), available at http://www.familiesusa.org (all Internet material as visited June 25, 2012, and included in Clerk of
Court’s case file). Over 60% of those without insurance
visit a doctor’s office or emergency room in a given year.

B
The large number of individuals without health insur­
ance, Congress found, heavily burdens the national
health-care market. See 42 U. S. C. §18091(2). As just
noted, the cost of emergency care or treatment for a seri­
ous illness generally exceeds what an individual can afford
to pay on her own. Unlike markets for most products,
however, the inability to pay for care does not mean that
an uninsured individual will receive no care. Federal and
state law, as well as professional obligations and embed­
ded social norms, require hospitals and physicians to
provide care when it is most needed, regardless of the
patient’s ability to pay. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §1395dd; Fla.
Stat. §395.1041(3)(f) (2010); Tex. Health & Safety Code
