Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

patible with the Spending Clause, Congress’ extension of
Medicaid remains available to any State that affirms its
willingness to participate.
A
Expansion has been characteristic of the Medicaid pro­
gram. Akin to the ACA in 2010, the Medicaid Act as
passed in 1965 augmented existing federal grant programs
jointly administered with the States.13 States were not
required to participate in Medicaid. But if they did, the
Federal Government paid at least half the costs. To qualify for these grants, States had to offer a minimum level of
health coverage to beneficiaries of four federally funded,
state-administered welfare programs: Aid to Families with
Dependent Children; Old Age Assistance; Aid to the Blind;
and Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled. See
Social Security Amendments of 1965, §121(a), 79 Stat.
343; Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S. 34, 37 (1981).
At their option, States could enroll additional “medically
needy” individuals; these costs, too, were partially borne by
the Federal Government at the same, at least 50%, rate.

Since 1965, Congress has amended the Medicaid pro­
gram on more than 50 occasions, sometimes quite sizably.
Most relevant here, between 1988 and 1990, Congress
——————
13 Medicaid was “plainly an extension of the existing Kerr-Mills”
grant program. Huberfeld, Federalizing Medicaid, 14 U. Pa. J. Const.
L. 431, 444–445 (2011). Indeed, the “section of the Senate report
dealing with Title XIX”—the title establishing Medicaid—“was entitled,
‘Improvement and Extension of Kerr-Mills Medical Assistance Pro­
gram.’ ” Stevens & Stevens, Welfare Medicine in America 51 (1974)
(quoting S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 9 (1965)).
Setting the pattern for Medicaid, Kerr-Mills reimbursed States for a
portion of the cost of health care provided to welfare recipients if
States met conditions specified in the federal law, e.g., participating
States were obliged to offer minimum coverage for hospitalization and
physician services. See Huberfeld, supra, at 443–444.
