Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 


required participating States to include among their bene­
ficiaries pregnant women with family incomes up to 133%
of the federal poverty level, children up to age 6 at the
same income levels, and children ages 6 to 18 with family
incomes up to 100% of the poverty level. See 42 U. S. C.
§§1396a(a)(10)(A)(i), 1396a(l); Medicare Catastrophic Cov­
erage Act of 1988, §302, 102 Stat. 750; Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1989, §6401, 103 Stat. 2258; Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, §4601, 104 Stat.
1388–166. These amendments added millions to the
Medicaid-eligible population. Dubay & Kenney, Lessons

tab. Medicaid’s 2010 expansion is financed largely by
federal outlays. In 2014, federal funds will cover 100%
of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries; that rate will
gradually decrease before settling at 90% in 2020. 42
U. S. C. §1396d(y) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). By comparison,
federal contributions toward the care of beneficiaries

57% between 2005 and 2008. §1396d(b) (2006 ed., Supp.
