SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


The actual cost of the regulations and taxes may be
more or less than predicted. What is known, however, is
that severing other provisions from the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion necessarily would impose
significant risks and real uncertainties on insurance companies, their customers, all other major actors in the system, and the government treasury. And what also is

Medicare and Medicaid, distorts the ACA’s design of
“shared responsibility.” Some hospitals may be forced to
raise the cost of care in order to offset the reductions in
reimbursements, which could raise the cost of insurance
premiums, in contravention of the Act’s goal of “lower[ing]
