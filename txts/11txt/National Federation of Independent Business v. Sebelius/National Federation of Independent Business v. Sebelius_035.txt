Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.

the words of The Federalist, ‘merely acts of usurpation’
which ‘deserve to be treated as such.’ ” Printz v. United
States, 521 U. S. 898, 924 (1997) (alterations omitted)
(quoting The Federalist No. 33, at 204 (A. Hamilton)); see
also New York, 505 U. S., at 177; Comstock, supra, at ___
(slip op., at 5) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (“It
is of fundamental importance to consider whether essential attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the
assertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper
Clause . . .”).
Applying these principles, the individual mandate cannot be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause
as an essential component of the insurance reforms. Each
of our prior cases upholding laws under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service
to, a granted power. For example, we have upheld provisions permitting continued confinement of those already
in federal custody when they could not be safely released,
Comstock, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1–2); criminalizing bribes involving organizations receiving federal funds,
Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 602, 605 (2004); and
tolling state statutes of limitations while cases are pending in federal court, Jinks v. Richland County, 538
U. S. 456, 459, 462 (2003). The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to
create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enumerated power.
This is in no way an authority that is “narrow in scope,”
Comstock, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20), or “incidental” to
the exercise of the commerce power, McCulloch, supra, at
418. Rather, such a conception of the Necessary and
Proper Clause would work a substantial expansion of
federal authority. No longer would Congress be limited to
regulating under the Commerce Clause those who by some
preexisting activity bring themselves within the sphere of
federal regulation. Instead, Congress could reach beyond
