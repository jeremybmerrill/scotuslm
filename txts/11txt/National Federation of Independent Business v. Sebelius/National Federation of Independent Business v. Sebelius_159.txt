strictions articulated in our cases”). For one thing, any
such conditions must be unambiguous so that a State at
least knows what it is getting into. See Pennhurst, supra,
at 17. Conditions must also be related “to the federal
interest in particular national projects or programs,”
Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444, 461 (1978),
and the conditional grant of federal funds may not “induce
the States to engage in activities that would themselves be
unconstitutional,” Dole, supra, at 210; see Lawrence County
v. Lead-Deadwood School Dist. No. 40–1, 469 U. S.
256, 269–270 (1985). Finally, while Congress may seek to
induce States to accept conditional grants, Congress may
not cross the “point at which pressure turns into compulsion, and ceases to be inducement.” Steward Machine, 301
U. S., at 590. Accord, College Savings Bank, supra, at 687;

Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 285 (1991)
(White, J., dissenting); Dole, supra, at 211.
When federal legislation gives the States a real choice
whether to accept or decline a federal aid package, the
federal-state relationship is in the nature of a contractual
relationship. See Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 186
(2002); Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17. And just as a contract
is voidable if coerced, “[t]he legitimacy of Congress’ power
to legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether
the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms
of the ‘contract.’ ” Ibid. (emphasis added). If a federal
spending program coerces participation the States have
not “exercise[d] their choice”—let alone made an “informed
choice.” Id., at 17, 25.
Coercing States to accept conditions risks the destruction of the “unique role of the States in our system.”
Davis, supra, at 685 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). “[T]he
Constitution has never been understood to confer upon
Congress the ability to require the States to govern according to Congress’ instructions.” New York, 505 U. S., at
