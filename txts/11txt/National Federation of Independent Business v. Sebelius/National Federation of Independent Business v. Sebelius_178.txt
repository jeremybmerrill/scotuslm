NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 

BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting


other requirements; comprehensive regulation and penalties; some undoubted taxes; and increases in some governmental expenditures, decreases in others. Under the
severability test set out above, it must be determined if
those provisions function in a coherent way and as Congress would have intended, even when the major provisions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid
Expansion are themselves invalid.
Congress did not intend to establish the goal of nearuniversal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences.
See, e.g., ACA §1563, 124 Stat. 270 (“[T]his Act will reduce
the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019”). And it did
not intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one industry or group of individuals. The whole design of the Act
is to balance the costs and benefits affecting each set
of regulated parties. Thus, individuals are required to
obtain health insurance. See 26 U. S. C. §5000A(a). Insurance companies are required to sell them insurance regardless of patients’ pre-existing conditions and to comply
with a host of other regulations. And the companies must
pay new taxes. See §4980I (high-cost insurance plans);
42 U. S. C. §§300gg(a)(1), 300gg–4(b) (community rating);
§§300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4(a) (guaranteed issue);
§300gg–11 (elimination of coverage limits); §300gg–14(a)
(dependent children up to age 26); ACA §§9010, 10905,
124 Stat. 865, 1017 (excise tax); Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) §1401, 124 Stat.
1059 (excise tax). States are expected to expand Medicaid
eligibility and to create regulated marketplaces called exchanges where individuals can purchase insurance. See
42 U. S. C. §§1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)
(Medicaid Expansion), 18031 (exchanges). Some persons
who cannot afford insurance are provided it through the
Medicaid Expansion, and others are aided in their purchase of insurance through federal subsidies available on
health-insurance exchanges. See 26 U. S. C. §36B (2006
