Opinion R the Court

engage in commerce, and the Government’s efforts to cast
the individual mandate in a different light were unpersuasive. Judge Marcus dissented, reasoning that the individual mandate regulates economic activity that has a clear
effect on interstate commerce.
Having held the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, the majority examined whether that provision
could be severed from the remainder of the Act. The majority determined that, contrary to the District Court’s
view, it could. The court thus struck down only the individual mandate, leaving the Act’s other provisions intact.
648 F. 3d, at 1328.
Other Courts of Appeals have also heard challenges to
the individual mandate. The Sixth Circuit and the D. C.
Circuit upheld the mandate as a valid exercise of Congress’s commerce power. See Thomas More Law Center v.
Obama, 651 F. 3d 529 (CA6 2011); Seven-Sky v. Holder,
661 F. 3d 1 (CADC 2011). The Fourth Circuit determined
that the Anti-Injunction Act prevents courts from considering the merits of that question. See Liberty Univ., Inc.
v. Geithner, 671 F. 3d 391 (2011). That statute bars suits
“for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection
of any tax.” 26 U. S. C. §7421(a). A majority of the Fourth
Circuit panel reasoned that the individual mandate’s
penalty is a tax within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction
Act, because it is a financial assessment collected by the
IRS through the normal means of taxation. The majority
therefore determined that the plaintiffs could not challenge the individual mandate until after they paid the
penalty.1
——————
1 The Eleventh Circuit did not consider whether the Anti-Injunction
Act bars challenges to the individual mandate. The District Court had
determined that it did not, and neither side challenged that holding on
appeal. The same was true in the Fourth Circuit, but that court
examined the question sua sponte because it viewed the Anti-Injunction
Act as a limit on its subject matter jurisdiction. See Liberty Univ., 671
