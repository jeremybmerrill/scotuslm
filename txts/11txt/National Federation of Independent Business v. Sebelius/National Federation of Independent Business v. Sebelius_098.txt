Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

rating requirements would trigger an adverse-selection
death-spiral in the health-insurance market: Insurance
premiums would skyrocket, the number of uninsured
would increase, and insurance companies would exit the
market. See supra, at 10–11. When complemented by an
insurance mandate, on the other hand, guaranteed issue
and community rating would work as intended, increasing
access to insurance and reducing uncompensated care.
See supra, at 11–12. The minimum coverage provision is
thus an “essential par[t] of a larger regulation of economic
activity”; without the provision, “the regulatory scheme

purchase health insurance is not “proper” legislation, THE
CHIEF JUSTICE urges, because the command “under­

JUSTICE’s argument is short on substance.

Court concluded that a federal statute impermissibly
transgressed the Constitution’s boundary between state
and federal authority: Printz v. United States, 521 U. S.
898 (1997), and New York v. United States, 505 U. S.
144 (1992). See ante, at 29. The statutes at issue in
