MISSOURI v. FRYE
Opinion of the Court

I
In August 2007, respondent Galin Frye was charged
with driving with a revoked license. Frye had been convicted for that offense on three other occasions, so the
State of Missouri charged him with a class D felony, which
carries a maximum term of imprisonment of four years.
See Mo. Rev. Stat. §§302.321.2, 558.011.1(4) (2011).
On November 15, the prosecutor sent a letter to Frye’s
counsel offering a choice of two plea bargains. App. 50.
The prosecutor first offered to recommend a 3-year sentence if there was a guilty plea to the felony charge, without a recommendation regarding probation but with a
recommendation that Frye serve 10 days in jail as socalled “shock” time. The second offer was to reduce the
charge to a misdemeanor and, if Frye pleaded guilty to it,
to recommend a 90-day sentence. The misdemeanor
charge of driving with a revoked license carries a maximum term of imprisonment of one year. 311 S. W. 3d 350,
360 (Mo. App. 2010). The letter stated both offers would
expire on December 28. Frye’s attorney did not advise
Frye that the offers had been made. The offers expired.
Id., at 356.
Frye’s preliminary hearing was scheduled for January 4,
2008. On December 30, 2007, less than a week before
the hearing, Frye was again arrested for driving with a revoked license. App. 47–48, 311 S. W. 3d, at 352–353. At
the January 4 hearing, Frye waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the charge arising from the August 2007
arrest. He pleaded not guilty at a subsequent arraignment but then changed his plea to guilty. There was no
underlying plea agreement. App. 5, 13, 16. The state trial
court accepted Frye’s guilty plea. Id., at 21. The prosecutor recommended a 3-year sentence, made no recommendation regarding probation, and requested 10 days shock
time in jail. Id., at 22. The trial judge sentenced Frye to
three years in prison. Id., at 21, 23.
