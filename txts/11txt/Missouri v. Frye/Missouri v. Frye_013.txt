Opinion of the Court

however. Here the question is whether defense counsel
has the duty to communicate the terms of a formal offer to
accept a plea on terms and conditions that may result in a
lesser sentence, a conviction on lesser charges, or both.
This Court now holds that, as a general rule, defense
counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from
the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions
that may be favorable to the accused. Any exceptions to
that rule need not be explored here, for the offer was a
formal one with a fixed expiration date. When defense
counsel allowed the offer to expire without advising the
defendant or allowing him to consider it, defense counsel
did not render the effective assistance the Constitution
requires.
Though the standard for counsel’s performance is not
determined solely by reference to codified standards of
professional practice, these standards can be important
guides. The American Bar Association recommends defense counsel “promptly communicate and explain to the
defendant all plea offers made by the prosecuting attorney,” ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty
14–3.2(a) (3d ed. 1999), and this standard has been adopted by numerous state and federal courts over the last 30
years. See, e.g., Davie v. State, 381 S. C. 601, 608–609,
675 S. E. 2d 416, 420 (2009); Cottle v. State, 733 So. 2d
963, 965–966 (Fla. 1999); Becton v. Hun, 205 W. Va. 139,
144, 516 S. E. 2d 762, 767 (1999); Harris v. State, 875
S. W. 2d 662, 665 (Tenn. 1994); Lloyd v. State, 258 Ga.
645, 648, 373 S. E. 2d 1, 3 (1988); United States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F. 2d 747, 752 (CA1 1991) (per curiam); Pham v. United States, 317 F. 3d 178, 182 (CA2
2003); United States ex rel. Caruso v. Zelinsky, 689 F. 2d
435, 438 (CA3 1982); Griffin v. United States, 330 F. 3d
733, 737 (CA6 2003); Johnson v. Duckworth, 793 F. 2d
