MISSOURI v. FRYE
Opinion of the Court

ment interrogations, postindictment lineups, and the
entry of a guilty plea. See Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S.
52 (1961) (arraignment); Massiah v. United States, 377
U. S. 201 (1964) (postindictment interrogation); Wade,
supra (postindictment lineup); Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407
U. S. 25 (1972) (guilty plea).
With respect to the right to effective counsel in plea
negotiations, a proper beginning point is to discuss two
cases from this Court considering the role of counsel in
advising a client about a plea offer and an ensuing guilty
plea: Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985); and Padilla v.
Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___(2010).
Hill established that claims of ineffective assistance of
counsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the
two-part test set forth in Strickland. See Hill, supra, at
57. As noted above, in Frye’s case, the Missouri Court of
Appeals, applying the two part test of Strickland, determined first that defense counsel had been ineffective and
second that there was resulting prejudice.
In Hill, the decision turned on the second part of the
Strickland test. There, a defendant who had entered a
guilty plea claimed his counsel had misinformed him of
the amount of time he would have to serve before he became eligible for parole. But the defendant had not alleged that, even if adequate advice and assistance had
been given, he would have elected to plead not guilty and
proceed to trial. Thus, the Court found that no prejudice
from the inadequate advice had been shown or alleged.
Hill, supra, at 60.
In Padilla, the Court again discussed the duties of
counsel in advising a client with respect to a plea offer
that leads to a guilty plea. Padilla held that a guilty plea,
based on a plea offer, should be set aside because counsel
misinformed the defendant of the immigration consequences of the conviction. The Court made clear that “the
negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litiga-
