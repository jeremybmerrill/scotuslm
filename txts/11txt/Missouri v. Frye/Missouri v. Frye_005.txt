MISSOURI, PETITIONER v. GALIN E. FRYE
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF 

MISSOURI, WESTERN DISTRICT

[March 21, 2012]

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States by the
terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that the accused shall have the assistance of counsel in all criminal
prosecutions. The right to counsel is the right to effective
assistance of counsel. See Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668, 686 (1984). This case arises in the context of
claimed ineffective assistance that led to the lapse of a
prosecution offer of a plea bargain, a proposal that offered
terms more lenient than the terms of the guilty plea entered later. The initial question is whether the constitutional right to counsel extends to the negotiation and
consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected. If
there is a right to effective assistance with respect to those
offers, a further question is what a defendant must demonstrate in order to show that prejudice resulted from
counsel’s deficient performance. Other questions relating
to ineffective assistance with respect to plea offers, including the question of proper remedies, are considered in a
second case decided today. See Lafler v. Cooper, post, at
3–16.
