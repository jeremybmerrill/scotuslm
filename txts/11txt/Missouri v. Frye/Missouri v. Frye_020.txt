MISSOURI, PETITIONER v. GALIN E. FRYE
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF 

MISSOURI, WESTERN DISTRICT

[March 21, 2012]

JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
This is a companion case to Lafler v. Cooper, post, p. ___.
The principal difference between the cases is that the
fairness of the defendant’s conviction in Lafler was established by a full trial and jury verdict, whereas Frye’s
conviction here was established by his own admission of
guilt, received by the court after the usual colloquy that
assured it was voluntary and truthful. In Lafler all that
could be said (and as I discuss there it was quite enough)
is that the fairness of the conviction was clear, though a
unanimous jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt can
sometimes be wrong. Here it can be said not only that the
process was fair, but that the defendant acknowledged the
correctness of his conviction. Thus, as far as the reasons
for my dissent are concerned, this is an a fortiori case. I
will not repeat here the constitutional points that I discuss
at length in Lafler, but I will briefly apply those points to
the facts here and comment upon a few statements in the
Court’s analysis.

of any substantive or procedural right; only of the oppor-
