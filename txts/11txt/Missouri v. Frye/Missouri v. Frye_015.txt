Opinion of the Court

(encouraging parties to “memorialize in some fashion prior
to trial (1) the fact that a plea bargain offer was made, and
(2) that the defendant was advised of the offer [and] its
precise terms, . . . and (3) the defendant’s response to the

standard laid out in Hill. In cases where a defendant
complains that ineffective assistance led him to accept a
plea offer as opposed to proceeding to trial, the defendant
will have to show “a reasonable probability that, but for
