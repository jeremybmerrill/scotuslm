Opinion of the Court

The State’s contentions are neither illogical nor without
some persuasive force, yet they do not suffice to overcome
a simple reality. Ninety-seven percent of federal convictions and ninety-four percent of state convictions are
the result of guilty pleas. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau
of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics Online, Table 5.22.2009, http://www.albany.edu/

“To a large extent . . . horse trading [between prosecutor
