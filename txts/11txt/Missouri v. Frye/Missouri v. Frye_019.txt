Opinion of the Court

a plea bargain. In Missouri, it appears “a plea offer once
accepted by the defendant can be withdrawn without recourse” by the prosecution. 311 S. W. 3d, at 359. The extent of the trial court’s discretion in Missouri to reject a
plea agreement appears to be in some doubt. Compare id.,
at 360, with Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4).
We remand for the Missouri Court of Appeals to consider these state-law questions, because they bear on the
federal question of Strickland prejudice. If, as the Missouri court stated here, the prosecutor could have canceled
the plea agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable
probability the prosecutor would have adhered to the
agreement, there is no Strickland prejudice. Likewise, if
the trial court could have refused to accept the plea
agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable probability the trial court would have accepted the plea, there is no
Strickland prejudice. In this case, given Frye’s new offense for driving without a license on December 30, 2007,
there is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have
adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would
have accepted it at the January 4, 2008, hearing, unless
they were required by state law to do so.
It is appropriate to allow the Missouri Court of Appeals
to address this question in the first instance. The judgment of the Missouri Court of Appeals is vacated, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
