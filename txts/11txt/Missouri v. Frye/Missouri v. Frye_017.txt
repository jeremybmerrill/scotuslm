Opinion of the Court

Rules, some state rules including in Missouri, and this
Court’s precedents give trial courts some leeway to accept
or reject plea agreements, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
11(c)(3); see Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4); Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243–244 (1969). It can be assumed
that in most jurisdictions prosecutors and judges are
familiar with the boundaries of acceptable plea bargains
and sentences. So in most instances it should not be

Offer to Frye during the Offer window, let alone any evidence that Frye’s conduct interfered with trial counsel’s
ability to do so.” 311 S. W. 3d, at 356. On this record, it
is evident that Frye’s attorney did not make a meaningful
attempt to inform the defendant of a written plea offer
before the offer expired. See supra, at 2. The Missouri
Court of Appeals was correct that “counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.”
Strickland, supra, at 688.
The Court of Appeals erred, however, in articulating the
precise standard for prejudice in this context. As noted, a
defendant in Frye’s position must show not only a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the lapsed
plea but also a reasonable probability that the prosecution
