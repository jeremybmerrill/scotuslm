MISSOURI v. FRYE
Opinion of the Court

832, 834 (CA11 1991). The standard for prompt communication and consultation is also set out in state bar professional standards for attorneys. See, e.g., Fla. Rule Regulating Bar 4–1.4 (2008); Ill. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2011);
Kan. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2010); Ky. Sup. Ct. Rule
3.130, Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2011); Mass. Rule Prof.
Conduct 1.4 (2011–2012); Mich. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4
(2011).
The prosecution and the trial courts may adopt some
measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabricated claims after a later, less advantageous plea offer has
been accepted or after a trial leading to conviction with
resulting harsh consequences. First, the fact of a formal
offer means that its terms and its processing can be documented so that what took place in the negotiation process
becomes more clear if some later inquiry turns on the
conduct of earlier pretrial negotiations. Second, States
may elect to follow rules that all offers must be in writing,
again to ensure against later misunderstandings or fabricated charges. See N. J. Ct. Rule 3:9–1(b) (2012) (“Any
plea offer to be made by the prosecutor shall be in writing
and forwarded to the defendant’s attorney”). Third, formal
offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent
plea proceeding or before a trial on the merits, all to ensure that a defendant has been fully advised before those
further proceedings commence. At least one State often
follows a similar procedure before trial. See Brief for
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al.
as Amici Curiae 20 (discussing hearings in Arizona conducted pursuant to State v. Donald, 198 Ariz. 406, 10 P. 3d
1193 (App. 2000)); see also N. J. Ct. Rules 3:9–1(b), (c)
(requiring the prosecutor and defense counsel to discuss
the case prior to the arraignment/status conference including any plea offers and to report on these discussions in
open court with the defendant present); In re Alvernaz, 2
Cal. 4th 924, 938, n. 7, 830 P. 2d 747, 756, n. 7 (1992)
