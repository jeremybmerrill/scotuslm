MISSOURI v. FRYE
Opinion of the Court

bargaining purposes. This often results in individuals
who accept a plea bargain receiving shorter sentences
than other individuals who are less morally culpable but
take a chance and go to trial” (footnote omitted)). In today’s criminal justice system, therefore, the negotiation of
a plea bargain, rather than the unfolding of a trial, is
almost always the critical point for a defendant.
To note the prevalence of plea bargaining is not to criticize it. The potential to conserve valuable prosecutorial
resources and for defendants to admit their crimes and
receive more favorable terms at sentencing means that a
plea agreement can benefit both parties. In order that
these benefits can be realized, however, criminal defendants require effective counsel during plea negotiations.
“Anything less . . . might deny a defendant ‘effective representation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and
advice would help him.’ ” Massiah, 377 U. S., at 204 (quoting Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 326 (1959) (Douglas, J., concurring)).

The inquiry then becomes how to define the duty and
responsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bargain
process. This is a difficult question. “The art of negotiation is at least as nuanced as the art of trial advocacy and
it presents questions farther removed from immediate
judicial supervision.” Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. ___, ___
(2011) (slip op., at 8–9). Bargaining is, by its nature,
defined to a substantial degree by personal style. The
alternative courses and tactics in negotiation are so individual that it may be neither prudent nor practicable to
try to elaborate or define detailed standards for the proper
discharge of defense counsel’s participation in the process.
Cf. ibid.
This case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion
to define the duties of defense counsel in those respects,
