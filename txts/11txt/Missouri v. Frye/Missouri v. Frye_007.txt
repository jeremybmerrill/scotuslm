Opinion of the Court

Frye filed for postconviction relief in state court. Id., at
8, 25–29. He alleged his counsel’s failure to inform him of
the prosecution’s plea offer denied him the effective assistance of counsel. At an evidentiary hearing, Frye testified
he would have entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor
had he known about the offer. Id., at 34.
A state court denied the postconviction motion, id., at
52–57, but the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed, 311
S. W. 3d 350. It determined that Frye met both of the
requirements for showing a Sixth Amendment violation
under Strickland. First, the court determined Frye’s
counsel’s performance was deficient because the “record is
void of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to communicate the Offer to Frye during the Offer window.” 311
S. W. 3d, at 355, 356 (emphasis deleted). The court next
concluded Frye had shown his counsel’s deficient performance caused him prejudice because “Frye pled guilty to
a felony instead of a misdemeanor and was subject to a
maximum sentence of four years instead of one year.” Id.,
at 360.
To implement a remedy for the violation, the court
deemed Frye’s guilty plea withdrawn and remanded to
allow Frye either to insist on a trial or to plead guilty
to any offense the prosecutor deemed it appropriate to
charge. This Court granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___

It is well settled that the right to the effective assistance
of counsel applies to certain steps before trial. The “Sixth
Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to have
counsel present at all ‘critical’ stages of the criminal proceedings.” Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 786 (2009)
