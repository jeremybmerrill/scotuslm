SCALIA, J., dissenting

subject covered by the Sixth Amendment, which is concerned not with the fairness of bargaining but with the
fairness of conviction. “The Constitution . . . is not an allpurpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect world;
and when we ignore its text in order to make it that, we
often find ourselves swinging a sledge where a tack hammer is needed.” Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1). In this case
and its companion, the Court’s sledge may require the
reversal of perfectly valid, eminently just, convictions. A
legislature could solve the problems presented by these
cases in a much more precise and efficient manner. It
might begin, for example, by penalizing the attorneys
who made such grievous errors. That type of subconstitutional remedy is not available to the Court, which
is limited to penalizing (almost) everyone else by reversing
valid convictions or sentences. Because that result is
inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment and decades of
our precedent, I respectfully dissent.
