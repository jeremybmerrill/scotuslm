FILARSKY v. DELIA
Opinion of the Court

1018, 1019 (1893) (“A member of a posse comitatus summoned by the sheriff to aid in the execution of a warrant
for a felony in the sheriff ’s hands is entitled to the same
protection in the discharge of his duties as the sheriff
himself ”); State v. Mooring, 115 N. C. 709, 20 S. E. 182
(1894) (considering it “well settled by the courts” that a
sheriff may break open the doors of a house to execute a
search warrant and that “if he act in good faith in doing
so, both he and his posse comitatus will be protected”);
North Carolina v. Gosnell, 74 F. 734, 738–739 (CC WDNC
1896) (“Both judicial and ministerial officers, in the execution of the duties of their office, are under the strong
protection of the law; and their legally summoned assistants, for such time as in service, are officers of the law”);
Reed v. Rice, 25 Ky. 44, 46–47 (App. 1829) (private individuals summoned by a constable to execute a search
warrant were protected from a suit based on the invalidity
of the warrant).
Indeed, examples of individuals receiving immunity for
actions taken while engaged in public service on a temporary or occasional basis are as varied as the reach of government itself. See, e.g., Gregory v. Brooks, 37 Conn. 365,
372 (1870) (public wharfmaster not liable for ordering removal of a vessel unless the order was issued maliciously);
Henderson v. Smith, 26 W. Va. 829, 836–838 (1885)
(notaries public given immunity for discretionary acts
taken in good faith); Chamberlain v. Clayton, 56 Iowa 331,
9 N. W. 237 (1881) (trustees of a public institution for the
disabled not liable absent a showing of malice); McCormick v. Burt, 95 Ill. 263, 265–266 (1880) (school board
members not liable for suspending a student in good
faith); Donohue v. Richards, 38 Me. 379, 392 (1854)
(same); Downer v. Lent, 6 Cal. 94, 95 (1856) (members of a
Board of Pilot Commissioners given immunity for official
acts); Rail v. Potts & Baker, 27 Tenn. 225, 228–230 (1847)
(private individuals appointed by the sheriff to serve as
