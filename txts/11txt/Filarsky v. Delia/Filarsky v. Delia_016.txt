ment duties free from the distractions that can accompany
even routine lawsuits is also implicated when individuals
other than permanent government employees discharge
these duties. See Richardson, supra, at 411. Not only will
such individuals’ performance of any ongoing government
responsibilities suffer from the distraction of lawsuits, but
such distractions will also often affect any public employees with whom they work by embroiling those employees
in litigation. This case is again a good example: If the suit
against Filarsky moves forward, it is highly likely that
Chief Wells, Bekker, and Peel will all be required to testify, given their roles in the dispute. Allowing suit under
§1983 against private individuals assisting the government will substantially undermine an important reason
immunity is accorded public employees in the first place.
Distinguishing among those who carry out the public’s
business based on the nature of their particular relationship with the government also creates significant linedrawing problems. It is unclear, for example, how Filarsky would be categorized if he regularly spent half his
time working for the City, or worked exclusively on one
City project for an entire year. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34–36.
Such questions deprive state actors of the ability to “reasonably anticipate when their conduct may give rise to
liability for damages,” Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.
635, 646 (1987) (alteration and internal quotation marks
omitted), frustrating the purposes immunity is meant to
serve. An uncertain immunity is little better than no
immunity at all.

Our decisions in Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158 (1992), and
Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399 (1997), are not to
the contrary. In Wyatt, we held that individuals who used
a state replevin law to compel the local sheriff to seize
disputed property from a former business partner were
