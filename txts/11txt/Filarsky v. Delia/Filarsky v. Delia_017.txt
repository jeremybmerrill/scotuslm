FILARSKY v. DELIA
Opinion of the Court

U. S. 922 (holding that an individual who uses a state

ability to achieve its objectives through their public service. Put simply, Wyatt involved no government agents,
no government interests, and no government need for

employed by a private company and working in a privately
run prison facility did not enjoy the same protection. We
explained that the various incentives characteristic of the
