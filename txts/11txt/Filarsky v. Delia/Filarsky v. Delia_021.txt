FILARSKY v. DELIA
GINSBURG, J., concurring

Delia v. Rialto, 621 F. 3d 1069, 1077 (CA9 2010). “[W]e
will do it a different way,” Filarsky informed Delia. App.
129; see 621 F. 3d, at 1077 (“Unable to obtain Delia’s
consent to a warrantless search of his house . . . , Filarsky
tried a different tactic.”).
Following Filarsky’s advice, Fire Chief Wells ordered
Delia to bring the insulation out of his house and place the
rolls on his lawn for inspection. App. 158. Filarsky recommended this course, the Ninth Circuit observed, mindful that “an individual does not have an expectation of
privacy in items exposed to the public, thereby eliminating
the need for a search warrant.” 621 F. 3d, at 1077. Delia
complied with Chief Wells’s order by producing the rolls,
all of them unused, App. 78, 85, after which the investigation into the legitimacy of Delia’s absence from work
apparently ended.
In explaining why the individual defendants other than
Filarsky were entitled to summary judgment on their
qualified immunity pleas, the Ninth Circuit stated that
“no . . . threat to [Delia’s] employment” attended Fire
Chief Wells’s order. 621 F. 3d, at 1079. The District
Court similarly stated that “Delia was not threatened with
insubordination or termination if he did not comply with
[the] order.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48.
These statements are at odds with the facts, as recounted by the Court of Appeals. “At the onset of the interview,” the Ninth Circuit stressed, “Filarsky warned Delia
that he was obligated to fully cooperate,” and that “[i]f at
any time it is deemed you are not cooperating then you
can be held to be insubordinate and subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.” 621 F. 3d, at
1072 (internal quotation marks omitted). Continuing in
this vein, the Court of Appeals concluded that “Delia’s
actions were involuntary and coerced by the direct threat
of sanctions including loss of his firefighter position.” Id.,
at 1077; see id., at 1085 (“Delia’s actions were involun-
