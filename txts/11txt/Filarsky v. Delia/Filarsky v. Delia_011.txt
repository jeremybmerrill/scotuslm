FILARSKY v. DELIA
Opinion of the Court

the Attorney General of the United States was expected to
and did maintain an active private law practice. To cite a
notable illustration, in Hayburn’s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792),
the first Attorney General, Edmund Randolph, sought a
writ of mandamus from this Court to compel a lower court
to hear William Hayburn’s petition to be put on the pension list. When this Court did not allow the Attorney
General to seek the writ in his official capacity, Randolph
readily solved the problem by arguing the case as Hayburn’s private lawyer. Ibid.; see also Letter from Edmund
Randolph to James Madison (Aug. 12, 1792), reprinted in
14 The Papers of James Madison 348, 349 (R. Rutland,
T. Mason, R. Brugger, J. Sisson, & F. Teute eds. 1983);

Constitutional Scheme: In the Beginning There Was
Pragmatism, 1989 Duke L. J. 561, 598–599, n. 121, 619.
Given all this, it should come as no surprise that the
common law did not draw a distinction between public
servants and private individuals engaged in public service
in according protection to those carrying out government
responsibilities. Government actors involved in adjudicative activities, for example, were protected by an absolute
immunity from suit. See Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335,
347–348 (1872); J. Bishop, Commentaries on the NonContract Law §781 (1889). This immunity applied equally
to “the highest judge in the State or nation” and “the
lowest officer who sits as a court and tries petty causes,”
T. Cooley, Law of Torts 409 (1879), including those who
served as judges on a part-time or episodic basis. Justices
of the peace, for example, often maintained active private
law practices (or even had nonlegal livelihoods), and generally served in a judicial capacity only part-time. See
Hubbell v. Harbeck, 54 Hun. 147, 7 N. Y. S. 243 (1889);
Ingraham v. Leland, 19 Vt. 304 (1847). In fact, justices of
the peace were not even paid a salary by the government,
but instead received compensation through fees payable
