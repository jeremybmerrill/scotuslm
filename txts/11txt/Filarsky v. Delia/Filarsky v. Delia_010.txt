been a surprise to find, on a trip to the docks, the local
ferryman collecting harbor fees as public wharfmaster.

Even such a core government activity as criminal prosecution was often carried out by a mixture of public employees and private individuals temporarily serving the
public. At the time §1983 was enacted, private lawyers
were regularly engaged to conduct criminal prosecutions
on behalf of the State. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gibbs,
70 Mass. 146 (1855); White v. Polk County, 17 Iowa 413
(1864). Abraham Lincoln himself accepted several such
appointments. See, e.g., An Awful Crime and Speedy
Punishment, Springfield Daily Register, May 14, 1853
(reporting that “A. Lincoln, esq. was appointed prosecutor”
in a rape case). In addition, private lawyers often assisted
public prosecutors in significant cases. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Knapp, 10 Mass. 477, 490–491 (1830);
Chambers v. State, 22 Tenn. 237 (1842). And public prosecutors themselves continued to represent private clients
while in office—sometimes creating odd conflicts of interest. See People v. Bussey, 82 Mich. 49, 46 N. W. 97, 98
(1890) (public prosecutor employed as private counsel by
the defendant’s wife in several civil suits against the
defendant); Phillip v. Waller, 5 Haw. 609, 617 (1886)
(public prosecutor represented plaintiff in a suit for malicious prosecution); Oliver v. Pate, 43 Ind. 132, 139 (1873)
(public prosecutor who conducted a state prosecution
against a defendant later served as counsel for the defendant in a malicious prosecution suit against the complaining witness).
This mixture of public responsibility and private pursuits extended even to the highest levels of government.
Until the position became full-time in 1853, for example,
