FILARSKY v. DELIA
Opinion of the Court

[his] house.” Delia v. Rialto, No. CV 08–03359 (CD Cal.,
Mar. 9, 2009), App. to Pet. for Cert. 42, 48.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed
with respect to all defendants except Filarsky. The Court
of Appeals concluded that the order violated the Fourth
Amendment, but agreed with the District Court that Delia
“ha[d] not demonstrated that a constitutional right was
clearly established as of the date of Chief Wells’s order,
such that defendants would have known that their actions
were unlawful.” Delia v. Rialto, 621 F. 3d 1069, 1079
(2010). As to Filarsky, however, the court concluded that
because he was a private attorney and not a City employee, he was not entitled to seek the protection of qualified
immunity. Id., at 1080–1081. The court noted that its
decision conflicted with a decision of the Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit, see Cullinan v. Abramson, 128 F. 3d
301, 310 (1997), but considered itself bound by Circuit
precedent and therefore “not free to follow the Cullinan
decision.” 621 F. 3d, at 1080 (citing Gonzalez v. Spencer,
336 F. 3d 832 (CA9 2003)).
Filarsky filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted.
564 U. S. ___ (2011).

Section 1983 provides a cause of action against any
person who deprives an individual of federally guaranteed
rights “under color” of state law. 42 U. S. C. §1983. Anyone whose conduct is “fairly attributable to the state” can
be sued as a state actor under §1983. See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, 937 (1982). At common
law, government actors were afforded certain protections
from liability, based on the reasoning that “the public good
can best be secured by allowing officers charged with the
duty of deciding upon the rights of others, to act upon
their own free, unbiased convictions, uninfluenced by any
apprehensions.” Wasson v. Mitchell, 18 Iowa 153, 155–156
