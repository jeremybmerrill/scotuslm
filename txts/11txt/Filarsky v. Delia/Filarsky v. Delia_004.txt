STEVE A. FILARSKY, PETITIONER v. NICHOLAS B.

DELIA

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 17, 2012] 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Section 1983 provides a cause of action against state
actors who violate an individual’s rights under federal law.
42 U. S. C. §1983. At common law, those who carried out
the work of government enjoyed various protections from
liability when doing so, in order to allow them to serve the
government without undue fear of personal exposure. Our
decisions have looked to these common law protections
in affording either absolute or qualified immunity to individuals sued under §1983. The question in this case is
whether an individual hired by the government to do its
work is prohibited from seeking such immunity, solely because he works for the government on something other
than a permanent or full-time basis.
