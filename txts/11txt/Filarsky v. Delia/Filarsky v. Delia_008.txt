Opinion of the Court

(1864) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also W.
Prosser, Law of Torts §25, p. 150 (1941) (common law
protections derived from the need to avoid the “impossible
burden [that] would fall upon all our agencies of government” if those acting on behalf of the government were
“unduly hampered and intimidated in the discharge of
their duties” by a fear of personal liability). Our decisions
have recognized similar immunities under §1983, reasoning that common law protections “ ‘well grounded in history and reason’ had not been abrogated ‘by covert inclusion
in the general language’ of §1983.” Imbler v. Pachtman,
424 U. S. 409, 418 (1976) (quoting Tenney v. Brandhove,
341 U. S. 367, 376 (1951)).
In this case, there is no dispute that qualified immunity

See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 243–244 (2009).
The Court of Appeals granted this protection to Chief
Wells, Peel, and Bekker, but denied it to Filarsky, because
he was not a public employee but was instead a private

“general principles of tort immunities and defenses” applicable at common law, and the reasons we have afforded
protection from suit under §1983. Imbler, supra, at 418.
A
Under our precedent, the inquiry begins with the common law as it existed when Congress passed §1983 in
1871. Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984). Understanding the protections the common law afforded to those
exercising government power in 1871 requires an appreciation of the nature of government at that time. In the
mid-nineteenth century, government was smaller in both
size and reach. It had fewer responsibilities, and operated
primarily at the local level. Local governments faced tight
