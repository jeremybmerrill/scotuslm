Opinion of the Court

judges of an election were not liable for refusing a voter
absent a showing of malice); Jenkins v. Waldron, 11
Johns. 114, 120–121 (NY Sup. Ct. 1814) (same).
We read §1983 “in harmony with general principles of
tort immunities and defenses.” Imbler, 424 U. S., at 418.
And we “proceed[ ] on the assumption that common-law
principles of . . . immunity were incorporated into our
judicial system and that they should not be abrogated
absent clear legislative intent to do so.” Pulliam v. Allen,
466 U. S. 522, 529 (1984). Under this assumption, immunity under §1983 should not vary depending on whether

Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399, 409–411 (1997).
We have called the government interest in avoiding
“unwarranted timidity” on the part of those engaged in the
public’s business “the most important special government
immunity-producing concern.” Id., at 409. Ensuring that
those who serve the government do so “with the decisiveness and the judgment required by the public good,”
Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 240 (1974), is of vital
importance regardless whether the individual sued as a
state actor works full-time or on some other basis.
