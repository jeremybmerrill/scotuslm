FILARSKY v. DELIA
Opinion of the Court

of Delia’s extended absence, and hired a private investigation firm to conduct surveillance on him. The private
investigators observed Delia purchasing building supplies—
including several rolls of fiberglass insulation—from a
home improvement store. The City surmised that Delia

interview, Filarsky questioned Delia about the building supplies. Delia acknowledged that he had purchased the
supplies, but claimed that he had not yet done the work on

Fire Chief Stephen Wells. Filarsky proposed resolving the
investigation by verifying Delia’s claim that he had not
done any work on his home. To do so, Filarsky recommended asking Delia to produce the building materials.
Chief Wells approved the plan.
When the meeting resumed, Filarsky requested permission for Peel to enter Delia’s home to view the materials.

out onto his lawn, so that Peel could observe them without
entering his home. Delia again refused to consent. Unable to obtain Delia’s cooperation, Filarsky ordered him to
produce the materials for inspection.
Delia’s counsel objected to the order, asserting that it
would violate the Fourth Amendment. When that objection proved unavailing, Delia’s counsel threatened to sue
