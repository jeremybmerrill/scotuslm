STEVE A. FILARSKY, PETITIONER v. NICHOLAS B.

DELIA

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 17, 2012] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring.
The Court addresses a sole question in this case: Is a
private attorney retained by a municipality to investigate
a personnel matter eligible for qualified immunity in a
suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983 alleging a constitutional
violation committed in the course of the investigation? I
agree that the answer is yes and that the judgment of
the Court of Appeals holding private attorney Filarsky
categorically ineligible for qualified immunity must be reversed. Qualified immunity may be overcome, however, if
the defendant knew or should have known that his conduct violated a right “clearly established” at the time of
the episode in suit. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.
800, 818 (1982). Because the Ninth Circuit did not consider the application of that standard to Filarsky, the
matter, as I see it, may be pursued on remand.
Filarsky was retained by the City of Rialto to investigate whether city firefighter Delia was taking time off
from work under the false pretense of a disabling physical
condition. In pursuit of the investigation, Filarsky asked
Delia to consent to a search of his home to determine what
Delia had done with several rolls of insulation he had
recently purchased at a home improvement store. When
Delia, on counsel’s advice, refused to consent to the search,
Filarsky “hatch[ed] a plan” to overcome Delia’s resistance.
