FILARSKY v. DELIA
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

essential governmental activity, or acting under close official supervision.” Id., at 413.
Filarsky, supported by the United States as amicus
curiae, contends that he fits into this coda because he
worked in close coordination with and under the supervision of City employees. Whether Filarsky was supervised
by those employees, and did not himself do the supervising, is unclear. But there is no doubt that Filarsky
worked alongside the employees in investigating Delia.
In such circumstances, I agree that Filarsky should be
allowed to claim qualified immunity from a §1983 suit.
As the Court’s opinion persuasively explains, there is a
“ ‘firmly rooted’ tradition of immunity” applicable to individuals who perform government work in capacities other
than as formal employees. Id., at 404; see ante, at 5–11.
And conferring qualified immunity on individuals like
Filarsky helps “protec[t] government’s ability to perform
its traditional functions,” and thereby helps “protect the
public at large.” Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 167–168
(1992). When a private individual works closely with
immune government employees, there is a real risk that
the individual will be intimidated from performing his
duties fully if he, and he alone, may bear the price of
liability for collective conduct. See ante, at 12; see also
ante, at 13 (noting distraction caused to immune public
employees by §1983 litigation brought against nonimmune
associates).
This does not mean that a private individual may assert
qualified immunity only when working in close coordination with government employees. For example, Richardson’s suggestion that immunity is also appropriate for
individuals “serving as an adjunct to government in an
essential governmental activity,” 521 U. S., at 413, would
seem to encompass modern-day special prosecutors and
comparable individuals hired for their independence.
There may yet be other circumstances in which immunity
