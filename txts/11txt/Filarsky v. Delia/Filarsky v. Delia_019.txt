FILARSKY v. DELIA
Opinion of the Court

Rialto has neither, and so must rely on the occasional
services of private individuals such as Mr. Filarsky. There
is no reason Rialtoâ€™s internal affairs investigator should be
denied the qualified immunity enjoyed by the ones who
work for New York.
In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals denying qualified immunity to Filarsky is
reversed.
It is so ordered.
