Opinion of the Court

by the parties that came before them. See W. Murfee, The
Justice of the Peace §1145 (1886). Yet the common law
extended the same immunity “to a justice of the peace as
to any other judicial officer.” Pratt v. Gardner, 56 Mass.
63, 70 (1848); see also Mangold v. Thorpe, 33 N. J. L. 134,
137–138 (1868).
The common law also extended certain protections to
individuals engaged in law enforcement activities, such as
sheriffs and constables. At the time §1983 was enacted,
however, “[t]he line between public and private policing
was frequently hazy. Private detectives and privately employed patrol personnel often were publicly appointed
as special policemen, and the means and objects of detective work, in particular, made it difficult to distinguish
between those on the public payroll and private detectives.” Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. Rev.
1165, 1210 (1999) (footnotes and internal quotation marks
omitted). The protections provided by the common law did
not turn on whether someone we today would call a police
officer worked for the government full-time or instead
for both public and private employers. Rather, at common
law, “[a] special constable, duly appointed according to
law, ha[d] all the powers of a regular constable so far as
may be necessary for the proper discharge of the special
duties intrusted to him, and in the lawful discharge of
those duties, [was] as fully protected as any other officer.”
W. Murfee, A Treatise on the Law of Sheriffs and Other
Ministerial Officers §1121, p. 609 (1884).
Sheriffs executing a warrant were empowered by the
common law to enlist the aid of the able-bodied men of the
community in doing so. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 332 (1765); In re Quarles,
158 U. S. 532, 535 (1895). While serving as part of
this “posse comitatus,” a private individual had the same
authority as the sheriff, and was protected to the same
extent. See, e.g., Robinson v. State, 93 Ga. 77, 18 S. E.
