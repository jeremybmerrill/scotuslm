MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY
Opinion of the Court

oned, tortured, and ultimately killed. The following year,
the U. S. Department of State issued a report concluding
that Rahim “died in the custody of [Palestinian Authority]
intelligence officers in Jericho.” Dept. of State, Occupied
Territories Human Rights Practices, 1995 (Mar. 1996).
In 2005, petitioners filed this action against respondents, the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization, asserting, inter alia, claims of torture
and extrajudicial killing under the TVPA. The District
Court granted respondents’ motion to dismiss, concluding,
as relevant, that the Act’s authorization of suit against

Appeals addressed the argument, and we offer no opinion on its merits.

F. 3d 604 (CADC 2011) (TVPA liability limited to natural persons);
Bowoto v. Chevron Corp., 621 F. 3d 1116 (CA9 2010) (same as Aziz),
with Sinaltrainal v. Coca Cola Co., 578 F. 3d 1252, 1264, n. 13 (CA11
2009) (TVPA liability extends to corporate defendants).
