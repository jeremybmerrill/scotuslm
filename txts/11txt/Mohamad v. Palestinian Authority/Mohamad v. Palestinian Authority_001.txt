Syllabus

MOHAMAD, INDIVIDUALLY AND FOR ESTATE OF RAHIM, 

DECEASED, ET AL. v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 

ET AL. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
No. 11–88. Argued February 28, 2012—Decided April 18, 2012
While visiting the West Bank, Azzam Rahim, a naturalized United
States citizen, allegedly was arrested by Palestinian Authority intelligence officers, imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed. Rahim’s
relatives, petitioners here, sued the Palestinian Authority and the
Palestine Liberation Organization under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA), which authorizes a cause of action
against “[a]n individual” for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing
committed under authority or color of law of any foreign nation. 106
Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. §1350. The District Court dismissed the suit, concluding, as relevant here, that the TVPA’s authorization of suit against “[a]n individual” extended liability only to
natural persons. The United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit affirmed.
Held: As used in the TVPA, the term “individual” encompasses only
natural persons. Consequently, the Act does not impose liability
against organizations. Pp. 2–11.
(a) The ordinary, everyday meaning of “individual” refers to a human being, not an organization, and Congress in the normal course
does not employ the word any differently. The Dictionary Act defines
“person” to include certain artificial entities “as well as individuals,”
1 U. S. C. §1, thereby marking “individual” as distinct from artificial
entities. Federal statutes routinely distinguish between an “individual” and an organizational entity. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §§92(k), 511.
And the very Congress that passed the TVPA defined “person” in a
separate Act to include “any individual or entity.” 18 U. S. C.
