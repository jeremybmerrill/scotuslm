Opinion of the Court

S. Rep. No. 102–249, p. 7 (1991) (S. Rep.); see also H. R.
Rep. No. 102–367, pt. 1, p. 4 (1991) (H. R. Rep.) (“Only
‘individuals,’ not foreign states, can be sued”). Yet that
statement, while clarifying that the Act does not encompass liability against foreign states, says nothing about
liability against nonsovereign organizations. The other
excerpts petitioners cite likewise are not probative of the
meaning of “individual,” for they signal only that the Act
does not impose liability on perpetrators who act without
authority or color of law of a foreign state. See, e.g., H. R.
Rep., at 5 (“The bill does not attempt to deal with torture
or killing by purely private groups”); S. Rep., at 8 (The bill
“does not cover purely private criminal acts by individuals
or nongovernmental organizations”).
Indeed, although we need not rely on legislative history
given the text’s clarity, we note that the history only supports our interpretation of “individual.” The version of the
TVPA that was introduced in the 100th Congress established liability against a “person.” Hearing and Markup
on H. R. 1417 before the House Committee on Foreign
Affairs and Its Subcommittee on Human Rights and
International Organizations, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 82
(1988). During the markup session of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, one of the bill’s sponsors proposed an
amendment “to make it clear we are applying it to individuals and not to corporations.” Id., at 81, 87. Counsel
explained that it was a “fairly simple” matter “of changing
the word ‘person’ to ‘individuals’ in several places in the
bill.” Id., at 87–88. The amendment was unanimously
adopted, and the version of the bill reported out of Committee reflected the change. Id., at 88; H. R. Rep. No. 693,
pt. 1, p. 1 (1988). A materially identical version of the bill
was enacted as the TVPA by the 102d Congress. Although
we are cognizant of the limitations of this drafting history,
cf. Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545
U. S. 546, 568 (2005), we nevertheless find it telling that
