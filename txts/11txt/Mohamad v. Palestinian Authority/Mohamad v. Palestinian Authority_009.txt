MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY
Opinion of the Court

deed to conclude that Congress employed the term “individual” four times in one sentence to refer to a natural
person and once to refer to a natural person and any
nonsovereign organization. See also §3(b)(1) (using term
“individual” six times in referring to victims of torture).
It is also revealing that the Act holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to “any person who may be a
claimant in an action for wrongful death.” §2(a)(2) (emphasis added). “Person,” we have recognized, often has a
broader meaning in the law than “individual,” see Clinton,
524 U. S., at 428, n. 13, and frequently includes nonnatural persons, see, e.g., 1 U. S. C. §1. We generally seek
to respect Congress’ decision to use different terms to describe different categories of people or things. See Sosa v.
Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). Our
construction of “individual” to encompass solely natural
persons credits Congress’ use of the disparate terms;
petitioners’ construction does not.3
In sum, the text of the statute persuades us that the Act
authorizes liability solely against natural persons.

Petitioners’ counterarguments are unpersuasive. 

A
Petitioners first dispute that the plain text of the TVPA
requires today’s result. Although they concede that an
ordinary meaning of “individual” is “human being,” petitioners point to definitions of “individual” that “frame the
term . . . in distinctly non-human terms, instead placing
their emphases on the oneness of something.” Brief for
——————
3 The parties debate whether estates, or other nonnatural persons, in
fact may be claimants in a wrongful-death action. We think the debate
largely immaterial. Regardless of whether jurisdictions today allow for
such actions, Congress’ use of the broader term evidences an intent to
accommodate that possibility.
