MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY
Opinion of the Court

the sole explanation for substituting “individual” for “person” confirms what we have concluded from the text alone.
C
Petitioners’ final argument is that the Act would be
rendered toothless by a construction of “individual” that
limits liability to natural persons. They contend that precluding organizational liability may foreclose effective
remedies for victims and their relatives for any number of
reasons. Victims may be unable to identify the men and
women who subjected them to torture, all the while knowing the organization for whom they work. Personal jurisdiction may be more easily established over corporate than
human beings. And natural persons may be more likely
than organizations to be judgment proof. Indeed, we are
told that only two TVPA plaintiffs have been able to recover successfully against a natural person—one only after
the defendant won the state lottery. See Jean v. Dorelien,
431 F. 3d 776, 778 (CA11 2005).
We acknowledge petitioners’ concerns about the limitations on recovery. But they are ones that Congress imposed and that we must respect. “[N]o legislation pursues
its purposes at all costs,” Rodriguez v. United States, 480
U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam), and petitioners’
purposive argument simply cannot overcome the force of
the plain text. We add only that Congress appeared well
aware of the limited nature of the cause of action it established in the Act. See, e.g., 138 Cong. Rec. 4177 (1992)
(remarks of Sen. Simpson) (noting that “as a practical
matter, this legislation will result in a very small number
of cases”); 137 Cong. Rec. 2671 (1991) (remarks of Sen.
Specter) (“Let me emphasize that the bill is a limited
measure. It is estimated that only a few of these lawsuits
will ever be brought”).
