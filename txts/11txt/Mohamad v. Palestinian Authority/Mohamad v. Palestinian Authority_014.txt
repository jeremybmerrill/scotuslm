Opinion of the Court

*
*
*
The text of the TVPA convinces us that Congress did not
extend liability to organizations, sovereign or not. There
are no doubt valid arguments for such an extension. But
Congress has seen fit to proceed in more modest steps in
the Act, and it is not the province of this Branch to do
otherwise. The judgment of the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
