MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY
Opinion of the Court

We also decline petitioners’ suggestion to construe the
TVPA’s scope of liability to conform with other federal
statutes that petitioners contend provide civil remedies to
victims of torture or extrajudicial killing. None of the
three statutes petitioners identify employs the term “individual” to describe the covered defendant, and so none
assists in the interpretive task we face today. See 42
U. S. C. §1983; 28 U. S. C. §§1603(a), 1605A(c) (2006 ed.,
Supp. IV); 18 U. S. C. §§2333, 2334(a)–(b), 2337. The
same is true of the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350, so
it offers no comparative value here regardless of whether
corporate entities can be held liable in a federal commonlaw action brought under that statute. Compare Doe v.
Exxon Mobil Corp., 654 F. 3d 11 (CADC 2011), with
Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F. 3d 111 (CA2
2010), cert. granted, 565 U. S. ___ (2011). Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contemplates liability against officers who do not personally
execute the torture or extrajudicial killing, see, e.g.,
Chavez v. Carranza, 559 F. 3d 486 (CA6 2009), it does not
follow (as petitioners argue) that the Act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations. An officer who
gives an order to torture or kill is an “individual” in that
word’s ordinary usage; an organization is not.
B
Petitioners also contend that legislative history supports
their broad reading of “individual.” But “reliance on legislative history is unnecessary in light of the statute’s unambiguous language.” Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P. A.
v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2010) (slip op., at
6, n. 3). In any event, the excerpts petitioners cite do not
help their cause. Petitioners note that the Senate Report
states that “[t]he legislation uses the term ‘individual’ to
make crystal clear that foreign states or their entities
cannot be sued under this bill under any circumstances.”
