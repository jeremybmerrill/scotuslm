Opinion of the Court

“(1) subjects an individual to torture shall, in a civil
action, be liable for damages to that individual; or
“(2) subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing
shall, in a civil action, be liable for damages to the individual’s legal representative, or to any person who
may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.”
§2(a).
The Act defines “torture” and “extrajudicial killing,” §3,
and imposes a statute of limitations and an exhaustion
requirement, §§2(b), (c). It does not define “individual.”
Petitioners concede that foreign states may not be sued
under the Act—namely, that the Act does not create an
exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of
1976, 28 U. S. C. §1602 et seq., which renders foreign
sovereigns largely immune from suits in U. S. courts.
They argue, however, that the TVPA does not similarly
restrict liability against other juridical entities. In petitioners’ view, by permitting suit against “[a]n individual,”
the TVPA contemplates liability against natural persons
and nonsovereign organizations (a category that, petitioners assert, includes respondents). We decline to read
“individual” so unnaturally. The ordinary meaning of the
word, fortified by its statutory context, persuades us that
the Act authorizes suit against natural persons alone.
A
Because the TVPA does not define the term “individual,”
we look first to the word’s ordinary meaning. See FCC v.
AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5) (“When
a statute does not define a term, we typically give the
phrase its ordinary meaning” (internal quotation marks
omitted)). As a noun, “individual” ordinarily means “[a]
human being, a person.” 7 Oxford English Dictionary 880
(2d ed. 1989); see also, e.g., Random House Dictionary
of the English Language 974 (2d ed. 1987) (“a person”);
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1152 (1986)
