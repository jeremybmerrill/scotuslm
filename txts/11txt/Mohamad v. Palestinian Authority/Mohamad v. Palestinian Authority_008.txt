tional terrorism” and defined “person” as it appears in
the statute to include “any individual or entity capable of
holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.” Federal
Courts Administration Act of 1992, 18 U. S. C. §§2333(a),
2331(3) (emphasis added)).

This is not to say that the word “individual” invariably
means “natural person” when used in a statute. Congress
remains free, as always, to give the word a broader or
different meaning. But before we will assume it has done
so, there must be some indication Congress intended such
a result. Perhaps it is the rare statute (petitioners point
to only one such example, located in the Internal Revenue
Code) in which Congress expressly defines “individual” to
include corporate entities. See 26 U. S. C. §542(a)(2). Or
perhaps, as was the case in Clinton v. City of New York,
524 U. S. 417, 429 (1998), the statutory context makes
that intention clear, because any other reading of “individual” would lead to an “ ‘absurd’ ” result Congress could
not plausibly have intended.
There are no such indications in the TVPA. As noted,
the Act does not define “individual,” much less do so in a
manner that extends the term beyond its ordinary usage.
And the statutory context strengthens—not undermines—
the conclusion that Congress intended to create a cause of
action against natural persons alone. The Act’s liability
provision uses the word “individual” five times in the same
sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator (i.e., the defendant) and four times to refer to the victim. See §2(a). Only
a natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial
killing. “Since there is a presumption that a given term
is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute, a
presumption surely at its most vigorous when a term is
repeated within a given sentence,” Brown v. Gardner, 513
U. S. 115, 118 (1994) (citation omitted), it is difficult in-
