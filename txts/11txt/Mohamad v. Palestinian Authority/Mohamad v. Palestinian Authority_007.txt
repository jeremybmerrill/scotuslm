MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY
Opinion of the Court

(“a particular person”) (hereinafter Webster’s). After all,
that is how we use the word in everyday parlance. We say
“the individual went to the store,” “the individual left
the room,” and “the individual took the car,” each time referring unmistakably to a natural person. And no one, we
hazard to guess, refers in normal parlance to an organization as an “individual.” Evidencing that common usage,
this Court routinely uses “individual” to denote a natural
person, and in particular to distinguish between a natural
person and a corporation. See, e.g., Goodyear Dunlop
Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. __, __ (2011)
(slip op., at 7) (“For an individual, the paradigm forum
for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual’s
domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in
which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home”).
Congress does not, in the ordinary course, employ the
word any differently. The Dictionary Act instructs that
“[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,
unless the context indicates otherwise . . . the wor[d]
‘person’ . . . include[s] corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals.” 1 U. S. C. §1 (emphasis
added). With the phrase “as well as,” the definition marks
“individual” as distinct from the list of artificial entities
that precedes it.
In a like manner, federal statutes routinely distinguish
between an “individual” and an organizational entity of
some kind. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §92(k) (“ ‘Person’ includes
partnerships, associations, and corporations, as well as
individuals”); §511 (same); 15 U. S. C. §717a (“ ‘Person’
includes an individual or a corporation”); 16 U. S. C. §796
(“ ‘[P]erson’ means an individual or a corporation”); 8
U. S. C. §1101(b)(3) (“ ‘[P]erson’ means an individual or an
organization”). Indeed, the very same Congress that
enacted the TVPA also established a cause of action for
U. S. nationals injured “by reason of an act of interna-
