ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY
Opinion of the Court

in federal district court. See 42 U. S. C. §2000e–5(f); 29
U. S. C. §633a(c); §216(b). Title 5 U. S. C. §7703(b)(2)
demonstrates that Congress knew how to provide alternative forums for judicial review based on the nature of an
employee’s claim. That Congress declined to include an
exemption from Federal Circuit review for challenges to
a statute’s constitutionality indicates that Congress intended no such exception.
B
The purpose of the CSRA also supports our conclusion
that the statutory review scheme is exclusive, even for
employees who bring constitutional challenges to federal
statutes. As we have previously explained, the CSRA’s
“integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review”
for aggrieved federal employees was designed to replace
an “ ‘outdated patchwork of statutes and rules’ ” that afforded employees the right to challenge employing agency
actions in district courts across the country. Fausto, 484
U. S., at 444–445. Such widespread judicial review, which
included appeals in all of the Federal Courts of Appeals
produced “wide variations in the kinds of decisions . . .
issued on the same or similar matters” and a double layer
of judicial review that was “wasteful and irrational.” Id.,
at 445 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The CSRA’s objective of creating an integrated scheme
of review would be seriously undermined if, as petitioners
would have it, a covered employee could challenge a covered employment action first in a district court, and then
again in one of the courts of appeals, simply by alleging
that the statutory authorization for such action is unconstitutional. Such suits would reintroduce the very potential for inconsistent decisionmaking and duplicative
judicial review that the CSRA was designed to avoid.
Moreover, petitioners’ position would create the possibility
of parallel litigation regarding the same agency action
