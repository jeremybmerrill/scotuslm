ET AL. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIRST CIRCUIT
No. 11–45. Argued February 27, 2012—Decided June 11, 2012
The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) “established a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal
employees,” United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 455, including
removals, 5 U. S. C. §7512. A qualifying employee has the right to a

action that is based on an absolute statutory bar to employment. The
ALJ also concluded that the MSPB lacked authority to determine the
constitutionality of a federal statute. Rather than seeking further
MSPB review or appealing to the Federal Circuit, Elgin joined other
petitioners raising the same constitutional challenges to their removals in a suit in Federal District Court. The District Court found that
it had jurisdiction and denied petitioners’ constitutional claims on the
