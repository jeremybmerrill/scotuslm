employee grievances arise. For example: Why was a
particular employee removed from federal employment?
Does the employer have a sound, nonprohibited basis for
the employment action in question? See, e.g., Davis v.
Department of Veterans Affairs, 106 MSPR 654, 657–658
(2007).
By contrast, petitioners’ claims involve general factual
issues pertaining to the facial constitutionality of the

petitioners wish to develop would address issues of gender
difference that might be considered relevant to military
service. See Brief for Petitioners 48 (alleging that “women’s role in the military has changed dramatically in the
past thirty years”). Likewise, under the Bill of Attainder
Clause, the key question is whether requiring draft registration as a condition of federal employment amounts to
the singling out of a particular person or group for punishment without trial. See Nixon v. Administrator of
General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 468–469. Whatever the
relevant facts may be on either claim, it is clear that they
can have no conceivable bearing on any matter the Board
is authorized to address.

Administrative agencies typically do not adjudicate
facial constitutional challenges to the laws that they administer. Such challenges not only lie outside the realm of
special agency expertise, but they are also wholly collateral to other types of claims that the agency is empowered
to consider. When “the administrative appeals process
does not address the kind of . . . constitutional claims” at
issue, we cannot infer that Congress intended to “limit[t]
