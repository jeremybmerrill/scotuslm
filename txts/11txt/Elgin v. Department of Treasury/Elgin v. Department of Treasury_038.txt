ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY 

ALITO, J., dissenting


IV 

The presumptive power of the federal courts to hear
constitutional challenges is well established. In this case,
however, the majority relies on a very weak set of inferences to strip the courts of their original jurisdiction over
petitionersâ€™ claims. Because I believe Congress would
have been very surprised to learn that it implied this
result when it passed the CSRA, I respectfully dissent.
