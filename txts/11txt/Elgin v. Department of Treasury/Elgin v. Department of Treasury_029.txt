ALITO, J., dissenting

with a final written decision. See §§7513(b)(1)–(4). Following these internal agency procedures, an aggrieved
employee may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection
Board. §7513(d).
The Board’s mission is “to ensure that Federal employees are protected against abuses by agency management,
that Executive branch agencies make employment decisions in accordance with the merit system principles, and
that Federal merit systems are kept free of prohibited
personnel practices.” Merit Systems Protection Board, An
Introduction to the Merit Systems Protection Board 5
(1999). The Board adjudicates employment disputes in
accordance with applicable federal laws and regulations,
including the “[m]erit system principles” and “[p]rohibited
personnel principles” identified in §§2301, 2302. After

of congressional enactments has generally been thought

consistently taken the position that it lacks “authority to
determine the constitutionality of statutes.” Malone v.
Department of Justice, 14 MSPR 403, 406 (1983) (citing
Montana Ch. of Assn. of Civilian Technicians, Inc. v.
Young, 514 F. 2d 1165, 1167 (CA9 1975)). Thus, the
Board’s own self-described role in the administrative
process is simply to apply the relevant statutes as written,
