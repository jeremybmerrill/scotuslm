Opinion of the Court

tioned its jurisdiction when an employee appeals from a
type of adverse action over which the MSPB lacked jurisdiction.7 But the Federal Circuit has never held, in an
appeal from agency action within the MSPB’s jurisdiction,
that its authority to decide particular legal questions is
derivative of the MSPB’s authority. To the contrary, in
Briggs v. MSPB, 331 F. 3d 1307, 1312–1313 (2003), the
Federal Circuit concluded that it could determine the
constitutionality of a statute upon which an employee’s
removal was based, notwithstanding the MSPB’s professed lack of authority to decide the question.8
Petitioners next contend that even if the Federal Circuit
could consider their claims in the first instance, resolution
of the claims requires a factual record that neither the
MSPB (because it lacks authority to decide the legal question) nor the Federal Circuit (because it is an appellate

MSPB, 931 F. 2d 853, 855 (CA Fed. 1991) (action against employee was
not suspension within MSPB’s jurisdiction); Manning v. MSPB, 742
F. 2d 1424, 1425–1427 (CA Fed. 1984) (reassignment of employee was
not an adverse action within MSPB’s jurisdiction); Rosano v. Department of Navy, 699 F. 2d 1315 (CA Fed. 1983) (refusal to prorate employee’s health insurance premiums was not an adverse action within
MSPB’s jurisdiction).
8 It is not unusual for an appellate court reviewing the decision of
an administrative agency to consider a constitutional challenge to a
federal statute that the agency concluded it lacked authority to decide.
See, e.g., Preseault v. ICC, 853 F. 2d 145, 148–149 (CA2 1988) (provision of the National Trails System Act Amendments of 1983), aff ’d on
other grounds, 494 U. S. 1 (1990); Reid v. Engen, 765 F. 2d 1457, 1460–
1461 (CA9 1985) (provision of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958);
Chadha v. INS, 634 F. 2d 408, 411, 413 (CA9 1980) (provision of the
Immigration and Nationality Act), aff ’d, 462 U. S. 919 (1983).
