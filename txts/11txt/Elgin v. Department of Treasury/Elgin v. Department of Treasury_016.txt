ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY
Opinion of the Court

Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14). By
contrast, a jurisdictional rule based on the type of employee and adverse agency action at issue does not involve

Contrary to petitioners’ suggestion, none of those characteristics are present here.

M. S. P. B. 81, 83 (1983) (“[I]t is well settled that administrative agencies are without authority to determine the
constitutionality of statutes”). This Court has also stated
that “adjudication of the constitutionality of congressional
enactments has generally been thought beyond the juris-
