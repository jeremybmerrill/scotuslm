ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY
ALITO, J., dissenting

employment disputes within the existing statutory framework. By contrast, petitioners argue that one key provision of that framework is facially unconstitutional. Not
only does the Board lack authority to adjudicate facial
constitutional challenges, but such challenges are wholly
collateral to the type of claims that the Board is authorized to hear.
The majority attempts to defend its holding by noting
that, although the Board cannot consider petitioners’
claims, petitioners may appeal from the Board to the
Federal Circuit, which does have authority to address
facial constitutional claims. But that does not cure the
oddity of requiring such claims to be filed initially before
the Board, which can do nothing but pass them along
unaddressed, leaving the Federal Circuit to act as a court
of first review, but with little capacity for factfinding.
Because I doubt that Congress intended to channel
petitioners’ constitutional claims into an administrative
tribunal that is powerless to decide them, I respectfully

but whether it has taken it away. See Whitman v. Department of Transportation, 547 U. S. 512, 514 (2006)
(per curiam).
Congress may remove certain claims from the general
jurisdiction of the federal courts in order to channel these
