ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY
Opinion of the Court

actions against federal employees. Id., at 443. For example, Subchapter II of Chapter 75, the portion of the CSRA
relevant to petitioners, specifically enumerates the major
adverse actions and employee classifications to which the
CSRA’s procedural protections and review provisions
apply. 5 U. S. C. §§7511, 7512. The subchapter then sets
out the procedures due an employee prior to final agency
action. §7513. And, Chapter 77 of the CSRA exhaustively
details the system of review before the MSPB and the
Federal Circuit. §§7701, 7703; see also Fausto, supra, at
449 (emphasizing that the CSRA’s structure evinces “the
primacy” of review by the MSPB and the Federal Circuit).
Given the painstaking detail with which the CSRA sets
out the method for covered employees to obtain review of
adverse employment actions, it is fairly discernible that
Congress intended to deny such employees an additional
avenue of review in district court.
Petitioners do not dispute that they are employees who
suffered adverse actions covered by the foregoing provisions of the CSRA. Nor do they contest that the CSRA’s
text and structure support implied preclusion of district
court jurisdiction, at least as a general matter. Petitioners
even acknowledge that the MSPB routinely adjudicates
some constitutional claims, such as claims that an agency
took adverse employment action in violation of an employee’s First or Fourth Amendment rights, and that these
claims must be brought within the CSRA scheme. See
