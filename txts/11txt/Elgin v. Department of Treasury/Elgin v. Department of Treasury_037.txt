ALITO, J., dissenting

to dismiss the case.
The majority suggests that its approach will allow the
Board to resolve some cases on nonconstitutional grounds,
thus avoiding needless adjudication of constitutional issues. See ante, at 18. But achieving that goal does not
require the blunt instrument of jurisdictional preclusion.
District courts have broad discretion to manage their
dockets, including the power to refrain from reviewing a
constitutional claim pending adjudication of a nonconstitutional claim that might moot the case. See Kerotest Mfg.
Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., 342 U. S. 180, 183
(1952) (acknowledging the equitable discretion of courts,
in furtherance of “[w]ise judicial administration” and
“conservation of judicial resources,” to stay proceedings to
prevent “two litigations where one will suffice” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). In short, the district courts
are well equipped to guard against piecemeal litigation
without any help from the majority’s holding.
Finally, the majority contends that channeling facial
constitutional claims through the Board is necessary to
provide “clear guidance about the proper forum for the
employee’s claims at the outset of the case.” Ante, at 11.
Because it can be hard to tell the difference between facial
and as-applied challenges, the majority argues, it is less
confusing simply to require that all claims must be
brought before the Board. This is a red herring. Labels
aside, the most sensible rule would be to allow initial
judicial review of constitutional claims that attack the
validity of a statute based on its inherent characteristics,
not as a result of how the statute has been applied. That
line is bright enough, and the distinction is already one
that the Board must draw based on its own determination
that it can hear some as-applied challenges but lacks
“authority to determine the constitutionality of statutes.”
