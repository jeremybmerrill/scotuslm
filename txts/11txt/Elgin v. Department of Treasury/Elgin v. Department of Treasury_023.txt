Opinion of the Court

As evidenced by their district court complaint, petitioners’ constitutional claims are the vehicle by which they
seek to reverse the removal decisions, to return to federal
employment, and to receive the compensation they would
have earned but for the adverse employment action. See
App. 29–30. A challenge to removal is precisely the type of
personnel action regularly adjudicated by the MSPB and
the Federal Circuit within the CSRA scheme. Likewise,
reinstatement, backpay, and attorney’s fees are precisely

the Federal Circuit to provide. See supra, at 2; see also
Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602, 614 (1984) (holding that
plaintiffs’ claims were not wholly collateral to a statutory

relevance here, preliminary questions unique to the employment context may obviate the need to address the
constitutional challenge. For example, petitioner Henry
Tucker asserts that his resignation amounted to a constructive discharge. That issue falls squarely within the
MSPB’s expertise, and its resolution against Tucker would
