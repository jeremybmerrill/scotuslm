Opinion of the Court

quired by law, rule, or regulation having been followed,”
or “unsupported by substantial evidence.” §§7703(a)(1),
(c). The Federal Circuit has “exclusive jurisdiction” over
appeals from a final decision of the MSPB. 28 U. S. C.
§1295(a)(9); see also 5 U. S. C. §7703(b)(1) (judicial review
of an MSPB decision “shall be” in the Federal Circuit).
II
Petitioners are former federal competitive service employees who failed to comply with the Military Selective
Service Act, 50 U. S. C. App. §453. That Act requires
male citizens and permanent-resident aliens of the United
States between the ages of 18 and 26 to register for the
Selective Service. Another federal statute, 5 U. S. C.
§3328 (hereinafter Section 3328), bars from employment
by an Executive agency anyone who has knowingly and
willfully failed to register. Pursuant to Section 3328, petitioners were discharged (or allegedly constructively
discharged) by respondents, their employing agencies.
Among petitioners, only Michael Elgin appealed his
removal to the MSPB. Elgin argued that Section 3328 is
an unconstitutional bill of attainder and unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of sex when combined with
the registration requirement of the Military Selective
Service Act. The MSPB referred Elgin’s appeal to an administrative law judge (ALJ) for an initial decision.2
The ALJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,
concluding that an employee is not entitled to MSPB
review of agency action that is based on an absolute statutory bar to employment. App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a–101a.
The ALJ also held that Elgin’s constitutional claims could
not “confer jurisdiction” on the MSPB because it “lacks
authority to determine the constitutionality of a statute.”
