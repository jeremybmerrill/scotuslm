ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY
Opinion of the Court

judicial review in a federal appellate court precluded
district court jurisdiction over a plaintiff ’s statutory and
constitutional claims. Id., at 206. We noted that the
plaintiff ’s claims could be “meaningfully addressed in the
Court of Appeals” and that the case therefore did “not
present the ‘serious constitutional question’ that would
arise if an agency statute were construed to preclude all
judicial review of a constitutional claim.” Id., at 215, and
n. 20 (quoting Bowen, supra, at 681, n. 12). Accordingly,
we did not require Webster’s “heightened showing,” but
instead asked only whether Congress’ intent to preclude
district court jurisdiction was “ ‘fairly discernible in the
statutory scheme.’ ” 510 U. S., at 207 (quoting Block v.
Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 351 (1984)).
Like the statute in Thunder Basin, the CSRA does not
foreclose all judicial review of petitioners’ constitutional
claims, but merely directs that judicial review shall occur
in the Federal Circuit. Moreover, as we explain below, the
Federal Circuit is fully capable of providing meaningful
review of petitioners’ claims. See infra, at 12–17. Accordingly, the appropriate inquiry is whether it is “fairly discernible” from the CSRA that Congress intended covered
employees appealing covered agency actions to proceed
exclusively through the statutory review scheme, even in
cases in which the employees raise constitutional challenges to federal statutes.
IV
To determine whether it is “fairly discernible” that
Congress precluded district court jurisdiction over petitioners’ claims, we examine the CSRA’s text, structure,
and purpose. See Thunder Basin, supra, at 207; Fausto,
484 U. S., at 443.
