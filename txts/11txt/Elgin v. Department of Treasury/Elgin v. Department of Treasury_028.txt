ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY
ALITO, J., dissenting

considerably reduced. Thunder Basin, supra, at 212 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Free Enterprise

Chapter 75 of Title 5 sets forth detailed procedures for
adverse actions taken against certain covered employees
“for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.” 5 U. S. C. §7513(a). When an agency takes such an
action, it must provide the employee with advance written
notice of the action and the specific reasons for it, give the
employee an opportunity to respond, allow the employee to
be represented by an attorney, and provide the employee
