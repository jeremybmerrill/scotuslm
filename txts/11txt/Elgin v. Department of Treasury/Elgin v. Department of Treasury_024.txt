ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY
Opinion of the Court

avoid the need to reach his constitutional claims. In addition, the challenged statute may be one that the MSPB
regularly construes, and its statutory interpretation could
alleviate constitutional concerns. Or, an employee’s appeal may involve other statutory or constitutional claims
that the MSPB routinely considers, in addition to a constitutional challenge to a federal statute. The MSPB’s resolution of those claims in the employee’s favor might fully
dispose of the case. Thus, because the MSPB’s expertise
can otherwise be “brought to bear” on employee appeals
that challenge the constitutionality of a statute, we see no
reason to conclude that Congress intended to exempt such
claims from exclusive review before the MSPB and the
Federal Circuit. See Thunder Basin, 510 U. S., at 214–
215 (concluding that, where administrative Commission’s
expertise “could be brought to bear” on appeal, Commission’s exclusive review of alleged statutory violation was
appropriate despite its lack of expertise in interpreting a
particular statute (internal quotation marks and brackets
omitted)).

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that it is fairly
discernible that the CSRA review scheme was intended to
preclude district court jurisdiction over petitioners’ claims.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
