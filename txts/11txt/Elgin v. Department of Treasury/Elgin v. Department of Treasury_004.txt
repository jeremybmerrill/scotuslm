ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY
Syllabus
the MSPB to take evidence and find facts for Federal Circuit review.
See 5 U. S. C. §§1204(b)(1)–(2). Petitioners err in arguing that the
MSPB will invariably dismiss a case without ever reaching the factfinding stage in an appeal such as theirs. The MSPB may determine
that it lacks authority to decide the issue; but absent another infirmity in the adverse action, it will affirm the employing agency’s decision. The Federal Circuit can then review the decision, including any
factual record developed by the MSPB. Petitioners’ argument is not
illustrated by Elgin’s case, which was dismissed on the threshold
ground that he was not an “employee” with a right to appeal because
his employment was absolutely barred by statute. Pp. 12–18.
(2) Petitioners’ claims are also not “wholly collateral” to the
CSRA scheme. Their constitutional claims are the vehicle by which
they seek to reverse the removal decisions, to return to federal employment, and to receive lost compensation. A challenge to removal
is precisely the type of personnel action regularly adjudicated by the
MSPB and the Federal Circuit within the CSRA scheme, and reinstatement, backpay, and attorney’s fees are precisely the kinds of relief that the CSRA empowers the MSPB and the Federal Circuit to
provide. Pp. 18–19.
(3) Finally, in arguing that their constitutional claims are not the
sort that Congress intended to channel through the MSPB because
they are beyond the MSPB’s expertise, petitioners overlook the many
threshold questions that may accompany a constitutional claim and
to which the MSPB can apply its expertise, e.g., whether a resignation, as in petitioner Tucker’s case, amounts to a constructive discharge. Pp. 19–20.

641 F. 3d 6, affirmed.

C. J., and SCALIA, KENNEDY, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.
