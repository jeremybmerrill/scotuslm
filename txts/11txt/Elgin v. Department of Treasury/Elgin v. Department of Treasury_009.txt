relief. See 565 U. S. ___ (2011). We conclude that it does,
and we therefore affirm.
III
We begin with the appropriate standard for determining
whether a statutory scheme of administrative and judicial
review provides the exclusive means of review for constitutional claims. Petitioners argue that even if they may
obtain judicial review of their constitutional claims before
the Federal Circuit, they are not precluded from pursuing
their claims in federal district court. According to petitioners, the general grant of federal-question jurisdiction
in 28 U. S. C. §1331, which gives district courts authority
over constitutional claims, remains undisturbed unless
Congress explicitly directs otherwise. In support of this
argument, petitioners rely on Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S.
592, 603 (1988), which held that “where Congress intends
to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims[,] its
intent to do so must be clear.” The Webster Court noted
that this “heightened showing” was required “to avoid the
‘serious constitutional question’ that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for
a colorable constitutional claim.” Ibid. (quoting Bowen v.
Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667,
681, n. 12 (1986)). Petitioners contend that the CSRA
does not meet this standard because it does not expressly
bar suits in district court.
Petitioners’ argument overlooks a necessary predicate to
the application of Webster’s heightened standard: a statute
that purports to “deny any judicial forum for a colorable
constitutional claim.” 486 U. S., at 603. Webster’s standard does not apply where Congress simply channels judicial review of a constitutional claim to a particular court.
We held as much in Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510
U. S. 200 (1994). In that case, we considered whether a
statutory scheme of administrative review followed by
