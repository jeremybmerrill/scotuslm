WOOD v. MILYARD
Opinion of the Court

before 1997 and thus did not toll the AEDPA statute of
limitations at all.” Ibid. But rather than inviting a decision on the statute of limitations question, the State informed the District Court it would “not challenge” Wood’s
petition on timeliness grounds; instead, the State simply
defended against Wood’s double jeopardy and Sixth
Amendment claims on the merits.

“Ordinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation
is forfeited if not raised in a defendant’s answer or in
an amendment thereto.” Day, 547 U. S., at 202 (citing Fed.
Rules Civ. Proc. 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a)). See also Habeas
Corpus Rule 5(b) (requiring the State to plead a statute
of limitations defense in its answer).4 An affirmative
defense, once forfeited, is “exclu[ded] from the case,” 5 C.
Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1278,
pp. 644–645 (3d ed. 2004), and, as a rule, cannot be asserted on appeal. See Day, 547 U. S., at 217 (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 764 (1975);
McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, 950 F. 2d 13,
22 (CA1 1991) (“It is hornbook law that theories not raised
squarely in the district court cannot be surfaced for the
first time on appeal.”).
In Granberry v. Greer, we recognized a modest exception
to the rule that a federal court will not consider a forfeited
affirmative defense. 481 U. S., at 134. The District Court
in Granberry denied a federal habeas petition on the
merits. Id., at 130. On appeal, the State argued for the
first time that the petition should be dismissed because

4 We note here the distinction between defenses that are “waived” and
those that are “forfeited.” A waived claim or defense is one that a party
has knowingly and intelligently relinquished; a forfeited plea is one
that a party has merely failed to preserve. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.
443, 458, n. 13 (2004); United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 733
(1993). That distinction is key to our decision in Wood’s case.
