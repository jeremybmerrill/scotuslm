THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

State to amend its answer to add a defense, nor can they
develop the facts that are often necessary to resolve questions of timeliness. Cf. id., at 209 (majority opinion) (finding no difference between a district court’s ability to raise
a forfeited limitations defense sua sponte and its ability to
notice the State’s forfeiture and permit an amended pleading under Rule of Civil Procedure 15).
In light of these considerations, I cannot join the Court’s
holding that a court of appeals has discretion to consider
sua sponte a forfeited limitations defense. Nor can I join
the Court’s separate holding that the Court of Appeals
abused its discretion by raising a defense that had been
deliberately waived by the State. As the dissent in Day
noted, there is no principled reason to distinguish between
forfeited and waived limitations defenses when determining whether courts may raise such defenses sua sponte.
See 547 U. S., at 218, n. 3 (explaining that, if “ ‘values
beyond the concerns of the parties’ ” justify sua sponte
consideration of forfeited defenses, such values equally
support sua sponte consideration of waived defenses).
Therefore, I concur only in the judgment.
