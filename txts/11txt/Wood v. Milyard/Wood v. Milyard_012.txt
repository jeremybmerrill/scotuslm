justice would be better served’ by addressing the merits or
by dismissing the petition as time barred.” Day, 547 U. S.,
at 210–211 (quoting Granberry, 481 U. S., at 136; internal
quotation marks omitted). It would be “an abuse of discretion,” we observed, for a court “to override a State’s deliberate waiver of a limitations defense.” 547 U. S., at 202.
In Day’s case itself, we emphasized, the State’s concession
of timeliness resulted from “inadvertent error,” id., at 211,
not from any deliberate decision to proceed straightaway
to the merits.
Consistent with Granberry and Day, we decline to adopt
an absolute rule barring a court of appeals from raising, on its own motion, a forfeited timeliness defense. The
institutional interests served by AEDPA’s statute of limitations are also present when a habeas case moves to the
court of appeals, a point Granberry recognized with respect to a nonexhaustion defense. We accordingly hold, in
response to the first question presented, see supra, at 4,
that courts of appeals, like district courts, have the authority—though not the obligation—to raise a forfeited
timeliness defense on their own initiative.

We turn now to the second, case-specific, inquiry. See
ibid. Although a court of appeals has discretion to address, sua sponte, the timeliness of a habeas petition,
appellate courts should reserve that authority for use in
exceptional cases. For good reason, appellate courts ordinarily abstain from entertaining issues that have not been
raised and preserved in the court of first instance. See
supra, at 6. That restraint is all the more appropriate
when the appellate court itself spots an issue the parties
did not air below, and therefore would not have anticipated in developing their arguments on appeal.
Due regard for the trial court’s processes and time investment is also a consideration appellate courts should
