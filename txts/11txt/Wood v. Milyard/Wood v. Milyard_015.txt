PATRICK WOOD, PETITIONER v. KEVIN MILYARD,

WARDEN, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

[April 24, 2012] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,
concurring in the judgment.
In Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006), the Court
held that a federal district court may raise sua sponte a
forfeited statute of limitations defense to a habeas corpus
petition. Relying on Day and Granberry v. Greer, 481
U. S. 129 (1987), the Court now holds that a court of appeals may do the same. Because I continue to think that
Day was wrongly decided and that Granberry is inapposite, I cannot join the Court’s opinion. See Day, 547 U. S.,
at 212–219 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS and BREYER,
JJ., dissenting).
As the dissent in Day explained, the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure apply in habeas corpus cases to the extent
that they are consistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules,
the habeas corpus statute, and the historical practice of
habeas proceedings. Id., at 212 (citing Gonzalez v. Crosby,
545 U. S. 524, 529–530 (2005), and Woodford v. Garceau,
538 U. S. 202, 208 (2003)). As relevant here, the Rules of
Civil Procedure provide that a defendant forfeits his statute of limitations defense if he fails to raise it in his answer or in an amendment thereto. 547 U. S., at 212 (citing
Rules 8(c), 12(b), 15(a)). That forfeiture rule is fully consistent with habeas corpus procedure. As an initial matter, the rule comports with the Habeas Rules’ instruction
