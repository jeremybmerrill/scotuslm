WOOD v. MILYARD
Opinion of the Court

defense, and intelligently chooses not to rely on it in the
court of first instance? The answer Day instructs is “no”:
A court is not at liberty, we have cautioned, to bypass,
override, or excuse a State’s deliberate waiver of a limitations defense. Id., at 202, 210, n. 11. The Tenth Circuit,
we accordingly hold, abused its discretion by resurrecting
the limitations issue instead of reviewing the District
Court’s disposition on the merits of Wood’s claims.
I
In the course of a 1986 robbery at a pizza shop in a
Colorado town, the shop’s assistant manager was shot and
killed. Petitioner Patrick Wood was identified as the perpetrator. At a bench trial in January 1987, Wood was
convicted of murder, robbery, and menacing, and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed Wood’s convictions and sentence on direct
appeal in May 1989, and the Colorado Supreme Court
denied Wood’s petition for certiorari five months later.
Wood did not ask this Court to review his conviction in the
90 days he had to do so.
Wood then pursued postconviction relief, asserting constitutional infirmities in his trial, conviction, and sentence. Prior to the federal petition at issue here, which
was filed in 2008, Wood, proceeding pro se, twice sought
relief in state court. First, in 1995, he filed a motion to
vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to Colorado
Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) (1984).1 He also asked
the Colorado trial court to appoint counsel to aid him in
pursuit of the motion. When some months passed with no
——————
1 Colorado Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) (1984) provides, in relevant part: “[E]very person convicted of a crime is entitled as a matter of
right to make application for postconviction review upon the groun[d]
. . . [t]hat the conviction was obtained or sentence imposed in violation
of the Constitution or laws of the United States or the constitution or
laws of this state.”
