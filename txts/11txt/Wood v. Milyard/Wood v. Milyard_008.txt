Opinion of the Court

at 201 (quoting 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(2)).3
The state judgment against Wood became final on direct
review in early 1990. See supra, at 2. Wood’s time for
filing a federal petition therefore began to run on the date
of AEDPA’s enactment, April 24, 1996, and expired on
April 24, 1997, unless Wood had a “properly filed” application for state postconviction relief “pending” in Colorado
state court during that period. Wood maintains he had
such an application pending on April 24, 1996: the Rule
35(c) motion he filed in 1995. That motion, Wood asserts,
remained pending (thus continuing to suspend the oneyear clock) until at least August 2004, when he filed his
second motion for postconviction relief in state court. The
2004 motion, the State does not contest, was “properly
filed.” Wood argues that this second motion further tolled
the limitations period until February 5, 2007, exactly one
year before he filed the federal petition at issue here. If
Wood is correct that his 1995 motion remained “pending”
in state court from April 1996 until August 2004, his
federal petition would be timely.
In its preanswer response to Wood’s petition, the State
set forth its comprehension of the statute of limitations
issue. It noted that Wood’s “time for filing a habeas petition began to run on April 24, 1996, when the AEDPA
became effective” and that Wood “had until April 24, 1997,
plus any tolling periods, to timely file his habeas petition.”
App. 69a–70a. The State next identified the crucial question: Did Wood’s 1995 state petition arrest the one-year
statute of limitations period from 1996 until 2004? Id., at
70a. “[I]t is certainly arguable,” the State then asserted,
“that the 1995 postconviction motion was abandoned
——————
3 The one-year clock may also be stopped—or “tolled”—for equitable
reasons, notably when an “extraordinary circumstance” prevents a
prisoner from filing his federal petition on time. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010). Wood does not contend that the equitable
tolling doctrine applies to his case. App. 144a, n. 5.
