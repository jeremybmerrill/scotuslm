WOOD v. MILYARD
Opinion of the Court

held the petition time barred. 403 Fed. Appx. 335 (2010).
In so ruling, the Court of Appeals concluded it had authority to raise timeliness on its own motion. Id., at 337, n. 2.
It further ruled that the State had not taken that issue off
the table by declining to interpose a statute of limitations
defense in the District Court. Ibid.
We granted review, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), to resolve two
issues: first, whether a court of appeals has the authority to address the timeliness of a habeas petition on the
court’s own initiative;2 second, assuming a court of appeals
has such authority, whether the State’s representations to
the District Court in this case nonetheless precluded the
Tenth Circuit from considering the timeliness of Wood’s
petition.

A

Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a state prisoner has
one year to file a federal petition for habeas corpus relief,
starting from “the date on which the judgment became
final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration
of the time for seeking such review.”
28 U. S. C.
§2244(d)(1)(A). For a prisoner whose judgment became
final before AEDPA was enacted, the one-year limitations
period runs from the AEDPA’s effective date: April 24,
1996. See Serrano v. Williams, 383 F. 3d 1181, 1183
(CA10 2004). “The one-year clock is stopped, however,
during the time the petitioner’s ‘properly filed’ application
for state postconviction relief ‘is pending.’ ” Day, 547 U. S.,
——————
2 The Tenth Circuit’s conclusion that it had authority to raise an
AEDPA statute of limitations defense sua sponte conflicts with the view
of the Eighth Circuit. Compare 403 Fed. Appx. 335, 337, n. 2 (CA10
2010) (case below), with Sasser v. Norris, 553 F. 3d 1121, 1128 (CA8
2009) (“The discretion to consider the statute of limitations defense
sua sponte does not extend to the appellate level.”).
