KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of the Court

state court against 59 defendants, including respondents
Railroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC) and Viad
Corp (Viad). According to the complaint, RFPC distribut­
ed locomotive brakeshoes containing asbestos, and Viad
was the successor-in-interest to a company that manufac­
tured and sold locomotives and locomotive engine valves
containing asbestos. Corson alleged that he handled this
equipment and that he was injured by exposure to asbes­
tos. The complaint asserted state-law claims that the
equipment was defectively designed because it contained
asbestos, and that respondents failed to warn of the dan­
gers of asbestos or to provide instructions regarding its
safe use. After the complaint was filed, Corson passed
away, and the executrix of his estate, Gloria Kurns, was
substituted as a party. Corson’s widow and the executrix
are petitioners here.
Respondents removed the case to the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
and moved for summary judgment. Respondents argued
that petitioners’ state-law claims were pre-empted by the
LIA. The District Court agreed and granted summary
judgment for respondents. See Kurns v. A. W. Chesterton,
Civ. Action No. 08–2216 (ED Pa., Feb. 3, 2009), App. to
Pet. for Cert. 39a. The Third Circuit affirmed. See Kurns
v. A. W. Chesterton, Inc., 620 F. 3d 392 (2010). We granted
certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).

motive and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition
and safe to operate . . . without unnecessary peril to life or
limb.” Act of Feb. 17, 1911, ch. 103, §2, 36 Stat. 913–914.
In 1915, Congress amended the BIA to apply to “the entire
locomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances
