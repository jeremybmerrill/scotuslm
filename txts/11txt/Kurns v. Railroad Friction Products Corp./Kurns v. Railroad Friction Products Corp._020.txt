Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

II
Petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims, by contrast, proceed
on a fundamentally different theory of tort liability that
does not implicate a product’s physical composition at all.
A failure-to-warn claim asks nothing of a product’s design, but requires instead that a manufacturer caution of
nonobvious dangers and provide instructions for safe use.
Indeed, a product may be flawlessly designed and still
subject its manufacturer or seller to liability for lack of
adequate instructions or warnings. See, e.g., Madden, The
Duty To Warn in Products Liability: Contours and Criti­
cism, 89 W. Va. L. Rev. 221 (1987) (“Although a product is
unerringly designed, manufactured and assembled, injury
or damage occasioned by its intended or reasonably fore­
seeable use may subject the seller to liability. Such liabil­
ity may be found if the product has a potential for injury
that is not readily apparent to the user” (cited in Restate­
ment (Third) of Torts: Products Liability §2, Reporter’s
Note, Comment i, n. 1 (1997) (hereinafter Restatement));
see also Madden, 89 W. Va. L. Rev., at 221, n. 1 (collecting
cases). Petitioners’ complaint embodies just this concep­
tual distinction. Compare App. 22–23, ¶¶10(c)–(e), (g),
with id., at 25, ¶10(p).1
In the jurisdictions relevant to this suit, failure to warn
is “a distinct cause of action under the theory of strict
products liability.” Riley v. American Honda Motor Co.,
259 Mont. 128, 132, 856 P. 2d 196, 198 (1993). Thus, “ ‘a
failure to warn of an injury[-]causing risk associated with
the use of a technically pure and fit product can render
such product unreasonably dangerous.’ ” Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Jahnig v. Coisman, 283 N. W. 2d 557, 560 (S. D. 1979)

do petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims allege that respondents’
locomotive parts should have been altered, for example, by affixing
warnings to the products themselves. See App. 22–23, ¶¶10(c)–(e), (g);
id., at 27, ¶12(d).
