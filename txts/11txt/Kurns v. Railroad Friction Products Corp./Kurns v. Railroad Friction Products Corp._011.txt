KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of the Court

Because those claims “are directed to the same subject” as
the LIA, Napier dictates that they fall within the pre­
empted field. Id., at 612.

Petitioners further argue that, even if their design­
defect claims are pre-empted, their failure-to-warn claims
do not suffer the same fate. In their complaint, petitioners
alleged in closely related claims (1) that respondents
negligently failed to warn of the risks associated with
asbestos and to provide instructions concerning safe­
guards for working with asbestos; and (2) that the asbestoscontaining products were defective because respondents
failed to give sufficient warnings or instructions con­
cerning the “risks, dangers, and harm inherent in said
asbestos products.” See App. 20–27 (¶¶7–10, 12), 42 (¶8);
see also Brief for Petitioners 11. According to petitioners,
these claims do not fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field
because “[t]he basis of liability for failure to warn . . . is
not the ‘design’ or ‘manufacture’ of a product,” but is in­
stead “the failure to provide adequate warnings regarding
the product’s risks.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 16.
We disagree. A failure-to-warn claim alleges that the
product itself is unlawfully dangerous unless accompanied
by sufficient warnings or instructions.
Restatement
(Third) of Torts: Products Liability §2(c) (1997) (A failure­
to-warn claim alleges that a product is defective “when the
foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have
been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable
instructions or warnings by the seller or other distribu­
tor, . . . and the omission of the instructions or warnings
renders the product not reasonably safe”); see also id.,
Comment l, at 33 (“Reasonable designs and instructions
or warnings both play important roles in the production
and distribution of reasonably safe products”). Thus, the
“gravamen” of petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims “is still
