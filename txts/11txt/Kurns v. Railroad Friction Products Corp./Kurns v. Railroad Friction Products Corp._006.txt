Opinion of the Court

thereof.”1 Act of Mar. 4, 1915, ch. 169, §1, 38 Stat. 1192.
The BIA as amended became commonly known as the
Locomotive Inspection Act. As relevant here, the LIA
provides:
“A railroad carrier may use or allow to be used
a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only
when the locomotive or tender and its parts and
appurtenances—
“(1) are in proper condition and safe to operate
without unnecessary danger of personal injury;
“(2) have been inspected as required under this
chapter and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of
Transportation under this chapter; and
“(3) can withstand every test prescribed by the Sec­
retary under this chapter.” 49 U. S. C. §20701.2
The issue presented in this case is whether the LIA pre­
empts petitioners’ state-law claims that respondents
defectively designed locomotive parts and failed to warn
Corson of dangers associated with those parts. In light of
this Court’s prior decision in Napier, supra, we conclude
that petitioners’ claims are pre-empted.

2 At the time of Corson’s employment, this provision of the LIA was
worded somewhat differently. See 45 U. S. C. §23 (1946 ed.). Petition­
ers do not argue that the change in statutory language makes any
difference in this case.
