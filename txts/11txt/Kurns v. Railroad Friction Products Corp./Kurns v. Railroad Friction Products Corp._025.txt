KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

address warnings specific to maintenance and repair.
Because the pre-empted field is congruent with the regu­
lated field, see, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89,
112 (2000), the majority’s decision sweeps far too broadly.3

In short, the majority affords the LIA field-pre-emptive
effect well beyond what Napier requires, leaving petition­
ers without a remedy for what they allege was fatal ex­
posure to asbestos in repair facilities. “It is difficult to
believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all
means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal
conduct.” Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 251. That is doubly true
in light of the LIA’s “purpose . . . of facilitating employee
recovery, not of restricting such recovery or making it
impossible.” Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 189 (1949).
I therefore concur in part and dissent in part.

3 Disagreeing with the agency’s interpretation, JUSTICE KAGAN con­
cludes that the LIA empowers the FRA to require warnings as an
incident of the authority to prescribe locomotive design. Compare ante,
2–3 (concurring opinion), with, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 22–23. Such power,
if it exists, must be limited to warnings that impose direct require­
ments on the physical composition of locomotive equipment. Cf. n. 1,
supra; 49 CFR §§229.85, 229.113 (2010). That may be a formal line,
but it is the line that this Court drew in describing the scope of the
authority conferred by the LIA, and therefore the pre-empted field. See
Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 611–612 (1926).
And it is the line that separates petitioners’ design-defect claims from
their claims for failure to warn.
