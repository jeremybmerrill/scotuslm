GLORIA GAIL KURNS, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE



OF GEORGE M. CORSON, DECEASED, ET AL., 

PETITIONERS v. RAILROAD FRICTION 

PRODUCTS CORPORATION ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT



[February 29, 2012]




JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case requires us to determine whether petitioners’
state-law tort claims for defective design and failure to
warn are pre-empted by the Locomotive Inspection Act
(LIA), 49 U. S. C. §20701 et seq. The United States Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit determined that petition­
ers’ claims fall within the field pre-empted by that Act, as
that field was defined by this Court’s decision in Napier v.
Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605 (1926). We
agree.
