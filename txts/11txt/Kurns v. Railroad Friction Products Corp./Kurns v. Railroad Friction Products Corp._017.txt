KAGAN, J., concurring

General Motors Corp., 114 F. 3d 908, 911 (CA9 1997) (“As
for warning requirements, these too are within the scope
of the [agency’s] authority”); Scheiding v. General Motors
Corp., 22 Cal. 4th 471, 484, 993 P. 2d 996, 1004 (2000)
(same).* And because the agency could have required
warnings about the equipment’s use, the petitioners’
failure-to-warn claims, no less than their defective-design
claims, are preempted under Napier.
I understand these views to comport with the Court’s
opinion in this case, and I accordingly join it in full.

——————
* JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR argues that “preserving petitioners’ failure-towarn claims coheres with the LIA’s regulatory regime” because the
agency disclaims authority over locomotive repair and maintenance.
Post, at 7. But that claim conflates two separate distinctions. The
agency draws a line not between mandating design changes and mandating warnings, but between regulating equipment that is hazardous
to repair and regulating equipment that is hazardous to use on the
railroad line. In keeping with that analysis, the agency contends that
the petitioners’ design-defect claims also fall outside the preempted
field because the alleged defect in the brakeshoes rendered dangerous
only their repair, and not their on-line use. See Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 12–13. The agency’s understanding of its authority therefore does not support JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s position. As the
agency agrees, the petitioners’ claims must stand or fall together if
viewed through the lens of the agency’s regulatory authority. In my
view, they fall because the Court rightly rejects the agency’s proffered
distinction between regulating the dangers of repairing equipment and
regulating the dangers of using that equipment on line. See supra,
at 2.
