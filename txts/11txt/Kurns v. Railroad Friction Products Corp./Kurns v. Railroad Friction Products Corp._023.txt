KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

empted. See English, 496 U. S., at 85–86; Silkwood v.
Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 256 (1984). Indeed, the
majority elides the distinction between indirect and direct
regulation, even though this Court has explained that
the two are not equivalent for pre-emption purposes. See
Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 186 (1988)
(“Congress may reasonably determine that incidental regulatory pressure is acceptable, whereas direct regulatory
authority is not”). State wage-and-hour laws, workplace safety standards, or tax credits for green technology,
for example, could all “influence” the means and materials
of locomotive equipment manufacture without imposing
direct obligations. Nor does the majority substantiate its
assertion that the “influence” exerted by a duty to warn
need be “inevitabl[e]” or “substantial.” Ante, at 9, n. 4. To
the contrary, the requirements imposed by such a duty
could be light, and the corresponding liability negligible,
in comparison to the commercial value of retaining an
existing design.
Respondents could have complied with state-law duties
to warn by providing instructions for the safe maintenance
of asbestos-containing locomotive parts in equipment man­
uals. See, e.g., Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., Engine
Manual for 600 Series Diesel Engines (1951), online at

(last
visited Feb. 27, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file). Or respondents could have ensured that repair
shops posted signs. See Restatement §2, at 29–30, Com­
ment i (duty to warn “may require that instructions and
warnings be given not only to purchasers, users, and
consumers, but also to others who a reasonable seller
should know will be in a position to reduce or avoid the
risk of harm”); see also, e.g., Patch v. Hillerich & Bradsby
Co., 361 Mont. 241, 246, 257 P. 3d 383, 388 (2011) (“While
placing a warning directly on a product is one method of
warning, other methods of warning exist, including, but
