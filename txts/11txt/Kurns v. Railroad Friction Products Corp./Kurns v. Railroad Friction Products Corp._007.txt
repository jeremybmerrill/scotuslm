KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of the Court

state law thus occurs through the “direct operation of the
Supremacy Clause.” Brown v. Hotel Employees, 468 U. S.
491, 501 (1984). Congress may, of course, expressly pre­
empt state law, but “[e]ven without an express provision
for preemption, we have found that state law must yield to
a congressional Act in at least two circumstances.” Crosby
v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372
(2000). First, “state law is naturally preempted to the

State of locomotives not equipped with” certain prescribed
devices, on the ground that the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC), the agency then vested with the au­
thority to carry out the LIA’s requirements, had not re­
quired the devices in question.3 272 U. S., at 607, 609. In
response, the States argued that their requirements were
not pre-empted because they were directed at a different
objective than the LIA. Id., at 612. According to the
States, their regulations were intended to protect railroad
workers from sickness and disease, whereas “the federal
regulation endeavors solely to prevent accidental injury in
