Opinion of the Court

petitioners must contend with Napier. Petitioners do not
ask us to overrule Napier and thus do not seek to over­
come the presumption of stare decisis that attaches to this
85-year-old precedent. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v.
SEB S. A., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (noting
the “special force of the doctrine of stare decisis with re­
gard to questions of statutory interpretation” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Instead, petitioners advance
several arguments aimed at demonstrating that their
claims fall outside of the field pre-empted by the LIA, as it
was defined in Napier. Each is unpersuasive.
1
Petitioners, along with the Solicitor General as amicus
curiae, first argue that petitioners’ claims do not fall with­
in the LIA’s pre-empted field because the claims arise out
of the repair and maintenance of locomotives, rather than
the use of locomotives on a railroad line. Specifically, they
contend that the scope of the field pre-empted by the LIA
is coextensive with the scope of the Federal Government’s
regulatory authority under the LIA, which, they argue,
does not extend to the regulation of hazards arising from
the repair or maintenance of locomotives. Therefore, the
argument goes, state-law claims arising from repair or
maintenance—as opposed to claims arising from use on
the line—do not fall within the pre-empted field.
We reject this attempt to redefine the pre-empted field.
In Napier, the Court held that Congress, in enacting the
LIA, “manifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field
of regulating locomotive equipment,” and the Court did
not distinguish between hazards arising from repair and
maintenance as opposed to those arising from use on the
line. 272 U. S., at 611. The pre-empted field as defined
by Napier plainly encompasses the claims at issue here.
Petitioners’ common-law claims for defective design and
failure to warn are aimed at the equipment of locomotives.
