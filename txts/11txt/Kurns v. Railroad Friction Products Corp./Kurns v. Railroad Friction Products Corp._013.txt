KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of the Court

This argument fails for the same reason as the two
preceding arguments: It is inconsistent with Napier.
Napier defined the field pre-empted by the LIA on the
basis of the physical elements regulated—“the equipment
of locomotives”—not on the basis of the entity directly
subject to regulation. 272 U. S., at 612. Because petition­
ers’ claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives,
they fall within the pre-empted field.
Petitioners’ proposed rule is also contrary to common
sense. Under petitioners’ approach, a State could not
require railroads to equip their locomotives with parts
meeting state-imposed specifications, but could require
manufacturers of locomotive parts to produce only parts
meeting those state-imposed specifications. We rejected a
similar approach in an express pre-emption context in
Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246 (2004). There, a state entity
argued that its rules prohibiting the purchase or lease of
vehicles that failed to meet stringent emissions require­
ments were not pre-empted by the Clean Air Act, 42
U. S. C. §7543(a), because the rules in question were
aimed at the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manu­
facture or sale. 541 U. S., at 248. We observed, however,
that “treating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions
differently for pre-emption purposes would make no
sense,” because the “manufacturer’s right to sell federally
approved vehicles is meaningless in the absence of a pur­
chaser’s right to buy them.” Id., at 255. Similarly, a
railroad’s ability to equip its fleet of locomotives in compli­
ance with federal standards is meaningless if manufactur­
ers are not allowed to produce locomotives and locomotive
parts that meet those standards. Petitioners’ claims thus
do not avoid pre-emption simply because they are aimed at
the manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts.
