KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of the Court

A
First, petitioners suggest that the Federal Railroad
Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA), 84 Stat. 971 (codified at 49
U. S. C. §20102 et seq.), altered the LIA’s pre-emptive
scope. The FRSA grants the Secretary of Transportation
broad regulatory authority over railroad safety. See
§20103(a). Petitioners point to the FRSA’s pre-emption
provision, which provides in part that “[a] State may adopt
or continue in force a law, regulation, or order related to
railroad safety . . . until the Secretary of Transportation
. . . prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the
subject matter of the State requirement.” §20106(a)(2)
(2006 ed., Supp. III). According to petitioners, the FRSA’s
pre-emption provision supplanted the LIA’s pre-emption of
the field, with the result that petitioners’ claims are not
pre-empted because the Secretary has not issued a regula­
tion or order addressing the use of asbestos in locomotives
or locomotive parts.
Petitioners’ reliance on the FRSA is misplaced. The
FRSA instructs that “[t]he Secretary of Transportation,
as necessary, shall prescribe regulations and issue orders
for every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and
regulations in effect on October 16, 1970.” §20103(a) (2006
ed.) (emphasis added). By its terms, the FRSA does
not alter pre-existing federal statutes on railroad safety.
“Rather, it leaves existing statutes intact, . . . and author­
izes the Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety
with supplemental regulation.” Marshall v. Burlington
Northern, Inc., 720 F. 2d 1149, 1152–1153 (CA9 1983)
(Kennedy, J.). Because the LIA was already in effect
when the FRSA was enacted, we conclude that the FRSA
left the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope as defined by Napier, intact.

Since the LIA’s pre-emptive scope remains unaltered,
