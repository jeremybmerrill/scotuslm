Opinion of the Court

the operation of trains.” Ibid.
To determine whether the state requirements were pre­
empted, this Court asked whether the LIA “manifest[s]
the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating loco­
motive equipment[.]” Id., at 611. The Court answered
that question in the affirmative, stating that “[t]he broad
scope of the authority conferred upon the [ICC]” by Con­
gress in the LIA led to that conclusion. Id., at 613. The
power delegated to the ICC, the Court explained, was a
“general one” that “extends to the design, the construction
and the material of every part of the locomotive and ten­
der and of all appurtenances.” Id., at 611.
The Court rejected the States’ contention that the scope
of the pre-empted field was to “be determined by the object
sought through the legislation, rather than the physical
elements affected by it.” Id., at 612. The Court found it
dispositive that “[t]he federal and the state statutes are
directed to the same subject—the equipment of locomo­
tives.” Ibid. Because the States’ requirements operated
upon the same physical elements as the LIA, the Court
held that the state laws, “however commendable or how­
ever different their purpose,” id., at 613, fell within the
LIA’s pre-empted field.
IV
Against the backdrop of Napier, petitioners advance two
arguments in support of their position that their state-law
claims related to the use of asbestos in locomotive equip­
ment do not fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field. Peti­
tioners first contend that Napier no longer defines the
scope of the LIA’s pre-empted field because that field has
been narrowed by a subsequently enacted federal statute.
Alternatively, petitioners argue that their claims do not
fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field, even as that field
was defined by Napier. We address each of petitioners’
arguments in turn.
