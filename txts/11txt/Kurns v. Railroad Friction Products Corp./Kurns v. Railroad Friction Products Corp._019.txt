KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.
Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.

LIA contains no substantive regulations, let alone a
“scheme of federal regulation . . . so pervasive as to make
reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the
States to supplement it.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,
331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). Instead of relying on such
indications of Congress’ intent to oust state law, Napier
implied field pre-emption from the LIA’s mere delegation
of regulatory authority to the Interstate Commerce Com­
mission. Compare 272 U. S., at 612–613, with, e.g., Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,
471 U. S. 707, 717 (1985), and New York State Dept. of
Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S. 405, 415 (1973). None­
theless, Napier’s construction of the LIA has been settled
law for 85 years, and “ ‘[c]onsiderations of stare decisis
have special force in the area of statutory interpretation.’ ”
Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, 502
U. S. 197, 202 (1991).
Consistent with the values served by statutory stare
decisis, however, it is important to be precise about what
Napier held: Napier defined the pre-empted field as the
physical composition of locomotive equipment. See 272
U. S., at 611 (“[T]he power delegated . . . by the [LIA] . . .
extends to the design, the construction, and the material
of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all ap­
purtenances”); id., at 612 (“The federal and the state
statutes are directed to the same subject—the equipment
of locomotives. They operate upon the same object”); see
also Act of June 7, 1924, §2, 43 Stat. 659 (making the
LIA’s standard of care applicable to the “locomotive, its
boiler, tender, and all parts and appurtenances thereof ”).
Petitioners’ defective-design claims fall within the pre­
empted field because they would impose state-law re­
quirements on a locomotive’s physical makeup. See ante,
at 7–8.
