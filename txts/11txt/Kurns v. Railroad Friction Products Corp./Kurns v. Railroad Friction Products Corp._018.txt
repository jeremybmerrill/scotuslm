GLORIA GAIL KURNS, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE

OF GEORGE M. CORSON, DECEASED, ET AL., 

PETITIONERS v. RAILROAD FRICTION 

PRODUCTS CORPORATION ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF



APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT



[February 29, 2012]




JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring in part and dissent­
ing in part.
I concur in the Court’s holding that the Locomotive
Inspection Act (LIA), 49 U. S. C. §20701 et seq., pre-empts
petitioners’ tort claims for defective design, but I respect­
fully dissent from the Court’s holding that the same is
true of petitioners’ claims for failure to warn. In my view,
the latter escape pre-emption because they impose no
state-law requirements in the field reserved for federal
regulation: “the equipment of locomotives.” Napier v.
Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 612 (1926).

Statutory stare decisis compels me to agree that the LIA
occupies “the field of regulating locomotive equipment
used on a highway of interstate commerce.” Id., at 607.
Perhaps this Court might decide Napier differently today.
The LIA lacks an express pre-emption clause, and “our
recent cases have frequently rejected field pre-emption in
the absence of statutory language expressly requiring it.”
