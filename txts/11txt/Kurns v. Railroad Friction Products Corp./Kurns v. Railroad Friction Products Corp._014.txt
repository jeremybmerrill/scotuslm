Opinion of the Court

4
Finally, petitioners contend that the LIA’s pre-emptive
scope does not extend to state common-law claims, as
opposed to state legislation or regulation. Petitioners note
that “a preempted field does not necessarily include state
common law.” Brief for Petitioners 38–39 (citing Silkwood
v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238 (1984); Sprietsma v.
Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51 (2002)). Napier, however,
held that the LIA “occup[ied] the entire field of regulating
locomotive equipment” to the exclusion of state regulation.
272 U. S., at 611–612. That categorical conclusion admits
of no exception for state common-law duties and standards
of care. As we have recognized, state “regulation can be
. . . effectively exerted through an award of damages,” and
“[t]he obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is
designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and
controlling policy.” San Diego Building Trades Council v.
Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959). Cf. Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. 312, 324 (2008) (“Absent other indication, reference to a State’s ‘requirements’ [in a federal
express pre-emption provision] includes its common-law
duties”). We therefore conclude that state common-law
duties and standards of care directed to the subject of
locomotive equipment are pre-empted by the LIA.

For the foregoing reasons, we hold that petitioners’
state-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims fall
within the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre­
empted by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
affirmed.
It is so ordered.
