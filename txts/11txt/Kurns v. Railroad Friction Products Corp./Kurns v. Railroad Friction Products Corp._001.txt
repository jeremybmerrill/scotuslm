KURNS, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF CORSON, 

DECEASED, ET AL. v. RAILROAD FRICTION 

PRODUCTS CORP. ET AL. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 10–879.

Argued November 9, 2011—Decided February 29, 2012

George Corson worked as a welder and machinist for a railroad carrier.
After retirement, Corson was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He and
his wife, a petitioner here, sued respondents Railroad Friction Products Corporation and Viad Corp in state court, claiming injury from

§20701. Pp. 2–3.
(b) Congress may expressly pre-empt state law. But even without
