Opinion of the Court

that [Corson] suffered harmful consequences as a result of
his exposure to asbestos contained in locomotive parts and
appurtenances.” 620 F. 3d, at 398, n. 8. Because petition­
ers’ failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the
equipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted
field defined by Napier. 272 U. S., at 612.4

Petitioners also contend that their state-law claims
against manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts
fall outside of the LIA’s pre-empted field because manufac­
turers were not regulated under the LIA at the time that
Corson was allegedly exposed to asbestos. Petitioners
point out that the LIA, as originally enacted in the BIA,
subjected only common carriers to civil penalties. Act of
Feb. 17, 1911, §9, 36 Stat. 916. It was not until 1988, well
after the events of this case, that the LIA’s penalty provi­
sion was revised to apply to “[a]ny person” violating the
LIA. Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, §14(7)(A), 102
Stat. 633; see also §14(7)(B) (amending penalty provision
to provide that “an act by an individual that causes
a railroad to be in violation . . . shall be deemed a
violation”).

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR apparently agrees that petitioners’ failure-to­
warn claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives. Post, at 5
(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Yet, she argues,
those claims affect locomotive equipment only “ ‘tangentially.’ ” Ibid.
(quoting English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990)). Not
so. A failure-to-warn claim imposes liability on a particular design of
locomotive equipment unless warnings deemed sufficient under state
law are given. This duty to warn and the accompanying threat of
liability will inevitably influence a manufacturer’s choice whether to
use that particular design. By influencing design decisions in that
manner, failure-to-warn liability has a “ ‘direct and substantial effect’ ”
on the “physical elements” of a locomotive. Post, at 5 (quoting English,
supra, at 85).
