Opinion of the Court

discovery documents to ascertain which can be taxed as
necessary to the litigation. In any event, the present case
does not present a hybrid situation; it involves purely
written translation, which falls outside the tasks performed by an “interpreter” as that term is ordinarily
understood.

Because the ordinary meaning of “interpreter” is someone who translates orally from one language to another,
we hold that the category “compensation of interpreters”
in §1920(6) does not include costs for document translation. We therefore vacate the judgment of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand
the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
