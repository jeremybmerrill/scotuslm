TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

usage, ibid. Moreover, the word “interpret” is generally
understood to mean “to explain or tell the meaning of:
translate into intelligible or familiar language or terms,”
while “translate” commonly means “to turn into one’s own
or another language.” Webster’s 1182, 2429. See also
Random House Dictionary of the English Language 744,
1505 (1973) (defining the transitive verb “interpret” as,
inter alia, “to translate,” and “translate” as “to turn (some­
thing written or spoken) from one language into another”).
Notably, several federal district court decisions refer to
translators of written documents as “interpreters.” E.g.,
United States v. Prado-Cervantez, No. 11–40044–11, 2011
WL 4691934, *3 (Kan., Oct. 6, 2011) (“Standby counsel
should also be prepared to arrange for interpreters to
interpret or translate documents when necessary for
defendant.”); Mendoza v. Ring, No. 07–3114, 2008 WL
2959848, *2 (CD Ill., July 30, 2008) (“The interpreter is
also directed to translate filings by the plaintiff from
Spanish to English. The original and translated versions
will be docketed.”). So do a number of state statutes. E.g.,
Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §26806(a) (West 2008) (“[T]he clerk
of the court may employ as many foreign language inter­
preters as may be necessary . . . to translate documents intended for filing in any civil or criminal action . . . .”).
Most federal courts of appeals confronted with the ques­
tion have held that costs may be awarded under §1920(6)
for the translation of documents necessary to, or in prepa­
ration for, litigation. Compare 633 F. 3d 1218, 1220–1222
(CA9 2011); BDT Prods., Inc. v. Lexmark Int’l, Inc., 405
F. 3d 415, 419 (CA6 2005); Slagenweit v. Slagenweit, 63
F. 3d 719, 721 (CA8 1995) (per curiam); and Chore-Time
Equip., Inc. v. Cumberland Corp., 713 F. 2d 774, 782 (CA
Fed. 1983) (all holding that costs for document translation
are covered by §1920(6)), with Extra Equipamentos E
Exportação Ltda. v. Case Corp., 541 F. 3d 719, 727–728
(CA7 2008) (costs for document translation are not covered
