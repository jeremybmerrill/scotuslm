GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Federal courts can meaningfully take part.”). Documen­
tary evidence in a foreign language, no less than oral
statements, must be translated to equip the parties to
present their case clearly and the court to decide the
merits intelligently. See, e.g., United States v. Mosquera,
816 F. Supp. 168, 175 (EDNY 1993) (“For a non-English

for printed or electronically recorded transcripts”); §1920(3) (2006 ed.)
(“Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses”); §1920(4) (“Fees
for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any [necessary]
materials”). Nothing indicates that Congress intended paragraph (6),
unlike paragraphs (2)–(4), to apply exclusively to oral communications.
