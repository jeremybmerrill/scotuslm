KOUICHI TANIGUCHI, PETITIONER v. KAN PACIFIC
SAIPAN, LTD., DBA MARIANAS RESORT AND SPA
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[May 21, 2012]

JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER and
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.
To be comprehended by the parties, the witnesses, and
the court, expression in foreign languages must be trans­
lated into English. Congress therefore provided, in 28
U. S. C. §1920(6), that the prevailing party may recoup
compensation paid to “interpreters.” The word “interpret­
ers,” the Court emphasizes, commonly refers to translators
of oral speech. Ante, at 5–6. But as the Court acknowl­
edges, ante, at 7, and n. 2, “interpreters” is more than
occasionally used to encompass those who translate writ­
ten speech as well. See Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary of the English Language 1182 (1976) (hereinafter Webster’s) (defining “interpreter” as “one that
translates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties
conversing in different tongues”); Black’s Law Dictionary
895 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “interpreter” as a “person who
translates, esp. orally, from one language to another”);
Ballentine’s Law Dictionary 655 (3d ed. 1969) (defining
“interpreter” as “[o]ne who interprets, particularly one
who interprets words written or spoken in a foreign
language”).
In short, employing the word “interpreters” to include
translators of written as well as oral speech, if not “the
most common usage,” ante, at 8, is at least an “acceptable”
