Opinion of the Court

sons who translate documents, but because that is not the
ordinary meaning of the word, it does not control unless
the context in which the word appears indicates that it
does. Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in §1920,
however, even hints that Congress intended to go beyond
the ordinary meaning of “interpreter” and to embrace the
broadest possible meaning that the definition of the word
can bear.
If anything, the statutory context suggests the opposite:
that the word “interpreter” applies only to those who
translate orally. As previously mentioned, Congress enacted §1920(6) as part of the Court Interpreters Act.
The main provision of that Act is §2(a), codified in 28
U. S. C. §§1827 and 1828. See 92 Stat. 2040–2042. Particularly relevant here is §1827. As it now reads, that
statute provides for the establishment of “a program to
facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United
States.” §1827(a). Subsection (d) directs courts to use an
interpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the
United States if a party or witness “speaks only or primarily a language other than the English language” or “suffers
from a hearing impairment” “so as to inhibit such party’s
comprehension of the proceedings or communication with
counsel or the presiding judicial officer, or so as to inhibit
such witness’ comprehension of questions and the presentation of such testimony.” §1827(d)(1).3 As originally
enacted, subsection (k) mandated that the “interpretation
provided by certified interpreters . . . shall be in the consecutive mode except that the presiding judicial officer . . .
may authorize a simultaneous or summary interpretation.” §1827(k) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also 92 Stat. 2042.

3 This provision remains substantially the same as it appeared when
first enacted. See 28 U. S. C. §1827(d)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also
92 Stat. 2040.
