TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD., DBA 

MARIANAS RESORT AND SPA

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 10–1472. Argued February 21, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012
Title 28 U. S. C. §1920, as amended by the Court Interpreters Act, includes “compensation of interpreters” among the costs that may be
awarded to prevailing parties in federal-court lawsuits. §1920(6). In
this case, the District Court awarded costs to respondent as the prevailing party in a civil action instituted by petitioner. The award included the cost of translating from Japanese to English certain documents that respondent used in preparing its defense. The Ninth
Circuit affirmed, concluding that §1920(6) covers the cost of translating documents as well as the cost of translating live speech.

437, 441. As originally configured, §1920 contained five categories of
taxable costs, but in 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters
Act, which added a sixth category that includes “compensation of interpreters.” §1920(6). Pp. 3−5.
(b) Because the term “interpreter” is not defined in the Court Interpreters Act or in any other relevant statutory provision, it must be
given its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.
179, 187. When Congress passed that Act in 1978, many dictionaries
defined “interpreter” as one who translates spoken, as opposed to
