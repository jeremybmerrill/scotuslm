TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.
Opinion of the Court

296, 301 (1989) (relying on the “most common meaning”
and the “ordinary and natural signification” of the word
“request,” even though it may sometimes “double for ‘demand’ or ‘command’ ”). The fact that the definition of
“interpreter” in Webster’s Third has a sense divider denoting the most common usage suggests that other usages,
although acceptable, might not be common or ordinary. It
is telling that all the dictionaries cited above defined
“interpreter” at the time of the statute’s enactment as
including persons who translate orally, but only a handful
defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators
of written material. See supra, at 5–7. Although the
Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative
on the English language, recognized that “interpreter” can
mean one who translates writings, it expressly designated
that meaning as obsolete. See supra, at 6. Were the
meaning of “interpreter” that respondent advocates truly
common or ordinary, we would expect to see more support
for that meaning. We certainly would not expect to see it
designated as obsolete in the Oxford English Dictionary.
Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common
or ordinary meaning.
Based on our survey of the relevant dictionaries, we
conclude that the ordinary or common meaning of “interpreter” does not include those who translate writings.
Instead, we find that an interpreter is normally understood as one who translates orally from one language to
another. This sense of the word is far more natural. As
the Seventh Circuit put it: “Robert Fagles made famous
translations into English of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the
Aeneid, but no one would refer to him as an Englishlanguage ‘interpreter’ of these works.” Extra Equipamen­
