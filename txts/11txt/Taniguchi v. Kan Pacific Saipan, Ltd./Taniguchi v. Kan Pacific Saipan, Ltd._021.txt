GINSBURG, J., dissenting

by §1920(6)). See also In re Puerto Rico Elec. Power Auth.,
687 F. 2d 501, 506, 510 (CA1 1982) (recognizing that
costs of document translation may be reimbursed, with­
out specifying the relevant subsection of §1920); Studieng­
esellschaft Kohle mbH v. Eastman Kodak Co., 713 F. 2d
128, 133 (CA5 1983) (allowing document translation
costs under §1920(4)); Quy v. Air Am., Inc., 667 F. 2d 1059,
1065 (CADC 1981) (allowing “translation costs” under
§1920(6)).1
In practice, federal trial courts have awarded document
translation costs in cases spanning several decades. See,
e.g., Raffold Process Corp. v. Castanea Paper Co., 25
F. Supp. 593, 594 (WD Pa. 1938). Before the Court Inter­
preters Act added §1920(6) to the taxation of costs statute
in 1978, district courts awarded costs for document trans­
lation under §1920(4), which allowed taxation of “[f ]ees for
exemplification and copies of papers,” 28 U. S. C. §1920(4)
(1976 ed.), or under §1920’s predecessor, 28 U. S. C. §830
(1925 ed.). See, e.g., Bennett Chemical Co. v. Atlantic
Commodities, Ltd., 24 F. R. D. 200, 204 (SDNY 1959)
(§1920(4)); Raffold Process Corp., 25 F. Supp., at 594
(§830). Pre-1978, district courts also awarded costs for
oral translation of witness testimony. See, e.g., Kaiser
Industries Corp. v. McLouth Steel Corp., 50 F. R. D. 5, 11
(ED Mich. 1970). Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act, a
measure intended to expand access to interpretation
services, indicates a design to eliminate the availability of
costs awards for document translation. See S. Rep. No.
95–569, p. 4 (1977) (hereinafter S. Rep.) (“The commit­
tee . . . feels the time has come to provide by statute for
the provision of and access to qualified certified interpret­

costs, like other costs recoverable under §1920, may be
“denied or limited” if they “were unreasonably incurred or unnecessary
to the case.” 10 Moore’s Federal Practice §54.101[1][b], p. 54–158 (3d
ed. 2012).
