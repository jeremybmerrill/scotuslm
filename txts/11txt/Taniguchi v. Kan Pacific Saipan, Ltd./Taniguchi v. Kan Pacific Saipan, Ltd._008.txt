§1920.” Ibid.
As originally configured, §1920 contained five categories
of taxable costs: (1) “[f]ees of the clerk and marshal”; (2)
“[f ]ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the
case”; (3) “[f]ees and disbursements for printing and witnesses”; (4) “[f]ees for exemplification and copies of papers
necessarily obtained for use in the case”; and (5) “[d]ocket
fees under section 1923 of this title.” 62 Stat. 955. In
1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which
amended §1920 to add a sixth category: “Compensation of
court appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and
salaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation
services under section 1828 of this title.” 28 U. S. C.
§1920(6); see also §7, 92 Stat. 2044. We are concerned
here with this sixth category, specifically the item of taxable costs identified as “compensation of interpreters.”

To determine whether the item “compensation of interpreters” includes costs for document translation, we must

The question here is: What is the ordinary meaning of
“interpreter”?
Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted the
Court Interpreters Act in 1978 defined “interpreter” as one
who translates spoken, as opposed to written, language.
The American Heritage Dictionary, for instance, defined
the term as “[o]ne who translates orally from one language
into another.” American Heritage Dictionary 685 (1978).
The Scribner-Bantam English Dictionary defined the
related word “interpret” as “to translate orally.” Scribner-
