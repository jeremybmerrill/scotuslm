TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.
Opinion of the Court

Bantam English Dictionary 476 (1977). Similarly, the
Random House Dictionary defined the intransitive form of
“interpret” as “to translate what is said in a foreign language.” Random House Dictionary of the English Language 744 (1973) (emphasis added). And, notably, the
Oxford English Dictionary defined “interpreter” as “[o]ne
who translates languages,” but then divided that definition into two senses: “a. [a] translator of books or writings,” which it designated as obsolete, and “b. [o]ne who
translates the communications of persons speaking different languages; spec. one whose office it is to do so orally in
the presence of the persons; a dragoman.” 5 Oxford English Dictionary 416 (1933); see also Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English 566 (6th ed. 1976) (“One who
interprets; one whose office it is to translate the words of
persons speaking different languages, esp. orally in their
presence”); Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary 686
(1973) (“one who translates orally for the benefit of two or
more parties speaking different languages: . . . a translator (obs.)”).
Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined the
words “interpreter” and “interpret” in terms of oral translation. The then-current edition of Black’s Law Dictionary, for example, defined “interpreter” as “[a] person
sworn at a trial to interpret the evidence of a foreigner . . .
to the court,” and it defined “interpret” in relevant part as
“to translate orally from one tongue to another.” Black’s
Law Dictionary 954, 953 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); see also
W. Anderson, A Dictionary of Law 565 (1888) (“One who
translates the testimony of witnesses speaking a foreign
tongue, for the benefit of the court and jury”); 1 B. Abbott,
Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or
English Jurisprudence 639 (1878) (“one who restates the
testimony of a witness testifying in a foreign tongue, to the
court and jury, in their language”). But see Ballentine’s
Law Dictionary 655, 654 (3d ed. 1969) (defining “inter-
