TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

written document in advance, Taniguchi maintains, does
not count as “interpretation.” Ibid. But if the interpreter
then reads the prepared written translation aloud in
court, that task, in Taniguchi’s view, can be charged as
“interpretation,” id., at 11, even though the reading in­
volves no translation of foreign-language expression—
written or oral—at all.
Similarly hard to categorize is the common court­
interpreter task of listening to a recording in a foreign
language, transcribing it, then translating it into English. See González 439. Although this task involves oral
foreign-language communication, it does not, Taniguchi
contends, qualify as “interpretation,” because it involves
“the luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the
leisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.” Reply Brief
for Petitioner 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). But
sight translation—which Taniguchi concedes may be
charged as “interpretation”—may sometimes involve sim­
ilarly careful linguistic analysis of a written document
in advance of a court proceeding. Davis & Hewitt, Lessons

Taniguchi warns that translation costs can be exorbi­
tant and burdensome to police. Reply Brief 19–22; Tr. of
Oral Arg. 20–21. The Court expresses a similar concern.

Court also observes that “[t]axable costs are limited to relatively
minor, incidental expenses.” Ante, at 12. The tab for unquestionably
allowable costs, however, may run high. See, e.g., In re Ricoh Co., Ltd.
Patent Litigation, No. C 03–02289, 2012 WL 1499191, *6 (ND Cal., Apr.
26, 2012) (awarding $440,000 in copying costs); Jones v. Halliburton
Co., No. 4:07–cv–2719, 2011 WL 4479119, *2 (SD Tex., Sept. 26, 2011)
(awarding $57,300 in fees for court-appointed expert). Translation
costs, on the other hand, are not inevitably large. See Brief for Re­
