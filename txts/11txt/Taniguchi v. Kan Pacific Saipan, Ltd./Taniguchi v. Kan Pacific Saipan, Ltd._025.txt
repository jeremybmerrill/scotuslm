GINSBURG, J., dissenting

costs, however, has shown that district judges are up to
the task of confining awards to translation services neces­
sary to present or defeat a claim. See Eastman Kodak Co.,
713 F. 2d, at 133 (district court should not award docu­
ment translation costs “carte blanche,” but must deter­
mine whether such costs were necessarily incurred). See
also, e.g., Conn v. Zakharov, No. 1:09 CV 0760, 2010 WL
2293133, *3 (ND Ohio, June 4, 2010) (denying translation
costs where prevailing party did not demonstrate the costs
were necessary); Maker’s Mark Distillery, Inc. v. Diageo
North Am., Inc., No. 3:03–CV–93, 2010 WL 2651186, *3
(WD Ky., June 30, 2010) (same); Competitive Technologies
v. Fujitsu Ltd., No. C–02–1673, 2006 WL 6338914, *11
(ND Cal., Aug. 23, 2006) (same); Arboireau v. Adidas
Salomon AG, No. CV–01–105, 2002 WL 31466564, *6
(Ore., June 14, 2002) (same); Oetiker v. Jurid Werke,
GmbH, 104 F. R. D. 389, 393 (DC 1982) (same); Lockett, 60
F. R. D., at 473 (awarding costs for “necessary” transla­
tions); Kaiser, 50 F. R. D., at 11–12 (same); Bennett, 24
F. R. D., at 204 (same); Raffold Process Corp., 25 F. Supp.,
at 594 (same). Courts of appeals, in turn, are capable of
reviewing such judgments for abuse of discretion.
In short, §1920(6)’s prescription on “interpreters” is not
so clear as to leave no room for interpretation. Given the
purpose served by translation and the practice prevailing
in district courts, supra, at 3, there is no good reason to
exclude from taxable costs payments for placing written
words within the grasp of parties, jurors, and judges. I
would therefore affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.

less than $13,000, of which at least fourteen were less than $3,000).
