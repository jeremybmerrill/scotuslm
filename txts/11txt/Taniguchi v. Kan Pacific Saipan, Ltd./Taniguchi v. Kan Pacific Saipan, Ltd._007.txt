Opinion of the Court

tornies and counsellors’ fees . . . as are allowed in the
supreme or superior courts of the respective states.”
Act of Mar. 1, 1793, §4, 1 Stat. 333.
Although twice reenacted, this provision expired in 1799.
Alyeska Pipeline, supra, at 248, n. 19; Crawford Fitting
Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 439 (1987). Yet
even in the absence of express legislative authorization,
the practice of referring to state rules for the taxation of
costs persisted. See Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U. S., at 250.
Not until 1853 did Congress enact legislation specifying
the costs allowable in federal court. Id., at 251. The
impetus for a uniform federal rule was largely the consequence of two developments. First, a “great diversity in
practice among the courts” had emerged. Ibid. Second,
“losing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbitant fees for the victor’s attorney.” Ibid. Against this
backdrop, Congress passed the 1853 Fee Act, which we
have described as a “far-reaching Act specifying in detail
the nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the
federal courts.” Id., at 251–252. The substance of this Act
was transmitted through the Revised Statutes of 1874
and the Judicial Code of 1911 to the Revised Code of
1948, where it was codified, “without any apparent intent to
change the controlling rules,” as 28 U. S. C. §1920. 421
U. S., at 255.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives courts the
discretion to award costs to prevailing parties. That Rule
provides in relevant part: “Unless a federal statute, these
rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs—other
than attorney’s fees—should be allowed to the prevailing
party.” Rule 54(d)(1). We have held that “§1920 defines
the term ‘costs’ as used in Rule 54(d).” Crawford Fitting,
482 U. S., at 441. In so doing, we rejected the view that
“the discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is a separate source
of power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in
