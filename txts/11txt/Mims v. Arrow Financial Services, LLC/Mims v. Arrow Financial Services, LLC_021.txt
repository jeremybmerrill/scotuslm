MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
Opinion of the Court

under 28 U. S. C. §1331. In the absence of direction from
Congress stronger than any Arrow has advanced, we apply
the familiar default rule: Federal courts have §1331 jurisdiction over claims that arise under federal law. Because
federal law gives rise to the claim for relief Mims has
stated and specifies the substantive rules of decision, the
Eleventh Circuit erred in dismissing Mims’s case for lack
of subject-matter jurisdiction.

*
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
