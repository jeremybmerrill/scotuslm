MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
Opinion of the Court

by 28 U. S. C. §1331 should hold firm against “mere implication flowing from subsequent legislation.” Colorado
River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S.
800, 808, 809, n. 15 (1976) (quoting Rosencrans v. United
States, 165 U. S. 257, 262 (1897)).
We are not persuaded, moreover, that Congress sought
only to fill a gap in the States’ enforcement capabilities.
Had Congress so limited its sights, it could have passed
a statute providing that out-of-state telemarketing calls
directed into a State would be subject to the laws of the
receiving State. Congress did not enact such a law. Instead, it enacted detailed, uniform, federal substantive
prescriptions and provided for a regulatory regime administered by a federal agency. See 47 U. S. C. §227. TCPA
liability thus depends on violation of a federal statutory
requirement or an FCC regulation, §§227(b)(3)(A), (c)(5),
not on a violation of any state substantive law.
The federal interest in regulating telemarketing to
“protec[t] the privacy of individuals” while “permit[ting]
legitimate [commercial] practices,” 105 Stat. 2394, note
following 47 U. S. C. §227 (Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omitted), is evident from the regulatory role Congress assigned to the FCC. See, e.g.,
§227(b)(2) (delegating to the FCC authority to exempt calls
from the Act’s reach and prohibit calls to businesses).
Congress’ design would be less well served if consumers
had to rely on “the laws or rules of court of a State,”
§227(b)(3), or the accident of diversity jurisdiction,13 to

all courts of appeals to have considered the question have
held that the TCPA does not bar district courts from exercising diversity jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1332, see, e.g., Gottlieb v. Carnival
Corp., 436 F. 3d 335 (CA2 2006), at oral argument, Arrow’s counsel
maintained that diversity jurisdiction “should go, too,” Tr. of Oral Arg.

to hear TCPA claims, residents of States that choose not to hear TCPA
