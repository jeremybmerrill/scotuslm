MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
Opinion of the Court

B
Mims, a Florida resident, alleged that Arrow, seeking to
collect a debt, repeatedly used an automatic telephone
dialing system or prerecorded or artificial voice to call
Mims’s cellular phone without his consent. Commencing
suit in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of
Florida, Mims charged that Arrow “willfully or knowingly
violated the TCPA.” App. 14. He sought declaratory
relief, a permanent injunction, and damages. Id., at 18–
19.
The District Court held that it lacked subject-matter
jurisdiction over Mims’s TCPA claim. Under Eleventh
Circuit precedent, the District Court explained, federalquestion jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1331 was unavailable “because Congress vested jurisdiction over [private
actions under] the TCPA exclusively in state courts.” Civ.
No. 09–22347 (SD Fla., Apr. 1, 2010), App. to Pet. for Cert.
4a–5a (citing Nicholson v. Hooters of Augusta, Inc., 136
F. 3d 1287 (CA11 1998)). Adhering to Circuit precedent,
the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 421 Fed. Appx. 920, 921 (2011) (quoting Nicholson, 136 F. 3d, at 1287–1288 (“Congress granted state
courts exclusive jurisdiction over private actions under the
[TCPA].”)).
We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), to resolve a
split among the Circuits as to whether Congress granted
state courts exclusive jurisdiction over private actions
brought under the TCPA. Compare Murphey v. Lanier,
204 F. 3d 911, 915 (CA9 2000) (U. S. district courts lack
federal-question jurisdiction over private TCPA actions),
