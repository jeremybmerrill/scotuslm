MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
Opinion of the Court

ond, the TCPA forbids using artificial or prerecorded
voice messages to call residential telephone lines without prior express consent. §227(b)(1)(B). Third, the Act
proscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax machines. §227(b)(1)(C). Fourth, it bans using automatic
telephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a
business’ telephone lines simultaneously. §227(b)(1)(D).2
The TCPA delegates authority to the FCC to ban artificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses,
§227(b)(2)(A), and to exempt particular types of calls from
the law’s requirements, §§227(b)(2)(B), (C). The Act also
directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to protect the
privacy of residential telephone subscribers, possibly
through the creation of a national “do not call” system.
§227(c).3
Congress provided complementary means of enforcing
the Act. State Attorneys General may “bring a civil action
on behalf of [State] residents,” if the Attorney General
“has reason to believe that any person has engaged . . . in
a pattern or practice” of violating the TCPA or FCC regulations thereunder. 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011).
“The district courts of the United States . . . have exclusive
jurisdiction” over all TCPA actions brought by State Attorneys General. §227(g)(2). The Commission may intervene in such suits. §227(g)(3).4

2 In 2010, Congress amended the statute to prohibit an additional
practice: the manipulation of caller-identification information. See
Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111–331, 124 Stat. 3572. This
legislation inserted a new subsection (e) into 47 U. S. C. §227 and
redesignated the former subsections (e), (f), and (g) as subsections (f),
(g), and (h), respectively. Ibid. While the new subsection (e) does not
bear on this case and is not here discussed, our citations of subsection
(g) refer to the current, redesignated statutory text.
3 The National Do Not Call Registry is currently managed by the
Federal Trade Commission. See 15 U. S. C. §6151 (2006 ed., Supp. IV);
16 CFR §310.4(b)(1)(iii) (2011).
