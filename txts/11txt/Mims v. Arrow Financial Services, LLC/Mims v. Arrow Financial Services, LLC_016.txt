jurisdiction. See supra, at 9. True enough, but Congress had simultaneously provided for TCPA enforcement
actions by state authorities, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g) (Supp.
2011), and had made federal district courts exclusively
competent in such cases, §227(g)(2). Congress may simply
have wanted to avoid any argument that in private actions, as in actions brought by State Attorneys General,
“federal jurisdiction is exclusive.” Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451
(emphasis deleted) (citing Yellow Freight, 494 U. S. 820
(holding, after 26 years of litigation, that claims under the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 may be resolved in state as well
as federal courts) and Tafflin, 493 U. S. 455 (holding, after
20 years of litigation, that claims under RICO may be
resolved in state as well as federal courts)). Moreover, by
providing that private actions may be brought in state
court “if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court
of [the] State,” 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), Congress arguably
gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to “decide
for [themselves] whether to entertain claims under the
[TCPA],” Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451. See Brief for Respondent
16 (Congress “le[ft] States free to decide what TCPA
claims to allow.”).12
Making state-court jurisdiction over §227(b)(3) claims
exclusive, Arrow further asserts, “fits hand in glove with
[Congress’] objective”: enabling States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded state law. Id.,
at 15. Even so, we have observed, jurisdiction conferred

12 The Supremacy Clause declares federal law the “supreme law of
the land,” and state courts must enforce it “in the absence of a valid
excuse.” Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 370, n. 16 (1990). “An excuse
that is inconsistent with or violates federal law is not a valid excuse:
The Supremacy Clause forbids state courts to dissociate themselves
from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal
to recognize the superior authority of its source.” Id., at 371. Without
the “if otherwise permitted” language, 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), there is
little doubt that state courts would be obliged to hear TCPA claims.
See Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386, 394 (1947).
