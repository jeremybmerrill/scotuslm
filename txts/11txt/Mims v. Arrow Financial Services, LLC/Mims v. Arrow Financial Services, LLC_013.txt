MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
Opinion of the Court

U. S. C. §252(e)(6) “divest[s] the district courts of their
authority under 28 U. S. C. §1331 to review the [state
agency’s] order for compliance with federal law.”); K mart
Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 485 U. S. 176, 182–183 (1988) (“The
District Court would be divested of [§1331] jurisdiction . . .
if this action fell within one of several specific grants of
exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of International Trade
[under 28 U. S. C. §1581(a) or §1581(i)(3)].”).
“[D]ivestment of district court jurisdiction” should be
found no more readily than “divestmen[t] of state court
jurisdiction,” given “the longstanding and explicit grant
of federal question jurisdiction in 28 U. S. C. §1331.”
ErieNet, 156 F. 3d, at 523 (Alito, J., dissenting); see
Gonell, Note, Statutory Interpretation of Federal Jurisdictional Statutes: Jurisdiction of the Private Right of Action
under the TCPA, 66 Ford. L. Rev. 1895, 1929–1930 (1998).
Accordingly, the District Court retains §1331 jurisdiction
over Mims’s complaint unless the TCPA, expressly or by
fair implication, excludes federal-court adjudication. See
Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at 644; Gonell, supra, at 1929
(Jurisdiction over private TCPA actions “is proper under
§1331 unless Congress enacted a partial repeal of §1331 in
the TCPA.”).
III
Arrow’s arguments do not persuade us that Congress
has eliminated §1331 jurisdiction over private actions
under the TCPA.
The language of the TCPA—“A person or entity may, if
otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a
State, bring [an action] in an appropriate court of that
State,” 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)—Arrow asserts, is uniquely
state-court oriented. See Brief for Respondent 13. That
may be, but “[i]t is a general rule that the grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive.” United States v. Bank of New
