Opinion of the Court

I

A

In enacting the TCPA, Congress made several findings
relevant here. “Unrestricted telemarketing,” Congress
determined, “can be an intrusive invasion of privacy.”
TCPA, 105 Stat. 2394, note following 47 U. S. C. §227
(Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omitted). In particular, Congress reported, “[m]any consumers
are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance
[telemarketing] calls to their homes.” Ibid. (internal
quotation marks omitted). “[A]utomated or prerecorded
telephone calls” made to private residences, Congress
found, were rightly regarded by recipients as “an invasion
of privacy.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
Although over half the States had enacted statutes restricting telemarketing, Congress believed that federal
law was needed because “telemarketers [could] evade
[state-law] prohibitions through interstate operations.”
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). See also S. Rep.
No. 102–178, p. 3 (1991) (“[B]ecause States do not have
jurisdiction over interstate calls[,] [m]any States have
expressed a desire for Federal legislation . . . .”).1
Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA principally outlaws four practices. First, the Act makes it
unlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system
or an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the
prior express consent of the called party, to call any emergency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular
telephone, or other service for which the receiver is
charged for the call. See 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(1)(A). Sec——————
1 In general, the Communications Act of 1934 grants to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) authority to
regulate interstate telephone communications and reserves to the
States authority to regulate intrastate telephone communications. See
Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355, 360, 369–370
(1986).
