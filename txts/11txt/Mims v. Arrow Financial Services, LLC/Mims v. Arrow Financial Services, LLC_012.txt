Opinion of the Court

tions in state courts. In cases “arising under” federal law,
we note, there is a “deeply rooted presumption in favor of
concurrent state court jurisdiction,” rebuttable if “Congress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction
over a particular federal claim.” Tafflin v. Levitt, 493
U. S. 455, 458–459 (1990). E.g., 28 U. S. C. §1333 (“The
district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of
the courts of the States, of: (1) Any civil case of admiralty
or maritime jurisdiction . . . .”). The presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, we have recognized, can
be overcome “by an explicit statutory directive, by unmistakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear
incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests.” Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453
U. S. 473, 478 (1981).
Arrow readily acknowledges the presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, but maintains that 28
U. S. C. §1331 creates no converse presumption in favor
of federal-court jurisdiction. Instead, Arrow urges, the
TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces §1331, an
earlier, more general prescription. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
28–29; Brief for Respondent 31.
Section 1331, our decisions indicate, is not swept away
so easily. As stated earlier, see supra, at 8, when federal
law creates a private right of action and furnishes the
substantive rules of decision, the claim arises under federal law, and district courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under §1331.9 That principle endures unless
Congress divests federal courts of their §1331 adjudicatory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv.
Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642 (2002) (Nothing in 47
——————
9 Even when a right of action is created by state law, if the claim requires resolution of significant issues of federal law, the case may arise
under federal law for 28 U. S. C. §1331 purposes. See Grable & Sons
Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 312
(2005).
