Opinion of the Court

nology Inst. v. Inacom Communications, Inc., 106 F. 3d
1146, 1158 (CA4 1997) (same), with Charvat v. EchoStar
Satellite, LLC, 630 F. 3d 459, 463–465 (CA6 2010) (U. S.
district courts have federal-question jurisdiction over
private TCPA actions), Brill v. Countrywide Home Loans,
Inc., 427 F. 3d 446, 447 (CA7 2005) (same), and ErieNet,
156 F. 3d, at 521 (Alito, J., dissenting) (same). We now
hold that Congress did not deprive federal courts of
federal-question jurisdiction over private TCPA suits.
II
Federal courts, though “courts of limited jurisdiction,”
Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.
375, 377 (1994), in the main “have no more right to decline
the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, then to usurp
that which is not given.” Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264
(1821). Congress granted federal courts general federalquestion jurisdiction in 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, §1,
18 Stat. 470.6 As now codified, the law provides: “The
district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil
actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of
the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §1331. The statute originally included an amount-in-controversy requirement, set
at $500. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, §1, 18 Stat. 470. Recognizing the responsibility of federal courts to decide claims,
large or small, arising under federal law, Congress in 1980
eliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement in
federal-question (but not diversity) cases. See Federal
Question Jurisdictional Amendments Act of 1980, 94 Stat.
2369 (amending 28 U. S. C. §1331). See also H. R. Rep.

6 Congress had previously granted general federal-question jurisdiction to federal courts, but the grant was short lived. See Steffel v.
Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 464, n. 14 (1974) (describing Midnight Judges
Act of 1801, §11, 2 Stat. 92, repealed by Act of Mar. 8, 1802, §1, 2 Stat.
132).
