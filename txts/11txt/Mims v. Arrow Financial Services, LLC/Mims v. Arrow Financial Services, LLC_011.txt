MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
Opinion of the Court

No. 96–1461, p. 1 (1980).7 Apart from deletion of the
amount-in-controversy requirement, the general federalquestion provision has remained essentially unchanged
since 1875. See 13D Wright & Miller 163.
Because federal law creates the right of action and
provides the rules of decision, Mims’s TCPA claim, in 28
U. S. C. §1331’s words, plainly “aris[es] under” the “laws
. . . of the United States.” As already noted, supra, at 2,
“[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of
action.” American Well Works, 241 U. S., at 260. Although courts have described this formulation as “more
useful for inclusion than for . . . exclusion,” Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 809, n. 5
(1986) (quoting T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F. 2d 823,
827 (CA2 1964)), there is no serious debate that a federally created claim for relief is generally a “sufficient condition for federal-question jurisdiction.” Grable & Sons
Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545
U. S. 308, 317 (2005).8
Arrow agrees that this action arises under federal law,
see Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, but urges that Congress vested
exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA ac——————
7 At the time it was repealed, the amount-in-controversy requirement
in federal-question cases had reached $10,000. See Act of July 25,
1958, 72 Stat. 415. Currently, the amount in controversy in diversity
cases must exceed $75,000. See 28 U. S. C. §1332.
8 For a rare exception to the rule that a federal cause of action suffices
to ground federal-question jurisdiction, see Shoshone Mining Co. v.
Rutter, 177 U. S. 505 (1900), discussed in R. Fallon, J. Manning, D.
Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the
Federal System, 784–785 (6th ed. 2009). In Shoshone Mining, we held
that a suit for a federal mining patent did not arise under federal law
for jurisdictional purposes because “the right of possession” in controversy could be determined by “local rules or customs, or state statutes,”
177 U. S., at 509, or “may present simply a question of fact,” id., at 510.
Here, by contrast, the TCPA not only creates the claim for relief and
designates the remedy; critically, the Act and regulations thereunder
supply the governing substantive law.
