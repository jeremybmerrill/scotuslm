Opinion of the Court

gain redress for TCPA violations.
Arrow emphasizes a statement made on the Senate floor
by Senator Hollings, the TCPA’s sponsor:
“Computerized calls are the scourge of modern civilization. They wake us up in the morning; they interrupt our dinner at night; they force the sick and
elderly out of bed; they hound us until we want to
rip the telephone right out of the wall.
.
.
.
.
.
“The substitute bill contains a private right-ofaction provision that will make it easier for consumers
to recover damages from receiving these computerized
calls. The provision would allow consumers to bring
an action in State court against any entity that violates the bill. The bill does not, because of constitutional constraints, dictate to the States which court in
each State shall be the proper venue for such an action, as this is a matter for State legislators to determine. Nevertheless, it is my hope that States will
make it as easy as possible for consumers to bring
such actions, preferably in small claims court. . . .
“Small claims court or a similar court would allow
the consumer to appear before the court without an
attorney. The amount of damages in this legislation
is set to be fair to both the consumer and the telemarketer. However, it would defeat the purposes of the
bill if the attorneys’ costs to consumers of bringing an
action were greater than the potential damages. I
thus expect that the States will act reasonably in
permitting their citizens to go to court to enforce this
bill.” 137 Cong. Rec. 30821–30822 (1991).
This statement does not bear the weight Arrow would
place on it.
