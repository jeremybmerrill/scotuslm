Opinion of the Court

claims. Brief for Respondent 33. “Moreover, if plaintiffs
are free to bring TCPA claims in federal court under
§1331, then defendants sued in state court would be equally free to remove those cases to federal court under 28
U. S. C. §1441.” Id., at 22–23. Indeed, Arrow suggests,
defendants could use removal as a mechanism to force
small-claims-court plaintiffs to abandon suit rather than
“figh[t] it out” in the “more expensive federal forum.” Id.,
at 23.
Arrow’s floodgates argument assumes “a shocking degree of noncompliance” with the Act, Reply Brief 11, and
seems to us more imaginary than real. The current federal district court civil filing fee is $350. 28 U. S. C.
§1914(a). How likely is it that a party would bring a $500
claim in, or remove a $500 claim to, federal court? Lexis
and Westlaw searches turned up 65 TCPA claims removed
to federal district courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin since the Seventh Circuit held, in October 2005, that
the Act does not confer exclusive jurisdiction on state
courts. All 65 cases were class actions, not individual
cases removed from small-claims court.15 There were also
26 private TCPA claims brought initially in federal district
courts; of those, 24 were class actions.

Nothing in the text, structure, purpose, or legislative
history of the TCPA calls for displacement of the federalquestion jurisdiction U. S. district courts ordinarily have

15 When Congress wants to make federal claims instituted in state
court nonremovable, it says just that. See Breuer v. Jim’s Concrete of
Brevard, Inc., 538 U. S. 691, 696–697 (2003) (quoting, e.g., 28 U. S. C.
§1445(a) (“A civil action in any State court against a railroad or its
receivers or trustees, [arising under §§51–60 of Title 45,] may not be
removed to any district court of the United States.”) and 15 U. S. C.
§77v(a) (“[N]o case arising under this subchapter and brought in any
State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of
the United States.”)).
