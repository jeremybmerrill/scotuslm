MARCUS D. MIMS, PETITIONER v. ARROW 

FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[January 18, 2012]


JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns enforcement, through private suits,
of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA
or Act), 47 U. S. C. §227. Voluminous consumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology—for example, computerized calls dispatched to private homes—
prompted Congress to pass the TCPA. Congress determined that federal legislation was needed because
telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping
state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act
bans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission)
to prescribe implementing regulations. It authorizes
States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices
and to recover damages on their residents’ behalf. The
Commission must be notified of such suits and may intervene in them. Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA
suits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U. S.
district courts. Congress also provided for civil actions by
private parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA
or of the Commission’s implementing regulations.
