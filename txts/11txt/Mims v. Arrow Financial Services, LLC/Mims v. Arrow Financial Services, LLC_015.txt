MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
Opinion of the Court

see ErieNet, 156 F. 3d, at 522 (Alito, J., dissenting) (“[47
U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011)] reveals that, while
drafting the TCPA, Congress knew full well how to grant
exclusive jurisdiction with mandatory language. The most
natural interpretation of Congress’ failure to use similar
language in [47 U. S. C. §]227(b)(3) is that Congress did
not intend to grant exclusive jurisdiction in that section.”);
Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451 (“[47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp.
2011)] is explicit about exclusivity, while [47 U. S. C.]
§227(b)(3) is not; the natural inference is that the state
forum mentioned in §227(b)(3) is optional rather than
mandatory.”).11
Arrow urges that Congress would have had no reason to
provide for a private action “in an appropriate [state]
court,” §227(b)(3), if it did not mean to make the state
forum exclusive. Had Congress said nothing at all about
bringing private TCPA claims in state courts, Arrow observes, those courts would nevertheless have concurrent

11 For TCPA actions brought by State Attorneys General, or
“an[other] official or agency designated by a State,” 47 U. S. C. A.
§227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), Arrow points out, Congress specifically addressed venue, service of process, §227(g)(4), and potential conflicts
between federal and state enforcement efforts, §227(g)(7). No similar
prescriptions appear in the section on private actions, 47 U. S. C.
§227(b)(3), for this obvious reason:
“[As] the general rules governing venue and service of process in the
district courts are well established, see 28 U. S. C. §1391(b); Fed. Rules
Civ. Proc. 4, 4.1, there was no need for Congress to reiterate them in
section 227(b)(3). The fact that venue and service of process are discussed in [47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(4) (Supp. 2011)] and not [47 U. S. C.
§]227(b)(3) simply indicates that Congress wished to make adjustments
to the general rules in the former section and not the latter. As for the
conflict provision that appears in section [47 U. S. C. A. §227(g) (Supp.
2011)] but not [47 U. S. C. §]227(b)(3), it is hardly surprising that
Congress would be concerned about agency conflicts in the section of
the TCPA dealing with official state enforcement efforts but not in the
section governing private lawsuits.” ErieNet, Inc. v. Velocity Net, Inc.,
156 F. 3d 513, 523 (CA3 1998) (Alito, J., dissenting).
