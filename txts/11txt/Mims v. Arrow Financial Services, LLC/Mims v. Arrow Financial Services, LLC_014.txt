Opinion of the Court

York & Trust Co., 296 U. S. 463, 479 (1936).
Nothing in the permissive language of §227(b)(3) makes
state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports to
oust federal courts of their 28 U. S. C. §1331 jurisdiction
over federal claims. See, e.g., Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at
643 (“[N]othing in 47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6) purports to strip
[§1331] jurisdiction.”). Cf. Yellow Freight System, Inc. v.
Donnelly, 494 U. S. 820, 823 (1990) (Title VII’s language—
“[e]ach United States district court . . . shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this subchapter,” 42 U. S. C.
§2000e–5(f)(3)—does not “ous[t] state courts of their presumptive jurisdiction.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Congress may indeed provide a track for a federal
claim exclusive of §1331. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §405(h)
(“No action . . . shall be brought under [§1331] to recover
on any claim arising under [Title II of the Social Security
Act].”); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 756–757 (1975).
Congress has done nothing of that sort here, however.
Title 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3) does not state that a private
plaintiff may bring an action under the TCPA “only” in
state court, or “exclusively” in state court. The absence of
such a statement contrasts with the Act’s instruction on
suits instituted by State Attorneys General. As earlier
noted, see supra, at 4, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp.
2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction over [such] actions”
in “[t]he district courts of the United States.”10 Section
227(g)(2)’s exclusivity prescription “reinforce[s] the conclusion that [47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)’s] silence . . . leaves the
jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched. For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it
was excluded expressly.” Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at 644;

10 “How

strange it would be,” the Seventh Circuit observed, “to make
federal courts the exclusive forum for suits by the states, while making
state courts the exclusive forum for suits by private plaintiffs.” Brill v.
Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 427 F. 3d 446, 451 (2005).
