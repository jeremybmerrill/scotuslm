MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
Syllabus
over private TCPA suits. Pp. 7–18.
(a) Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the
rules of decision, Mims’s TCPA claim, in §1331’s words, plainly
“aris[es] under” the “laws . . . of the United States.” Arrow agrees
that this action arises under federal law, but urges that Congress
vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in
state courts. In cases “arising under” federal law, there is a presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if “Congress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a particular federal claim.” Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458–459. Arrow
acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that §1331 creates no
converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction. Instead,
Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces
§1331, an earlier, more general prescription.
Section 1331 is not swept away so easily. The principle that district courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under §1331 when
federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the substantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal
courts of their §1331 adjudicatory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md.
Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642. Accordingly,
the District Court retains §1331 jurisdiction over Mims’s complaint
unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federalcourt adjudication. See id., at 644. Pp. 7–10.
(b) Arrow’s arguments do not persuade this Court that Congress
eliminated §1331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions. Title 47
U. S. C. §227(b)(3)’s language may be state-court oriented, but “the
grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive,” United States v. Bank of New York &
Trust Co., 296 U. S. 463, 479. Nothing in §227(b)(3)’s permissive language makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports
to oust federal courts of their §1331 jurisdiction. The provision does
not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action “only” or
“exclusively” in state court. In contrast, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2)
(Supp. 2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction” over state-initiated TCPA
suits in the federal courts. Section 227(g)(2)’s exclusivity prescription
“reinforce[s] the conclusion that [47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)’s] silence . . .
leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched. For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.” Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at 644.
Arrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private
action “in an appropriate [state] court,” §227(b)(3), if it did not mean
to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have concurrent jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all. But, as
already noted, Congress had simultaneously made federal-court ju-
