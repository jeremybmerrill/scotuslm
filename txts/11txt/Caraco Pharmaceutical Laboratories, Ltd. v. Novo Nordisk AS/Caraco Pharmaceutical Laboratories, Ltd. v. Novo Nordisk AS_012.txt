Opinion of the Court

either—
“(aa) the drug for which the [brand’s NDA] was
approved; or
“(bb) an approved method of using the drug.” 21
U. S. C. §355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I).
The counterclaim thus enables a generic competitor to
obtain a judgment directing a brand to “correct or delete”
certain patent information that is blocking the FDA’s
approval of a generic product. This case raises the question whether the counterclaim is available to fix a brand’s
use code.
B
The parties to this case sell or seek to sell the diabetes
drug repaglinide. Respondents (collectively Novo) manufacture Prandin, the brand-name version of the drug. The
FDA has approved three uses of Prandin to treat diabetes: repaglinide by itself; repaglinide in combination with
metformin; and repaglinide in combination with thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Petitioners (collectively Caraco) wish
to market a generic version of the drug for two of those
uses.
Novo originally owned a patent for the repaglinide
compound, known as the ’035 patent, but it expired in
2009. In 2004, Novo also acquired a method-of-use patent
for the drug, called the ’358 patent, which does not expire
until 2018. That patent—the one at issue here—claims a
“method for treating [diabetes by] administering . . . repaglinide in combination with metformin.” 601 F. 3d 1359,
1362 (CA Fed. 2010). Thus, Novo currently holds a patent
for one of the three FDA-approved uses of repaglinide—its
use with metformin. But Novo holds no patent for the use
of repaglinide with TZDs or its use alone.
In 2005, Caraco filed an ANDA seeking to market a
generic version of repaglinide. At that time, the Orange
Book entry for Prandin listed both the ’035 patent (the
