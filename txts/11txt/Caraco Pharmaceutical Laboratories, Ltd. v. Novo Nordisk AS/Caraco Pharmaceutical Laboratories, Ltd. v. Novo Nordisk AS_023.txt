Opinion of the Court

unpatented methods of use. To fulfill that charge, the
FDA must determine whether any patent covers a particular method of use; and to do that, the agency (which views
itself as lacking expertise in patent matters, see supra, at
4–5, and n. 2) relies on the use codes submitted in the
regulatory process. See 68 Fed. Reg. 36682–36683. An
overbroad use code therefore throws a wrench into the
FDA’s ability to approve generic drugs as the statute contemplates. So it is not surprising that the language Congress used in the counterclaim provision sweeps widely

Another aspect of the counterclaim provision—its description of available remedies—dispatches whatever
remains of Novo’s arguments. According to the statute,
a successful claimant may obtain an order requiring
the brand to “correct or delete” its patent information.
§355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). Our interpretation of the statute gives
content to both those remedies: It deletes a listing from
the Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent
and corrects the listing when the brand has misdescribed
the patent’s scope. By contrast, Novo’s two arguments
would all but read the term “correct” out of the statute.
Consider first how Novo’s an-means-any contention
would accomplish that result. Recall that on Novo’s view,
a counterclaim can succeed only if the patent challenged
does not claim either the drug or any approved method of
using it. See supra, at 11. But when a generic manufacturer makes that showing, the remedy must be to “delete”
the listing; no correction would be enough. Novo agrees
with that proposition; “[a]t bottom,” Novo avers, “the
counterclaim is a delisting provision.” Brief for Respondents 20. But that raises the obvious question: Why did
Congress also include the term “correct” in the statute?
Novo can come up with just one answer: The counter-
