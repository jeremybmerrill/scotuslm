CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.
NOVO NORDISK A/S 

Opinion of the Court 


Tr. of Oral Arg. 54; but even without it, the company can
eventually get a judgment of non-infringement enabling
the FDA to approve its ANDA. In contrast, where (as
here) a brand files an overbroad use code, a generic company cannot use paragraph IV litigation to that end. A
paragraph IV certification (unlike a section viii statement)
requires the generic company to propose labeling identical
to the brand’s; it cannot carve out any uses. See supra, at
4. And that proposed label will necessarily infringe because it will include the use(s) on which the brand does
have a patent. So here, a paragraph IV suit cannot lead to
a judgment enabling FDA approval; the counterclaim
offers the only route to bring the generic drug to market
for non-infringing uses. Novo’s view eliminates the counterclaim where it has the greatest value.
IV
The statutory counterclaim we have considered enables
courts to resolve patent disputes so that the FDA can
fulfill its statutory duty to approve generic drugs that do
not infringe patent rights. The text and context of the
provision demonstrate that a generic company can employ
the counterclaim to challenge a brand’s overbroad use
code. We accordingly hold that Caraco may bring a counterclaim seeking to “correct” Novo’s use code “on the
ground that” the ’358 patent “does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug”—indeed, does not claim
two.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
