CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.
NOVO NORDISK A/S
Opinion of the Court

were exploiting this statutory scheme to prevent or delay
the marketing of generic drugs, and the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) soon issued a study detailing these
anticompetitive practices. See FTC, Generic Drug Entry
Prior to Patent Expiration: An FTC Study, pp. iii–vi (July
2002) (hereinafter FTC Study). That report focused attention on brands’ submission of inaccurate patent information to the FDA. In one case cited by the FTC, Mylan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson, 268 F. 3d 1323 (CA
Fed. 2001), a brand whose original patent on a drug was
set to expire listed a new patent ostensibly extending its
rights over the drug, but in fact covering neither the compound nor any method of using it. The FDA, as was (and
is) its wont, accepted the listing at its word and accordingly declined to approve a generic product. The generic
manufacturer sued to delete the improper listing from the
Orange Book, but the Federal Circuit held that the HatchWaxman Amendments did not allow such a right of action.
See id., at 1330–1333. As the FTC noted, that ruling
meant that the only option for generic manufacturers in
Mylan’s situation was to file a paragraph IV certification
(triggering an infringement suit) and then wait out the
usual 30-month period before the FDA could approve an
ANDA. See FTC Study 40–45.
Congress responded to these abuses by creating a mechanism, in the form of a legal counterclaim, for generic
manufacturers to challenge patent information a brand
has submitted to the FDA. See Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, 117
Stat. 2452. The provision authorizes an ANDA applicant
sued for patent infringement to
“assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the
[brand] to correct or delete the patent information
submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) [of
§355] on the ground that the patent does not claim
