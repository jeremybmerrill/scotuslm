assumption of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments is that
the courts are the appropriate mechanism for the resolution of disputes about the scope and validity of patents”).2
Thus, whether section viii is available to a generic manufacturer depends on how the brand describes its patent.
Only if the use code provides sufficient space for the generic’s proposed label will the FDA approve an ANDA with a
section viii statement.
The generic manufacturer’s second option is to file a socalled paragraph IV certification, which states that a
listed patent “is invalid or will not be infringed by the
manufacture, use, or sale of the [generic] drug.” 21
U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). A generic manufacturer will
typically take this path in either of two situations: if it
wants to market the drug for all uses, rather than carving
out those still allegedly under patent; or if it discovers, as
described above, that any carve-out label it is willing to
adopt cannot avoid the brand’s use code. Filing a paragraph IV certification means provoking litigation. The
patent statute treats such a filing as itself an act of infringement, which gives the brand an immediate right to
sue. See 35 U. S. C. §271(e)(2)(A). Assuming the brand
does so, the FDA generally may not approve the ANDA
until 30 months pass or the court finds the patent invalid
or not infringed. See 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(5)(B)(iii). Accordingly, the paragraph IV process is likely to keep the generic drug off the market for a lengthy period, but may
eventually enable the generic company to market its drug
for all approved uses.
In the late 1990’s, evidence mounted that some brands

courts have affirmed the FDA’s view of its ministerial role.
See, e.g., Apotex, Inc. v. Thompson, 347 F. 3d 1335, 1349 (CA Fed.
2003); aaaiPharma v. Thompson, 296 F. 3d 227, 242–243 (CA4 2002).
That question is not before us, and we express no view on it.
