SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

on which brand manufacturers submit use codes requires
“information on the indication or method of use for the
Orange Book ‘Use Code’ description.” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 213; see also ibid. (explaining brand manufacturers
should “[s]ubmit the description of the approved indication
or method of use that you propose FDA include as the ‘Use
Code’ in the Orange Book”). Those sources at the least
suggest (as Novo thought) that a method of use here is
distinct from an indication and that either suffices as a
use code.
Prior to enactment of the counterclaim provision, Congress considered a bill that required brand manufacturers
to submit a “description of the approved use covered by the
[patent] claim,” and that allowed a generic manufacturer
to bring a civil action to correct that information. See
ante, at 20. Congress rejected the bill, in part over criticism that it would encourage excess litigation.* Absent
greater clarity from FDA concerning what is required of
brand manufacturers in use codes, Congress’ fears of undue litigation may be realized.
