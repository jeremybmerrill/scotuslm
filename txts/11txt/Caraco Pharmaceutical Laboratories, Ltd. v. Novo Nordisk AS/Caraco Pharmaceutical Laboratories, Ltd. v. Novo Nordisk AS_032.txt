SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

produces or markets the generic drug.” Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 6 (hereinafter United States
Brief). But the generic manufacturer, having been forced
to proceed with a paragraph IV certification, will have secured approval to market a drug with a label materially
identical to the brand manufacturer’s. That is not a position I imagine a generic manufacturer wants to be in: As
the Solicitor General’s Office informed us at argument,
“[i]t would be inducement of infringement to sell a product
with labeling that suggests that the product be used for
a patented method of use.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 24; see also
United States Brief 32 (noting that in this situation, if
a generic manufacturer proceeded with a paragraph IV
certification, “[s]o long as the [new drug application
(NDA)] holder’s patent covers some approved method of
using the approved drug, the proposed labeling will be
infringing”).
In short, the counterclaim cannot restore the smooth
working of a statutory scheme thrown off kilter by an
overly broad use code. At best, it permits the generic
manufacturer to do what the scheme contemplates it
should do—file an ANDA with a section viii statement—
but only after expensive and time-consuming litigation. A
fix is in order, but it must come from Congress or FDA.

Precisely because the regulatory scheme depends on the
accuracy and precision of use codes, I find FDA’s guidance
as to what is required of brand manufacturers in use codes
remarkably opaque. The relevant regulation states simply
that a brand manufacturer must provide “[t]he description
of the patented method of use as required for publication.”
21 CFR §314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3). The form on which brand
manufacturers submit that information provides some
additional detail, explaining that “[e]ach approved use
claimed by the patent should be separately identified . . .
