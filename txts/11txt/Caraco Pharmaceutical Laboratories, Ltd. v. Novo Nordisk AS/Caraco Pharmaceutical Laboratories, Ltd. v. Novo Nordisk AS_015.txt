CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.
NOVO NORDISK A/S
Opinion of the Court

1366–1367. Judge Dyk dissented. He would have read
the phrase “the patent does not claim . . . an approved
method of using the drug” to include situations where, as
here, the use code wrongly indicates that the patent covers
one or more particular approved methods of use. See id.,
at 1376–1378. And he would have construed “patent information submitted . . . under subsection (b) or (c)” to

must decide when a “patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using” a drug. Second, we must determine the content of “patent information submitted . . .
under subsection (b) or (c)” of §355. We consider both of
those questions against the backdrop of yet a third statutory phrase, providing that the remedy for a prevailing
counterclaimant is an order requiring the brand “to correct
or delete” that patent information. And we consider each
question in the context of the entire statute. See Robinson
v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997) (Statutory interpretation focuses on “the language itself, the specific
context in which that language is used, and the broader
context of the statute as a whole”). We cannot say that the
counterclaim clause is altogether free of ambiguity. But
when we consider statutory text and context together, we
conclude that a generic manufacturer in Caraco’s position

remand from the Federal Circuit’s decision, the District Court
determined that the ’358 patent was invalid and unenforceable. See
775 F. Supp. 2d 985 (ED Mich. 2011). The Federal Circuit stayed
Novo’s appeal from that judgment pending the decision here.
