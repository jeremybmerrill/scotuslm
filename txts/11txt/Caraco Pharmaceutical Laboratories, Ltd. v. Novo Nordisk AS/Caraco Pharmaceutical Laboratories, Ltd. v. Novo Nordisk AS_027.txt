CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.
NOVO NORDISK A/S 

Opinion of the Court 


had no need to duplicate its list of mandated filings. So
the drafting history does not support Novo’s conclusion. If
anything, the statute’s evolution indicates that Congress
determined to enforce the FDA’s new listing provisions,
including its use-code requirement, through the new
counterclaim.
B
Novo next argues that Congress established the counterclaim only to solve the problem raised by the Federal
Circuit’s decision in Mylan, 268 F. 3d 1323—the impossibility of deleting an improperly listed patent from the
Orange Book. In Mylan, as earlier described, a generic
company alleged that a brand had listed a patent that
covered neither the approved drug nor any method of
using it, and brought an action seeking delisting. See
supra, at 6. The Federal Circuit held that no such action
was available, even assuming the allegation was true.
Because several legislators saw Mylan as “exemplif[ying]”
brands’ “perceived abuse” of the FDA’s patent listing practices, Brief for Respondents 35, Novo contends that we
should construe the counterclaim provision to aid only a
generic company that “finds itself in the same position as
Mylan was in Mylan,” Supp. Brief in Opposition 5–6.
Once again, we think not. Maybe Mylan triggered the
legislative effort to enact a counterclaim, or maybe it
didn’t: By the time Congress acted, it also had at hand an
FTC study broadly criticizing brands’ patent listings and
an FDA rule designed to address the very same issue. See
supra, at 6, 21. But even assuming Mylan “prompted the
proposal” of the counterclaim, “whether that alone accounted for its enactment is quite a different question.”
Eli Lilly, 496 U. S., at 670, n. 3 (emphasis deleted). Here,
we think Mylan alerted Congress to a broader problem—
that generic companies generally had no avenue to challenge the accuracy of brands’ patent listings, and that the
