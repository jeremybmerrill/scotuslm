CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.
NOVO NORDISK A/S 

Opinion of the Court 


ground that the patent does not claim . . . an approved
method of using the drug.” 117 Stat. 2452, 21 U. S. C.
§355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). We hold that a generic manufacturer
may employ this provision to force correction of a use code
that inaccurately describes the brand’s patent as covering
a particular method of using the drug in question.

A

The FDA regulates the manufacture, sale, and labeling
of prescription drugs under a complex statutory scheme.
To begin at the beginning: When a brand manufacturer
wishes to market a novel drug, it must submit a new drug
application (NDA) to the FDA for approval. The NDA
must include, among other things, a statement of the
drug’s components, scientific data showing that the drug
is safe and effective, and proposed labeling describing
the uses for which the drug may be marketed. See
§§355(b)(1), (d). The FDA may approve a brand-name
drug for multiple methods of use—either to treat different
conditions or to treat the same condition in different ways.
Once the FDA has approved a brand manufacturer’s
drug, another company may seek permission to market
a generic version pursuant to legislation known as the
Hatch-Waxman Amendments. See Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, 98 Stat.
1585. Those amendments allow a generic competitor to
file an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) piggybacking on the brand’s NDA. Rather than providing
independent evidence of safety and efficacy, the typical
ANDA shows that the generic drug has the same active
ingredients as, and is biologically equivalent to, the brandname drug. See §§355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iv). As we have previously recognized, this process is designed to speed the
introduction of low-cost generic drugs to market. See Eli
Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 676 (1990).
