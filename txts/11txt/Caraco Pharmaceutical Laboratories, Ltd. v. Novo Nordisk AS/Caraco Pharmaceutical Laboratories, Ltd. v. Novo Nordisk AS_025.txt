CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.
NOVO NORDISK A/S
Opinion of the Court

claim would be useless: It authorizes a remedy only “on
the ground that” the listed patent does not claim the drug
or an approved method of using it—and notwithstanding
the wrong expiration date, this patent does so. Alternatively, suppose the brand lists a patent as having a 2018
expiration date when in fact the patent has already
lapsed. Then, a generic manufacturer could bring a counterclaim alleging that the patent no longer claims the
drug or a method of using it—but the appropriate remedy
would be deletion, not correction, of the brand’s listing.
Novo’s reading of “patent information,” like its reading of
“not an,” effectively deletes the term “correct” from the
statute.

Novo finally advances two arguments relating to the
counterclaim’s drafting history. Neither contention, however, overcomes the statutory text and context. Indeed,
consideration of the provision’s background only strengthens our view of its meaning.
A
Novo first contends that our interpretation of the statute “effectively resurrect[s] the scheme rejected by Congress.” Brief for Respondents 44 (quoting Smith v. United
States, 507 U. S. 197, 203, n. 4 (1993)). In 2002, Novo
notes, Congress failed to pass a bill that would have required brands to file specified “patent information,” including, for method-of-use patents, a description of “the
approved use covered by the [patent] claim.” S. 812, 107th
Cong., 2d Sess., §103(a)(1), p. 7 (engrossed bill). That bill
would have allowed a generic company to bring its own
civil action—not merely a counterclaim in ongoing litigation—to “delete” or “correct” the information filed. Id.,
at 8. The Senate approved the bill, but the House of Representatives took no action on it. Novo argues that because
