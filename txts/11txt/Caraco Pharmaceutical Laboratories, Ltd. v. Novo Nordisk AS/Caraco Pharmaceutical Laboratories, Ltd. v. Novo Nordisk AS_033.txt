CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.

NOVO NORDISK A/S 

SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring


and contain adequate information to assist . . . applicants
in determining whether a listed method of use patent
claims a use for which the . . . applicant is not seeking
approval.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 214a. But it also provides
that brand manufacturers may “us[e] no more than 240
total characters including spaces,” id., at 213a, and elsewhere FDA acknowledges “that in some cases 240 characters may not fully describe the use as claimed in the patent.” 68 Fed. Reg. 36683 (2003); see also ibid. (indicating
for this reason that use codes “are not meant to substitute
for the applicant’s review of the patent”).
Indeed, in some respects we are here today because
of FDA’s opacity in describing what is required of brand
manufacturers. In its initial NDA filing, Novo submitted
a use code for the ’358 patent that was not “overly broad”:
It described narrowly the single patented method of use.
App. 54–55, 99. Some years later FDA required that Novo
amend its label to “[r]eplace all the separate indications”
“with the following sentence: ‘Prandin is indicated as an
adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in
adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.’ ” Id., at 163–164,
215. Novo then amended its use code to track the new
label, id., at 482–486, explaining that the amendment
“correspond[ed] with the change in labeling required by
FDA,” id., at 483. Novo understood its amended use code
to comply with FDA regulations, likely on the ground it
pressed before us: that the regulations permit a brand
manufacturer to submit for publication in the Orange
Book a description of either the patented method of use or
the indication (which refers to “what a drug does,” ante,
at 15, n. 7). Brief for Respondents 10, 22, 48–50.
For the reasons explained by the Court, see ante, at 15,
n. 7, Novo is mistaken. But the company can hardly be
faulted for so thinking. The regulations also require submission of “a description of each approved method of use
or indication,” 21 CFR §314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1), and the form
