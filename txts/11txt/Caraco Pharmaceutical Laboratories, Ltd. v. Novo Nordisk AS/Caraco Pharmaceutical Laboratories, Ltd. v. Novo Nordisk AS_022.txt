§271(e)(1). We noted there that submitting information
“under a Federal law” suggests doing so “in furtherance of
or compliance with a comprehensive scheme of regulation.” 496 U. S., at 667. Likewise, in Ardestani v. INS,
502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991), we held that a regulatory proceeding “under section 554,” 5 U. S. C. §504(b)(1)(C)(i),

Once again, that congressional choice fits the broader
statutory context. Use codes are pivotal to the FDA’s
implementation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments—and
no less so because a regulation, rather than the statute
itself, requires their submission.
Recall that those
Amendments instruct the FDA (assuming other requirements are met) to approve an ANDA filed with a section
