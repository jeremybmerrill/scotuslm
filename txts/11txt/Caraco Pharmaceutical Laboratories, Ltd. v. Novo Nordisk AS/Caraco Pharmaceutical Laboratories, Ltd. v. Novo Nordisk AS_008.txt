Opinion of the Court

Because the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that
would infringe a patent, the timing of an ANDA’s approval
depends on the scope and duration of the patents covering the brand-name drug. Those patents come in different
varieties. One type protects the drug compound itself.
Another kind—the one at issue here—gives the brand
manufacturer exclusive rights over a particular method of
using the drug. In some circumstances, a brand manufacturer may hold such a method-of-use patent even after its
patent on the drug compound has expired.
To facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as
patents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and FDA
regulations direct brand manufacturers to file information
about their patents. The statute mandates that a brand
submit in its NDA “the patent number and the expiration
date of any patent which claims the drug for which the
[brand] submitted the [NDA] or which claims a method of
using such drug.” §§355(b)(1). And the regulations issued
under that statute require that, once an NDA is approved,
the brand provide a description of any method-of-use
patent it holds. See 21 CFR §§314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e)
(2011). That description is known as a use code, and the
brand submits it on FDA Form 3542. As later discussed,
the FDA does not attempt to verify the accuracy of the
use codes that brand manufacturers supply. It simply publishes the codes, along with the corresponding patent
numbers and expiration dates, in a fat, brightly hued
volume called the Orange Book (less colorfully but more
officially denominated Approved Drug Products with
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations).
After consulting the Orange Book, a company filing an
ANDA must assure the FDA that its proposed generic
drug will not infringe the brand’s patents. When no patents are listed in the Orange Book or all listed patents
have expired (or will expire prior to the ANDA’s approval),
the generic manufacturer simply certifies to that effect.
