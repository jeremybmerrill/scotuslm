Opinion of the Court

this failed legislation would have allowed a generic company to challenge overbroad descriptions of a patent, we
cannot read the statute Congress eventually enacted as
doing so.
We disagree. We see no reason to assume, as Novo does,
that Congress rejected S. 812 because it required brands
to submit patent information beyond a number and expiration date. Indeed, Novo’s argument highlights the perils
of relying on the fate of prior bills to divine the meaning of
enacted legislation. “A bill can be proposed for any number of reasons, and it can be rejected for just as many
others.” Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v.
Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 170 (2001)). S.
812 contained numerous items, including a title on importing prescription drugs (no controversy there!), that may
have caused its failure. See S. 812, Tit. II. Moreover,
what criticism there was of the bill’s mechanism for challenging brands’ patent claims focused not on the specification of “patent information,” but instead on the creation of
an independent cause of action—stronger medicine than
the counterclaim Congress ultimately adopted.8 And
finally, Novo ignores a likely cause for the redrafting of
the provision on submitting information. Between S. 812’s
demise and the counterclaim’s enactment, the FDA issued
a rule requiring brands to supply material concerning
method-of-use patents, including use codes. The drafters
of the counterclaim provision knew about that rule,9 and

critical complement to the work FDA has done in clarifying its regulations on patent listing, but it goes much further”).
