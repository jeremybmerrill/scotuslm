CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.
NOVO NORDISK A/S
Opinion of the Court

drug compound) and the ’358 patent (the use of the drug
with metformin). Caraco assured the FDA that it would
not market its generic drug until the ’035 patent expired,
thus making that patent irrelevant to the FDA’s review of
the ANDA. Caraco filed a paragraph IV certification for
the remaining, ’358 patent, stating that it was “invalid or
[would] not be infringed.” §355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV); see supra,
at 5. In accord with the patent statute, Novo treated this
filing as an act of infringement and brought suit.
When Caraco filed its ANDA, Novo’s use code for the
’358 patent represented that the patent covered “ ‘[u]se of
repaglinide in combination with metformin to lower blood
glucose.’ ” 601 F. 3d, at 1362–1363. The FDA therefore
advised Caraco that if it did not seek to market repaglinide for use with metformin, it could submit a section
viii statement. That would allow Caraco, assuming its
ANDA was otherwise in order, to market its generic drug
for the other two uses. Caraco took the FDA’s cue and in
2008 submitted a section viii statement, with proposed
labeling carving out Novo’s patented metformin therapy.
See App. 166–176.
Before the FDA took further action, however, Novo
changed its use code for the ’358 patent. The new use code
describes “ ‘[a] method for improving glycemic control in
adults with type 2 diabetes.’ ”3 601 F. 3d, at 1363. Because that code indicates that the ’358 patent protects all
three approved methods of using repaglinide to treat
diabetes, Caraco’s proposed carve-out of metformin therapy was no longer sufficient; even with that exclusion,
——————
3 Novo asserts that it made the change so that its use code would
mirror its label, which the FDA had just asked it to alter. See Brief for
Respondents 14. But the FDA, in calling for new labeling, neither
requested nor required Novo to amend its use code. And indeed, Novo’s
counsel conceded before the Federal Circuit that Novo modified its use
code in part as “ ‘a response to the [FDA’s] section viii’ ” suggestion. 601
F. 3d, at 1380–1381.
