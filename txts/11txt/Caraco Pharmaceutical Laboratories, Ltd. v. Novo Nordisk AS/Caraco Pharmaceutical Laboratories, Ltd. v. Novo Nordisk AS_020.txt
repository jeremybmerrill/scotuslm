Opinion of the Court

assertion of a claim . . . in any [other] civil action”). So
if we needed any proof that Congress knew how to say
“not any” when it meant “not any,” here we find it. We think
that sees, raises, and bests Novo’s argument.
Our more essential point, though, has less gamesmanship about it: We think that the “not any” construction
does not appear in the relevant counterclaim provision
because Congress did not mean what Novo wishes it had.
And we think that is so because Congress meant (as it
usually does) for the provision it enacted to fit within
the statutory scheme—here, by facilitating the approval of
non-infringing generic drugs under section viii.

Novo contends that Caraco’s counterclaim must fail for
another, independent reason: On its view (as on the Federal Circuit’s), the counterclaim does not provide a way to
correct use codes because they are not “patent information
submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)” of
§355. Once again, we disagree.
The statute does not define “patent information,” but
a use code must qualify. It describes the method of use
claimed in a patent. See 21 CFR §§314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3),
(e). That fits under any ordinary understanding of the
language.7

7 Novo’s only counter is to redefine a use code. Novo argues that a use
code need not be tied to the patent at all—that “[t]he relevant regulation requires [NDA] applicants to provide [only] ‘a description of each
approved method of use or indication.’ ” Brief for Respondents 48
(quoting 21 CFR §314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1)). Because an “indication” refers
generally to what a drug does (here, treat diabetes), see §201.57(c)(2),
Novo claims that a use code may sweep more broadly than the patent.
But that is incorrect. First, Novo does not cite the regulations that
specify the information required for publication—i.e., use codes. See
§314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3) (requiring a “description of the patented method
of use as required for publication”); §314.53(e) (“[F]or each use patent,”
FDA will publish “the approved indications or other conditions of use
