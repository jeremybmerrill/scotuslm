Opinion of the Court

Congress for special responsibilities.9 See H. R. Rep., at
277 (even “[i]f the estate is not a separate taxable entity,”
administrative responsibility can “var[y] according to the
nature of the debtor”). Although estates of corporate
debtors are not separate taxable entities under 26 U. S. C.
§§1398 and 1399, the IRC requires a trustee that “has
possession of or holds title to all or substantially all the
property or business of a corporation” to “make the return
of income for such corporation.” §6012(b)(3). In effect,
Congress provided that the trustee in a corporate-debtor
case may shoulder responsibility that parallels that borne
by the trustee of a separate taxable entity. In any event,
petitioners do not deny that neither the separate taxable
entity provisions nor the special provisions for corporate
debtors apply to them.
Finally, petitioners and the dissent contend that the
purpose of 11 U. S. C. §1222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debt­
ors with robust relief from tax debts, relying on state­
ments by a single Senator on unenacted bills introduced in
years preceding the enactment. See Brief for Petitioners
23–36. They argue that deeming §1222(a)(2)(A) inapplica­
ble to their postpetition income taxes would undermine
that purpose and confine the exception to prepetition
taxes. But we need not resolve here what other claims, if
any, are covered by §1222(a)(2)(A).10 Whatever the 2005

9 The original §346 established that the estate of a corporate debtor
is not a separate taxable entity, but nonetheless provided that “the
trustee shall make any [State or local] tax return otherwise required
. . . to be filed by or on behalf of such . . . corporation.” §§346(c)(1)–(2),
92 Stat. 2565, 2566. The current §346 similarly states, in the same
provision deeming the debtor taxable when there is no separate taxable
estate, that “[t]he trustee shall make such tax returns of income of
corporations . . . . The estate shall be liable for any [State or local] tax
imposed on such corporation.” §346(b).
10 The dissent opines that employment taxes must be administrative
expenses “incurred by the estate” because, in its view, they “do not
fit easily” within the category of administrative expenses under
