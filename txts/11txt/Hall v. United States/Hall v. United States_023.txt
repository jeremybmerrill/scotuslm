ity creditors while leaving enough funds over to guarantee
unsecured creditors the minimum amounts that Chapter
12 requires. If so, the farmer may not be able to proceed
under Chapter 12. See §§1225(a)(1), (6) (bankruptcy court
will not confirm Plan unless it satisfies statutory criteria
and debtor will be able to make good on his commitments
under the Plan).
It is also important to understand that the same kind of
insufficient-assets-and-income problem might occur where
the debtor owes the Government a large post-petition tax
debt. In general, postpetition claims are not part of the
bankruptcy proceedings. See 7 Norton Bankruptcy Law
and Practice §135:14 (3d ed. 2011) (hereinafter Norton).
Unless the Government’s debt falls within an exception to
this general rule, bankruptcy law would leave the Government to collect its postpetition claim outside of bankruptcy as best it could. Again, the result will be to leave
the farmer with fewer assets and income to devote to his
Chapter 12 Plan—perhaps to the point where he cannot
proceed under Chapter 12 at all.

With this general summary in mind, it is easier to understand the significance of the question this case presents. The question arises out of an amendment to a

payments, of all claims entitled to priority under section 507, unless—

unit that arises as a result of the sale, transfer, exchange, or other disposition of any farm asset used in
the debtor’s farming operation, in which case the
