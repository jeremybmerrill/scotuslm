ers or fishermen) to reorganize their debts in much the
same way as does Chapter 12. And there is authority
holding that taxes on income earned between the time the
Chapter 13 debtor files for bankruptcy and the time the
bankruptcy Plan is confirmed are not “tax[es] incurred
by the estate.” See In re Whall, 391 B. R. 1, 5–6 (Bkrtcy.
Ct. Mass. 2008); In re Brown, No. 05–41071, 2006 WL
3370867, *3 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mass. 2006); In re Jagours, 236
B. R. 616, 620, n. 4 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tex. 1999); In re
Gyulafia, 65 B. R. 913, 916 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 1986). Why,
asks the majority, should the law treat Chapter 12 taxes
differently?
For one thing, the issue is less important in a Chapter
13 case, for the relevant time period—between filing and
Plan confirmation—is typically very short. Compare H. R.
Rep. No. 95–595, at 276 (“most chapter 13 estates will only
remain open for 1 or 2 months until confirmation of the
plan”), with Brief for Neil E. Harl et al. as Amici Curiae
32–33 (survey of Chapter 12 bankruptcies found the average time from filing to confirmation in a district ranged
from nearly five months to over three years). See also 7
Norton §122:14, at 122–27 (“In Chapter 13, the plan must
be filed within 15 days after the filing of the petition,
unless the time is extended for cause. A Chapter 12 Plan
must be filed no later than 90 days after the order for
relief, unless the court finds that an extension is substantially justified” (footnote omitted)).
For another, the issue arises differently in a Chapter 13
case. That chapter, unlike Chapter 12, contains a special
provision that permits the Government to seek §507 priority treatment of all taxes incurred while the bankruptcy
case is pending. §1305 (Government can file proof of claim
to have postpetition taxes treated as if they had arisen
before the petition was filed).
Finally, if uniformity of interpretation between these
two chapters is critical, I do not see the serious harm in
