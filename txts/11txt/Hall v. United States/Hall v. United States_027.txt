BREYER, J., dissenting

Therein lies the problem. These results are the very
opposite of what Congress intended. Congress did not
want to relegate to ordinary-unsecured-claim status only
prepetition tax claims, i.e., tax claims that accrued well
before the Chapter 12 proceedings began. Rather, Congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of
collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and
were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. See 145 Cong. Rec. 1113 (the Amendment will
have the effect of “reducing the priority of taxes during
proceedings” (emphasis added) (statement of Sen. Grassley
during a failed attempt to enact the Amendment)); Hearing on the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001 before the
Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 107th Cong., 1st

(emphasis added)). The majority does not deny the importance of Congress’ objective. Rather, it feels compelled
to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong
place.

Code language can be and is better interpreted in a way
that would give full effect to the Amendment. In particular, the relevant language is better interpreted so that in

It is common ground that subsection (a)(2) of §507 covers, and gives §507 priority to, “administrative expenses
allowed under section 503(b).” §507(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp.
IV). It is also common ground that the relevant definitional section, namely §503(b), defines allowed “adminis-
