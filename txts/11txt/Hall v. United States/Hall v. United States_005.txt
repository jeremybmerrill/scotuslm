HALL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Chapter 12 debtors similarly file a plan of reorganization.
§1221. To be confirmed, the plan must provide for the full
payment of priority claims. §1222(a)(2).
In the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), §1003, 119 Stat. 186,
Congress created an exception to that requirement:
“Contents of plan
“(a) The plan shall—

“(2) provide for the full payment, in deferred cash
payments, of all claims entitled to priority under sec­

Under §1222(a)(2)(A), certain governmental claims result­

of their priority status.
That exception, however, applies only to claims in the
plan that are “entitled to priority under section 507” in the
first place. Section 507 lists 10 categories of such claims.
Two pertain to taxes: One category, §507(a)(8), covers
prepetition taxes, and is inapplicable in this case. The
other, §507(a)(2), covers “administrative expenses allowed
under section 503(b),” which in turn includes “any tax . . .
incurred by the estate.” §503(b)(B)(i). Thus, for postpeti­
