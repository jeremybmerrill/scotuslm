HALL v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

2
The majority, following the Government’s suggestion,
interprets the relevant language in a way that denies the
Amendment its intended effect. It holds that the only
income tax claims to which §507 accords priority are
claims for taxes due for years prior to the taxable year in
which the farmer filed for bankruptcy. (We shall call
these “prepetition tax claims.”) In the majority’s view,
§507 does not cover income tax liabilities that arise during
the year of filing or during the Chapter 12 proceedings.
(We shall call these “postpetition tax claims.”) Ante, at 4–
5; see Brief for United States 8 (the Amendment “provides
farmers relief from [only] those tax claims that are otherwise entitled to priority under 11 U. S. C. 507(a)(8), namely
pre-petition claims arising from the sale of farm assets”); Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, §705(1)(A), 119 Stat. 126 (amending
§507(a)(8) to clarify that it only covers income tax claims
for taxable years that end on or before the date of the
filing of the bankruptcy petition).
The majority then observes that the Amendment creates
an exception only in respect to §507 priority claims.
§1222(a) (“The plan shall . . . provide for the full payment
. . . of all claims entitled to priority under section 507,
unless . . . .” (Emphasis added.)). Ante, at 2. Thus, if
(without the Amendment) §507 would not cover postpetition capital gains taxes in the first place, the Amendment
(creating only a §507 exception) cannot affect postpetition tax claims. An exception from nothing amounts to
nothing.
Consequently, the majority concludes that postpetition
tax claims fall outside the bankruptcy proceeding entirely;
the tax authorities can collect them as if they were ordinary tax debts; and the Government’s efforts to collect
them can lead to the very results (blocking the use of
Chapter 12) that the Amendment sought to avoid.
