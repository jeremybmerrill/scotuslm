HALL v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

treating the relevant taxes as “administrative expenses”
in both Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases rather than in
neither. The majority apparently believes that this would
render §1305 (the provision permitting the Government to
seek §507 priority treatment) superfluous. Ante, at 10–12.
But that is not so. This interpretation would simply limit
the scope of operation of §1305 to the period of time after
the Chapter 13 Plan is confirmed but while the Chapter 13
case is still pending. And that is likely to be a significant
period of time relative to the preconfirmation period. See
H. R. Rep. No. 95–595, at 276 (“[M]ost chapter 13 estates
will only remain open for 1 or 2 months until confirmation
of the plan”); §§1325(b)(1), (4) (debtor must commit all his
projected disposable income over a 3-year period (sometimes extended to five) to the Plan, unless all unsecured
claims can be paid off over a shorter period). The greatest
Chapter 13 harm this interpretation could cause is to require the Government to pursue those tax liabilities as
§507 priority administrative expense claims (rather than
allow it to choose between §507 priority treatment and
pursuing those claims outside bankruptcy) during the
relatively brief period of time between the filing of a petition and the Plan’s confirmation.
In sum, I would treat a postpetition/preconfirmation tax
liability as a tax “incurred by the estate,” hence as an
“administrative expense,” hence as a “clai[m] entitled to
priority under section 507, unless . . . ,” hence as a claim
falling within the scope of the Amendment. Doing so
would allow the Amendment to take effect as Congress
intended.
III
The Government argues that, even if tax liabilities
arising during the bankruptcy proceedings are “administrative expenses,” they still do not fall within the Amendment’s scope. It says that neither the Amendment nor
