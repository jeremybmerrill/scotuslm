HALL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court 


B

Our reading of “incurred by the estate” as informed by
the IRC’s separate taxable entity rules draws support
from a related provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11
U. S. C. §346, and its longstanding interplay with 26
U. S. C. §§1398 and 1399. That relationship illustrates
that from the inception of the current Bankruptcy Code,
Congress has specified on a chapter-by-chapter basis
which estates are separately taxable and therefore liable
for taxes. That relationship also refutes the dissent’s
suggestion that applying such rules is an incongruous
importation of “tax law” unconnected to “bankruptcy
principles (as Congress understood them).” Post, at 8–9
(opinion of BREYER, J.). And it reinforces the reasonableness of our view that whether an estate “incurs”
taxes under §503(b) turns on such chapter-by-chapter
distinctions.
In the original Bankruptcy Code, Congress included a
provision, §346, that set out a chapter-specific division of
tax liabilities between the estate and the debtor. Bank­
ruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2565. Section
346(b)(1) provided that in an individual-debtor Chapter 7
or 11 bankruptcy, “any income of the estate may be taxed
under a State or local law imposing a tax . . . only to the
estate, and may not be taxed to such individual.” 92 Stat.
2565 (emphasis added); see also 11 Collier on Bankruptcy
¶TX12.03[5][b][i], p. TX12–21 (16th ed. 2011) (hereinafter
Collier) (§346(b) “provided that in a case under chapter 7
[or] 11 . . . the estate of an individual is a taxable entity”).
Section 346(d) provided, meanwhile, that in a Chapter 13
bankruptcy, “any income of the estate or the debtor may
be taxed under a State or local law imposing a tax . . . only
to the debtor, and may not be taxed to the estate.” 92 Stat.
2566 (emphasis added). Congress thus established that
the estate in an individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bank­
ruptcy is a separate taxable entity; the estate in a Chapter
