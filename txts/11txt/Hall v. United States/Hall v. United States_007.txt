HALL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

peals held that “the operative language simply failed to
make its way into the statute.” Id., at 1167. The Court of
Appeals concluded that because the taxes do not qualify
under §503(b), they are not priority claims in the plan
eligible for the §1222(a)(2)(A) exception.
Judge Paez dissented, siding with a sister Circuit
that had concluded that Congress intended §1222(a)(2)(A)
to extend to such postpetition federal income taxes. We
granted certiorari to resolve the split of authority.1 564
U. S. ___ (2011).

A

Our resolution of this case turns on the meaning of a
phrase in §503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code: “incurred by
the estate.” The parties agree that §1222(a)(2)(A) applies
only to priority claims collectible in the bankruptcy plan
and that postpetition federal income taxes so qualify only
if they constitute a “tax . . . incurred by the estate.”
§503(b)(B)(i).
The phrase “incurred by the estate” bears a plain and
natural reading. See FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___
(2011) (slip op., at 5) (“When a statute does not define a
term, we typically ‘give the phrase its ordinary meaning’ ”).
To “incur,” one must “suffer or bring on oneself (a liability
or expense).” Black’s Law Dictionary 836 (9th ed. 2009);
see also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary
1146 (1976) (“to . . . become liable or subject to: bring down
upon oneself ”); Random House Dictionary 722 (1966) (“to
become liable or subject to through one’s own action; bring
upon oneself ”). A tax “incurred by the estate” is a tax for
which the estate itself is liable.
