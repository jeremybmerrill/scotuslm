Opinion of the Court

priority, much less alter the underlying division of tax
liability between the estate and the debtor in Chapter 12
cases. “We assume that Congress is aware of existing law
when it passes legislation,” Miles v. Apex Marine Corp.,
498 U. S. 19, 32 (1990), and the existing law at the enact­
ment of §1222(a)(2)(A) indicated that an estate’s liability
for taxes turned on chapter-by-chapter separate taxable
entity rules.

The statutory structure further reinforces our holding
that petitioners’ postpetition income taxes are not “in­
curred by the estate.” As a leading bankruptcy treatise
and lower courts recognize, “[b]ecause chapter 12 was
modeled on chapter 13, and because so many of the provi­
sions are identical, chapter 13 cases construing provisions
corresponding to chapter 12 provisions may be relied on as
authority in chapter 12 cases.” 8 Collier ¶1200.01[5], at
1200–10; In re Lopez, 372 B. R. 40, 45, n. 13 (Bkrtcy. App.
Panel CA9 2007); Justice v. Valley Nat. Bank, 849 F. 2d
1078, 1083 (CA8 1988). We agree. Section 1322(a)(2), like
§1222(a)(2), requires full payment of “all claims entitled to
priority under section 507” under the plan. Both provi­
sions cross-reference the same section of the Code, §507,
and in turn, the same subsection, §503(b). Both are treat­
ed alike by IRC §§1398 and 1399. Whether postpetition
taxes qualify under §503(b) in Chapter 13 thus sheds light
on whether they so qualify in petitioners’ Chapter 12 case.
Bankruptcy courts and commentators have reasoned
that postpetition income taxes are not “incurred by the
estate” under §503(b) because “a tax on postpetition in­
come of the debtor or of the chapter 13 estate is not a
liability of the chapter 13 estate; it is a liability of the
debtor alone.” 8 Collier ¶1305.02[1], at 1305–5 and 1305–
