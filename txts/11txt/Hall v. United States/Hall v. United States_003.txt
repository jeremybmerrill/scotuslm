Syllabus
Nor does the text support deeming a tax “incurred by the estate”
whenever it is paid by the debtor out of property of the estate. Section 503’s legislative history is not inconsistent with this Court’s
holding, and the Court has cautioned against allowing ambiguous
legislative history to muddy clear statutory language. See Milner v.
Department of Navy, 562 U. S. ___, ___. Meanwhile, any cases suggesting that postpetition taxes were treated as administrative expenses are inapposite because they involve corporate debtors, which
Congress has singled out for responsibilities paralleling those borne
by a separate taxable entity’s trustee. Finally, petitioners contend
that the purpose of §1222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debtors with robust
relief from tax debts. There may be compelling policy reasons for
treating postpetition income tax liabilities as dischargeable. But if
Congress intended petitioners’ result, it did not so provide in the
statute. Pp. 12−17.
