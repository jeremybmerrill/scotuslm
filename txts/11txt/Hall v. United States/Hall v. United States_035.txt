BREYER, J., dissenting

anything else in §1222(a) provides for the payment of
administrative expenses. Rather, that section and its
Amendment provide only for the payment of “claims.”
§1222(a)(2) (“The plan shall . . . provide for the full payment . . . of all claims entitled to priority under section
507, unless . . .” (emphasis added)). And administrative
expenses, the Government says, like all debts that are
incurred postpetition, are not “claims.”
The Government finds support for its view in the fact
that that §1222 deals with the contents of a “plan,” while a
later section, §1227(a), says that the provisions of a “confirmed plan bind the debtor, each creditor, [and certain
others of no relevance here].” (Emphasis added.) This
is because the Code defines “creditor” to include only holders of pre-petition claims, thus excluding holders of
post-petition claims, such as administrative expenses.
§101(10).
The Government points out that a different Code section, namely §1226(b)(1), provides for the payment of
administrative expenses. That section says that “[b]efore
or at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan,
there shall be paid . . . any unpaid claim of the kind
specified in section 507(a)(2),” namely “administrative expenses.” And Congress did not amend §1226(b)(1); it
amended the earlier section, §1222(a).
In short, the Government says, the Plan only covers
those §507 priority “expenses and claims” that are described as “claims” and can be held by “creditors.” Section
1226(b)(1), not §1222, deals with administrative expenses.
The bottom line of the Government’s chain of logic is, once
again, that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong
place.
I concede that there is some text and legislative history
that supports the Government’s view that the word
“claim” in §1222(a) does not include “administrative expenses.” See, e.g., §507(a) (referring to “expenses and
