HALL v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

revisions of the Code for many years with the help of
Bankruptcy experts, and having considered the Amendment several times over a period of years, would have
made the drafting mistake that the Government and the
majority necessarily imply that it made. Moreover, I believe it important that courts interpreting statutes make
significant efforts to allow the provisions of congressional
statutes to function in the ways that that the elected
branch of Government likely intended and for which it
can be held democratically accountable.
For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.
