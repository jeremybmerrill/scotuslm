HALL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

6.5 For over a decade, the Government has likewise hewed
to the position that “since post-petition tax liabilities are,
in Chapter 13 cases, incurred by the debtor, rather than
the bankruptcy estate, characterizing such liabilities as
administrative expenses is inconsistent with section 503.”
IRS Chief Counsel Advice No. 200113027, p. 6 (Mar. 30,
2001), 2001 WL 307746, *4; see also Internal Revenue
Manual §5.9.10.9.2(3) (2006) (hereinafter IRM); IRS Liti­
gation Guideline Memorandum GL–26, p. 9 (Dec. 16,
1996), 1996 WL 33107107, *6. We see no reason to depart
from those established understandings. To “ ‘hold the
Chapter 13 estate liable for [a] tax when it does not exist
as a taxable entity defies common sense as well as Con­
gress’ intent.’ ” In re Whall, 391 B. R. 1, 4 (Bkrtcy. Ct.
Mass. 2008). The same holds true for a Chapter 12 estate.
A provision in Chapter 13 confirms that postpetition
income taxes fall outside §503(b). Section 1305(a)(1) pro­
vides that “[a] proof of claim may be filed by any entity
that holds a claim against the debtor . . . for taxes that
become payable to a governmental unit while the case is
pending.” (Emphasis added.) That provision gives holders
of postpetition claims the option of collecting postpetition
taxes within the bankruptcy case—an option that the
Government would never need to invoke if postpetition tax
liabilities were already collectible inside the bankruptcy.
Accordingly, lest we render §1305 “ ‘inoperative or super­
fluous,’ ” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004), it is clear
that postpetition income taxes are not automatically col­
lectible in a Chapter 13 plan and, a fortiori, are not admin­
istrative expenses under §503(b).
It follows that postpetition income taxes are not auto­
