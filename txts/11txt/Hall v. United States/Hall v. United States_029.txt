BREYER, J., dissenting

farm assets to raise funds for creditors) as a liability that,
in a bankruptcy sense, the estate incurs.
The English language permits this reading of the phrase
tax “incurred by the estate.” When the farmer, in the
midst of Chapter 12 proceedings, sells a portion of his
farm to raise money to help pay his creditors, one can
say, as a matter of English, that the bankruptcy estate has
“incurred” the associated tax, even if it is ultimately taxed
to the farmer, just as one can say that an employee who
makes purchases using a company credit card “incurs
costs” for which his employer is liable.
As a matter of general bankruptcy principles (as Congress understood them), the history of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code revision is replete with statements to the effect
that “[t]axes arising from the operation of the estate after
bankruptcy are entitled to priority as administrative
expenses.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–595, p. 193 (1977) (emphasis
added). See S. Rep. No. 95–1106, p. 13 (1978) (administrative expenses include “[t]axes incurred during the
administration of the estate” (emphasis added)); S. Rep.
No. 95–989, p. 66 (1978) (“In general, administrative
expenses include taxes which the trustee incurs in administering the debtor’s estate, including taxes on capital gains
from sales of property by the trustee and taxes on income
earned by the estate during the case” (emphasis added));
124 Cong. Rec. 32415 (1978) (“The amendment generally
follows the Senate amendment in providing expressly
that taxes incurred during the administration of the estate
share the first priority given to administrative expenses
generally” (emphasis added)); id., at 34014 (Senate version
of the joint floor statement saying exactly the same).
And importantly, as the majority concedes, ante, at 14–
15, bankruptcy law treats taxes incurred by corporate
debtors while they are in bankruptcy proceedings as
“tax[es] incurred by the estate,” even though the Tax Code
does not treat the bankruptcy estate of a corporate debtor
