Opinion of the Court

As the IRC makes clear, only certain estates are liable
for federal income taxes. Title 26 U. S. C. §§1398 and
1399 address taxation in bankruptcy and define the divi­
sion of responsibilities for the payment of taxes between
the estate and the debtor on a chapter-by-chapter basis.
Section 1398 provides that when an individual debtor files
for Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy, the estate shall be liable
for taxes. In such cases, the trustee files a separate re­
turn on the estate’s behalf and “[t]he tax” on “the taxable
income of the estate . . . shall be paid by the trustee.”
§1398(c)(1); see also §6012(b)(4) (“Returns of . . . an estate
of an individual under chapter 7 or 11 . . . shall be made
by the fiduciary thereof ”). Section 1399 provides that
“[e]xcept in any case to which section 1398 applies, no
separate taxable entity shall result from the commence­
ment of a [bankruptcy] case.” In Chapter 12 and 13 cases,
then, there is no separately taxable estate. The debtor—
not the trustee—is generally liable for taxes and files the
only tax return. See In re Lindsey, 142 B. R. 447, 448
(Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Okla. 1992) (“It is clear that, pursuant
to 26 U. S. C. §1398 and 1399, the standing Chapter 12
trustee neither files a return nor pays federal income
tax”); cf. infra, at 15 (discussing special trustee duties in
corporate-debtor cases).
These provisions suffice to resolve this case: Chapter 12
estates are not taxable entities. Petitioners, not the estate
itself, are required to file the tax return and are liable for
the taxes resulting from their postpetition farm sale. The
postpetition federal income tax liability is not “incurred by
the estate” and thus is neither collectible nor discharge­
able in the Chapter 12 plan.2
——————
2 Because we hold that the postpetition federal income taxes at issue
are not collectible in the plan because they are not “incurred by the
estate,” we need not address the Government’s broader alternative
argument that Chapter 12 plans are exclusively limited to prepetition
claims.
