LYNWOOD D. HALL, ET UX., PETITIONERS v. 

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[May 14, 2012]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
Under Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code, farmer
debtors may treat certain claims owed to a governmental
unit resulting from the disposition of farm assets as dis­
chargeable, unsecured liabilities. 11 U. S. C. §1222(a)
(2)(A). One such claim is for “any tax . . . incurred by the
estate.” §503(b)(B)(i). The question presented is whether
a federal income tax liability resulting from individual
debtors’ sale of a farm during the pendency of a Chapter
12 bankruptcy is “incurred by the estate” and thus dis­
chargeable. We hold that it is not.
I

A

In 1986, Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy
Code, §1201 et seq., to allow farmer debtors with regu­
lar annual income to adjust their debts. Chapter 12 was
modeled on Chapter 13, §1301 et seq., which permits
individual debtors with regular annual income to preserve
existing assets subject to a “court-approved plan under
which they pay creditors out of their future income.”
