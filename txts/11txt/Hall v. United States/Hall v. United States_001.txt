HALL ET UX. v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 10–875.

Argued November 29, 2011—Decided May 14, 2012

Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code allows farmer debtors with regular
annual income to adjust their debts subject to a reorganization plan.
The plan must provide for full payment of priority claims. 11 U. S. C.
§1222(a)(2). Under §1222(a)(2)(A), however, certain governmental
claims arising from the disposition of farm assets are stripped of priority status and downgraded to general, unsecured claims that are
dischargeable after less than full payment. That exception applies
only to claims “entitled to priority under [11 U. S. C. §507]” in the
first place. As relevant here, §507(a)(2) covers “administrative expenses allowed under §503(b),” which includes “any tax . . . incurred
by the estate.” §503(b)(B)(i).
Petitioners filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and then sold their
farm. They proposed a plan under which they would pay off outstanding liabilities with proceeds from the sale. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a tax on the capital gains from
the sale. Petitioners then proposed treating the tax as an unsecured
claim to be paid to the extent funds were available, with the unpaid
balance being discharged. The Bankruptcy Court sustained an IRS
objection, the District Court reversed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed
the District Court. The Ninth Circuit held that because a Chapter 12
estate is not a separate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue
Code (IRC), 26 U. S. C. §§1398, 1399, it does not “incur” postpetition
federal income taxes. The Ninth Circuit concluded that because the
tax was not “incurred by the estate” under §503(b), it was not a priority claim eligible for the §1222(a)(2)(A) exception.
Held: The federal income tax liability resulting from petitioners’ postpetition farm sale is not “incurred by the estate” under §503(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code and thus is neither collectible nor dischargeable in
