BREYER, J., dissenting

family has held the land or assets for many years). If the
resulting tax debt were treated as a §507 priority claim,
then it might well absorb much of the money raised to the
point where (depending upon the size of his other debts)
the farmer might be unable to proceed under Chapter 12.
The Amendment accordingly seeks to place the tax authorities farther back in the creditor queue, requiring them,
like ordinary unsecured creditors, to seek payment from
the funds that remain after the §507 priority creditors
(and secured claim holders) have been paid.
The Amendment’s chief legislative sponsor, Senator
Charles Grassley, explained this well when he told the
Senate:
“Under current law, farmers often face a crushing tax
liability if they need to sell livestock or land in order
to reorganize their business affairs. . . . [H]igh taxes
have caused farmers to lose their farms. Under the
bankruptcy code, the I. R. S. must be paid in full for
any tax liabilities generated during a bankruptcy reorganization. If the farmer can’t pay the I. R. S. in
full, then he can’t keep his farm. This isn’t sound policy. Why should the I. R. S. be allowed to veto a
farmer’s reorganization plan?
[The Amendment]
takes this power away from the I. R. S. by reducing
the priority of taxes during proceedings. This will free
up capital for investment in the farm, and help farmers stay in the business of farming.” 145 Cong. Rec.
1113 (1999).

§54:61, p. 11 (Oct. 2011 Supp.) (“This provision attempts
to mitigate the tax expense often incurred by farmers who
have significant taxable capital gains or depreciation recapture when their low basis farm assets are foreclosed,
sold, or otherwise disposed of by their creditors”).
