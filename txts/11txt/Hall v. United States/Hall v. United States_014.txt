Opinion of the Court

matically collectible in petitioners’ Chapter 12 plan.6
Because both chapters cross-reference §503(b) in an iden­
tical manner, see §§1222(a)(2), 1322(a)(2), we are cogni­
zant that any conflicting reading of §503(b) here could
disrupt settled Chapter 13 practices. See Cohen v. de la
Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998) (the Court “ ‘will not read
the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice
absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a
departure’ ”). Chapter 13 filings outnumber Chapter 12
filings six-hundred-fold. See U. S. Bankruptcy Courts—

6 The dissent suggests that Chapter 12 can be distinguished from
Chapter 13 because Chapter 12 bankruptcies tend to be longer, such
that the treatment of taxes is more “important.” Post, at 13. As
a practical matter, it is not clear that Chapter 12 bankruptcies are
substantially longer. Compare Brief for Neil E. Harl. et al. as Amici
Curiae 33 (median Chapter 12 case duration is under 8 months) with
Tr. of Oral Arg. 49 (“on average we’re talking about 4 months in a
chapter 13 case”). In any event, there is no indication that Congress
intended any difference in duration—if it anticipated a difference at
all—to flip the characterization of postpetition income taxes from one
chapter to the other. Nor does the absence of a §1305 equivalent in
Chapter 12 justify shoehorning postpetition taxes into §503(b), as the
dissent argues. That Chapter 12 lacks a provision allowing such taxes
to be brought inside the plan only clarifies that such taxes fall outside
of the plan.
The dissent alternatively suggests that it “do[es] not see the serious
harm in treating the relevant taxes as ‘administrative expenses’ in both
Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases.” Post, at 13–14. The “harm” is to
settled understandings in Chapter 13 to the contrary. The “harm” is
also to §1305; to avoid rendering §1305 a nullity, the dissent recasts the
provision as applicable not to all “taxes that become payable . . . while
the case is pending,” but only those payable “after the Chapter 13 Plan
is confirmed.” Post, at 14. The dissent does not claim, however, that
this was Congress’ intent for §1305, as Congress’ choice of words would
be exceedingly overbroad if it were. And the dissent’s novel reading
contravenes ample Chapter 13 authority recognizing no such limitation
on §1305’s scope. E.g., 8 Collier ¶1305.02 (citing cases).
