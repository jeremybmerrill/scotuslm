12 makes clear that at least some postpetition claims are
to be discharged once the debtor has completed his payments under the Plan. That fact, in turn, suggests that
the Plan may provide for their payment and that the
holders of such claims may be bound by the terms of a
confirmed Plan.
The upshot is that the Government’s second argument
presents a plausible, but not the only plausible, interpretation of the Code’s language. And the Government’s
second argument, like the majority’s argument, has a
problem, namely that it reduces Congress’ Amendment to

In sum the phrase tax “incurred by the estate” in
§503(b) (the “administrative expense” section) and the
word “claim” in §1222(a) are open to different interpretations. Each of the narrower interpretations advanced by
the Government or adopted by the Court would either
exclude postpetition taxes from the phrase taxes “incurred
by the estate” or exclude all postpetition debts, including
administrative expenses, from the word “claim.” In these
ways, these interpretations would, as I have said, prevent
the Amendment from accomplishing its basic purpose.
A broader interpretation of the word “claim” may allow
the Plan to include certain postpetition debts. This, taken
together with a broader interpretation of the phrase tax
“incurred by the estate,” prevents the Government from
collecting postpetition/preconfirmation tax debts outside of
Chapter 12, requiring it to assume a place in the creditor

Amendment to take effect as intended.
I find this last-mentioned consideration determinative.
It seems to me unlikely that Congress, having worked on
