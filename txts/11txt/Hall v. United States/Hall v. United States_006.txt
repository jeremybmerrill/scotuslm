Opinion of the Court

Petitioners Lynwood and Brenda Hall petitioned for
bankruptcy under Chapter 12 and sold their farm shortly
thereafter. Petitioners initially proposed a plan of reor­
ganization under which they would pay off outstanding
liabilities with proceeds from the sale. The Internal Reve­
nue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a federal income tax
of $29,000 on the capital gains from the farm sale.
Petitioners amended their proposal to treat the income
tax as a general, unsecured claim to be paid to the extent
funds were available, with the unpaid balance discharged.
Again the IRS objected. Taxes on income from a postpeti­
tion farm sale, the IRS argued, remain the debtors’ inde­
pendent responsibility because they are neither collectible
nor dischargeable in bankruptcy.
The Bankruptcy Court sustained the objection. The
court reasoned that because a Chapter 12 estate is not a
separate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue Code
(IRC), see 26 U. S. C. §§1398, 1399, it cannot “incur” taxes
for purposes of 11 U. S. C. §503(b).
The District Court reversed, expressing doubt that IRC
provisions are relevant to interpreting §503(b). Based on
its reading of legislative history, the District Court deter­
mined that Congress intended §1222(a)(2)(A) to extend to
petitioners’ postpetition taxes.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.
617 F. 3d 1161 (2010). The Court of Appeals held that the
Chapter 12 estate does not “incur” the postpetition federal
income taxes for purposes of §503(b) because it is not a
separate taxable entity under the IRC, and noted that
Congress repeatedly has indicated the relevance of the
IRC’s taxable entity provisions to the Bankruptcy Code.
Although “sympathetic” to the view that the postpetition
tax liabilities should be dischargeable, the Court of Ap­
