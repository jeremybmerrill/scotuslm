HALL v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

as a “separate taxable entity.” See, e.g., United States v.
Noland, 517 U. S. 535, 543 (1996) (treating Chapter 11
corporate debtor’s postpetition taxes as administrative
expenses); In re Pacific-Atlantic Trading Co., 64 F. 3d
1292, 1298 (CA9 1995) (same); In re L. J. O’Neil Shoe Co.,
64 F. 3d 1146, 1151–1152 (CA8 1995) (same); In re Hillsborough Holdings Corp., 156 B. R. 318, 320 (Bkrtcy. Ct.
MD Fla. 1993) (“[A]dministrative expenses should include
taxes which the trustee, and, in Chapter 11 cases, the
Debtor-in-Possession, incurs in administering the estate,
including taxes based on capital gains from sales of property and taxes on income earned by the estate during the
case post-petition”).
Even though, as the majority says, corporate bankruptcies have some special features (in particular, a trustee in
a corporate bankruptcy is required to file the estate’s
income tax return), it is unclear why these features should
have any bearing on the definition of administrative
expenses.
See ante, at 15 (discussing 26 U. S. C.
§6012(b)(3)). Indeed, in many corporate Chapter 11 bankruptcies, there is no trustee, in which case the debtor-inpossession, just like an individual Chapter 12 debtor, must
file the tax return. See 11 U. S. C. §§1104, 1107 (2006 ed.
and Supp. IV); 5 Norton §§91:3, 93:1 (typically, no trustee
is appointed in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the debtorin-possession assumes most of the duties and powers of a
trustee, continuing in possession and managing the business until the court determines, upon request of a party in
interest, that grounds exist for the appointment of a trustee); Holywell Corp. v. Smith, 503 U. S. 47, 54 (1992) (“As
the assignee of ‘all’ or ‘substantially all’ of the property
of the corporate debtors, the trustee must file the returns that the corporate debtors would have filed had the
plan not assigned their property to the trustee” (emphasis
added)).
Consequently, I can find no strong bankruptcy law
