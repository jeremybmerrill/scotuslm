HALL v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is
not entitled to priority under section 507, but the debt
shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor receives a discharge; or
“(B) the holder of a particular claim agrees to a different treatment of that claim.” §1222(a) (emphasis
added).
The Amendment consists of subparagraph (A).
At first blush, the Amendment seems to relegate the
capital gains tax collector to the status of an ordinary
unsecured creditor. See ibid. (exception applies to claims
“owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the
sale . . . of any farm asset”). If, as petitioners claim, that
is so, then it is unlikely that such a debt could stop a
farmer from proceeding under Chapter 12, since its treatment as an ordinary unsecured claim means that the
farmer will not necessarily have to pay the debt in full.
But if the Government and the majority are right, then
the capital gains tax falls outside the category of §507
priority claims—and therefore falls outside the scope of
the Amendment; in fact, it falls outside the bankruptcy
proceeding altogether. And the Government then might
well be able to collect the debt in full outside the bankruptcy proceeding—even if doing so would reduce the
farmer’s assets and future income to the point where the
farmer would not be able to proceed under Chapter 12.
The question before us is whether we must interpret the
Amendment in a way that could bring about this result.

Congress did not intend this result. In a significant
number of instances a Chapter 12 farmer, in order to
have enough money to pay his creditors, might have to sell
farmland or other farm assets at a price that would give
rise to considerable capital gains taxes (particularly if the
