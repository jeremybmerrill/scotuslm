HALL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

the estate is not separately taxable in Chapter 13 (and
now Chapter 12) cases.
In 2005, Congress in BAPCPA amended §346 and crys­
tallized the connection between the Bankruptcy Code and
the IRC. Section 346 now expressly aligns its assignment
of state or local taxes with the rules for federal taxes,
providing in relevant part:
“(a) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
provides that a separate taxable estate or entity is
created in a case concerning a debtor under this title,
and the income . . . of such estate shall be taxed to or
claimed by the estate, a separate taxable estate is also
created for purposes of any State and local law impos­
ing a tax on or measured by income and such income
. . . shall be taxed to or claimed by the estate and may
not be taxed to or claimed by the debtor.
“(b) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
provides that no separate taxable estate shall be cre­

and the income . . . of an estate shall be taxed to or
claimed by the debtor, such income . . . shall be taxed
to or claimed by the debtor under a State or local law
imposing a tax on or measured by income and may not
be taxed to or claimed by the estate.” (Emphasis added.)
Thus, whenever the estate is separately taxable under
federal income tax law, that “is also” the case under state
or local income tax law, §346(a), and vice versa, §346(b).
And given that the Bankruptcy Code instructs that the as­
signment of state or local tax liabilities shall turn on the
IRC’s separate taxable entity rules, there is parity in
turning to such rules in assigning federal tax liabilities.
In the same Act, Congress added §1222(a)(2)(A). Section
1222(a)(2)(A) carves out an exception to the ordinary
priority classification scheme. But §1222(a)(2)(A) did not
purport to redefine which claims are otherwise entitled to
