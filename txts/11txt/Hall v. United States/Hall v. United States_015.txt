HALL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

417,503 annual Chapter 12 and 13 filings, respectively)
(as visited May 14, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file). Yet adopting petitioners’ reading of §503(b)
would mean that, in every Chapter 13 case, the Govern­
ment could ignore §1305 and expect priority payment of
postpetition income taxes in every plan.
At bottom, “identical words and phrases within the
same statute should normally be given the same mean­
ing.” Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551
U. S. 224, 232 (2007). Absent any indication that Con­
gress intended a conflict between two closely related chap­
ters, we decline to create one.7
III
Petitioners and the dissent advance several arguments
for why the postpetition income taxes at issue should be
considered “incurred by the estate,” notwithstanding the
IRC’s separate taxable entity rules. But none provides
sufficient reason to overcome the statute’s plain language,
context, and structure.
Petitioners primarily argue that “incurred by the estate”
has a temporal meaning. Petitioners emphasize that the
estate only comes into existence after a bankruptcy peti­
tion is filed. Thus, they reason, taxes “incurred by the
estate” refers to all taxes “incurred postpetition,” regard­
less of whether the estate is liable for the tax and regard­
less of the chapter under which a case is filed. Although
all taxes “incurred by the estate” are necessarily incurred

manuals dating back to 1998 indicate that the Government did
not view postpetition federal income taxes as collectible in an individual debtor’s Chapter 12 plan, even when that view was adverse to its
interests. See IRM §25.17.12.9.3 (2004); id., §25.17.12.9.3(1) (2002);
id., §5.9, ch. 10.8(4) (1999); id., §5.9, ch. 10.8(4) (1998). Until the en­
actment of 11 U. S. C. §1222(a)(2)(A), treating such taxes as priority
claims in the plan would have assured the Government of full payment
before or at the time of the plan.
