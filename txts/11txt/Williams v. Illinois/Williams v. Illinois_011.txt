suspicion for L. J.’s rape.
Sandra Lambatos, a forensic specialist at the ISP lab,
conducted a computer search to see if the Cellmark profile
matched any of the entries in the state DNA database.
The computer showed a match to a profile produced by the
lab from a sample of petitioner’s blood that had been taken
after he was arrested on unrelated charges on August 3,
2000.
On April 17, 2001, the police conducted a lineup at
which L. J. identified petitioner as her assailant. Petitioner was then indicted for aggravated criminal sexual

In lieu of a jury trial, petitioner chose to be tried before a
state judge.

Petitioner’s bench trial began in April 2006. In open
court, L. J. again identified petitioner as her attacker.
The State also offered three expert forensic witnesses to
link petitioner to the crime through his DNA. First, Brian
Hapack, an ISP forensic scientist, testified that he had
confirmed the presence of semen on the vaginal swabs
taken from L. J. by performing an acid phosphatase test.
After performing this test, he testified, he resealed the
evidence and left it in a secure freezer at the ISP lab.
Second, Karen Abbinanti, a state forensic analyst, testified that she had used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
and Short Tandem Repeat (STR) techniques to develop a
DNA profile from a blood sample that had been drawn
from petitioner after he was arrested in August 2000. She
also stated that she had entered petitioner’s DNA profile
into the state forensic database.
Third, the State offered Sandra Lambatos as an expert
witness in forensic biology and forensic DNA analysis. On
direct examination, Lambatos testified about the general
process of using the PCR and STR techniques to generate
