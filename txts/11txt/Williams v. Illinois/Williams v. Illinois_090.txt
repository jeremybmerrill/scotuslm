KAGAN, J., dissenting

the purpose of the testimony is to enable the factfinder to
assess the expert opinion’s basis. (And this tactic would
not be confined to cases involving scientific evidence. As
JUSTICE THOMAS points out, the prosecutor could similarly
substitute experts for all kinds of people making out-ofcourt statements. See ante, at 7.) The plurality thus
would countenance the Constitution’s circumvention. If
the Confrontation Clause prevents the State from getting
its evidence in through the front door, then the State could
sneak it in through the back. What a neat trick—but
really, what a way to run a criminal justice system. No
wonder five Justices reject it.
III
The plurality also argues, as a “second, independent
basis” for its decision, that the Cellmark report falls outside the Confrontation Clause’s ambit because it is nontestimonial. Ante, at 3. The plurality tries out a number of
supporting theories, but all in vain: Each one either conflicts with this Court’s precedents or misconstrues this
case’s facts. JUSTICE THOMAS rejects the plurality’s views
for similar reasons as I do, thus bringing to five the number of Justices who repudiate the plurality’s understanding of what statements count as testimonial. See ante, at
1, 12–15. JUSTICE THOMAS, however, offers a rationale
of his own for deciding that the Cellmark report is nontestimonial. I think his essay works no better. When
all is said and done, the Cellmark report is a testimonial
statement.
A
According to the plurality, we should declare the
Cellmark report nontestimonial because “the use at trial
of a DNA report prepared by a modern, accredited laboratory ‘bears little if any resemblance to the historical practices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.’ ”
