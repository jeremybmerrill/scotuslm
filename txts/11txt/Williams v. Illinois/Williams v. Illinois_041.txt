WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
BREYER, J., concurring

swab taken from the crime victim, had identified semen in
that material, and had derived a profile of the male DNA
that the semen contained. Lambatos then entered that
profile into an Illinois State Police Crime Laboratory
computerized database, which contained, among many
other DNA profiles, a profile derived by the crime laboratory from Williams’ blood (taken at an earlier time). The
computer she was using showed that the two profiles
matched. Lambatos then confirmed the match.
Later, Lambatos testified at trial, where the prosecutor
asked her three relevant questions. First, the prosecutor
asked whether there was “a computer match generated of
the male DNA profile [derived by Cellmark] found in [the]
semen from the vaginal swabs . . . to [the] male DNA
profile [found in the database] that had been identified as
having originated from Sandy Williams”? App. 56. Since
the computer had shown such a match, Lambatos answered affirmatively. Ibid.
Second, the prosecutor asked whether Lambatos had independently “compare[d the DNA profile that Cellmark
had derived from] the semen that had been identified . . .
from the vaginal swabs of [the victim] to the male DNA
profile [found in the database] that had been [derived] . . .
from the blood of Sandy Williams.” Ibid. Lambatos again
answered affirmatively. Ibid.
Third, the prosecutor asked whether, in Lambatos’ expert opinion, the DNA profile derived from the semen
identified in the vaginal swabs of the victim was “a match
to Sandy Williams.” Id., at 58. Lambatos again answered
affirmatively. Ibid.
The Confrontation Clause problem lies in the fact that
Lambatos did not have personal knowledge that the male
DNA profile that Cellmark said was derived from the
crime victim’s vaginal swab sample was in fact correctly
derived from that sample. And no Cellmark expert testified that it was true. Rather, she simply relied for her
