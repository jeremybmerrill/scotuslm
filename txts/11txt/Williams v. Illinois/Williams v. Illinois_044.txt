BREYER, J., concurring

cians could be responsible for an error like that. And the
testifying analyst might not have reviewed the underlying
notes and caught the error during direct examination (or
for that matter, during cross-examination).
Adapting the example slightly, assume that the admissibility of the initial laboratory report into trial had been
directly at issue. Who should the prosecution have had to
call to testify? Only the analyst who signed the report
noting the match? What if the analyst who made the
match knew nothing about either the laboratory’s underlying procedures or the specific tests run in the particular
case? Should the prosecution then have had to call all
potentially involved laboratory technicians to testify? Six
to twelve or more technicians could have been involved.
(See Appendix, infra, which lists typically relevant laboratory procedures.) Some or all of the words spoken or
written by each technician out of court might well have
constituted relevant statements offered for their truth and
reasonably relied on by a supervisor or analyst writing
the laboratory report. Indeed, petitioner’s amici argue
that the technicians at each stage of the process should
be subject to cross-examination. See Brief for Innocence
Network as Amicus Curiae 13–23 (hereinafter Innocence
Network Brief).
And as is true of many hearsay statements that fall
within any of the 20 or more hearsay exceptions, crossexamination could sometimes significantly help to elicit
the truth. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803 (listing 24 hearsay
exceptions). The Confrontation Clause as interpreted in
Crawford recognizes, as a limitation upon a pure “testimonial statement” requirement, circumstances where the
defendant had an adequate “prior opportunity to crossexamine.” 541 U. S., at 59. To what extent might the
“testimonial statements” requirement embody one or more
(or modified versions) of these traditional hearsay exceptions as well?
