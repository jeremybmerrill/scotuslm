WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
BREYER, J., concurring
Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.

(Continued)

Electrophoresis
“We conducted a proper
electrophoresis, using the
proper procedures to place
the DNA in the properly
calibrated equipment run in
the proper conditions. We
followed the proper precautions to avoid cross-sample
contamination. The procedures we followed used are
generally accepted in the
scientific community.”

12. Technicians
#11 and #12: Report
“Using the proper
computer software, we
properly transcribed
the data produced by
the electropherogram
into a report. We
applied the proper
criteria to review the
computer determinations of what the allele
values are at each of
the chromosomal
locations analyzed.
We properly documented those allele
values to produce the
DNA profile. The
procedures we followed are generally
accepted in the scientific community.”

C. Comparison Between the Two DNA Profiles
13. Analyst
Analyst (who eventually testifies in court) compares the two
electropherograms and reports, i.e., compares the electropherograms and profiles from the crime-scene DNA to the
defendant’s DNA. Analyst then prepares her own report
setting forth her conclusions about the DNA match.
