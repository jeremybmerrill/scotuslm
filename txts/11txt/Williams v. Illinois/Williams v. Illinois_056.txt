Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J. 


B. Profile of Crime-Scene Sample (Examples of Statements)
7. Technician #7:
Evidence Examination
“The crime-scene evidence
was submitted in a properly sealed packaged, and I
unpackaged it using the
proper precautions to
ensure contamination did
not occur. Using the
proper tests, I determined
that DNA suitable for
testing was present in the
evidence. I used the proper
procedures to take cuttings
or swabbings from the
evidence and to preserve
them for further testing.
The procedures I followed
are generally accepted in
the scientific community.”
10. Technician #10:
Amplification
“Using the proper procedures, I used the proper
chemicals to measure the
amount of DNA in the
sample accurately and to
normalize the sample to the
proper concentration. The
procedures I followed are
generally accepted in the
scientific community.”

8. Technician #8:
Extraction
“I used the proper
procedures and added
the proper chemical
reagents to the sample
to break open the cells
to free up the DNA so
that it became accessible for further testing. I
followed the proper
precautions to ensure
contamination did not
occur. The procedures I
followed are generally
accepted in the scientific community.”

9. Technician #9:
Quantification
“I conducted a proper
PCR process, placing
the sample in the proper equipment, running
the proper number of
cycles, and using the
proper chemical reagents to trigger the
reactions that copy the
DNA. I followed the
proper precautions to
guard against contamination. The procedures
I followed are generally
accepted in the scientific
community.”
