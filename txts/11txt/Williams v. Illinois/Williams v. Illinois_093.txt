WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
KAGAN, J., dissenting

The plurality next attempts to invoke our precedents
holding statements nontestimonial when made “to respond
to an ‘ongoing emergency,’ ” rather than to create evidence
for trial, Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); here, the
plurality insists, the Cellmark report’s purpose was “to
catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large.” Ante, at
31. But that is to stretch both our “ongoing emergency”
test and the facts of this case beyond all recognition. We
have previously invoked that test to allow statements by a
woman who was being assaulted and a man who had just
been shot. In doing so, we stressed the “informal [and]
harried” nature of the statements, Bryant, 562 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 31)—that they were made as, or “minutes”
after, id., at ___ (slip op., at 28), the events they described
“actually happen[ed],” Davis, 547 U. S., at 827 (emphasis
deleted), by “frantic” victims of criminal attacks, ibid.,
to officers trying to figure out “what had . . . occurred” and
what threats remained, Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 30) (internal quotation marks omitted). On their face,
the decisions have nothing to say about laboratory analysts conducting routine tests far away from a crime scene.
And this case presents a peculiarly inapt set of facts
for extending those precedents. Lambatos testified at trial
that “all reports in this case were prepared for this criminal investigation . . . [a]nd for the purpose of the eventual
litigation,” App. 82—in other words, for the purpose of
producing evidence, not enabling emergency responders.
And that testimony fits the relevant timeline. The police
did not send the swabs to Cellmark until November
2008—nine months after L. J.’s rape—and did not receive
the results for another four months. See id., at 30–34, 51–
52, 54. That is hardly the typical emergency response.
Finally, the plurality offers a host of reasons for why
reports like this one are reliable: “[T]here [i]s no prospect
of fabrication,” ante, at 31 (internal quotation marks
omitted); multiple technicians may “work on each DNA
