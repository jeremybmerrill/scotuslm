KAGAN, J., dissenting

Commonwealth suggested. Citing chapter and verse from
various studies, we concluded that “[f]orensic evidence is
not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation” and
mistake. 557 U. S., at 318; see id., at 319.
And just two years later (and just one year ago), we
reiterated Melendez-Diaz’s analysis when faced with a
State’s attempt to evade it. In Bullcoming v. New Mexico,
564 U. S. ___ (2011), a forensic report showed the defendant’s blood-alcohol concentration to exceed the legal limit
for drivers. The State tried to introduce that finding
through the testimony of a person who worked at the
laboratory but had not performed or observed the blood
test or certified its results. We held that Melendez-Diaz
foreclosed that tactic. The report, we stated, resembled
the certificates in Melendez-Diaz in “all material respects,”
564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15): Both were signed documents providing the results of forensic testing designed to
“ ‘prov[e] some fact’ in a criminal proceeding,” id., at ___
(slip op., at 14) (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 310).
And the State’s resort to a “surrogate” witness, in place
of the analyst who produced the report, did not satisfy the
Confrontation Clause. Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 12). Only the presence of “that particular scientist,”
we reasoned, would enable Bullcoming’s counsel to ask
“questions designed to reveal whether incompetence . . . or
dishonesty” had tainted the results. Id., at ___, ___ (slip
op., at 2, 12). Repeating the refrain of Melendez-Diaz, we
held that “[t]he accused’s right is to be confronted with”
the actual analyst, unless he is unavailable and the accused “had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine”
him. Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).
This case is of a piece. The report at issue here shows a
DNA profile produced by an analyst at Cellmark’s laboratory, allegedly from a vaginal swab taken from a young
woman, L. J., after she was raped. That report is identical
to the one in Bullcoming (and Melendez-Diaz) in “all mate-
