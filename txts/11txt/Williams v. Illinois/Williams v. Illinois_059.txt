WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

other than to establish their truth.
A
Illinois Rule of Evidence 703 (2011) and its federal
counterpart permit an expert to base his opinion on facts
about which he lacks personal knowledge and to disclose
those facts to the trier of fact. Relying on these Rules, the
State contends that the facts on which an expert’s opinion
relies are not to be considered for their truth, but only to
explain the basis of his opinion. See People v. Pasch, 152
Ill. 2d 133, 176, 604 N. E. 2d 294, 311 (1992) (“By allowing
an expert to reveal the information for this purpose alone,
it will undoubtedly aid the jury in assessing the value of
his opinion”); see also Advisory Committee’s Notes on Fed.
Rule Evid. 703, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 361 (stating that expert basis testimony is admissible “only for the purpose
of assisting the jury in evaluating an expert’s opinion”).
Accordingly, in the State’s view, the disclosure of expert
“basis testimony” does not implicate the Confrontation
Clause.
I do not think that rules of evidence should so easily
trump a defendant’s confrontation right. To be sure, we
should not “lightly swee[p] away an accepted rule” of
federal or state evidence law, ante, at 2 (internal quotation
marks omitted), when applying the Confrontation Clause.
“Rules of limited admissibility are commonplace in evidence law.” Mnookin, Expert Evidence and the Confrontation Clause after Crawford v. Washington, 15 J. L. & Pol’y
791, 812 (2007). And, we often presume that courts and
juries follow limiting instructions. See, e.g., Street, supra,
at 415, n. 6. But we have recognized that concepts central
to the application of the Confrontation Clause are ultimately matters of federal constitutional law that are not
dictated by state or federal evidentiary rules. See Barber
v. Page, 390 U. S. 719, 724–725 (1968) (defining a constitutional standard for whether a witness is “unavailable”
