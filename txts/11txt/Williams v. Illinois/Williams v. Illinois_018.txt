WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
Opinion of ALITO, J.

the general testing procedures of the laboratory. The
Court declined to accept this surrogate testimony, despite
the fact that the testifying analyst was a “knowledgeable
representative of the laboratory” who could “explain the
lab’s processes and the details of the report.” 564 U. S., at
___ (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1). The Court
stated simply: “The accused’s right is to be confronted with
the analyst who made the certification.” Id., at ___ (slip
op., at 2).
Just as in Melendez-Diaz, the forensic report that was
“introduce[d]” in Bullcoming “contain[ed] a testimonial
certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal
trial.” 564 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 7–8). The report
was signed by the nontestifying analyst who had authored
it, stating, “I certify that I followed the procedures set out
on the reverse of this report, and the statements in this

sample is based on the grams of alcohol in one hundred
milliliters of blood.” App. in Bullcoming, O. T. 2010,
No. 09–10876, p. 62. Critically, the report was introduced
at trial for the substantive purpose of proving the truth
of the matter asserted by its out-of-court author—namely,
that the defendant had a blood-alcohol level of 0.21. This
was the central fact in question at the defendant’s trial,
and it was dispositive of his guilt.
In concurrence, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR highlighted the importance of the fact that the forensic report had been
admitted into evidence for the purpose of proving the truth
of the matter it asserted. She emphasized that “this [was]
not a case in which an expert witness was asked for his
independent opinion about underlying testimonial reports
that were not themselves admitted into evidence.” 564
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (opinion concurring in part)
(citing Fed. Rule Evid. 703). “We would face a different
question,” she observed, “if asked to determine the constitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others’
