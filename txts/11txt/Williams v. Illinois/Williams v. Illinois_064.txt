THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

Cellmark’s statements were introduced for their truth.
C
The plurality’s contrary conclusion may seem of little
consequence to those who view DNA testing and other
forms of “hard science” as intrinsically reliable. But see
Melendez-Diaz, supra, at 318 (“Forensic evidence is not
uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation”). Today’s
holding, however, will reach beyond scientific evidence to
ordinary out-of-court statements. For example, it is not
uncommon for experts to rely on interviews with third
parties in forming their opinions. See, e.g., People v. Goldstein, 6 N. Y. 3d 119, 123–124, 843 N. E. 2d 727, 729–730
(2005) (psychiatrist disclosed statements made by the
defendant’s acquaintances as part of the basis of her opinion that the defendant was motivated to kill by his feelings
of sexual frustration).
It is no answer to say that “safeguards” in the rules of
evidence will prevent the abuse of basis testimony. Ante,
at 26. To begin with, courts may be willing to conclude
that an expert is not acting as a “mere condui[t]” for hearsay, ante, at 27, as long as he simply provides some opinion based on that hearsay. See Brief for Respondent 18,
n. 4 (collecting cases). In addition, the hearsay may be the
kind of fact on which experts in a field reasonably rely.
See Fed. Rule Evid. 703; Goldstein, supra, at 125, 843
N. E. 2d, at 731 (evidence showed that reputable psychiatrists relied upon third-party interviews in forming their

Cellmark’s statements, Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 417 (1985), a
complete lack of other evidence tending to prove the facts conveyed by
Cellmark’s statements would completely refute the not-for-its-truth
rationale. The trial court, in announcing its verdict, expressly concluded
that petitioner’s DNA matched the “DNA . . . in the semen recovered
from the victim’s vagina.” 4 R. JJJ151. Absent other evidence, it would
have been impossible for the trial court to reach that conclusion without relying on the truth of Cellmark’s statement that its test results
were based on the semen from L. J.’s swabs.
