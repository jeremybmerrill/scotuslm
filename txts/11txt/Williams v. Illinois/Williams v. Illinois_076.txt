KAGAN, J., dissenting

The Court today disagrees, though it cannot settle on a
reason why. JUSTICE ALITO, joined by three other Justices, advances two theories—that the expert’s summary of
the Cellmark report was not offered for its truth, and
that the report is not the kind of statement triggering the
Confrontation Clause’s protection. In the pages that
follow, I call JUSTICE ALITO’s opinion “the plurality,”
because that is the conventional term for it. But in all
except its disposition, his opinion is a dissent: Five Justices specifically reject every aspect of its reasoning
and every paragraph of its explication. See ante, at 1
(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (“I share the dissent’s view of the plurality’s flawed analysis”). JUSTICE
THOMAS, for his part, contends that the Cellmark report
is nontestimonial on a different rationale. But no other
Justice joins his opinion or subscribes to the test he offers.
That creates five votes to approve the admission of the
Cellmark report, but not a single good explanation. The
plurality’s first rationale endorses a prosecutorial dodge;
its second relies on distinguishing indistinguishable forensic reports. JUSTICE THOMAS’s concurrence, though positing an altogether different approach, suffers in the end
from similar flaws. I would choose another path—to
adhere to the simple rule established in our decisions, for
the good reasons we have previously given. Because defendants like Williams have a constitutional right to confront the witnesses against them, I respectfully dissent
from the Court’s fractured decision.

Our modern Confrontation Clause doctrine began with
Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004). About a
quarter century earlier, we had interpreted the Clause to
allow the admission of any out-of-court statement falling
within a “firmly rooted hearsay exception” or carrying
“particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.” Ohio v.
