WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
Opinion of ALITO, J.

Cellmark found in semen from the vaginal
swabs of [L.J.] to a male DNA profile that
had been identified as having originated
from Sandy Williams?
“A Yes, there was.”3
The defect in this argument is that under Illinois law
(like federal law) it is clear that the putatively offending
phrase in Lambatos’ testimony was not admissible for the
purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted—i.e.,
that the matching DNA profile was “found in semen from
the vaginal swabs.” Rather, that fact was a mere premise
of the prosecutor’s question, and Lambatos simply assumed that premise to be true when she gave her answer
indicating that there was a match between the two DNA
profiles. There is no reason to think that the trier of fact
took Lambatos’ answer as substantive evidence to establish where the DNA profiles came from.
The dissent’s argument would have force if petitioner
had elected to have a jury trial. In that event, there would
have been a danger of the jury’s taking Lambatos’ testimony as proof that the Cellmark profile was derived from
the sample obtained from the victim’s vaginal swabs.
Absent an evaluation of the risk of juror confusion and
careful jury instructions, the testimony could not have

small difference between what Lambatos actually said on the
stand and the slightly revised version that the dissent would find unobjectionable shows that, despite the dissent’s rhetoric, its narrow
argument would have little practical effect in future cases. Prosecutors
would be allowed to do exactly what the prosecution did in this case so
long as their testifying experts’ testimony was slightly modified along
the lines shown above. Following that course presumably would not
constitute a “prosecutorial dodge,” “subterfuge,” “indirection,” the “neat
trick” of “sneak[ing]” in evidence, or the countenancing of constitutional
violations with “a wink and a nod.” See post, at 3, 16, 17, 12 (opinion of
KAGAN, J.).
