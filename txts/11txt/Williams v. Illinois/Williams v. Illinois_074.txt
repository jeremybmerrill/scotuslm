SANDY WILLIAMS, PETITIONER v. ILLINOIS
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF



ILLINOIS



[June 18, 2012] 


JUSTICE KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE
GINSBURG, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.
Some years ago, the State of California prosecuted a
man named John Kocak for rape. At a preliminary hearing, the State presented testimony from an analyst at the
Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratory—the same facility used
to generate DNA evidence in this case. The analyst had
extracted DNA from a bloody sweatshirt found at the
crime scene and then compared it to two control samples—
one from Kocak and one from the victim. The analyst’s
report identified a single match: As she explained on
direct examination, the DNA found on the sweatshirt
belonged to Kocak.
But after undergoing crossexamination, the analyst realized she had made a mortifying error. She took the stand again, but this time to admit
that the report listed the victim’s control sample as coming
from Kocak, and Kocak’s as coming from the victim. So
the DNA on the sweatshirt matched not Kocak, but the
victim herself. See Tr. in No. SCD110465 (Super. Ct. San
Diego Cty., Cal., Nov. 17, 1995), pp. 3–4 (“I’m a little hysterical right now, but I think . . . the two names should be
switched”), online at http: //www.nlada.org/forensics/for_
lib/Documents/1037341561.0/JohnIvanKocak.pdf (as visited June 15, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s case
file). In trying Kocak, the State would have to look elsewhere for its evidence.
