Opinion of ALITO, J.

pressures would encourage prosecutors to forgo DNA
testing and rely instead on older forms of evidence, such

DNA testing done in a particular case because those who
participated in the testing may always be subpoenaed by

number, and sent it under seal to the Illinois State Police
(ISP) lab.
At the ISP lab, a forensic scientist received the sealed
kit. He conducted a chemical test that confirmed the
presence of semen on the vaginal swabs, and he then
resealed the kit and placed it in a secure evidence freezer.
During the period in question, the ISP lab often sent
biological samples to Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratory in
Germantown, Maryland, for DNA testing. There was
evidence that the ISP lab sent L. J.â€™s vaginal swabs to
Cellmark for testing and that Cellmark sent back a report
containing a male DNA profile produced from semen taken
from those swabs. At this time, petitioner was not under
