Opinion of ALITO, J.

and the Federal Rules of Evidence, an expert may base an
opinion on facts that are “made known to the expert at or
before the hearing,” but such reliance does not constitute
admissible evidence of this underlying information. Ill.
Rule Evid. 703; Fed. Rule Evid. 703. Accordingly, in jury
trials, both Illinois and federal law generally bar an expert
from disclosing such inadmissible evidence.2 In bench
trials, however, both the Illinois and the Federal Rules
place no restriction on the revelation of such information
to the factfinder. When the judge sits as the trier of fact,
it is presumed that the judge will understand the limited
reason for the disclosure of the underlying inadmissible
information and will not rely on that information for any
improper purpose. As we have noted, “[i]n bench trials,
judges routinely hear inadmissible evidence that they are
presumed to ignore when making decisions.” Harris v.
Rivera, 454 U. S. 339, 346 (1981) (per curiam). There is a
“well-established presumption” that “the judge [has] adhered to basic rules of procedure,” when the judge is acting
as a factfinder. Id., at 346–347 (emphasis added). See
also Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 1078
(1991) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).
This feature of Illinois and federal law is important
because Crawford, while departing from prior Confrontation Clause precedent in other respects, took pains to
reaffirm the proposition that the Confrontation Clause “does
not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes

disclosure of these facts or data to the jury is permitted if the
value of disclosure “substantially outweighs [any] prejudicial effect,”
Fed. Rule Evid. 703, or “the probative value . . . outweighs the risk of
unfair prejudice.” People v. Pasch, 152 Ill. 2d 133, 223, 604 N. E. 2d
294, 333 (1992). When this disclosure occurs, “the underlying facts” are
revealed to the jury “for the limited purpose of explaining the basis for
[the expert’s] opinion” and not “for the truth of the matter asserted.”
Id., at 176, 604 N. E. 2d, at 311.
