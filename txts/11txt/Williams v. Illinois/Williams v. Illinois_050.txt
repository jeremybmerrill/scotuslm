BREYER, J., concurring

Brief A22–A49.
These standards are not foolproof. Nor are they always
properly applied. It is not difficult to find instances in
which laboratory procedures have been abused. See, e.g.,
Innocence Network Brief 6–11; App. to Brief for Public
Defender Service for the District of Columbia et al. as
Amici Curiae 1a–12a; cf. Giannelli, The Abuse of Scientific
Evidence in Criminal Cases: The Need for Independent
Crime Laboratories, 4 Va. J. Soc. Pol’y & L. 439 (1997).
Moreover, DNA testing itself has exonerated some defendants who previously had been convicted in part upon the
basis of testimony by laboratory experts. See MelendezDiaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S., at 319 (citing Garrett &
Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrongful Convictions, 95 Va. L. Rev. 1 (2009)).
But if accreditation did not prevent admission of faulty
evidence in some of those cases, neither did crossexamination. In the wrongful-conviction cases to which
this Court has previously referred, the forensic experts all
testified in court and were available for cross-examination.
Sklansky, Hearsay’s Last Hurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 72–
73 (cited study “did not identify any cases in which hearsay from forensic analysts contributed to the conviction of
innocent defendants”); see Garrett & Neufeld, supra, at
10–12, 84, 89 (noting that cross-examination was rarely
effective); see also Murphy, The New Forensics: Criminal
Justice, False Certainty, and the Second Generation of
Scientific Evidence, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 721, 785–786 (2007)
(suggesting need for greater reliance upon accreditation
and oversight of accredited laboratories); Sklansky, supra,
at 74 (same). Similarly, the role of cross-examination is
ambiguous in the laboratory example that the dissent
describes. See post, at 1–2. (Apparently, the report’s error
came to light and was corrected after cross-examination
had concluded, see Thompson, Taroni, & Aitken, Author’s
Response, 49 J. Forensic Sci. 1202 (2003), and in any
