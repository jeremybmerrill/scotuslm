issue here could undermine, not fortify, the accuracy of
factfinding at a criminal trial. Such a precedent could
bar the admission of other reliable case-specific technical
information such as, say, autopsy reports. Autopsies, like
the DNA report in this case, are often conducted when it is
not yet clear whether there is a particular suspect or
whether the facts found in the autopsy will ultimately
prove relevant in a criminal trial. Autopsies are typically
conducted soon after death. And when, say, a victim’s
body has decomposed, repetition of the autopsy may not be
possible. What is to happen if the medical examiner dies
before trial? E.g., State v. Lackey, 280 Kan. 190, 195–196,
120 P. 3d 332, 341 (2005); see also People v. Geier, 41 Cal.
4th 555, 601–602, 161 P. 3d 104, 136–137 (2007). Is the
Confrontation Clause “ ‘effectively’ ” to function “ ‘as a
statute of limitations for murder’ ”? Melendez-Diaz, supra,
at 335 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting Comment, Toward a Definition of “Testimonial”: How Autopsy Reports
Do Not Embody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement,

In general, such a holding could also increase the risk of
convicting the innocent. The New York County District
Attorney’s Office and the New York City Office of the
Chief Medical Examiner tell us that the additional cost
and complexity involved in requiring live testimony from
perhaps dozens of ordinary laboratory technicians who
participate in the preparation of a DNA profile may well
force a laboratory “to reduce the amount of DNA testing it
conducts, and force prosecutors to forgo forensic DNA
analysis in cases where it might be highly probative. In
the absence of DNA testing, defendants might well be
prosecuted solely on the basis of eyewitness testimony, the
reliability of which is often questioned.” NY County DAO

(1967)); see also NDAA Brief 26 (such a holding “will also
impact the innocent who may wait to be cleared from
