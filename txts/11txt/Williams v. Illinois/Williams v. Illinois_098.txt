KAGAN, J., dissenting

on very little. Among them, though, they can boast of two
accomplishments. First, they have approved the introduction of testimony at Williams’s trial that the Confrontation
Clause, rightly understood, clearly prohibits. Second, they
have left significant confusion in their wake. What
comes out of four Justices’ desire to limit Melendez-Diaz
and Bullcoming in whatever way possible, combined with
one Justice’s one-justice view of those holdings, is—to be
frank—who knows what. Those decisions apparently no
longer mean all that they say. Yet no one can tell in what
way or to what extent they are altered because no proposed limitation commands the support of a majority.
The better course in this case would have been simply to
follow Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. Precedent-based
decisionmaking provides guidance to lower court judges
and predictability to litigating parties. Today’s plurality
and concurring opinions, and the uncertainty they sow,
bring into relief that judicial method’s virtues. I would
decide this case consistently with, and for the reasons
stated by, Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. And until a
majority of this Court reverses or confines those decisions,
I would understand them as continuing to govern, in every
particular, the admission of forensic evidence.
I respectfully dissent.
