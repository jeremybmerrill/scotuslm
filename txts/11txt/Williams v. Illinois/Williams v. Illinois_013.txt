Opinion of ALITO, J.

Ibid. The trial judge agreed, noting, “If she says she didn’t
do her own testing and she relied on a test of another lab
and she’s testifying to that, we will see what she’s going to
say.” Ibid.
The prosecutor then proceeded, asking Lambatos, “Did
you compare the semen that had been identified by Brian
Hapack from the vaginal swabs of [L. J.] to the male DNA
profile that had been identified by Karen [Abbinanti] from
the blood of [petitioner]?” Ibid.
Lambatos answered “Yes.” Ibid. Defense counsel
lodged an objection “to the form of the question,” but the
trial judge overruled it. Ibid. Lambatos then testified
that, based on her own comparison of the two DNA profiles, she “concluded that [petitioner] cannot be excluded
as a possible source of the semen identified in the vaginal
swabs,” and that the probability of the profile’s appearing
in the general population was “1 in 8.7 quadrillion black,
1 in 390 quadrillion white, or 1 in 109 quadrillion Hispanic
unrelated individuals.” Id., at 57. Asked whether she
would “call this a match to [petitioner],” Lambatos answered yes, again over defense counsel’s objection. Id.,
at 58.
The Cellmark report itself was neither admitted into
evidence nor shown to the factfinder. Lambatos did not
quote or read from the report; nor did she identify it as the
source of any of the opinions she expressed.
On cross-examination, Lambatos confirmed that she did
not conduct or observe any of the testing on the vaginal
swabs, and that her testimony relied on the DNA profile
produced by Cellmark. Id., at 59. She stated that she
trusted Cellmark to do reliable work because it was an
accredited lab, but she admitted she had not seen any of
the calibrations or work that Cellmark had done in deducing a male DNA profile from the vaginal swabs. Id., at
59–62.
Asked whether the DNA sample might have been de-
