opinions). Of course, some courts may determine that
hearsay of this sort is not substantially more probative
than prejudicial and therefore should not be disclosed under Rule 703. But that balancing test is no substitute
for a constitutional provision that has already struck the
balance in favor of the accused. See Crawford, 541 U. S.,
at 61 (“[The Confrontation Clause] commands, not that
evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a
particular manner: by testing in the crucible of crossexamination”).

Having concluded that the statements at issue here
were introduced for their truth, I turn to whether they
were “testimonial” for purposes of the Confrontation
Clause. In Crawford, the Court explained that “[t]he text

of statements bearing “indicia of solemnity.” Davis v.
Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 836–837, 840 (2006) (THOMAS,
J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).
This test comports with history because solemnity marked
the practices that the Confrontation Clause was designed
to eliminate, namely, the ex parte examination of witnesses under the English bail and committal statutes passed
during the reign of Queen Mary. See id., at 835; Bryant,
562 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)
(slip op., at 1); Crawford, supra, at 43–45. Accordingly, I
have concluded that the Confrontation Clause reaches
