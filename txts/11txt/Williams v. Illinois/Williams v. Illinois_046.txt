BREYER, J., concurring

(Supp. 2012).
Some of these approaches seem more readily compatible
with Crawford than others. Some seem more easily considered by a rules committee (or by state courts) than by
this Court. Nonetheless, all assume some kind of Crawford boundary—some kind of limitation upon the scope of
its application—though they reflect different views as to
just how and when that might be done.
Answering the underlying general question just discussed, and doing so soon, is important. Trial judges in
both federal and state courts apply and interpret hearsay
rules as part of their daily trial work. The trial of criminal
cases makes up a large portion of that work. And laboratory reports frequently constitute a portion of the evidence
in ordinary criminal trials. Obviously, judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers have to know, in as definitive a
form as possible, what the Constitution requires so that
they can try their cases accordingly.
The several different opinions filed today embody several serious, but different, approaches to the difficult general question. Yet none fully deals with the underlying
question as to how, after Crawford, Confrontation Clause
“testimonial statement” requirements apply to crime laboratory reports. Nor can I find a general answer in
Melendez-Diaz or Bullcoming. While, as a matter of pure
logic, one might use those cases to answer a narrowed
version of the question presented here, see post, at 7–8
(KAGAN, J., dissenting), those cases do not fully consider the broader evidentiary problem presented. I consequently find the dissent’s response, “Been there, done
that,” unsatisfactory. See post, at 21.
Under these circumstances, I would have this case reargued. I would request the parties and amici to focus
specifically upon the broader “limits” question. And I
would permit them to discuss, not only the possible implications of our earlier post-Crawford opinions, but also any
