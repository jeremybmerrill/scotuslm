WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

proper solution to this problem is not to carve out a Confrontation Clause exception for expert testimony that is
rooted only in legal fiction. See ante, at 3. Nor is it to
create a new primary purpose test that ensures that DNA
evidence is treated differently. See ibid. Rather, the
solution is to adopt a reading of the Confrontation Clause
that respects its historically limited application to a narrow class of statements bearing indicia of solemnity. In
forgoing that approach, today’s decision diminishes the
Confrontation Clause’s protection in cases where experts
convey the contents of solemn, formalized statements to
explain the bases for their opinions. These are the very
cases in which the accused should “enjoy the right . . . to
be confronted with the witnesses against him.”
