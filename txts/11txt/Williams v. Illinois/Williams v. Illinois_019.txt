It has long been accepted that an expert witness may
voice an opinion based on facts concerning the events at
issue in a particular case even if the expert lacks firsthand knowledge of those facts.
At common law, courts developed two ways to deal with
this situation. An expert could rely on facts that had
already been established in the record. But because it was
not always possible to proceed in this manner, and because record evidence was often disputed, courts developed the alternative practice of allowing an expert to
testify in the form of a “hypothetical question.” Under this
approach, the expert would be asked to assume the truth
of certain factual predicates, and was then asked to offer
an opinion based on those assumptions. See 1 K. Broun,
McCormick on Evidence §14, p. 87 (6th ed. 2006); 1
J. Wigmore, Evidence §677, p. 1084 (2d ed. 1923) (“If the
witness is skilled enough, his opinion may be adequately
obtained upon hypothetical data alone; and it is immaterial whether he has ever seen the person, place or thing in
question” (citation omitted)). The truth of the premises
could then be established through independent evidence,
and the factfinder would regard the expert’s testimony to
be only as credible as the premises on which it was based.
An early example of this approach comes from the English case of Beckwith v. Sydebotham, 1 Camp. 116, 170
Eng. Rep. 897 (K. B. 1807), where a party sought to prove
the seaworthiness of a ship, the Earl of Wycombe, by
calling as witnesses “several eminent surveyors of ships
who had never seen the ‘Earl of Wycombe.’ ” Ibid. The
opposing party objected to the testimony because it relied
