WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
Opinion of ALITO, J.

on facts that were not known to be true, but the judge
disagreed. Because the experts were “peculiarly acquainted” with “a matter of skill or science,” the judge
said, the “jury might be assisted” by their hypothetical
opinion based on certain assumed facts. Id., at 117, 170 Eng.
Rep., at 897. The judge acknowledged the danger of the
jury’s being unduly prejudiced by wrongly assuming the
truth of the hypothetical facts, but the judge noted that

witnesses . . . and, upon the hypothesis or assumption
of these questions the witnesses are asked to give
their [opinion]. You must readily see that the value of
the answers to these questions depends largely, if not
wholly, upon the fact whether the statements made in

statements in these questions are not supported by
the proof, then the answers to the questions are entitled to no weight, because based upon false assumptions or statements of facts.” Forsyth v. Doolittle, 120

Modern rules of evidence continue to permit experts to
express opinions based on facts about which they lack
personal knowledge, but these rules dispense with the
need for hypothetical questions. Under both the Illinois
