SANDY WILLIAMS, PETITIONER v. ILLINOIS
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF



ILLINOIS



[June 18, 2012] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the plurality that the disclosure of
Cellmark’s out-of-court statements through the expert
testimony of Sandra Lambatos did not violate the Confrontation Clause. I reach this conclusion, however, solely
because Cellmark’s statements lacked the requisite “formality and solemnity” to be considered “ ‘testimonial’ ” for
purposes of the Confrontation Clause. See Michigan v.
Bryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (THOMAS, J., concurring
in judgment) (slip op., at 1). As I explain below, I share
the dissent’s view of the plurality’s flawed analysis.
I
The threshold question in this case is whether Cellmark’s statements were hearsay at all. As the Court
has explained, “[t]he [Confrontation] Clause . . . does not
bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other
than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.” See
Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 60, n. 9 (2004)
(citing Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 414 (1985)).
Here, the State of Illinois contends that Cellmark’s statements—that it successfully derived a male DNA profile
and that the profile came from L. J.’s swabs—were introduced only to show the basis of Lambatos’ opinion, and not
for their truth. In my view, however, there was no plausible reason for the introduction of Cellmark’s statements
