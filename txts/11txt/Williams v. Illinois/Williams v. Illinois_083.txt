WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
KAGAN, J., dissenting

ment as the basis for a conclusion, because the statement’s
utility is then dependent on its truth. If the statement is
true, then the conclusion based on it is probably true; if
not, not. So to determine the validity of the witness’s
conclusion, the factfinder must assess the truth of the outof-court statement on which it relies. That is why the
principal modern treatise on evidence variously calls the
idea that such “basis evidence” comes in not for its truth,
but only to help the factfinder evaluate an expert’s opinion “very weak,” “factually implausible,” “nonsense,” and
“sheer fiction.” D. Kaye, D. Bernstein, & J. Mnookin, The
New Wigmore: Expert Evidence §4.10.1, pp. 196–197 (2d
ed. 2011); id., §4.11.6, at 24 (Supp. 2012). “One can sympathize,” notes that treatise, “with a court’s desire to
permit the disclosure of basis evidence that is quite probably reliable, such as a routine analysis of a drug, but to
pretend that it is not being introduced for the truth of its
contents strains credibility.” Id., §4.10.1, at 198 (2d ed.
2011); see also, e.g., People v. Goldstein, 6 N. Y. 3d 119,
128, 843 N. E. 2d 727, 732–733 (2005) (“The distinction
between a statement offered for its truth and a statement
offered to shed light on an expert’s opinion is not meaningful”). Unlike in Street, admission of the out-of-court
statement in this context has no purpose separate from its
truth; the factfinder can do nothing with it except assess
its truth and so the credibility of the conclusion it serves to
buttress.1

1 In responding to this reasoning, the plurality confirms it. According
to the plurality, basis evidence supports the “credibility of the expert’s
opinion” by showing that he has relied on, and drawn logical inferences
from, sound “factual premises.” Ante, at 24. Quite right. And that
process involves assessing such premises’ truth: If they are, as the
plurality puts it, “unsupported by other evidence in the record” or
otherwise baseless, they will not “allay [a factfinder’s] fears” about an
“expert’s reasoning.” Ante, at 24–25. I could not have said it any
better.
