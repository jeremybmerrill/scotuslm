WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
KAGAN, J., dissenting

States’ birth certificates. The difference in labeling—a
“certificate” in one case, a “report of laboratory examination” in the other—is not of constitutional dimension.
Indeed, JUSTICE THOMAS’s approach, if accepted, would
turn the Confrontation Clause into a constitutional geegaw—nice for show, but of little value. The prosecution
could avoid its demands by using the right kind of forms
with the right kind of language. (It would not take long to
devise the magic words and rules—principally, never call
anything a “certificate.”)7 And still worse: The new conventions, precisely by making out-of-court statements less
“solem[n],” ante, at 1, would also make them less reliable—and so turn the Confrontation Clause upside down.
See Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52–53, n. 3 (“We find it implausible that a provision which concededly condemned
trial by sworn ex parte affidavit thought trial by unsworn
ex parte affidavit perfectly OK”). It is not surprising that
no other Member of the Court has adopted this position.
To do so, as JUSTICE THOMAS rightly says of the plurality’s
decision, would be to “diminis[h] the Confrontation
Clause’s protection” in “the very cases in which the accused should ‘enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the
witnesses against him.’ ” Ante, at 16.

Before today’s decision, a prosecutor wishing to admit
the results of forensic testing had to produce the technician responsible for the analysis. That was the result of
not one, but two decisions this Court issued in the last
three years. But that clear rule is clear no longer. The
five Justices who control the outcome of today’s case agree
——————
7 JUSTICE THOMAS asserts there is no need to worry, because “the
Confrontation Clause reaches bad-faith attempts to evade the formalized process.” Ante, at 10; see ante, at 9, n. 5. I hope he is right. But
JUSTICE THOMAS provides scant guidance on how to conduct this novel
inquiry into motive.
