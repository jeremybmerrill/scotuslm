BREYER, J., concurring

from knowing the identity of the defendant in this case.
Statements of this kind fall within a hearsay exception
that has constituted an important part of the law of evidence for decades. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6) (“Records of
Regularly Conducted Activity”); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence
§§1517–1533, pp. 1878–1899 (1904) (“Regular Entries”).
And for somewhat similar reasons, I believe that such
statements also presumptively fall outside the category of
“testimonial” statements that the Confrontation Clause
makes inadmissible.
As the plurality points out, ante, at 28–33, the introduction of statements of this kind does not risk creating
the “principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was
directed.” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 50. That evil consists of
the pre-Constitution practice of using “ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.” Ibid. Sir Walter
Raleigh’s case illustrates the point. State authorities
questioned Lord Cobham, the key witness against Raleigh,
outside his presence. They then used those testimonial
statements in court against Raleigh. And when Raleigh
asked to face and to challenge his accuser, he was denied
that opportunity. See id., at 44.
The Confrontation Clause prohibits the use of this kind
of evidence because allowing it would deprive a defendant
of the ability to cross-examine the witness. Id., at 61–62;
Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 242–243 (1895).
That deprivation would prevent a defendant from confronting the witness. And it would thereby prevent a
defendant from probing the witness’ perception, memory,
narration, and sincerity. See, e.g., 2 K. Broun et al.,
McCormick on Evidence §245, p. 125 (6th ed. 2006);
