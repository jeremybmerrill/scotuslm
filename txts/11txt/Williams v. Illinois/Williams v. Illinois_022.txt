WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
Opinion of ALITO, J.

other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.”
541 U. S., at 59–60, n. 9 (citing Tennessee v. Street,
471 U. S. 409). In Street, the defendant claimed that the
police had coerced him into adopting the confession of his
alleged accomplice. The prosecution sought to rebut this
claim by showing that the defendant’s confession differed
significantly from the accomplice’s. Although the accomplice’s confession was clearly a testimonial statement, the
Court held that the jurors could hear it as long as they
were instructed to consider that confession not for its
truth, but only for the “distinctive and limited purpose” of
comparing it to the defendant’s confession, to see whether
the two were identical. Id., at 417.

In order to assess petitioner’s Confrontation Clause
argument, it is helpful to inventory exactly what Lambatos said on the stand about Cellmark. She testified to the
truth of the following matters: Cellmark was an accredited
lab, App. 49; the ISP occasionally sent forensic samples to
Cellmark for DNA testing, ibid.; according to shipping
manifests admitted into evidence, the ISP lab sent vaginal
swabs taken from the victim to Cellmark and later received those swabs back from Cellmark, id., at 52–55; and,
finally, the Cellmark DNA profile matched a profile produced by the ISP lab from a sample of petitioner’s blood,
id., at 55–56. Lambatos had personal knowledge of all
of these matters, and therefore none of this testimony infringed petitioner’s confrontation right.
Lambatos did not testify to the truth of any other matter
concerning Cellmark. She made no other reference to the
Cellmark report, which was not admitted into evidence
and was not seen by the trier of fact. Nor did she testify to
anything that was done at the Cellmark lab, and she did
not vouch for the quality of Cellmark’s work.
