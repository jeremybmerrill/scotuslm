WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
BREYER, J., concurring

suspicion or exonerated from mistaken conviction”). I find
this plausible. But cf. Innocence Network Brief 3. An
interpretation of the Clause that risks greater prosecution
reliance upon less reliable evidence cannot be sound. Cf.
Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845 (1990) (“The central
concern of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant”).
Consequently, I would consider reports such as the DNA
report before us presumptively to lie outside the perimeter
of the Clause as established by the Court’s precedents.
Such a holding leaves the defendant free to call the laboratory employee as a witness if the employee is available.
Moreover, should the defendant provide good reason to
doubt the laboratory’s competence or the validity of its
accreditation, then the alternative safeguard of reliability
would no longer exist and the Constitution would entitle
defendant to Confrontation Clause protection. Similarly,
should the defendant demonstrate the existence of a motive to falsify, then the alternative safeguard of honesty
would no longer exist and the Constitution would entitle
the defendant to Confrontation Clause protection. Cf. 2
Wigmore, Evidence §1527, at 1892 (in respect to the business records exception, “there must have been no motive
to misrepresent”). Thus, the defendant would remain free
to show the absence or inadequacy of the alternative
reliability/honesty safeguards, thereby rebutting the presumption and making the Confrontation Clause applicable.
No one has suggested any such problem in respect to
the Cellmark Report at issue here.
Because the plurality’s opinion is basically consistent
with the views set forth here, I join that opinion in full.
