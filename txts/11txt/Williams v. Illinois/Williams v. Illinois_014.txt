WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
Opinion of ALITO, J.

graded before Cellmark analyzed it, Lambatos answered
that, while degradation was technically possible, she
strongly doubted it had occurred in this case. She gave
two reasons. First, the ISP lab likely would have noticed
the degradation before sending the evidence off to Cellmark. Second, and more important, Lambatos also noted
that the data making up the DNA profile would exhibit certain telltale signs if it had been deduced from a
degraded sample: The visual representation of the DNA
sequence would exhibit “specific patterns” of degradation,
and she “didn’t see any evidence” of that from looking at
the profile that Cellmark produced. Id., at 81–82.
When Lambatos finished testifying, the defense moved
to exclude her testimony “with regards to testing done by
[Cellmark]” based on the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 90.
Defense counsel argued that there was “no evidence with
regards to . . . any work done by [Cellmark] to justify
testimony coming into this case with regard to their analysis.” Ibid. Thus, while defense counsel objected to and
sought the exclusion of Lambatos’ testimony insofar as it
implicated events at the Cellmark lab, defense counsel did
not object to or move for the exclusion of any other portion
of Lambatos’ testimony, including statements regarding
the contents of the shipment sent to or received back from
Cellmark. See id., at 55, 56, 90. See also 385 Ill. App. 3d
359, 367–368, 895 N. E. 2d 961, 968 (2008) (chain-ofcustody argument based on shipping manifests waived).
The prosecution responded that petitioner’s Confrontation Clause rights were satisfied because he had the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who had testified
that there was a match between the DNA profiles produced by Cellmark and Abbinanti. App. 91. Invoking
Illinois Rule of Evidence 703,1 the prosecutor argued that
