WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
KAGAN, J., dissenting

And Melendez-Diaz made yet a more fundamental point
in response to claims of the über alles reliability of scientific evidence: It is not up to us to decide, ex ante, what
evidence is trustworthy and what is not. See 557 U. S., at
317–318; see also Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
11). That is because the Confrontation Clause prescribes
its own “procedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials.” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 67. That
procedure is cross-examination. And “[d]ispensing with
[it] because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously
guilty.” Id., at 62.
So the plurality’s second basis for denying Williams’s
right of confrontation also fails. The plurality can find no
reason consistent with our precedents for treating the
Cellmark report as nontestimonial. That is because the
report is, in every conceivable respect, a statement meant
to serve as evidence in a potential criminal trial. And that
simple fact should be sufficient to resolve the question.
B
JUSTICE THOMAS’s unique method of defining testimonial statements fares no better. On his view, the Confrontation Clause “regulates only the use of statements
bearing ‘indicia of solemnity.’ ” Ante, at 8 (quoting Davis,
547 U. S., at 836–837). And Cellmark’s report, he concludes, does not qualify because it is “neither a sworn nor a
certified declaration of fact.” Ante, at 9. But JUSTICE
THOMAS’s approach grants constitutional significance to
minutia, in a way that can only undermine the Confrontation Clause’s protections.

kinds of evidence that produce erroneous convictions—disagrees with
the plurality’s and JUSTICE BREYER’s view. It argues here that “[c]onfrontation of the analyst . . . is essential to permit proper adversarial
testing” and so to decrease the risk of convicting the innocent. Brief
