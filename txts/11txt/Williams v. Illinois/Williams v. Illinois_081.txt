WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
KAGAN, J., dissenting

surrogate testimony expose any lapses or lies” on the
testing analyst’s part. Ibid. Like the lawyers in MelendezDiaz and Bullcoming, Williams’s attorney could not ask
questions about that analyst’s “proficiency, the care he
took in performing his work, and his veracity.” 564 U. S.,
at ___, n. 7 (slip op., at 12, n. 7). He could not probe
whether the analyst had tested the wrong vial, inverted
the labels on the samples, committed some more technical
error, or simply made up the results. See App. to Brief for

Cellmark’s operations. Indeed, for all the record discloses,
she may never have set foot in Cellmark’s laboratory.

The plurality’s primary argument to the contrary tries

Crawford. “The Clause,” we cautioned there, “does not bar
the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than
establishing the truth of the matter asserted.” 541 U. S.,
at 59–60, n. 9 (citing Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409,
414 (1985)). The Illinois Supreme Court relied on that
statement in concluding that Lambatos’s testimony was
permissible. On that court’s view, “Lambatos disclosed
