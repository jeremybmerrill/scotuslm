Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.

APPENDIX
This appendix outlines the way that a typical modern forensic laboratory conducts DNA analysis. See NY County
DAO Brief 7–8; NDAA Brief 22–23; Innocence Network
Brief 13–23; see also Dept. of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, The FBI DNA Laboratory: A Review of Protocol and Practice Vulnerabilities 6–14 (May 2004), online at
http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/0405/final.pdf (as visited
June 14, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).
The DNA analysis takes place in three parts, through
three different sets of laboratory experts: (1) a DNA profile is derived from the suspect’s DNA sample, (2) a DNA
profile is derived from the crime-scene DNA sample, and
(3) an analyst compares the two profiles and makes a
conclusion.
As many as six technicians may be involved in deriving
the profile from the suspect’s sample; as many as six more
technicians may be involved in deriving the profile from
the crime-scene sample; and an additional expert may
then be required for the comparative analysis, for a total
of about a dozen different laboratory experts. Each expert
may make technical statements (express or implied) during the DNA analysis process that are in turn relied upon
by other experts. The amici dispute how many of these
experts the Confrontation Clause requires to be subject to
cross-examination. Compare Innocence Network Brief 13–
23 with NY County DAO Brief 7–8 and NDAA Brief 22–
23. In charting the three-step process, the appendix first
summarizes the laboratory procedures used to derive a
DNA profile and then illustrates potential statements that
technicians may make to explain their analysis.
