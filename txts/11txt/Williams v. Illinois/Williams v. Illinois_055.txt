WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS 

BREYER, J., concurring
Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J. 


A. Profile of Suspectâ€™s Sample (Summary of Lab Process)
1. Technician #1:
Evidence Examination
Forensics lab receives
crime-scene evidence.
Tech #1 examines the
evidence for biological
fluids/materials and tests
whether the results reveal
the presence of a biological
sample. If present, Tech
#1 takes cuttings or
swabbings from evidence
for DNA extraction.
4. Technician #4:
Amplification
Tech #4 amplifies (copies)
the extracted DNA using
polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), i.e., uses a highly
automated process to target, tag, and copy specific
locations (loci), raising
them to a detectable level.

5. Technicians #5 and #6:
Electrophoresis

2. Technician #2:
Extraction
Tech #2 extracts DNA
from cuttings or swabbings, i.e., adds chemical reagents to the
sample that break open
the cells and free up the
DNA so that it is accessible for testing.

3. Technician #3:
Quantification
Tech #3 measures the
amount of DNA that is
present in the sample to
ensure that there is
enough DNA for testing.
6. Technicians
#5 and #6: Report
Techs #5 and #6 use
software to determine
allele calls (i.e.,
length) and produce a
report. The software
measures the length
of the DNA fragments
produced by electrophoresis, determines
the alleles that correspond to the fragments, and compiles a
DNA profile for the
sample. The Techs
record what the allele
values are at each loci
analyzed, which, once
compiled, constitute a
DNA profile.
