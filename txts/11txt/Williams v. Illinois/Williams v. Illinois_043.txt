WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
BREYER, J., concurring

Experts—especially laboratory experts—regularly rely on
the technical statements and results of other experts to
form their own opinions. The reality of the matter is that
the introduction of a laboratory report involves layer upon
layer of technical statements (express or implied) made by
one expert and relied upon by another. Hence my general
question: How does the Confrontation Clause apply to
crime laboratory reports and underlying technical statements made by laboratory technicians?

The general question is not easy to answer. The California case described at the outset of the dissenting opinion helps to illustrate the difficulty. In that example,
Cellmark, the very laboratory involved in this case, tested
a DNA sample taken from the crime scene. A laboratory
analyst, relying upon a report the laboratory had prepared,
initially stated (at a pretrial hearing about admissibility) that the laboratory had found that the crime-scene
DNA sample matched a sample of the defendant’s DNA.
But during the hearing and after reviewing the laboratory’s notes, the laboratory analyst realized that the
written report was mistaken. In fact, the testing showed
only that the crime-scene DNA matched a sample of the
victim’s DNA, not the defendant’s DNA. At some point
during the writing of the report, someone, perhaps the
testifying analyst herself, must have misread the proper
original sample labeling. Upon discovering the error, the
analyst corrected her testimony.
The example is useful, not simply because as adapted
it might show the importance of cross-examination (an
importance no one doubts), but also because it can reveal
the nature of the more general question before us. When
the laboratory in the example received the DNA samples,
it labeled them properly. The laboratory’s final report
mixed up the labels. Any one of many different techni-
