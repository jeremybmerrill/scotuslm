WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
BREYER, J., concurring

necessary modifications of statements made in the opinions of those earlier cases.

In the absence of reargument, I adhere to the dissenting
view set forth in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, under
which the Cellmark report would not be considered “testimonial” and barred by the Confrontation Clause. See

view understands the Confrontation Clause as interpreted
in Crawford to bar the admission of “[t]estimonial” statements made out of court unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to crossexamine. 541 U. S., at 59 (emphasis added). It also
understands the word “testimonial” as having outer limits

for doing so and Crawford’s basic rationale does not apply.
In particular, the States could create an exception that

technical competence or its neutrality, the presumptive
exception would disappear, thereby requiring the prosecution to produce any relevant technical witnesses. Such

embodies technical or professional data, observations, and
judgments; the employees who contributed to the report’s
findings were professional analysts working on technical
matters at a certified laboratory; and the employees operated behind a veil of ignorance that likely prevented them
