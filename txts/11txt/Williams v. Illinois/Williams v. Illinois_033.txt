Opinion of ALITO, J.

prevent such abuses. First, trial courts can screen out
experts who would act as mere conduits for hearsay by
strictly enforcing the requirement that experts display
some genuine “scientific, technical, or other specialized
knowledge [that] will help the trier of fact to understand
the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Fed. Rule
Evid. 702(a). Second, experts are generally precluded
from disclosing inadmissible evidence to a jury. See Fed.
Rule Evid. 703; People v. Pasch, 152 Ill. 2d 133, 175–176,
604 N. E. 2d 294, 310–311 (1992). Third, if such evidence
is disclosed, the trial judges may and, under most circumstances, must, instruct the jury that out-of-court statements cannot be accepted for their truth, and that an
expert’s opinion is only as good as the independent evidence that establishes its underlying premises. See Fed.
Rules Evid. 105, 703; People v. Scott, 148 Ill. 2d 479, 527–
528, 594 N. E. 2d 217, 236–237 (1992). And fourth, if the
prosecution cannot muster any independent admissible
evidence to prove the foundational facts that are essential
to the relevance of the expert’s testimony, then the expert’s testimony cannot be given any weight by the trier of
fact.12

“The problem with [the not-for-the-truth-of-the-matter argument
accepted by the Illinois courts] is that Lambatos had to rely on the
truth of the statements in the Cellmark report to reach her own conclusion. The claim that evidence that the jury must credit in order to
credit the conclusion of the expert is introduced for something other
than its truth is sheer fiction.” New Wigmore §4.11.6, at 24 (2012
Supp.) (emphasis added).
This discussion is flawed. It overlooks the fact that there was no jury
in this case, and as we have explained, the trier of fact did not have to
rely on any testimonial hearsay in order to find that Lambatos’ testimony about the DNA match was supported by adequate foundational
evidence and was thus probative.
12 Our discussion of the first ground for our decision cannot conclude
without commenting on the Kocak case, which dramatically appears at
the beginning of the dissent. In that case, a Cellmark lab analyst
