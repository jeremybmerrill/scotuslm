Opinion of ALITO, J.

because there is simply no plausible explanation for how
Cellmark could have produced a DNA profile that matched
Williams’ if Cellmark had tested any sample other than
the one taken from the victim. If any other items that
might have contained Williams’ DNA had been sent
to Cellmark or were otherwise in Cellmark’s possession,
there would have been a chance of a mix-up or of crosscontamination. See District Attorney’s Office for Third
Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. 52, 80 (2009) (ALITO,
J., concurring). But there is absolutely nothing to suggest
that Cellmark had any such items. Thus, the fact that the
Cellmark profile matched Williams—the very man whom
the victim identified in a lineup and at trial as her attacker—was itself striking confirmation that the sample
that Cellmark tested was the sample taken from the victim’s
vaginal swabs. For these reasons, it is fanciful to suggest
that the trial judge took Lambatos’ testimony as providing
critical chain-of-custody evidence.
C
Other than the phrase that Lambatos used in referring
to the Cellmark profile, no specific passage in the trial
record has been identified as violating the Confrontation
Clause, but it is nevertheless suggested that the State
somehow introduced “the substance of Cellmark’s report
into evidence.” Post, at 8 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). The
main impetus for this argument appears to be the (erroneous) view that unless the substance of the report was
sneaked in, there would be insufficient evidence in the
record on two critical points: first, that the Cellmark
profile was based on the semen in the victim’s vaginal
swabs and, second, that Cellmark’s procedures were reliable. This argument is both legally irrelevant for present
purposes and factually incorrect.

have taken Lambatos’ statement as providing “the missing link.”
