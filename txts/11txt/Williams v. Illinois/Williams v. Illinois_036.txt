WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS
Opinion of ALITO, J.

the confrontation right, the statement at issue had the
primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.

In Hammon, the one case in which an informal statement was held to violate the Confrontation Clause, we
considered statements elicited in the course of police interrogation. We held that a statement does not fall
within the ambit of the Clause when it is made “under
circumstances objectively indicating that the primary
purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance
to meet an ongoing emergency.” 547 U. S., at 822. In
Bryant, another police-interrogation case, we explained
that a person who makes a statement to resolve an ongoing emergency is not acting like a trial witness because
the declarant’s purpose is not to provide a solemn declaration for use at trial, but to bring an end to an ongoing
threat. See 562 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11, 14). We
noted that “the prospect of fabrication . . . is presumably
significantly diminished” when a statement is made under
such circumstances, id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) and that
reliability is a salient characteristic of a statement that
falls outside the reach of the Confrontation Clause, id., at
___–___ (slip op., at 14–15). We emphasized that if a
statement is not made for “the primary purpose of creating
an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony,” its admissibility “is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence,
not the Confrontation Clause.” Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at
11–12).
In Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, the Court held that
the particular forensic reports at issue qualified as testimonial statements, but the Court did not hold that all
forensic reports fall into the same category. Introduction
of the reports in those cases ran afoul of the Confrontation
Clause because they were the equivalent of affidavits
made for the purpose of proving the guilt of a particular
