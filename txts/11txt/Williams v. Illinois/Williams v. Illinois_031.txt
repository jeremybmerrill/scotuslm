Opinion of ALITO, J.

not depend on factual premises unsupported by other
evidence in the record—not to prove the truth of the underlying facts.
Perhaps because it cannot seriously dispute the legitimate nonhearsay purpose of illuminating the expert’s
thought process, the dissent resorts to the last-ditch argument that, after all, it really does not matter whether
Lambatos’ statement regarding the source of the Cellmark
report was admitted for its truth. The dissent concedes
that “the trial judge might have ignored Lambatos’s

statement in question for its truth, there is simply no way

Clause applies only to out-of-court statements that are
“use[d]” to “establis[h] the truth of the matter asserted.”

alcohol level exceeded the legal limit and in MelendezDiaz that the substance in question contained cocaine.
Nothing comparable happened here. In this case, the
