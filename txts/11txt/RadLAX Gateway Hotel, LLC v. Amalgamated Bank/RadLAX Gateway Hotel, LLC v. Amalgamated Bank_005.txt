Opinion of the Court

the Bank itself might wish to obtain the property if
the alternative would be receiving auction proceeds that
fall short of the property’s full value. Under the debtors’
proposed auction procedures, however, the Bank would
not be permitted to bid for the property using the debt it is
owed to offset the purchase price, a practice known as
“credit-bidding.” Instead, the Bank would be forced to bid
cash. Correctly anticipating that the Bank would object to
this arrangement, the debtors sought to confirm their plan
under the cramdown provisions of §1129(b)(2)(A).
The Bankruptcy Court denied the debtors’ Sale and Bid
Procedures Motion, concluding that the proposed auction
procedures did not comply with §1129(b)(2)(A)’s requirements for cramdown plans. In re River Road Hotel Partners, LLC, Case No. 09 B 30029 (ND Ill., Oct. 5, 2010),
App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a. The Bankruptcy Court certified
an appeal directly to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit. That court accepted the certification and affirmed, holding that §1129(b)(2)(A) does not
permit debtors to sell an encumbered asset free and clear
of a lien without permitting the lienholder to credit-bid.

Bank, 651 F. 3d 642 (2011). We granted certiorari. 565
