RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK
Syllabus
creditor to credit-bid at the sale—and provide the creditor with a lien
on the sale proceeds, §1129(b)(2)(A)(ii); or the plan may provide the
secured creditor with the “indubitable equivalent” of its claim,
§1129(b)(2)(A)(iii).
Here, the debtors proposed to sell their property free and clear of
the Bank’s liens and repay the Bank with the sale proceeds, as contemplated by clause (ii). Because the debtors’ auction procedures do
not permit the Bank to credit-bid, however, the proposed sale cannot
satisfy the requirements of clause (ii). The debtors claim their plan
can instead satisfy clause (iii) by providing the Bank with the “indubitable equivalent” of its secured claim, in the form of cash generated
by the auction.
The debtors’ reading of §1129(b)(2)(A), under which clause (iii)
permits precisely what clause (ii) proscribes, is hyperliteral and contrary to common sense. “[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general.” Morales v. Trans World
Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384. Here, where general and specific
authorizations exist side-by-side, the general/specific canon avoids
rendering superfluous a specific provision that is swallowed by the
general one. See D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204,
208. As applied to §1129(b)(2)(A), the canon provides that the “general language” of clause (iii), “although broad enough to include it,
will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with” in clause
(ii). 285 U. S., at 208. Although the canon can be overcome by other
textual indications of statutory meaning, the debtors point to none
here. Pp. 3–8.
(b) None of the debtors’ objections to this approach is valid. Pp. 8–
9.

651 F. 3d 642, affirmed.
SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other
Members joined, except KENNEDY, J., who took no part in the decision of
the case.
