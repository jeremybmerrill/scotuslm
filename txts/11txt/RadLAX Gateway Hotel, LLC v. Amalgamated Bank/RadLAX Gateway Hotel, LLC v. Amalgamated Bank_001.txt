RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC, ET AL. v. 

AMALGAMATED BANK

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 11–166.

Argued April 23, 2012—Decided May 29, 2012

To finance the purchase of a commercial property and associated renovation and construction costs, petitioners (debtors) obtained a secured loan from an investment fund, for which respondent (Bank)
serves as trustee. The debtors ultimately became insolvent, and
sought relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant
to 11 U. S. C. §1129(b)(2)(A), the debtors sought to confirm a
“cramdown” bankruptcy plan over the Bank’s objection. That plan
proposed selling substantially all of the debtors’ property at an auction, and using the sale proceeds to repay the Bank. Under the debtors’ proposed auction procedures, the Bank would not be permitted to
bid for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase
price, a practice known as “credit-bidding.” The Bankruptcy Court
denied the debtors’ request, concluding that the auction procedures
did not comply with §1129(b)(2)(A)’s requirements for cramdown
plans. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that §1129(b)(2)(A)
does not permit debtors to sell an encumbered asset free and clear of
a lien without permitting the lienholder to credit-bid.
Held: The debtors may not obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11
cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear
of the Bank’s lien, but does not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the
sale. Pp. 3–10.
(a) A Chapter 11 plan proposed over the objection of a “class of secured claims” must meet one of three requirements in order to be
deemed “fair and equitable,” and therefore confirmable. The secured
creditor may retain its lien on the property and receive deferred cash
payments, §1129(b)(2)(A)(i); the debtors may sell the property free
and clear of the lien, “subject to section 363(k)”—which permits the
