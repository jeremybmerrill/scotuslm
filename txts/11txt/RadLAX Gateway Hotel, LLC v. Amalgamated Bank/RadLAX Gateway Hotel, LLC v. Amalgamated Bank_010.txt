RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK 

Opinion of the Court 


gests, to the contrary, that (i) is the rule for plans under
which the creditor’s lien remains on the property, (ii) is
the rule for plans under which the property is sold free
and clear of the creditor’s lien, and (iii) is a residual provision covering dispositions under all other plans—for example, one under which the creditor receives the property
itself, the “indubitable equivalent” of its secured claim.
Thus, debtors may not sell their property free of liens
under §1129(b)(2)(A) without allowing lienholders to
credit-bid, as required by clause (ii).
B
None of the debtors’ objections to this approach is valid.
The debtors’ principal textual argument is that
§1129(b)(2)(A) “unambiguously provides three distinct
options for confirming a Chapter 11 plan over the objection of a secured creditor.” Brief for Petitioners 15 (capitalization and bold typeface removed). With that much we
agree; the three clauses of §1129(b)(2)(A) are connected by
the disjunctive “or.” The debtors contend that our interpretation of §1129(b)(2)(A) “transforms ‘or’ into ‘and.’ ”
Reply Brief for Petitioners 3. But that is not so. The
question here is not whether debtors must comply with
more than one clause, but rather which one of the three
they must satisfy. Debtors seeking to sell their property
free of liens under §1129(b)(2)(A) must satisfy the requirements of clause (ii), not the requirements of both
clauses (ii) and (iii).
The debtors make several arguments against applying
the general/specific canon. They contend that clause (ii)
is no more specific than clause (iii), because the former
provides a procedural protection to secured creditors
(credit-bidding) while the latter provides a substantive
protection (indubitable equivalence). As a result, they say,
clause (ii) is not “a limiting subset” of clause (iii), which
(according to their view) application of the general/specific
