particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases
within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment. This rule applies
wherever an act contains general provisions and also
special ones upon a subject, which, standing alone, the

general rule, and clauses (i) and (ii) setting forth procedures that will always, ipso facto, establish an “indubitable equivalent,” with no need for judicial evaluation. But
the structure here would be a surpassingly strange manner of accomplishing that result—which would normally
be achieved by setting forth the “indubitable equivalent”
rule first (rather than last), and establishing the two safe
harbors as provisos to that rule. The structure here sug-
