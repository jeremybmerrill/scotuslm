10 RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK
Opinion of the Court

III
The parties debate at some length the purposes of the
Bankruptcy Code, pre-Code practices, and the merits of
credit-bidding. To varying extents, some of those debates
also occupied the attention of the Courts of Appeals that
considered the question presented here. See, e.g., In re
Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC, 599 F. 3d 298, 314–317
(CA3 2010); id., at 331–337 (Ambro, J., dissenting). But
nothing in the generalized statutory purpose of protecting
secured creditors can overcome the specific manner of that
protection which the text of §1129(b)(2)(A) contains. As
for pre-Code practices, they can be relevant to the interpretation of an ambiguous text, but we find no textual
ambiguity here. And the pros and cons of credit-bidding
are for the consideration of Congress, not the courts.
The Bankruptcy Code standardizes an expansive (and
sometimes unruly) area of law, and it is our obligation to
interpret the Code clearly and predictably using well
established principles of statutory construction.
See
United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235,
240–241 (1989). Under that approach, this is an easy case.
Because the RadLAX debtors may not obtain confirmation
of a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale
of collateral free and clear of the Bank’s lien, but does not
permit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale, we affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeals.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KENNEDY took no part in the decision of this
case.
