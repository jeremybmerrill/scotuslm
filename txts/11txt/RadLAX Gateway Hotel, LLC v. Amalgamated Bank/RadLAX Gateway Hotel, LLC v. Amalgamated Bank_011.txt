Opinion of the Court

canon requires. Brief for Petitioners 30–31; Reply Brief
for Petitioners 5–6. To begin with, we know of no authority for the proposition that the canon is confined to situations in which the entirety of the specific provision is a
“subset” of the general one. When the conduct at issue
falls within the scope of both provisions, the specific presumptively governs, whether or not the specific provision
also applies to some conduct that falls outside the general.
In any case, we think clause (ii) is entirely a subset.
Clause (iii) applies to all cramdown plans, which include
all of the plans within the more narrow category described
in clause (ii).4 That its requirements are “substantive”
whereas clause (ii)’s are “procedural” is quite beside the
point. What counts for application of the general/specific
canon is not the nature of the provisions’ prescriptions but
their scope.
Finally, the debtors contend that the Court of Appeals
conflated approval of bid procedures with plan confirmation. Brief for Petitioners 39. They claim the right to
pursue their auction now, leaving it for the Bankruptcy
Judge to determine, at the confirmation stage, whether
the resulting plan (funded by auction proceeds) provides
the Bank with the “indubitable equivalent” of its secured
claim. Under our interpretation of §1129(b)(2)(A), however, that approach is simply a nonstarter. As a matter of
law, no bid procedures like the ones proposed here could
satisfy the requirements of §1129(b)(2)(A), and the distinction between approval of bid procedures and plan confirmation is therefore irrelevant.

——————
4 We are speaking here about whether clause (ii) is a subset for purposes of determining whether the canon applies. As we have described
earlier, after applying the canon—ex post, so to speak—it ceases to be a
subset, governing a situation to which clause (iii) will no longer be
deemed applicable.
