ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS
Opinion of the Court

See id., at 4a–5a. (For example, homes helped by the
Brisbane/Manning Project, at a cost of more than $9,000
each, were then valued at $120,000 to $270,000. App. 67.)
The City’s new STEP method of financing would charge
each connecting lot owner a flat $2,500 fee and make up
the difference by floating bonds eventually paid for by all
lot owners citywide. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, n. 5.
On October 31, 2005, the City enacted an ordinance
implementing its decision. In December, the City’s Board
of Public Works enacted a further resolution, Resolution
101, which, as part of the transition, would “forgive all
assessment amounts . . . established pursuant to the Bar­
rett Law Funding for Municipal Sewer programs due and
owing from the date of November 1, 2005 forward.” App.
72 (emphasis added). In its preamble, the Resolution said
that the Barrett Law “may present financial hardships on
many middle to lower income participants who most need
sanitary sewer service in lieu of failing septic systems”;
it pointed out that the City was transitioning to the new
STEP method of financing; and it said that the STEP
method was based upon a financial model that had “con­
sidered the current assessments being made by partici­
pants in active Barrett Law projects” as well as future
projects. Id., at 71–72. The upshot was that those who
still owed Barrett Law assessments would not have to
make further payments but those who had already paid
their assessments would not receive refunds. This meant
that homeowners who had paid the full $9,278 Brisbane/
Manning Project assessment in a lump sum the preceding year would receive no refund, while homeowners
who had elected to pay the assessment in installments, and
had paid a total of $309.27, $463.90, or $927.80, would
be under no obligation to make further payments.
In February 2006, the 38 homeowners who had paid the
full Brisbane/Manning Project assessment asked the City
for a partial refund (in an amount equal to the smallest
