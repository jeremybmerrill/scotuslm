ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS
Opinion of the Court

II

A

As long as the City’s distinction has a rational basis,
that distinction does not violate the Equal Protection
Clause. This Court has long held that “a classification
neither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along
suspect lines . . . cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection
Clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental
purpose.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319–320 (1993); cf.
Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, 155, 165–166
(1897). We have made clear in analogous contexts that,
where “ordinary commercial transactions” are at issue, rational basis review requires deference to reasonable under­
lying legislative judgments. United States v. Carolene
Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938) (due process);
see also New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976)
(per curiam) (equal protection). And we have repeatedly
pointed out that “[l]egislatures have especially broad
latitude in creating classifications and distinctions in tax
statutes.” Regan v. Taxation With Representation of
Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 547 (1983); see also Fitzgerald v.
Racing Assn. of Central Iowa, 539 U. S. 103, 107–108
(2003); Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11 (1992);
Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356,
359 (1973); Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 87–88
(1940); Citizens’ Telephone Co. of Grand Rapids v. Fuller,
229 U. S. 322, 329 (1913).
Indianapolis’ classification involves neither a “funda­
mental right” nor a “suspect” classification. Its subject
matter is local, economic, social, and commercial. It is a
tax classification. And no one here claims that Indianapo­
lis has discriminated against out-of-state commerce or new
residents. Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472
U. S. 612 (1985); Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (1985);
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (1985);
