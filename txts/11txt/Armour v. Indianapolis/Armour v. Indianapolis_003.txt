Syllabus
sidered here, since the City’s administrative concerns are sufficient to
show a rational basis for its distinction. Petitioners propose other
forgiveness systems that they argue are superior to the City’s system,
but the Constitution only requires that the line actually drawn by the
City be rational. Petitioners further argue that administrative considerations alone should not justify a tax distinction lest a city justify
an unfair system through insubstantial administrative considerations. Here it was rational for the City to draw a line that avoided
the administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small
sums for years to come. Petitioners have not shown that the administrative concerns are too insubstantial to justify the classification.
Finally, petitioners argue that precedent makes it more difficult for
the City to show a rational basis, but the cases to which they refer
involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence. The
one exception, Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336, is distinguishable. Pp. 10–14.
