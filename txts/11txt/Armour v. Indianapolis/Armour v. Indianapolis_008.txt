Opinion of the Court

forgiven Brisbane/Manning installment debt, apparently
$8,062). The City denied the request in part because
“[r]efunding payments made in your project area, or any
portion of the payments, would establish a precedent of
unfair and inequitable treatment to all other property
owners who have also paid Barrett Law assessments . . .
and while [the November 1, 2005, cutoff date] might seem
arbitrary to you, it is essential for the City to establish
this date and move forward with the new funding ap­
proach.” Id., at 50–51.
C
Thirty-one of the thirty-eight Brisbane/Manning Project
lump-sum homeowners brought this lawsuit in Indiana
state court seeking a refund of about $8,000 each. They
claimed in relevant part that the City’s refusal to provide
them with refunds at the same time that the City forgave
the outstanding Project debts of other Brisbane/Manning
homeowners violated the Federal Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, §1; see also Rev. Stat. §1979,
42 U. S. C. §1983. The trial court granted summary
judgment in their favor. The State Court of Appeals af­
firmed that judgment. 918 N. E. 2d 401 (2009). But the
Indiana Supreme Court reversed. 946 N. E. 2d 553 (2011).
In its view, the City’s distinction between those who had
already paid their Barrett Law assessments and those
who had not was “rationally related to its legitimate inter­
ests in reducing its administrative costs, providing relief
for property owners experiencing financial hardship,
establishing a clear transition from [the] Barrett Law to
STEP, and preserving its limited resources.” App. to Pet.
for Cert. 19a. We granted certiorari to consider the equal
protection question. And we now affirm the Indiana Su­
preme Court.
