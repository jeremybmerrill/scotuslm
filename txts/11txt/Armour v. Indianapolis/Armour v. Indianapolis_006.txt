B
This case concerns one of the 24 still-open Barrett Law
projects, namely the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers
Project. The Brisbane/Manning Project began in 2001. It
connected about 180 homes to the City’s sewage system.
Construction was completed in 2003. The Indianapolis
Board of Public Works held an assessment hearing in
June 2004. And in July 2004 the Board sent the 180
affected homeowners a formal notice of their payment
obligations.
The notice made clear that each homeowner could pay
the entire assessment—$9,278 per property—in a lump
sum or in installments, which would include interest at a
3.5% annual rate. Under an installment plan, payments
would amount to $77.27 per month for 10 years; $38.66
per month for 20 years; or $25.77 per month for 30 years.
In the event, 38 homeowners chose to pay up front; 47
chose the 10-year plan; 27 chose the 20-year plan; and 68
chose the 30-year plan. And in the first year each home­
owner paid the amount due ($9,278 upfront; $927.80
under the 10-year plan; $463.90 under the 20-year plan, or
$309.27 under the 30-year plan). App. to Pet. for Cert.
48a.
The next year, however, the City decided to abandon the
Barrett Law method of financing. It thought that the
Barrett Law’s lot-by-lot payments had become too burden­
some for many homeowners to pay, discouraging changes
from less healthy septic tanks to healthier sewer systems.
