ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS
Opinion of the Court

I

A

Beginning in 1889 Indiana’s Barrett Law permitted
cities to pay for public improvements, such as sewage projects, by “apportion[ing]” the costs of a project “equally
among all abutting lands or lots.” Ind. Code §36–9–39–
15(b)(3) (2011); see Town Council of New Harmony v.
Parker, 726 N. E. 2d 1217, 1227, n. 13 (Ind. 2000) (proj­
ect’s beneficiaries pay its costs). When a city built a Bar­
rett Law project, the city’s public works board would
create an initial lot-owner assessment by “dividing the
estimated total cost of the sewage works by the total num­
ber of lots.” §36–9–39–16(a). It might then adjust an
individual assessment downward if the lot would benefit
less than would others. §36–9–39–17(b). Upon completion
of the project, the board would issue a final lot-by-lot
assessment.
The Law permitted lot owners to pay the assessment
either in a single lump sum or over time in installment
payments (with interest). The City would collect install­
ment payments “in the same manner as other taxes.”
§36–9–37–6. The Law authorized 10-, 20-, or 30-year
installment plans. §36–9–37–8.5(a). Until fully paid, an
assessment would constitute a lien against the property,
permitting the city to initiate foreclosure proceedings in
case of a default. §§36–9–37–9(b), –22.
For several decades, Indianapolis used the Barrett Law
system to fund sewer projects. See, e.g., Conley v. Brummit, 92 Ind. App. 620, 621, 176 N. E. 880, 881 (1931) (in
banc). But in 2005, the City adopted a new system, called
the Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP), which financed projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering in­
dividual lot owners’ sewer-connection costs. By that time,
the City had constructed more than 40 Barrett Law
projects. App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a. We are told that
installment-paying lot owners still owed money in respect
