CHRISTINE ARMOUR, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. CITY

OF INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

INDIANA

[June 4, 2012]


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
For many years, an Indiana statute, the “Barrett Law,”
authorized Indiana’s cities to impose upon benefited lot
owners the cost of sewer improvement projects. The Law
also permitted those lot owners to pay either immediately
in the form of a lump sum or over time in installments.
In 2005, the city of Indianapolis (City) adopted a new assessment and payment method, the “STEP” plan, and it
forgave any Barrett Law installments that lot owners had
not yet paid.
A group of lot owners who had already paid their entire
Barrett Law assessment in a lump sum believe that the
City should have provided them with equivalent refunds.
And we must decide whether the City’s refusal to do so unconstitutionally discriminates against them in violation
of the Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, §1. We hold
that the City had a rational basis for distinguishing be­
tween those lot owners who had already paid their share
of project costs and those who had not. And we conclude
that there is no equal protection violation.
