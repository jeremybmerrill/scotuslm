ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS
Opinion of the Court

payments, taxes, or parking tickets. E.g., 26 U. S. C.
§108(a)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (federal income tax
provision allowing homeowners to omit from gross income
newly forgiven home mortgage debt); United States v.
Martin, 523 F. 3d 281, 284 (CA4 2008) (tax amnesty pro­
gram whereby State newly forgave penalties and liabili­
ties if taxpayer satisfied debt); Horn v. Chicago, 860 F. 2d

program whereby outstanding tickets could be newly set­

they argue that the tax distinction before us would not
necessarily favor low-income homeowners.
We need not consider this argument, however, for the
administrative considerations we have mentioned are
sufficient to show a rational basis for the City’s distinc­

to Pet. for Cert. 19a (emphasis added). The record of the
City’s proceedings is consistent with that determination.
See App. 72 (when developing transition, the City “consid­
ered the current assessments being made by participants
in active Barrett Law projects”). In any event, a legisla­
