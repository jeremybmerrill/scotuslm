Opinion of the Court

Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55 (1982). Hence, this case
falls directly within the scope of our precedents holding
such a law constitutionally valid if “there is a plausible
policy reason for the classification, the legislative facts
on which the classification is apparently based rationally
may have been considered to be true by the governmental
decisionmaker, and the relationship of the classification to
its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction
arbitrary or irrational.” Nordlinger, supra, at 11 (citations
omitted). And it falls within the scope of our precedents
holding that there is such a plausible reason if “there is
any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could pro­
vide a rational basis for the classification.” FCC v. Beach
Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313 (1993); see also
Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U. S. 61, 78
(1911).
Moreover, analogous precedent warns us that we are not
to “pronounc[e]” this classification “unconstitutional un­
less in the light of the facts made known or generally
assumed it is of such a character as to preclude the as­
sumption that it rests upon some rational basis within
the knowledge and experience of the legislators.” Carolene
Products Co., supra, at 152 (due process claim). Further,
because the classification is presumed constitutional, the
“ ‘ burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrange­
ment to negative every conceivable basis which might
support it.’ ” Heller, supra, at 320 (quoting Lehnhausen,
supra, at 364).

In our view, Indianapolis’ classification has a rational
basis. Ordinarily, administrative considerations can justify a tax-related distinction. See, e.g., Carmichael v.
Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S. 495, 511–512 (1937)
(tax exemption for businesses with fewer than eight em­
ployees rational in light of the “[a]dministrative conven­
