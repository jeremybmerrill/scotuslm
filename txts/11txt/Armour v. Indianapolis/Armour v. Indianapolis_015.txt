ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS
Opinion of the Court

(any more than they can always do so). The question is
whether reducing those expenses, in the particular cir­
cumstances, provides a rational basis justifying the tax
difference in question.
In this case, “in the light of the facts made known or
generally assumed,” Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S., at
152, it is reasonable to believe that to graft a refund sys­
tem onto the City’s forgiveness decision could have (for
example) imposed an administrative burden of both col­
lecting and paying out small sums (say, $25 per month) for
years. As we have said, supra, at 7–9, it is rational for the
City to draw a line that avoids that burden. Petitioners,
who are the ones “attacking the legislative arrangement,”
have the burden of showing that the circumstances are
otherwise, i.e., that the administrative burden is too in­
substantial to justify the classification. That they have
not done.
Finally, petitioners point to precedent that in their view
makes it more difficult than we have said for the City to
show a “rational basis.” With but one exception, however,
the cases to which they refer involve discrimination based
on residence or length of residence. E.g., Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612 (state tax preference
distinguishing between long-term and short-term resident
veterans); Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (state use tax
that burdened out-of-state car buyers who moved in-state);
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (state
law that taxed out-of-state insurance companies at a
higher rate than in-state companies); Zobel v. Williams,
457 U. S. 55 (state dividend distribution system that
favored long-term residents). But those circumstances are
not present here.
The exception consists of Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co.
v. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989). The
Court there took into account a state constitution and
related laws that required equal valuation of equally
