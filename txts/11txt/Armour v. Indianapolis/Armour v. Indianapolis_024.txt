ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Pittsburgh was such a case; so is this one. Indiana law
promised neighboring homeowners that they would be
treated equally when it came to paying for sewer hookups. The City then ended up charging some homeowners
30 times what it charged their neighbors for the same
hook-ups. The equal protection violation is plain. I would
accordingly reverse the decision of the Indiana Supreme
Court, and respectfully dissent from the Courtâ€™s decision
to do otherwise.
