PANAGIS VARTELAS, PETITIONER v. ERIC H. 

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[March 28, 2012]


JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
Panagis Vartelas, a native of Greece, became a lawful
permanent resident of the United States in 1989. He
pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit
security) in 1994, and served a prison sentence of four
months for that offense. Vartelas traveled to Greece in
2003 to visit his parents. On his return to the United
States a week later, he was treated as an inadmissible
alien and placed in removal proceedings. Under the law
governing at the time of Vartelas’ plea, an alien in his
situation could travel abroad for brief periods without
jeopardizing his resident alien status. See 8 U. S. C.
§1101(a)(13) (1988 ed.), as construed in Rosenberg v.
Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449 (1963).
In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), 110
Stat. 3009–546. That Act effectively precluded foreign
travel by lawful permanent residents who had a conviction
like Vartelas’. Under IIRIRA, such aliens, on return from
a sojourn abroad, however brief, may be permanently
removed from the United States.
See 8 U. S. C.
