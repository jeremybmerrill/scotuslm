VARTELAS v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

§1101(a)(13)(C)(v); §1182(a)(2).
This case presents a question of retroactivity not addressed by Congress: As to a lawful permanent resident
convicted of a crime before the effective date of IIRIRA,
which regime governs, the one in force at the time of
the conviction, or IIRIRA? If the former, Vartelas’ brief
trip abroad would not disturb his lawful permanent resident status. If the latter, he may be denied reentry. We
conclude that the relevant provision of IIRIRA,
§1101(a)(13)(C)(v), attached a new disability (denial of
reentry) in respect to past events (Vartelas’ pre-IIRIRA
offense, plea, and conviction). Guided by the deeply rooted
presumption against retroactive legislation, we hold that
§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to Vartelas’ conviction.
The impact of Vartelas’ brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is therefore determined not by
IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his
conviction.

Before IIRIRA’s passage, United States immigration law
established “two types of proceedings in which aliens can
be denied the hospitality of the United States: deportation
hearings and exclusion hearings.” Landon v. Plasencia,
459 U. S. 21, 25 (1982). Exclusion hearings were held for
certain aliens seeking entry to the United States, and
deportation hearings were held for certain aliens who had
already entered this country. See ibid.
Under this regime, “entry” into the United States was
defined as “any coming of an alien into the United States,
from a foreign port or place.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13) (1988
ed.). The statute, however, provided an exception for
lawful permanent residents; aliens lawfully residing here
were not regarded as making an “entry” if their “departure
to a foreign port or place . . . was not intended or reasona-
