activity is concerned, escapes from our grasp. Ordinarily,
to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that an alien has committed a qualifying crime, the
immigration officer at the border would check the alien’s
records for a conviction. He would not call into session a
piepowder court12 to entertain a plea or conduct a trial.

lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of an offense under
§1182(a)(2) (or admits to one).
12 Piepowder (“dusty feet”) courts were temporary mercantile courts
held at trade fairs in Medieval Europe; local merchants and guild
members would assemble to hear commercial disputes. These courts
provided fast and informal resolution of trade conflicts, settling cases
