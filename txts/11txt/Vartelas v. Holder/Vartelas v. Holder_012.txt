VARTELAS v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

Vartelas urges that applying IIRIRA to him, rather than
the law that existed at the time of his conviction, would
attach a “new disability,” effectively a ban on travel outside the United States, “in respect to [events] . . . already
past,” i.e., his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and punishment, all occurring prior to the passage of IIRIRA. In
evaluating Vartelas’ argument, we note first a matter not
disputed by the Government: Congress did not expressly
prescribe the temporal reach of the IIRIRA provision in
question, 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13). See Landgraf, 511 U. S.,
at 280 (Court asks first “whether Congress has expressly
prescribed [new §1101(a)(13)’s] proper reach”); Brief for
Respondent 11 (Court’s holding in INS v. St. Cyr, 533
U. S., at 317–320, “compels the conclusion that Congress
has not ‘expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach’ ”
(quoting Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280)).5 Several other
provisions of IIRIRA, in contrast to §1101(a)(13), expressly
direct retroactive application, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)
(IIRIRA’s amendment of the “aggravated felony” definition
applies expressly to “conviction[s] . . . entered before, on,
or after” the statute’s enactment date (internal quotation
marks omitted)). See St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 319–320, and
n. 43 (setting out further examples). Accordingly, we
proceed to the dispositive question whether, as Vartelas
maintains, application of IIRIRA’s travel restraint to him
“would have retroactive effect” Congress did not authorize.
See Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280.
Vartelas presents a firm case for application of the
antiretroactivity principle. Neither his sentence, nor the
——————
statement in view of this Court’s many references to Justice Story’s
formulation in cases involving the presumption that statutes operate
only prospectively in the absence of a clear congressional statement to
the contrary.
5 In St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 317–320, we rejected the Government’s
contention that Congress directed retroactive application of IIRIRA in
its entirety.
