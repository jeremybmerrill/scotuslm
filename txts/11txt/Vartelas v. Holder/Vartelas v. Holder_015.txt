Opinion of the Court

the alien, for it attached a “new disability” to the guilty
plea and Congress had not instructed such a result. 533
U. S., at 321–323.
III
The Government, echoed in part by the dissent, argues
that no retroactive effect is involved in this case, for the
Legislature has not attached any disability to past conduct. Rather, it has made the relevant event the alien’s
post-IIRIRA act of returning to the United States. See
Brief for Respondent 19–20; post, at 3. We find this argument disingenuous. Vartelas’ return to the United States
occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason
for the “new disability” imposed on him was not his lawful
foreign travel. It was, indeed, his conviction, pre-IIRIRA,
of an offense qualifying as one of moral turpitude. That
past misconduct, in other words, not present travel, is the
wrongful activity Congress targeted in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).
The Government observes that lower courts have upheld Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
prosecutions that encompassed pre-enactment conduct.
See Brief for Respondent 18 (citing United States v.
Brown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416–417 (CA5 1977), and United
States v. Campanale, 518 F. 2d 352, 364–365 (CA9 1975)
(per curiam)). But those prosecutions depended on criminal activity, i.e., an act of racketeering occuring after the
provision’s effective date. Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), in
contrast, does not require any showing of criminal conduct
postdating IIRIRA’s enactment.
Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U. S. 30 (2006),
featured by the Government and the dissent, Brief for
Respondent 17, 36–37; post, at 3, is similarly inapposite.
That case involved 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5), an IIRIRA addition, which provides that an alien who reenters the United
States after having been removed can be removed again
under the same removal order. We held that the provision
