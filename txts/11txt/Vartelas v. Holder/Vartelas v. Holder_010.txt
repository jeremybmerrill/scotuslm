VARTELAS v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

cede removability and to request discretionary relief. The
Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and
ordered Vartelas removed to Greece. The BIA affirmed
the Immigration Judge’s decision.
In July 2008, Vartelas filed with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his
previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other
lapses, conceding his removability. He sought to withdraw
the concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA’s
new “admission” provision, codified at §1101(a)(13), did
not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status
based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction. The BIA denied the
motion, declaring that Vartelas had not been prejudiced by
his lawyers’ performance, for no legal authority prevented
the application of IIRIRA to Vartelas’ pre-IIRIRA conduct.
The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the BIA’s decision, agreeing that Vartelas had
failed to show he was prejudiced by his attorneys’ allegedly ineffective performance. Rejecting Vartelas’ argument
that IIRIRA operated prospectively and therefore did not
govern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had
not relied on the prior legal regime at the time he committed the disqualifying crime. See 620 F. 3d 108, 118–120
(2010).
In so ruling, the Second Circuit created a split with two
other Circuits. The Fourth and Ninth Circuits have held
that the new §1101(a)(13) may not be applied to lawful
permanent residents who committed crimes listed in
§1182 (among them, crimes of moral turpitude) prior to
IIRIRA’s enactment. See Olatunji v. Ashcroft, 387 F. 3d
383 (CA4 2004); Camins v. Gonzales, 500 F. 3d 872 (CA9
2007). We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), to
resolve the conflict among the Circuits.
