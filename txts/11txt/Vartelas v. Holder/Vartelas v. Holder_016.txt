VARTELAS v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

could be applied to an alien who reentered illegally before
IIRIRA’s enactment. Explaining the Court’s decision, we
said: “[T]he conduct of remaining in the country . . . is the
predicate action; the statute applies to stop an indefinitely
continuing violation . . . . It is therefore the alien’s choice
to continue his illegal presence . . . after the effective date
of the new la[w] that subjects him to the new . . . legal
regime, not a past act that he is helpless to undo.” 548
U. S., at 44 (emphasis added). Vartelas, we have several
times stressed, engaged in no criminal activity after
IIRIRA’s passage. He simply took a brief trip to Greece,
anticipating a return without incident as in past visits to
his parents. No “indefinitely continuing” crime occurred;
instead, Vartelas was apprehended because of a preIIRIRA crime he was “helpless to undo.” Ibid.
The Government further refers to lower court decisions
in cases involving 18 U. S. C. §922(g), which prohibits the
possession of firearms by convicted felons. Brief for Respondent 18–19 (citing United States v. Pfeifer, 371 F. 3d
430, 436 (CA8 2004), and United States v. Hemmings, 258
F. 3d 587, 594 (CA7 2001)). “[L]ongstanding prohibitions
on the possession of firearms by felons,” District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 626 (2008), however, target a
present danger, i.e., the danger posed by felons who bear
arms. See, e.g., Pfeifer, 371 F. 3d, at 436 (hazardous conduct that statute targets “occurred after enactment of the
statute”); Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968, §1201, 82 Stat. 236 (noting hazards involved when
felons possess firearms).7

7 The dissent, see post, at 6, notes two statutes of the same genre:
laws prohibiting persons convicted of a sex crime against a victim
under 16 years of age from working in jobs involving frequent contact
with minors, and laws prohibiting a person “who has been adjudicated
as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution” from possessing guns, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(4). The dissent is
correct that these statutes do not operate retroactively. Rather, they
