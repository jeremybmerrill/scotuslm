Opinion of the Court

graf, the relevant conduct (submitting a false claim) had
been unlawful for decades. See 520 U. S., at 947.
The operative presumption, after all, is that Congress
intends its laws to govern prospectively only. See supra,
at 7. “It is a strange ‘presumption,’ ” the Third Circuit
commented, “that arises only on . . . a showing [of] actual
reliance.” Ponnapula v. Ashcroft, 373 F. 3d 480, 491
(2004). The essential inquiry, as stated in Landgraf, 511
U. S., at 269–270, is “whether the new provision attaches
new legal consequences to events completed before its
enactment.” That is just what occurred here.
In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing
immigration law. While the presumption against retroactive application of statutes does not require a showing of
detrimental reliance, see Olatunji, 387 F. 3d, at 389–395,
reasonable reliance has been noted among the “familiar
considerations” animating the presumption, see Landgraf,
511 U. S., at 270 (presumption reflects “familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled
expectations”). Although not a necessary predicate for invoking the antiretroactivity principle, the likelihood of
reliance on prior law strengthens the case for reading a
newly enacted law prospectively. See Olatunji, 387 F. 3d,
at 393 (discussing St. Cyr).
St. Cyr is illustrative. That case involved a lawful permanent resident who pleaded guilty to a criminal charge
that made him deportable. Under the immigration law in
effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible
to apply for a waiver of deportation. But his removal
proceeding was commenced after Congress, in IIRIRA,
withdrew that dispensation. Disallowance of discretionary
waivers, the Court recognized, “attache[d] a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already
past.” 533 U. S., at 321 (internal quotation marks omit——————
U. S., at 948.
