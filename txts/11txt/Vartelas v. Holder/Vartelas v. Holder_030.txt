SCALIA, J., dissenting

effective date should be covered (here, post-1996 reentries). If, as so construed, the statute is unfair or irrational enough to violate the Constitution, that is another
matter entirely, and one not presented here. Our interpretive presumption against retroactivity, however, is just
thatâ€”a tool to ascertain what the statute means, not a
license to rewrite the statute in a way the Court considers
more desirable.
I respectfully dissent.
