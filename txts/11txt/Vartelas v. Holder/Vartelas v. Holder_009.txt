Opinion of the Court

B
Panagis Vartelas, born and raised in Greece, has resided
in the United States for over 30 years. Originally admitted on a student visa issued in 1979, Vartelas became a
lawful permanent resident in 1989. He currently lives in
the New York area and works as a sales manager for a
roofing company.
In 1992, Vartelas opened an auto body shop in Queens,
New York. One of his business partners used the shop’s
photocopier to make counterfeit travelers’ checks. Vartelas helped his partner perforate the sheets into individual checks, but Vartelas did not sell the checks or receive
any money from the venture. In 1994, he pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to make or possess counterfeit securities, in
violation of 18 U. S. C. §371. He was sentenced to four
months’ incarceration, followed by two years’ supervised
release.
Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging
parents in the years after his 1994 conviction; even after
the passage of IIRIRA in 1996, his return to the United
States from these visits remained uneventful. In January
2003, however, when Vartelas returned from a week-long
trip to Greece, an immigration officer classified him as an
alien seeking “admission.” The officer based this classification on Vartelas’ 1994 conviction. See United States
ex rel. Volpe v. Smith, 289 U. S. 422, 423 (1933) (counterfeiting ranks as a crime of moral turpitude).
At Vartelas’ removal proceedings, his initial attorney
conceded removability, and requested discretionary relief
from removal under the former §212(c) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (INA). See 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994
ed.) (repealed 1996). This attorney twice failed to appear
for hearings and once failed to submit a requested brief.
Vartelas engaged a new attorney, who continued to con——————
§1227(a)(2) (listing deportable crimes).
