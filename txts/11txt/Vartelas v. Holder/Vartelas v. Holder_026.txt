SCALIA, J., dissenting

tively unintended) and the validity question (whether
giving certain effect to a provision is unlawful) is on full
display in its attempts to distinguish §1101(a)(13)(C)(v)
from similar statutes. Take, for example, the Court’s discussion of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). That Act, which targets “patterns
of racketeering,” expressly defines those “patterns” to
include some pre-enactment conduct. See 18 U. S. C.
§1961(5). Courts interpreting RICO therefore need not
consider the presumption against retroactivity; instead,
the cases cited by the majority consider whether RICO
violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. See United States v.
Brown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416–417 (CA5 1977); United States
v. Campanale, 518 F. 2d 352, 364–365 (CA9 1975)
(per curiam). The Government recognized this distinction
and cited RICO to make a point about the Ex Post Facto
Clause rather than the presumption against retroactivity,
Brief for Respondent 17–18; the Court evidently does not.
The Court’s confident assertion that Congress surely
would not have meant this statute to apply to Vartelas,
whose foreign travel and subsequent return to the United
States were innocent events, ante, at 11, 14, simply begs
the question presented in this case. Ignorance, of course,
is no excuse (ignorantia legis neminem excusat); and his
return was entirely lawful only if the statute before us did
not render it unlawful. Since IIRIRA’s effective date in
1996, lawful permanent residents who have committed
crimes of moral turpitude are forbidden to leave the
United States and return without formally seeking “admission.” See §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). As a result, Vartelas’s
numerous trips abroad and “uneventful” reentries into the
United States after the passage of IIRIRA, see ante, at 5,
were lawful only if §1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to
him—which is, of course, precisely the matter in dispute
here.
The Court’s circular reasoning betrays its underlying
