VARTELAS v. HOLDER
SCALIA, J., dissenting

altogether”).
II
The Court avoids this conclusion by insisting that
“[p]ast misconduct, . . . not present travel, is the wrongful
activity Congress targeted” in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Ante,
at 11. That assertion does not, however, have any basis
in the statute’s text or structure, and the Court does not
pretend otherwise. Instead, the Court simply asserts that
Vartelas’s “lawful foreign travel” surely could not be the
“reason for the ‘new disability’ imposed on him.” Ibid.
(emphasis added). But the reason for a prohibition has
nothing to do with whether the prohibition is being applied to a past rather than a future act. It may be relevant
to other legal inquiries—for example, to whether a legislative act violates one of the Ex Post Facto Clauses in Article
I, see, e.g., Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 92 (2003), or one of
the Due Process Clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments, see, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla.,
Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487 (1955), or the Takings Clause in
the Fifth Amendment, see, e.g., Kelo v. New London, 545
U. S. 469, 477–483 (2005), or the Obligation of Contracts
Clause in Article I, see, e.g., United States Trust Co. of
N. Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U. S. 1, 29 (1977). But it has no
direct bearing upon whether the statute is retroactive.*
The Court’s failure to differentiate between the statutoryinterpretation question (whether giving certain effect to a
provision would make it retroactive and hence presump——————
* I say no direct bearing because if the prospective application of a
statute would raise constitutional doubts because of its effect on preenactment conduct, that would be a reason to presume a legislative
intent not to apply it unless the conduct in question is postenactment—that is, to consider it retroactive when the conduct in
question is pre-enactment. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380–
381 (2005). That is not an issue here. If the statute had expressly
made the new “admission” rule applicable to those aliens with prior
convictions, its constitutionality would not be in doubt.
