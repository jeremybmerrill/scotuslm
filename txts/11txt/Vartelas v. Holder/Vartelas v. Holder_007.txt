Opinion of the Court

port or place . . . was not voluntary.” Ibid. Interpreting
this cryptic provision, we held in Fleuti, 374 U. S., at 461–
462, that Congress did not intend to exclude aliens long
resident in the United States upon their return from
“innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this
country’s borders.” Instead, the Court determined, Congress meant to rank a once-permanent resident as a new
entrant only when the foreign excursion “meaningfully
interrupt[ed] . . . the alien’s [U. S.] residence.” Id., at 462.
Absent such “disrupti[on]” of the alien’s residency, the
alien would not be “subject . . . to the consequences of an
‘entry’ into the country on his return.” Ibid.1
In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between
exclusion and deportation procedures and created a uniform proceeding known as “removal.” See 8 U. S. C.
§§1229, 1229a; Judulang v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___
(2011) (slip op., at 1–2). Congress made “admission” the
key word, and defined admission to mean “the lawful
entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.”

(en banc).2 Thus, lawful permanent residents returning

1 The dissent appears driven, in no small measure, by its dim view of
the Court’s opinion in Fleuti. See post, at 6 (“same instinct” operative
in Fleuti and this case).
2 The BIA determined that the Fleuti doctrine no longer held sway
because it was rooted in the “no longer existent definition of ‘entry’ in
[the INA].” 21 I. & N. Dec., at 1065. The Board also noted that “Congress . . . amended the law to expressly preserve some, but not all, of
the Fleuti doctrine” when it provided that a lawful permanent resident
absent from the United States for less than 180 days would not be
regarded as seeking an admission except in certain enumerated circumstances, among them, prior commission of a crime of moral turpitude. See ibid. (citing 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13)(C)(ii)).
