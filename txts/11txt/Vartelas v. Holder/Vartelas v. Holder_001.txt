VARTELAS v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 10–1211. Argued January 18, 2012—Decided March 28, 2012
Before passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), United States immigration law
provided deportation hearings for excludable aliens who had already
entered the United States and exclusion hearings for excludable aliens seeking entry into the United States. Lawful permanent residents were not regarded as making an “entry,” upon their return
from “innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this country’s borders.” Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449, 462. In IIRIRA,
Congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation
procedures, creating a uniform “removal” proceeding. See 8 U. S. C.
§§1229, 1229a. Congress made “admission” the key word, and defined “admission” to mean “the lawful entry of the alien into the
United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration
officer.” §1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration
Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. Thus, lawful permanent residents returning from a trip abroad are now regarded as
seeking admission if they have “committed an offense identified in
section 1182(a)(2),” §1101(a)(13)(C)(v), including, as relevant here, “a
crime involving moral turpitude . . . or conspiracy to commit such a
crime,” §1182(a)(2)(A)(i).
Petitioner Vartelas, a lawful permanent resident of the United
States since 1989, pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a
counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a 4-month prison sentence.
In the years after his conviction, and even after IIRIRA’s passage,
Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents. In
2003, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an
immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking “admission”
based on his 1994 conviction. At Vartelas’ removal proceedings, his
