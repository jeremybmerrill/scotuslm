VARTELAS v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

loss at stake was less momentous.
In Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536 (1884), a
pathmarking decision, the Court confronted the “Chinese
Restriction Act,” which barred Chinese laborers from
reentering the United States without a certificate issued
on their departure. The Court held the reentry bar inapplicable to aliens who had left the country prior to the
Act’s passage and tried to return afterward without a
certificate. The Act’s text, the Court observed, was not “so
clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt [retroactive
application] was the intention of the legislature.” Id., at
559.
In Landgraf, the question was whether an amendment
to Title VII’s ban on employment discrimination authorizing compensatory and punitive damages applied to preenactment conduct. The Court held it did not. No doubt
the complaint against the employer charged discrimination that violated the Act at the time it occurred. But
compensatory and punitive damages were not then available remedies. The later provision for such damages, the
Court determined, operated prospectively only, and did
not apply to employers whose discriminatory conduct occurred prior to the amendment. See 511 U. S., at 280–
286. And in Hughes Aircraft, the Court held that a provision removing an affirmative defense to qui tam suits did
not apply to pre-enactment fraud. As in Landgraf, the
provision attached “a new disability” to past wrongful
conduct and therefore could not apply retrospectively
unless Congress clearly manifested such an intention.

Most recently, in St. Cyr, the Court took up the case of
an alien who had entered a plea to a deportable offense.
At the time of the plea, the alien was eligible for discretionary relief from deportation. IIRIRA, enacted after
entry of the plea, removed that eligibility. The Court held
that the IIRIRA provision in point could not be applied to
