VARTELAS v. HOLDER
SCALIA, J., dissenting

event—and it is that, rather than the Court’s pronouncement of some forward-looking reason, which governs
whether a statute has retroactive effect.
Finally, I cannot avoid observing that even if the Court’s
concern about the fairness or rationality of applying
§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) to Vartelas were relevant to the statutory interpretation question, that concern is greatly exaggerated. In disregard of a federal statute, convicted criminal Vartelas repeatedly traveled to and from Greece
without ever seeking formal admission at this country’s
borders. When he was finally unlucky enough to be apprehended, and sought discretionary relief from removal
under former §212(c) of the INA, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994
ed.), the Immigration Judge denying his application found
that Vartelas had made frequent trips to Greece and had
remained there for long periods of time, that he was “a
serious tax evader,” that he had offered testimony that
was “close to incredible,” and that he had not shown hardship to himself or his estranged wife and children should
he be removed. See 620 F. 3d 108, 111 (CA2 2010); Brief
for Respondent 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). In
decrying the “harsh penalty” imposed by this statute on
Vartelas, the Court ignores those inconvenient facts.
Ante, at 9. But never mind. Under any sensible approach
to the presumption against retroactivity, these factual
subtleties should be irrelevant to the temporal application
of §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).

This case raises a plain-vanilla question of statutory
interpretation, not broader questions about frustrated
expectations or fairness. Our approach to answering that
question should be similarly straightforward: We should
determine what relevant activity the statute regulates
(here, reentry); absent a clear statement otherwise, only
such relevant activity which occurs after the statute’s
