Opinion of the Court

resident alien who once committed a crime of moral turpitude could travel abroad for short durations without jeopardizing his status as a lawful permanent resident. Under
IIRIRA, on return from foreign travel, such an alien is
treated as a new arrival to our shores, and may be removed from the United States. Vartelas does not question
Congress’ authority to restrict reentry in this manner.
Nor does he contend that Congress could not do so retroactively. Instead, he invokes the principle against retroactive legislation, under which courts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has unambiguously
instructed retroactivity. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 263 (1994).
The presumption against retroactive legislation, the
Court recalled in Landgraf, “embodies a legal doctrine
centuries older than our Republic.” Id., at 265. Several
provisions of the Constitution, the Court noted, embrace
the doctrine, among them, the Ex Post Facto Clause, the
Contract Clause, and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process
Clause. Id., at 266. Numerous decisions of this Court
repeat the classic formulation Justice Story penned for
determining when retrospective application of a law would
collide with the doctrine. It would do so, Story stated,
when such application would “tak[e] away or impai[r]
vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creat[e] a
new obligation, impos[e] a new duty, or attac[h] a new
disability, in respect to transactions or considerations
already past.”

Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CC NH 1814).
See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 321 (2001) (invoking Story’s formulation); Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United
States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 947 (1997); Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 283.4

to the presumption against retroactivity.” Post, at 6. That is a bold
