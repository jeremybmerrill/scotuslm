HARDY v. CROSS
Per Curiam

On a final visit to A. S.’s mother on the morning of
March 28, the mother informed the police detective that
A. S. had called approximately two weeks earlier and had
said that she did not want to testify and would not return
to Chicago. See id., at E–30; 632 F. 3d 356, 359 (CA7
2011). A. S.’s mother told the detective that she still did
not know where A. S. was or how to contact her. Exh. K,
at E30.
The trial court granted the State’s motion and admitted
A. S.’s earlier testimony. The trial court concluded that
the State had “expended efforts that go way beyond due
diligence,” id., at E–65, and that A. S. “ha[d] made it
impossible for anybody to find where she is . . . in spite of
what I think are superhuman efforts to locate [her],” id.,
at E–67. At Cross’ retrial, a legal intern from the State’s
attorney’s office read A. S.’s prior, cross-examined testimony to the jury. According to the opinion below, the
clerk’s reading of the prior testimony did not include the
long pauses that occurred at the first trial, and the clerk
read the transcript with a slight inflection. See 632 F. 3d,
at 359. The jury acquitted Cross of aggravated sexual
assault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal
sexual assault.
On appeal, the Illinois Court of Appeals agreed that
A. S. was unavailable because “[i]t is clear from her telephone conversation with her mother that she was not in
the city” and “also evident that she was in hiding and did
not want to be located.” Id., at 83a. The court found that
the State had conducted a good-faith, diligent search to
locate A. S., and that the trial court had properly allowed
the introduction of A. S.’s cross-examined testimony from
the first trial. The court, therefore, affirmed Cross’ convictions and sentence. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied
Cross’ petition for leave to appeal, and we denied Cross’
petition for a writ of certiorari.
Cross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus
