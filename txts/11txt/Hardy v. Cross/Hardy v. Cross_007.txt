Per Curiam

not “noteworthy” or “particularly helpful.” Ibid. Since
A. S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at
E–42, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the
school had better information about A. S.’s location than
did the members of her family.
Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that the State’s
efforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve
her with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testifying at the retrial. A. S., however, had expressed fear
about testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless
appeared in court and had taken the stand. The State
represented that A. S., although fearful, had agreed to
testify at the retrial as well. 632 F. 3d, at 362. We have
never held that the prosecution must have issued a subpoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into
hiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes,
and the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a
sexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she
is willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.
As we observed in Roberts, when a witness disappears
before trial, it is always possible to think of additional
steps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the
witness’ presence, see 448 U. S., at 75, but the Sixth
Amendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust
every avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.
And, more to the point, the deferential standard of review
set out in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) does not permit a federal
court to overturn a state court’s decision on the question of
unavailability merely because the federal court identifies
additional steps that might have been taken. Under
AEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it
cannot be disturbed.
The petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross’ motion to
proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment
of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is
Reversed.
