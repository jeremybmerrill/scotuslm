HARDY v. CROSS
Per Curiam

State said that it had remained in “constant contact” with
A. S. and her mother and that “[e]very indication” had
been that A. S., “though extremely frightened, would be
willing to again come to court and testify.” Record, Exh. J,
p. 111 (hereinafter Exh. J). On March 3, however, A. S.’s
mother and brother told the State’s investigator that they
did not know where she was, and A. S.’s mother reported
that A. S. was “very fearful and very concerned” about
testifying again. Record, Exh. K, p. E–9 (hereinafter Exh.
K); id., at E–14. On March 9 or 10, the investigator interviewed A. S.’s father, who also had “no idea where [A. S.]
was.” Id., at E–12. The father’s only suggestion was to
refer the investigator back to the mother.
On March 10, the State learned from A. S.’s mother that
A. S. had run away from home the day before and had not
returned.* Exh. J, at 111. Thereafter, “efforts began by
members of the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office and
by law enforcement personnel to locate” A. S. Id., at 112.
The State averred that its efforts included the following:
“Constant personal visits to the home of [A. S.] and
her mother, at all hours of the day and night. This
is where the victim has lived since the sexual assault
occurred.
“Personal visits to the home of [A. S.’s] father. This
is where the victim lived when the sexual assault
occurred.
“Personal conversations, in English and in Spanish,
with the victim’s mother, father, and other family
members.
——————
* The State’s motion does not mention the investigator’s March 3 visit
with A. S.’s mother and brother, and the record in this case does not
make entirely clear when A. S. disappeared and when the State’s
attorney actually became aware of this fact. In any event, the parties
do not dispute the facts in this case regarding the State’s efforts to
locate A. S. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a.
