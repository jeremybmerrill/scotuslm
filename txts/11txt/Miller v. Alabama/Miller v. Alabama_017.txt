Opinion of the Court

judgment) (slip op., at 5)—makes relevant here a second
line of our precedents, demanding individualized sentencing when imposing the death penalty. In Woodson, 428
U. S. 280, we held that a statute mandating a death sentence for first-degree murder violated the Eighth Amendment. We thought the mandatory scheme flawed because
it gave no significance to “the character and record of
the individual offender or the circumstances” of the offense,
and “exclud[ed] from consideration . . . the possibility of
compassionate or mitigating factors.” Id., at 304. Subsequent decisions have elaborated on the requirement that
capital defendants have an opportunity to advance, and
the judge or jury a chance to assess, any mitigating factors, so that the death penalty is reserved only for the
most culpable defendants committing the most serious
offenses. See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66, 74–
76 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110–112
(1982); Lockett, 438 U. S., at 597–609 (plurality opinion).
Of special pertinence here, we insisted in these rulings
that a sentencer have the ability to consider the “mitigating qualities of youth.” Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350,
367 (1993). Everything we said in Roper and Graham
about that stage of life also appears in these decisions. As
we observed, “youth is more than a chronological fact.”
Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115. It is a time of immaturity, irresponsibility, “impetuousness[,] and recklessness.” Johnson, 509 U. S., at 368. It is a moment and “condition
of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence
and to psychological damage.” Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115.
And its “signature qualities” are all “transient.” Johnson,
509 U. S., at 368. Eddings is especially on point. There, a
16-year-old shot a police officer point-blank and killed
him. We invalidated his death sentence because the judge
did not consider evidence of his neglectful and violent
family background (including his mother’s drug abuse and
his father’s physical abuse) and his emotional disturbance.
