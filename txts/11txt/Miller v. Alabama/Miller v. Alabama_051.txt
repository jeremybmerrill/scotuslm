THOMAS, J., dissenting

of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). The Court invalidated those statutes in Woodson, Roberts, and Sumner.
The Court reasoned that mandatory capital sentencing
schemes were problematic, because they failed “to allow
the particularized consideration” of “relevant facets of the
character and record of the individual offender or the
circumstances of the particular offense.” Woodson, supra,
at 303–304 (plurality opinion).3
In my view, Woodson and its progeny were wrongly
decided. As discussed above, the Cruel and Unusual
Punishments Clause, as originally understood, prohibits
“torturous methods of punishment.” See Graham, 560
U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is not concerned with
whether a particular lawful method of punishment—
whether capital or noncapital—is imposed pursuant to a
mandatory or discretionary sentencing regime. See Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 371 (1977) (Rehnquist, J.,
dissenting) (“The prohibition of the Eighth Amendment
relates to the character of the punishment, and not to the
process by which it is imposed”). In fact, “[i]n the early
days of the Republic,” each crime generally had a defined
punishment “prescribed with specificity by the legislature.” United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 45 (1978).
Capital sentences, to which the Court analogizes, were

3 The Court later extended Woodson, requiring that capital defendants be permitted to present, and sentencers in capital cases be permitted to consider, any relevant mitigating evidence, including the age of
the defendant. See, e.g., Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 597–608 (1978)
(plurality opinion); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110–112
(1982); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1986); Johnson v.
Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 361–368 (1993). Whatever the validity of the
requirement that sentencers be permitted to consider all mitigating
evidence when deciding whether to impose a nonmandatory capital
sentence, the Court certainly was wrong to prohibit mandatory capital
sentences. See Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 488–500 (1993)
(THOMAS, J., concurring).
