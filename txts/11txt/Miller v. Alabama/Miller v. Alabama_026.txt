MILLER v. ALABAMA
Opinion of the Court

in Atkins, Roper, and Thompson, we similarly banned the
death penalty in circumstances in which “less than half ”
of the “States that permit[ted] capital punishment (for
whom the issue exist[ed])” had previously chosen to do so.
Atkins, 536 U. S., at 342 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (emphasis
deleted); see id., at 313–315 (majority opinion); Roper, 543
U. S., at 564–565; Thompson, 487 U. S., at 826–827 (plurality opinion). So we are breaking no new ground in
these cases.11
Graham and Thompson provide special guidance, because they considered the same kind of statutes we do and
——————
parole discretionary for juveniles. See Alabama Brief 25 (listing 12
States); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.5(b) (West 2008); Ind. Code §35–50–
2–3(b) (2011); N. M. Stat. §§31–18–13(B), 31–18–14, 31–18–15.2 (2010).
According to available data, only about 15% of all juvenile life-withoutparole sentences come from those 15 jurisdictions, while 85% come from
the 29 mandatory ones. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 10–9646, p. 19;
Human Rights Watch, State Distribution of Youth Offenders Serving Juvenile Life Without Parole (JLWOP), Oct. 2, 2009, online at
http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/10/02/state-distribution-juvenile-offendersserving-juvenile-life-without-parole (as visited June 21, 2012, and
available in Clerk of Court’s case file). That figure indicates that when
given the choice, sentencers impose life without parole on children
relatively rarely. And contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s argument, see
post, at 5, n. 2, we have held that when judges and juries do not often
choose to impose a sentence, it at least should not be mandatory. See
Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 295–296 (1976) (plurality
opinion) (relying on the infrequency with which juries imposed the
death penalty when given discretion to hold that its mandatory imposition violates the Eighth Amendment).
11 In response, THE CHIEF JUSTICE complains: “To say that a sentence
may be considered unusual because so many legislatures approve it
stands precedent on its head.” Post, at 5. To be clear: That description
in no way resembles our opinion. We hold that the sentence violates
the Eighth Amendment because, as we have exhaustively shown, it
conflicts with the fundamental principles of Roper, Graham, and our
individualized sentencing cases. We then show why the number of
States imposing this punishment does not preclude our holding, and
note how its mandatory nature (in however many States adopt it)
makes use of actual sentencing numbers unilluminating.
