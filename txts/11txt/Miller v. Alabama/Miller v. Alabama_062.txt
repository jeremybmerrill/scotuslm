ALITO, J., dissenting

sentences that may be imposed in criminal cases, but for
the most part it leaves questions of sentencing policy to be
determined by Congress and the state legislatures—and
with good reason. Determining the length of imprison­
ment that is appropriate for a particular offense and a
particular offender inevitably involves a balancing of in­
terests. If imprisonment does nothing else, it removes
the criminal from the general population and prevents
him from committing additional crimes in the outside
world. When a legislature prescribes that a category of
killers must be sentenced to life imprisonment, the legisla­
ture, which presumably reflects the views of the elec­
torate, is taking the position that the risk that these
offenders will kill again outweighs any countervailing
consideration, including reduced culpability due to imma­
turity or the possibility of rehabilitation. When the major­
ity of this Court countermands that democratic decision,
what the majority is saying is that members of society
must be exposed to the risk that these convicted murder­
ers, if released from custody, will murder again.
Unless our cases change course, we will continue to
march toward some vision of evolutionary culmination
that the Court has not yet disclosed. The Constitution
does not authorize us to take the country on this journey.
