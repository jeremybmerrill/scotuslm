MILLER v. ALABAMA
ALITO, J., dissenting

(plurality opinion); see also Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S.
___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554
U. S. 407, 419 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551,
560–561 (2005); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 311–312
(2002); Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 8 (1992); Ford v.
Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 406 (1986); Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 346 (1981); Estelle v. Gamble, 429
U. S. 97, 102 (1976). Both the provenance and philosophical basis for this standard were problematic from the
start. (Is it true that our society is inexorably evolving in
the direction of greater and greater decency? Who says
so, and how did this particular philosophy of history find
its way into our fundamental law? And in any event,
aren’t elected representatives more likely than unaccount­
able judges to reflect changing societal standards?) But at
least at the start, the Court insisted that these “evolving
standards” represented something other than the personal
views of five Justices. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S.
263, 275 (1980) (explaining that “the Court’s Eighth
Amendment judgments should neither be nor appear to
be merely the subjective views of individual Justices”). In­
stead, the Court looked for objective indicia of our society’s
moral standards and the trajectory of our moral “evolu­
tion.” See id., at 274–275 (emphasizing that “ ‘judgment
should be informed by objective factors to the maximum
possible extent’ ” (quoting Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584,
592 (1977) (plurality opinion))).
In this search for objective indicia, the Court toyed with
the use of public opinion polls, see Atkins, supra, at 316,
n. 21, and occasionally relied on foreign law, see Roper v.
Simmons, supra, at 575; Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S.
782, 796, n. 22 (1982); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S.
815, 830–831 (1988); Coker, 433 U. S., at 596, n. 10 (plu­
rality opinion).
In the main, however, the staple of this inquiry was the
tallying of the positions taken by state legislatures. Thus,
