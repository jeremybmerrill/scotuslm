MILLER v. ALABAMA



Opinion of the Court 


III



Alabama and Arkansas offer two kinds of arguments
against requiring individualized consideration before sentencing a juvenile to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. The States (along with the dissents) first
contend that the rule we adopt conflicts with aspects of
our Eighth Amendment caselaw. And they next assert
that the rule is unnecessary because individualized circumstances come into play in deciding whether to try a
juvenile offender as an adult. We think the States are
wrong on both counts.
A
The States (along with JUSTICE THOMAS) first claim that
Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), precludes our
holding. The defendant in Harmelin was sentenced to a
mandatory life-without-parole term for possessing more
than 650 grams of cocaine. The Court upheld that penalty, reasoning that “a sentence which is not otherwise cruel
and unusual” does not “becom[e] so simply because it is
‘mandatory.’ ” Id., at 995. We recognized that a different
rule, requiring individualized sentencing, applied in the
death penalty context. But we refused to extend that
command to noncapital cases “because of the qualitative
difference between death and all other penalties.” Ibid.;
see id., at 1006 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). According to Alabama, invalidating the mandatory imposition of life-without-parole
terms on juveniles “would effectively overrule Harmelin.”
Brief for Respondent in No. 10–9646, p. 59 (hereinafter
Alabama Brief); see Arkansas Brief 39.
We think that argument myopic. Harmelin had nothing
to do with children and did not purport to apply its hold—————— 

fendants and crimes. By contrast, the sentencing schemes that the



dissents find permissible altogether preclude considering these factors.
