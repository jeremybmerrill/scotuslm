MILLER v. ALABAMA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

that all offenders convicted of specified homicide offenses,
whether juveniles or not, deserve a sentence of life in
prison without the possibility of parole. Nothing in our
Constitution authorizes this Court to supplant that choice.
II
To invalidate mandatory life-without-parole sentences
for juveniles, the Court also relies on its cases “prohibit[ing] mandatory imposition of capital punishment.”
Ante, at 7. The Court reasons that, because Graham
compared juvenile life-without-parole sentences to the
death penalty, the “distinctive set of legal rules” that this
Court has imposed in the capital punishment context,
including the requirement of individualized sentencing, is
“relevant” here. Ante, at 12–13. But even accepting an
analogy between capital and juvenile life-without-parole
sentences, this Court’s cases prohibiting mandatory capital sentencing schemes have no basis in the original understanding of the Eighth Amendment, and, thus, cannot
justify a prohibition of sentencing schemes that mandate
life-without-parole sentences for juveniles.
A
In a line of cases following Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S.
238 (1972) (per curiam), this Court prohibited the mandatory imposition of the death penalty. See Woodson v.
North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion);
Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325 (1976) (same); Sumner
v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66 (1987). Furman first announced
the principle that States may not permit sentencers to
exercise unguided discretion in imposing the death penalty. See generally 408 U. S. 238. In response to Furman,
many States passed new laws that made the death penalty mandatory following conviction of specified crimes,
thereby eliminating the offending discretion. See Gregg
v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 180–181 (1976) (joint opinion
