MILLER v. ALABAMA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

treated no differently. “[M]andatory death sentences
abounded in our first Penal Code” and were “common in
the several States—both at the time of the founding and
throughout the 19th century.” Harmelin, 501 U. S., at
994–995; see also Woodson, supra, at 289 (plurality opinion) (“At the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted
in 1791, the States uniformly followed the common-law
practice of making death the exclusive and mandatory
sentence for certain specified offenses”). Accordingly, the
idea that the mandatory imposition of an otherwiseconstitutional sentence renders that sentence cruel and
unusual finds “no support in the text and history of the

perfectly reasonable legislative response to the concerns
expressed in Furman” regarding unguided sentencing
discretion, in that they “eliminat[ed] explicit jury discretion and treat[ed] all defendants equally.” Graham v.
Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 487 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concurring). And, as Justice White explained more than 30 years
ago, “a State is not constitutionally forbidden to provide
that the commission of certain crimes conclusively establishes that a criminal’s character is such that he deserves
death.” Roberts, supra, at 358 (dissenting opinion). Thus,
there is no basis for concluding that a mandatory capital sentencing scheme is unconstitutional. Because the

In any event, this Court has already declined to extend
its individualized-sentencing rule beyond the death penalty context. In Harmelin, the defendant was convicted of
