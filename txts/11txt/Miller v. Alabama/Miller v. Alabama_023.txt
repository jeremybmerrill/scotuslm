Opinion of the Court

ing to the sentencing of juvenile offenders. We have by
now held on multiple occasions that a sentencing rule
permissible for adults may not be so for children. Capital
punishment, our decisions hold, generally comports with
the Eighth Amendment—except it cannot be imposed on
children. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Thompson, 487 U. S.
815. So too, life without parole is permissible for nonhomicide offenses—except, once again, for children. See Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). Nor are these
sentencing decisions an oddity in the law. To the contrary,
“ ‘[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition’ that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature
adults.” J. D. B., 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11)
(quoting Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115–116, citing examples
from criminal, property, contract, and tort law). So if (as
Harmelin recognized) “death is different,” children are
different too. Indeed, it is the odd legal rule that does not
have some form of exception for children. In that context,
it is no surprise that the law relating to society’s harshest
punishments recognizes such a distinction. Cf. Graham,
560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)
(slip op., at 7) (“Graham’s age places him in a significantly
different category from the defendan[t] in . . . Harmelin”).
Our ruling thus neither overrules nor undermines nor conflicts with Harmelin.
Alabama and Arkansas (along with THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO) next contend that because many
States impose mandatory life-without-parole sentences on
juveniles, we may not hold the practice unconstitutional.
In considering categorical bars to the death penalty and
life without parole, we ask as part of the analysis whether
“ ‘objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed in
legislative enactments and state practice,’ ” show a “national consensus” against a sentence for a particular class
of offenders. Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10)
(quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). By our count, 29 juris-
