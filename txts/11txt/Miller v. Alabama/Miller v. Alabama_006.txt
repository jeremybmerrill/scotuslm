MILLER v. ALABAMA
Opinion of the Court

___ (2010) (slip op., at 17, 23), and runs afoul of our cases’
requirement of individualized sentencing for defendants
facing the most serious penalties. We therefore hold that

When Troup threatened to call the police, Shields shot and
killed her. The three boys fled empty-handed. See id., at

Arkansas law gives prosecutors discretion to charge 14year-olds as adults when they are alleged to have committed certain serious offenses. See Ark. Code Ann. §9–27–
318(c)(2) (1998). The prosecutor here exercised that authority by charging Jackson with capital felony murder
and aggravated robbery. Jackson moved to transfer the
