MILLER v. ALABAMA
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Amendment that bars only “unusual” punishments requires the abolition of this uniformly established practice
would be startling indeed.

It is a great tragedy when a juvenile commits murder—
most of all for the innocent victims. But also for the murderer, whose life has gone so wrong so early. And for
society as well, which has lost one or more of its members
to deliberate violence, and must harshly punish another.
In recent years, our society has moved toward requiring
that the murderer, his age notwithstanding, be imprisoned
for the remainder of his life. Members of this Court may
disagree with that choice. Perhaps science and policy
suggest society should show greater mercy to young killers, giving them a greater chance to reform themselves at
the risk that they will kill again. See ante, at 8–11. But
that is not our decision to make. Neither the text of the
Constitution nor our precedent prohibits legislatures from
requiring that juvenile murderers be sentenced to life
without parole. I respectfully dissent.
