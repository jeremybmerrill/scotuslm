THOMAS, J., dissenting

bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,
nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” As I have
previously explained, “the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was originally understood as prohibiting
torturous methods of punishment—specifically methods
akin to those that had been considered cruel and unusual
at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted.” Graham,
supra, at ___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 3) (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted).2 The clause does
not contain a “proportionality principle.” Ewing v. California, 538 U. S. 11, 32 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in
judgment); see generally Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.
957, 975–985 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.). In short, it
does not authorize courts to invalidate any punishment
they deem disproportionate to the severity of the crime
or to a particular class of offenders. Instead, the clause
“leaves the unavoidably moral question of who ‘deserves’ a
particular nonprohibited method of punishment to the
judgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty.”
Graham, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,
at 5).
The legislatures of Arkansas and Alabama, like those of
27 other jurisdictions, ante, at 19–20, have determined
——————
2 Neither the Court nor petitioners argue that petitioners’ sentences
would have been among “the ‘modes or acts of punishment that had
been considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights
was adopted.’ ” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip
op., at 10, n. 3) (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 405 (1986)).
Nor could they. Petitioners were 14 years old at the time they committed their crimes. When the Bill of Rights was ratified, 14-year-olds
were subject to trial and punishment as adult offenders. See Roper v.
Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 609, n. 1 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
Further, mandatory death sentences were common at that time. See
Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 994–995 (1991). It is therefore
implausible that a 14-year-old’s mandatory prison sentence—of any
length, with or without parole—would have been viewed as cruel and
unusual.
