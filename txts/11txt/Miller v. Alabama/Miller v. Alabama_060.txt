ALITO, J., dissenting

are concerned with the imposition of a term of imprison­
ment on offenders who kill. The two (carefully selected)
cases before us concern very young defendants, and de­
spite the brutality and evident depravity exhibited by at
least one of the petitioners, it is hard not to feel sympathy
for a 14-year-old sentenced to life without the possibility of
release. But no one should be confused by the particulars
of the two cases before us. The category of murderers that
the Court delicately calls “children” (murderers under the
age of 18) consists overwhelmingly of young men who are
fast approaching the legal age of adulthood. Evan Miller
and Kuntrell Jackson are anomalies; much more typical
are murderers like Christopher Simmons, who committed
a brutal thrill-killing just seven months shy of his 18th
birthday. Roper, 543 U. S., at 556.
Seventeen-year-olds commit a significant number of
murders every year,1 and some of these crimes are incred­
ibly brutal. Many of these murderers are at least as ma­
ture as the average 18-year-old. See Thompson, 487 U. S.,
at 854 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that
maturity may “vary widely among different individuals of
the same age”). Congress and the legislatures of 43 States
have concluded that at least some of these murderers
should be sentenced to prison without parole, and 28
States and the Federal Government have decided that for
some of these offenders life without parole should be man­
datory. See Ante, at 20–21, and nn. 9–10. The majority of
this Court now overrules these legislative judgments.2

1 Between

2002 and 2010, 17-year-olds committed an average com­
bined total of 424 murders and nonnegligent homicides per year. See

sons arrested (Table 4.7).
2 As the Court noted in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366
(1989), Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 to eliminate
discretionary sentencing and parole because it concluded that these
practices had led to gross abuses. The Senate Report for the 1984 bill
