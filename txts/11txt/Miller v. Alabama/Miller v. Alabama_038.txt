MILLER v. ALABAMA
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Brief ); Brief for Respondent in No. 10–9646, p. 30 (Alabama Brief ). The Court accepts that over 2,000 of those
prisoners received that sentence because it was mandated
by a legislature. Ante, at 22, n. 10. And it recognizes
that the Federal Government and most States impose such
mandatory sentences. Ante, at 19–20. Put simply, if a 17year-old is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent
victim, it is not “unusual” for the murderer to receive a
mandatory sentence of life without parole. That reality
should preclude finding that mandatory life imprisonment
for juvenile killers violates the Eighth Amendment.
Our precedent supports this conclusion. When determining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, this
Court typically begins with “ ‘objective indicia of society’s
standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and
state practice.’ ” Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 10); see also, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana,
554 U. S. 407, 422 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543
U. S. 551, 564 (2005). We look to these “objective indicia” to
ensure that we are not simply following our own subjective
values or beliefs. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 173
(1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).
Such tangible evidence of societal standards enables us to
determine whether there is a “consensus against” a given
sentencing practice. Graham, supra, at ___ (slip op., at
10). If there is, the punishment may be regarded as “unusual.” But when, as here, most States formally require
and frequently impose the punishment in question, there
is no objective basis for that conclusion.
Our Eighth Amendment cases have also said that we
should take guidance from “evolving standards of decency
that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Ante, at 6
(quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976); internal quotation marks omitted). Mercy toward the guilty
can be a form of decency, and a maturing society may
abandon harsh punishments that it comes to view as
