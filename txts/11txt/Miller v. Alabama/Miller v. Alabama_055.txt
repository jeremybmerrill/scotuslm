THOMAS, J., dissenting

decision leaves intact the discretionary imposition of lifewithout-parole sentences for juvenile homicide offenders,
it “think[s] appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles
to [life without parole] will be uncommon.” Ante, at 17.
That statement may well cause trial judges to shy away
from imposing life without parole sentences and embolden
appellate judges to set them aside when they are imposed.
And, when a future petitioner seeks a categorical ban on
sentences of life without parole for juvenile homicide
offenders, this Court will most assuredly look to the “actual
sentencing practices” triggered by this case. The Court
has, thus, gone from “merely” divining the societal consensus of today to shaping the societal consensus of tomorrow.

Today’s decision invalidates a constitutionally permissible sentencing system based on nothing more than the
Court’s belief that “its own sense of morality . . . pre-empts
that of the people and their representatives.” Graham,
supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 29).
Because nothing in the Constitution grants the Court the
authority it exercises today, I respectfully dissent.
