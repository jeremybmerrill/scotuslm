DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT



OF ARKANSAS



[June 25, 2012]




JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,
dissenting.
The Court now holds that Congress and the legislatures
of the 50 States are prohibited by the Constitution from
identifying any category of murderers under the age of 18
who must be sentenced to life imprisonment without
parole. Even a 17½-year-old who sets off a bomb in a
crowded mall or guns down a dozen students and teachers is a “child” and must be given a chance to persuade
a judge to permit his release into society. Nothing in
the Constitution supports this arrogation of legislative
authority.
The Court long ago abandoned the original meaning of
the Eighth Amendment, holding instead that the prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishment” embodies the
“evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a
maturing society.” Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958)
