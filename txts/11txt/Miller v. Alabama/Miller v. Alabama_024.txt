MILLER v. ALABAMA
Opinion of the Court

dictions (28 States and the Federal Government) make
a life-without-parole term mandatory for some juveniles
convicted of murder in adult court.9 The States argue that
this number precludes our holding.
We do not agree; indeed, we think the States’ argument
on this score weaker than the one we rejected in Graham.
For starters, the cases here are different from the typical
one in which we have tallied legislative enactments. Our
decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class
of offenders or type of crime—as, for example, we did in
Roper or Graham. Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process—considering an offender’s
youth and attendant characteristics—before imposing a
particular penalty. And in so requiring, our decision flows
straightforwardly from our precedents: specifically, the
principle of Roper, Graham, and our individualized sentencing cases that youth matters for purposes of meting
out the law’s most serious punishments. When both of
those circumstances have obtained in the past, we have
not scrutinized or relied in the same way on legislative
——————
9 The

States note that 26 States and the Federal Government make
life without parole the mandatory (or mandatory minimum) punishment for some form of murder, and would apply the relevant provision
to 14-year-olds (with many applying it to even younger defendants).
See Alabama Brief 17–18. In addition, life without parole is mandatory
for older juveniles in Louisiana (age 15 and up) and Texas (age 17). See
La. Child. Code Ann., Arts. 857(A), (B) (West Supp. 2012); La. Rev.
Stat. Ann. §§14:30(C), 14:30.1(B) (West Supp. 2012); Tex. Family Code
Ann. §§51.02(2)(A), 54.02(a)(2)(A) (West Supp. 2011); Tex. Penal Code
Ann. §12.31(a) (West 2011). In many of these jurisdictions, life without
parole is the mandatory punishment only for aggravated forms of
murder. That distinction makes no difference to our analysis. We have
consistently held that limiting a mandatory death penalty law to
particular kinds of murder cannot cure the law’s “constitutional vice” of
disregarding the “circumstances of the particular offense and the
character and propensities of the offender.” Roberts v. Louisiana, 428
U. S. 325, 333 (1976) (plurality opinion); see Sumner v. Shuman, 483
U. S. 66 (1987). The same analysis applies here, for the same reasons.
