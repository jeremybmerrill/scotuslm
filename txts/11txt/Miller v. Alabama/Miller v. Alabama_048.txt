MILLER v. ALABAMA
THOMAS, J., dissenting

The Court first relies on its cases “adopt[ing] categorical
bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity
of a penalty.” Ante, at 6–7. Of these categorical proportionality cases, the Court places particular emphasis on
Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), and Graham v.
Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010). In Roper, the Court held
that the Constitution prohibits the execution of an offender
who was under 18 at the time of his offense. 543 U. S.,
at 578. The Roper Court looked to, among other things, its
own sense of parental intuition and “scientific and sociological studies” to conclude that offenders under the age of
18 “cannot with reliability be classified among the worst
offenders.” Id., at 569. In Graham, the Court relied on
similar considerations to conclude that the Constitution
prohibits a life-without-parole sentence for a nonhomicide
offender who was under the age of 18 at the time of his
offense. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24).
The Court now concludes that mandatory life-withoutparole sentences for duly convicted juvenile murderers

principle: that imposition of a State’s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they
were not children.” Ante, at 11–12. But neither Roper nor
Graham held that specific procedural rules are required
for sentencing juvenile homicide offenders. And, the logic
of those cases should not be extended to create such a
requirement.
The Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States
by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that: “Excessive

that, even accepting the Court’s precedents, the Court’s holding in
today’s cases is unsupportable.
