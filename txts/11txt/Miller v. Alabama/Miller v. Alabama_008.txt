Opinion of the Court

Two justices dissented. They noted that Jackson was not
the shooter and that “any evidence of intent to kill was
severely lacking.”
Id., at 10, ___ S. W. 3d, at ___
(Danielson, J., dissenting). And they argued that Jackson’s mandatory sentence ran afoul of Graham’s admonition that “ ‘[a]n offender’s age is relevant to the Eighth

Like Jackson, petitioner Evan Miller was 14 years old at

law. See, e.g., Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 690–691 (1975).
