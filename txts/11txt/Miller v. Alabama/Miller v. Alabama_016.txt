MILLER v. ALABAMA
Opinion of the Court

most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed
as though they were not children.
And Graham makes plain these mandatory schemes’
defects in another way: by likening life-without-parole
sentences imposed on juveniles to the death penalty itself.
Life-without-parole terms, the Court wrote, “share some
characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no
other sentences.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). Imprisoning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of
his life “by a forfeiture that is irrevocable.” Ibid. (citing
Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 300–301 (1983)). And this
lengthiest possible incarceration is an “especially harsh
punishment for a juvenile,” because he will almost inevitably serve “more years and a greater percentage of his life
in prison than an adult offender.” Graham, 560 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 19–20). The penalty when imposed on a
teenager, as compared with an older person, is therefore
“the same . . . in name only.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 20).
All of that suggested a distinctive set of legal rules: In part
because we viewed this ultimate penalty for juveniles as
akin to the death penalty, we treated it similarly to that
most severe punishment. We imposed a categorical ban on
the sentence’s use, in a way unprecedented for a term of
imprisonment. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 9); id., at ___
(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (“For the first time
in its history, the Court declares an entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital sentence using the categorical approach it previously reserved for death penalty cases
alone”). And the bar we adopted mirrored a proscription
first established in the death penalty context—that the
punishment cannot be imposed for any nonhomicide
crimes against individuals. See Kennedy, 554 U. S. 407;
Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977).
That correspondence—Graham’s “[t]reat[ment] [of]
juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital punishment,” 560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in
