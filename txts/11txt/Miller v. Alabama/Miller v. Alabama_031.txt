Opinion of the Court

to imagine a judge deciding that a minor deserves a
(much) harsher sentence than he would receive in juvenile
court, while still not thinking life-without-parole appropriate. For that reason, the discretion available to a judge
at the transfer stage cannot substitute for discretion at
post-trial sentencing in adult court—and so cannot satisfy
the Eighth Amendment.
IV
Graham, Roper, and our individualized sentencing
decisions make clear that a judge or jury must have the
opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before
imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles. By
requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive
lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the
nature of their crimes, the mandatory sentencing schemes
before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so
the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. We accordingly reverse the judgments of the
Arkansas Supreme Court and Alabama Court of Criminal
Appeals and remand the cases for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
