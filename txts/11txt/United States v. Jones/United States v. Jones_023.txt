ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

accepts the holding in United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S.
276 (1983), that the use of a surreptitiously planted electronic device to monitor a vehicle’s movements on public
roads did not amount to a search. See ante, at 7.
The Court argues—and I agree—that “we must ‘assur[e]
preservation of that degree of privacy against government
that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.’ ”
Ante, at 5 (quoting Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27,
34 (2001)). But it is almost impossible to think of late18th-century situations that are analogous to what took
place in this case. (Is it possible to imagine a case in
which a constable secreted himself somewhere in a coach
and remained there for a period of time in order to monitor
the movements of the coach’s owner?3) The Court’s theory
seems to be that the concept of a search, as originally understood, comprehended any technical trespass that led
to the gathering of evidence, but we know that this is incorrect. At common law, any unauthorized intrusion on
private property was actionable, see Prosser & Keeton 75,
but a trespass on open fields, as opposed to the “curtilage”
of a home, does not fall within the scope of the Fourth
Amendment because private property outside the curtilage
is not part of a “hous[e]” within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment. See Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170
(1984); Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 (1924).
B
The Court’s reasoning in this case is very similar to that
in the Court’s early decisions involving wiretapping and
electronic eavesdropping, namely, that a technical trespass followed by the gathering of evidence constitutes a
——————
The Court suggests that something like this might have occurred in
1791, but this would have required either a gigantic coach, a very tiny
constable, or both—not to mention a constable with incredible fortitude
and patience.
