Opinion of the Court

438 (1928), we held that wiretaps attached to telephone
wires on the public streets did not constitute a Fourth
Amendment search because “[t]here was no entry of the
houses or offices of the defendants,” id., at 464.
Our later cases, of course, have deviated from that
exclusively property-based approach. In Katz v. United
States, 389 U. S. 347, 351 (1967), we said that “the Fourth
Amendment protects people, not places,” and found a
violation in attachment of an eavesdropping device to a
public telephone booth. Our later cases have applied the
analysis of Justice Harlan’s concurrence in that case,
which said that a violation occurs when government officers violate a person’s “reasonable expectation of privacy,”
id., at 360. See, e.g., Bond v. United States, 529 U. S. 334
(2000); California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207 (1986); Smith
v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735 (1979).
The Government contends that the Harlan standard
shows that no search occurred here, since Jones had no
“reasonable expectation of privacy” in the area of the Jeep
accessed by Government agents (its underbody) and in the
locations of the Jeep on the public roads, which were
visible to all. But we need not address the Government’s
contentions, because Jones’s Fourth Amendment rights
do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom,
we must “assur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy
against government that existed when the Fourth
Amendment was adopted.” Kyllo, supra, at 34. As explained, for most of our history the Fourth Amendment
was understood to embody a particular concern for government trespass upon the areas (“persons, houses, papers, and effects”) it enumerates.3 Katz did not repudiate

3 JUSTICE ALITO’s concurrence (hereinafter concurrence) doubts the
wisdom of our approach because “it is almost impossible to think of
late-18th-century situations that are analogous to what took place in
this case.” Post, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment). But in fact it
posits a situation that is not far afield—a constable’s concealing himself
