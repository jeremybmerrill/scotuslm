UNITED STATES v. JONES
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

lance is long enough to constitute a Fourth Amendment
search, the police may always seek a warrant.11 We also
need not consider whether prolonged GPS monitoring in
the context of investigations involving extraordinary
offenses would similarly intrude on a constitutionally
protected sphere of privacy. In such cases, long-term
tracking might have been mounted using previously available techniques.

For these reasons, I conclude that the lengthy monitoring that occurred in this case constituted a search under
the Fourth Amendment. I therefore agree with the majority that the decision of the Court of Appeals must be
affirmed.

——————
11 In this case, the agents obtained a warrant, but they did not comply
with two of the warrant’s restrictions: They did not install the GPS
device within the 10-day period required by the terms of the warrant
and by Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(e)(2)(B)(i), and they did not install the
GPS device within the District of Columbia, as required by the terms
of the warrant and by 18 U. S. C. §3117(a) and Rule 41(b)(4). In the
courts below the Government did not argue, and has not argued here,
that the Fourth Amendment does not impose these precise restrictions
and that the violation of these restrictions does not demand the suppression of evidence obtained using the tracking device. See, e.g.,
United States v. Gerber, 994 F. 2d 1556, 1559–1560 (CA11 1993);
United States v. Burke, 517 F. 2d 377, 386–387 (CA2 1975). Because it
was not raised, that question is not before us.
