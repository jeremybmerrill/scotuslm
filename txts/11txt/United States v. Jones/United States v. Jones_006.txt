UNITED STATES v. JONES
Opinion of the Court

It is important to be clear about what occurred in this
case: The Government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information. We have no
doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been
considered a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment when it was adopted. Entick v. Carrington,
95 Eng. Rep. 807 (C. P. 1765), is a “case we have described
as a ‘monument of English freedom’ ‘undoubtedly familiar’
to ‘every American statesman’ at the time the Constitution
was adopted, and considered to be ‘the true and ultimate
expression of constitutional law’ ” with regard to search
and seizure. Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U. S. 593, 596
(1989) (quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626
(1886)). In that case, Lord Camden expressed in plain
terms the significance of property rights in search-andseizure analysis:
“[O]ur law holds the property of every man so sacred,
that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour’s close
without his leave; if he does he is a trespasser, though
he does no damage at all; if he will tread upon his
neighbour’s ground, he must justify it by law.” Entick,
supra, at 817.
The text of the Fourth Amendment reflects its close connection to property, since otherwise it would have referred
simply to “the right of the people to be secure against
unreasonable searches and seizures”; the phrase “in their
persons, houses, papers, and effects” would have been
superfluous.
Consistent with this understanding, our Fourth
Amendment jurisprudence was tied to common-law trespass, at least until the latter half of the 20th century.
