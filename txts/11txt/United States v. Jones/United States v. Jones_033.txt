expenditure of law enforcement resources. Devices like
the one used in the present case, however, make long-term
monitoring relatively easy and cheap. In circumstances
involving dramatic technological change, the best solution
to privacy concerns may be legislative. See, e.g., Kerr, 102
Mich. L. Rev., at 805–806. A legislative body is well situated to gauge changing public attitudes, to draw detailed
lines, and to balance privacy and public safety in a comprehensive way.
To date, however, Congress and most States have not
enacted statutes regulating the use of GPS tracking technology for law enforcement purposes. The best that we
can do in this case is to apply existing Fourth Amendment
doctrine and to ask whether the use of GPS tracking in a
particular case involved a degree of intrusion that a reasonable person would not have anticipated.
Under this approach, relatively short-term monitoring
of a person’s movements on public streets accords with
expectations of privacy that our society has recognized
as reasonable. See Knotts, 460 U. S., at 281–282. But
the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of
most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy. For
such offenses, society’s expectation has been that law
enforcement agents and others would not—and indeed, in
the main, simply could not—secretly monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual’s car for
a very long period. In this case, for four weeks, law enforcement agents tracked every movement that respondent made in the vehicle he was driving. We need not
identify with precision the point at which the tracking of
this vehicle became a search, for the line was surely
crossed before the 4-week mark. Other cases may present
more difficult questions. But where uncertainty exists
with respect to whether a certain period of GPS surveil
