UNITED STATES v. JONES
Opinion of the Court

on public streets” is okay, but that “the use of longer term
GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses” is no
good. Post, at 13 (emphasis added). That introduces yet
another novelty into our jurisprudence. There is no precedent for the proposition that whether a search has occurred depends on the nature of the crime being investigated. And even accepting that novelty, it remains
unexplained why a 4-week investigation is “surely” too
long and why a drug-trafficking conspiracy involving substantial amounts of cash and narcotics is not an “extraordinary offens[e]” which may permit longer observation.
See post, at 13–14. What of a 2-day monitoring of a
suspected purveyor of stolen electronics? Or of a 6-month
monitoring of a suspected terrorist? We may have to
grapple with these “vexing problems” in some future case
where a classic trespassory search is not involved and
resort must be had to Katz analysis; but there is no reason
for rushing forward to resolve them here.
III
The Government argues in the alternative that even if
the attachment and use of the device was a search, it was
reasonable—and thus lawful—under the Fourth Amendment because “officers had reasonable suspicion, and indeed probable cause, to believe that [Jones] was a leader
in a large-scale cocaine distribution conspiracy.” Brief for
United States 50–51. We have no occasion to consider this
argument. The Government did not raise it below, and
the D. C. Circuit therefore did not address it. See 625
F. 3d, at 767 (Ginsburg, Tatel, and Griffith, JJ., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc). We consider the
argument forfeited. See Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537
U. S. 51, 56, n. 4 (2002).
