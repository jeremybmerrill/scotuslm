UNITED STATES v. JONES
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

to treat secrecy as a prerequisite for privacy. I would not
assume that all information voluntarily disclosed to some
member of the public for a limited purpose is, for that
reason alone, disentitled to Fourth Amendment protection.
See Smith, 442 U. S., at 749 (Marshall, J., dissenting)
(“Privacy is not a discrete commodity, possessed absolutely
or not at all. Those who disclose certain facts to a bank or
phone company for a limited business purpose need not
assume that this information will be released to other
persons for other purposes”); see also Katz, 389 U. S., at
351–352 (“[W]hat [a person] seeks to preserve as private,
even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected”).
Resolution of these difficult questions in this case is
unnecessary, however, because the Government’s physical
intrusion on Jones’ Jeep supplies a narrower basis for
decision. I therefore join the majority’s opinion.
