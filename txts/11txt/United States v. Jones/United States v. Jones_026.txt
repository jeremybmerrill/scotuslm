UNITED STATES v. JONES
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

at 353.
Under this approach, as the Court later put it when
addressing the relevance of a technical trespass, “an actual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish
a constitutional violation.” United States v. Karo, 468
U. S. 705, 713 (1984) (emphasis added). Ibid. (“Compar[ing] Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) (no
trespass, but Fourth Amendment violation), with Oliver v.

Fourth Amendment violation)”). In Oliver, the Court
wrote:
“The existence of a property right is but one element
in determining whether expectations of privacy are

some internal quotation marks omitted).” 466 U. S.,

The majority suggests that two post-Katz decisions—
Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56 (1992), and Alderman
v. United States, 394 U. S. 165 (1969)—show that a technical trespass is sufficient to establish the existence of a
search, but they provide little support.
In Soldal, the Court held that towing away a trailer
home without the owner’s consent constituted a seizure
even if this did not invade the occupants’ personal privacy.
But in the present case, the Court does not find that there
was a seizure, and it is clear that none occurred.
In Alderman, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment rights of homeowners were implicated by the use of a
surreptitiously planted listening device to monitor thirdparty conversations that occurred within their home. See
394 U. S., at 176–180. Alderman is best understood to
