UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ANTOINE JONES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT



[January 23, 2012]




JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE
BREYER, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, concurring in the
judgment.
This case requires us to apply the Fourth Amendment’s
prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures to a
21st-century surveillance technique, the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS) device to monitor a vehicle’s movements for an extended period of time. Ironically, the Court
has chosen to decide this case based on 18th-century
tort law. By attaching a small GPS device1 to the underside of the vehicle that respondent drove, the law enforcement officers in this case engaged in conduct that might
have provided grounds in 1791 for a suit for trespass
to chattels.2 And for this reason, the Court concludes,
the installation and use of the GPS device constituted
a search. Ante, at 3–4.
——————
1 Although the record does not reveal the size or weight of the device
used in this case, there is now a device in use that weighs two ounces
and is the size of a credit card. Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.
2 At common law, a suit for trespass to chattels could be maintained if
there was a violation of “the dignitary interest in the inviolability of
chattels,” but today there must be “some actual damage to the chattel
before the action can be maintained.” W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton,
& D. Owen, Prosser & Keeton on Law of Torts 87 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser & Keeton). Here, there was no actual damage to the
vehicle to which the GPS device was attached.
