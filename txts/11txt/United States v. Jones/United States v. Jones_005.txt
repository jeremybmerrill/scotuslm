Opinion of the Court

ment, charging Jones and others with the same conspiracy. The Government introduced at trial the same GPSderived locational data admitted in the first trial, which
connected Jones to the alleged conspirators’ stash house
that contained $850,000 in cash, 97 kilograms of cocaine,
and 1 kilogram of cocaine base. The jury returned a guilty
verdict, and the District Court sentenced Jones to life
imprisonment.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit reversed the conviction because of admission of the evidence obtained by warrantless use of
the GPS device which, it said, violated the Fourth Amendment. United States v. Maynard, 615 F. 3d 544 (2010).
The D. C. Circuit denied the Government’s petition for
rehearing en banc, with four judges dissenting. 625 F. 3d
766 (2010). We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011).

A

The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that
“[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches
and seizures, shall not be violated.” It is beyond dispute
that a vehicle is an “effect” as that term is used in the
Amendment. United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 12
(1977). We hold that the Government’s installation of a
GPS device on a target’s vehicle,2 and its use of that device
to monitor the vehicle’s movements, constitutes a “search.”

we have noted, the Jeep was registered to Jones’s wife. The Government acknowledged, however, that Jones was “the exclusive driver.”
Id., at 555, n. (internal quotation marks omitted). If Jones was not the
owner he had at least the property rights of a bailee. The Court of
Appeals concluded that the vehicle’s registration did not affect his
ability to make a Fourth Amendment objection, ibid., and the Government has not challenged that determination here. We therefore do not
consider the Fourth Amendment significance of Jones’s status.
