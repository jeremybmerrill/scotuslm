UNITED STATES v. JONES
Opinion of the Court

search.7 475 U. S., at 114–115.
Finally, the Government’s position gains little support
from our conclusion in Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S.
170 (1984), that officers’ information-gathering intrusion
on an “open field” did not constitute a Fourth Amendment
search even though it was a trespass at common law, id.,
at 183. Quite simply, an open field, unlike the curtilage of
a home, see United States v. Dunn, 480 U. S. 294, 300
(1987), is not one of those protected areas enumerated in
the Fourth Amendment. Oliver, supra, at 176–177. See
also Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57, 59 (1924). The
Government’s physical intrusion on such an area—unlike
its intrusion on the “effect” at issue here—is of no Fourth
Amendment significance.8
B
The concurrence begins by accusing us of applying
“18th-century tort law.” Post, at 1. That is a distortion.
What we apply is an 18th-century guarantee against unreasonable searches, which we believe must provide at

Government also points to Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S. 583
(1974), in which the Court rejected the claim that the inspection of an
impounded vehicle’s tire tread and the collection of paint scrapings
from its exterior violated the Fourth Amendment. Whether the plurality said so because no search occurred or because the search was reasonable is unclear. Compare id., at 591 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)
(“[W]e fail to comprehend what expectation of privacy was infringed”),
with id., at 592 (“Under circumstances such as these, where probable
cause exists, a warrantless examination of the exterior of a car is not
unreasonable . . . ”).
8 Thus, our theory is not that the Fourth Amendment is concerned
with “any technical trespass that led to the gathering of evidence.”
Post, at 3 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis added). The
Fourth Amendment protects against trespassory searches only with
regard to those items (“persons, houses, papers, and effects”) that it
enumerates. The trespass that occurred in Oliver may properly be
understood as a “search,” but not one “in the constitutional sense.” 466
U. S., at 170, 183.
