ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

Property Act,5 respondent would likely be an owner of
the vehicle, and it would not matter whether the GPS was
installed before or after his wife turned over the keys. In
non-community-property States, on the other hand, the
registration of the vehicle in the name of respondent’s wife
would generally be regarded as presumptive evidence that
she was the sole owner. See 60 C. J. S., Motor Vehicles
§231, pp. 398–399 (2002); 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Automobiles
§1208, pp. 859–860 (2007).
Fourth, the Court’s reliance on the law of trespass will
present particularly vexing problems in cases involving
surveillance that is carried out by making electronic, as
opposed to physical, contact with the item to be tracked.
For example, suppose that the officers in the present case
had followed respondent by surreptitiously activating a
stolen vehicle detection system that came with the car
when it was purchased. Would the sending of a radio
signal to activate this system constitute a trespass to
chattels? Trespass to chattels has traditionally required a
physical touching of the property. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §217 and Comment e (1963 and 1964);
Dobbs, supra, at 123. In recent years, courts have wrestled with the application of this old tort in cases involving
unwanted electronic contact with computer systems, and
some have held that even the transmission of electrons
that occurs when a communication is sent from one computer to another is enough. See, e.g., CompuServe, Inc. v.
Cyber Promotions, Inc. 962 F. Supp. 1015, 1021 (SD Ohio
1997); Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek, 46 Cal. App. 4th 1559,
1566, n. 6 (1996). But may such decisions be followed in
applying the Court’s trespass theory? Assuming that
what matters under the Court’s theory is the law of trespass as it existed at the time of the adoption of the Fourth
