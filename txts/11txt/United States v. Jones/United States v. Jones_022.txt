UNITED STATES v. JONES
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

This holding, in my judgment, is unwise. It strains the
language of the Fourth Amendment; it has little if any
support in current Fourth Amendment case law; and it is

I would analyze the question presented in this case by
asking whether respondent’s reasonable expectations of
privacy were violated by the long-term monitoring of the
movements of the vehicle he drove.

The Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable
searches and seizures,” and the Court makes very little

when there is “some meaningful interference with an individual’s possessory interests in that property,” United
States v. Jacobsen, 466 U. S. 109, 113 (1984), and here
there was none. Indeed, the success of the surveillance
technique that the officers employed was dependent on
the fact that the GPS did not interfere in any way with
the operation of the vehicle, for if any such interference had
been detected, the device might have been discovered.
The Court does claim that the installation and use of the
GPS constituted a search, see ante, at 3–4, but this conclusion is dependent on the questionable proposition that
these two procedures cannot be separated for purposes of
Fourth Amendment analysis. If these two procedures are
analyzed separately, it is not at all clear from the Court’s
opinion why either should be regarded as a search. It is
clear that the attachment of the GPS device was not itself
a search; if the device had not functioned or if the officers
had not used it, no information would have been obtained.
And the Court does not contend that the use of the device
constituted a search either. On the contrary, the Court
