privacy in all conversations that took place under their

for the proposition that “the Court has not altogether
abandoned use of property concepts in determining the
presence or absence of the privacy interests protected by

rights reflect society’s explicit recognition of a person’s authority to act as he wishes in certain areas, and therefore should be considered in determining whether an
individual’s expectations of privacy are reasonable); Karo,
supra, at 732 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Alderman in support of the proposition
that “a homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy
in the contents of his home, including items owned by
others”).
In sum, the majority is hard pressed to find support in
post-Katz cases for its trespass-based theory.

Disharmony with a substantial body of existing case law
is only one of the problems with the Court’s approach in
this case.
I will briefly note four others. First, the Court’s reasoning largely disregards what is really important (the use of
a GPS for the purpose of long-term tracking) and instead
attaches great significance to something that most would
view as relatively minor (attaching to the bottom of a car a
small, light object that does not interfere in any way with
the car’s operation). Attaching such an object is generally
regarded as so trivial that it does not provide a basis for
recovery under modern tort law. See Prosser & Keeton
§14, at 87 (harmless or trivial contact with personal property not actionable); D. Dobbs, Law of Torts 124 (2000)
(same). But under the Court’s reasoning, this conduct
