UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ANTOINE JONES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT



[January 23, 2012]




JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion because I agree that a search
within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment occurs, at a
minimum, “[w]here, as here, the Government obtains
information by physically intruding on a constitutionally

(1979); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 361 (1967)
(Harlan, J., concurring). In Katz, this Court enlarged its
then-prevailing focus on property rights by announcing
