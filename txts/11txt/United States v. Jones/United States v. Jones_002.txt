UNITED STATES v. JONES
Syllabus
analysis of Justice Harlan’s concurrence in Katz v. United States, 389
U. S. 347, which said that the Fourth Amendment protects a person’s
“reasonable expectation of privacy,” id., at 360. Here, the Court need
not address the Government’s contention that Jones had no “reasonable expectation of privacy,” because Jones’s Fourth Amendment
rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom, the
Court must “assur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against
government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.”
Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 34. Katz did not repudiate the
understanding that the Fourth Amendment embodies a particular
concern for government trespass upon the areas it enumerates. The
Katz reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to, but
not substituted for, the common-law trespassory test. See Alderman
v. United States, 394 U. S. 165, 176; Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S.
56, 64. United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, and United States v.
Karo, 468 U. S. 705—post-Katz cases rejecting Fourth Amendment
challenges to “beepers,” electronic tracking devices representing another form of electronic monitoring—do not foreclose the conclusion
that a search occurred here. New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106, and
Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170, also do not support the Government’s position. Pp. 4–12.
(c) The Government’s alternative argument—that if the attachment and use of the device was a search, it was a reasonable one—is
forfeited because it was not raised below. P. 12.

615 F. 3d 544, affirmed.
SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,
C. J., and KENNEDY, THOMAS, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined. SOTOMAYOR,
J., filed a concurring opinion. ALITO, J., filed an opinion concurring in
the judgment, in which GINSBURG, BREYER, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.
