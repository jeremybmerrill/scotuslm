UNITED STATES v. JONES
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

may violate the Fourth Amendment. By contrast, if longterm monitoring can be accomplished without committing
a technical trespass—suppose, for example, that the Federal Government required or persuaded auto manufacturers to include a GPS tracking device in every car—the
Court’s theory would provide no protection.
Second, the Court’s approach leads to incongruous
results. If the police attach a GPS device to a car and use
the device to follow the car for even a brief time, under the
Court’s theory, the Fourth Amendment applies. But if the
police follow the same car for a much longer period using
unmarked cars and aerial assistance, this tracking is not
subject to any Fourth Amendment constraints.
In the present case, the Fourth Amendment applies, the
Court concludes, because the officers installed the GPS
device after respondent’s wife, to whom the car was registered, turned it over to respondent for his exclusive use.
See ante, at 8. But if the GPS had been attached prior to
that time, the Court’s theory would lead to a different
result. The Court proceeds on the assumption that respondent “had at least the property rights of a bailee,”
ante, at 3, n. 2, but a bailee may sue for a trespass to
chattel only if the injury occurs during the term of the
bailment. See 8A Am. Jur. 2d, Bailment §166, pp. 685–
686 (2009). So if the GPS device had been installed before
respondent’s wife gave him the keys, respondent would
have no claim for trespass—and, presumably, no Fourth
Amendment claim either.
Third, under the Court’s theory, the coverage of the
Fourth Amendment may vary from State to State. If the
events at issue here had occurred in a community property
State4 or a State that has adopted the Uniform Marital
