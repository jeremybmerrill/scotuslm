UNITED STATES v. JONES
Opinion of the Court

wife. A warrant issued, authorizing installation of the device in the District of Columbia and within 10 days.
On the 11th day, and not in the District of Columbia but
in Maryland,1 agents installed a GPS tracking device on
the undercarriage of the Jeep while it was parked in a
public parking lot. Over the next 28 days, the Government used the device to track the vehicle’s movements,
and once had to replace the device’s battery when the
vehicle was parked in a different public lot in Maryland.
By means of signals from multiple satellites, the device
established the vehicle’s location within 50 to 100 feet, and
communicated that location by cellular phone to a Government computer. It relayed more than 2,000 pages of
data over the 4-week period.
The Government ultimately obtained a multiple-count
indictment charging Jones and several alleged coconspirators with, as relevant here, conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or
more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in
violation of 21 U. S. C. §§841 and 846. Before trial, Jones
filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained through the
GPS device. The District Court granted the motion only in
part, suppressing the data obtained while the vehicle was
parked in the garage adjoining Jones’s residence. 451
F. Supp. 2d 71, 88 (2006). It held the remaining data
admissible, because “ ‘[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation
of privacy in his movements from one place to another.’ ”

(1983)). Jones’s trial in October 2006 produced a hung
jury on the conspiracy count.
In March 2007, a grand jury returned another indict——————
1 In this litigation, the Government has conceded noncompliance with
the warrant and has argued only that a warrant was not required.
