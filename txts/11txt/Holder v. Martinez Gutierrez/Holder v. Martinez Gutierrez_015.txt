Opinion of the Court

(“the immigrant”) and says nothing about imputation. But
the BIA has consistently imputed a parent’s knowledge
of inadmissibility (or lack thereof ) to a child. See, e.g.,
Senica v. INS, 16 F. 3d 1013, 1015 (CA9 1994) (“Therefore,
the BIA reasoned, the children were not entitled to relief
under [§1182(k)] because [their mother’s] knowledge was
imputed to them”); In re Mushtaq, No. A43 968 082, 2007
WL 4707539 (BIA, Dec. 10, 2007) (per curiam); In re Ahmed, No. A41 982 631, 2006 WL 448156 (BIA, Jan. 17,
2006) (per curiam).
Similarly, the Board imputes a parent’s abandonment
(or non-abandonment) of LPR status to her child when
determining whether that child can reenter the country as
a “returning resident immigran[t]” under §1181(b). See
Matter of Zamora, 17 I. & N. Dec. 395, 396 (1980) (holding that a “voluntary and intended abandonment by the
mother is imputed” to an unemancipated minor child for
purposes of applying §1181(b)); Matter of Huang, 19 I.
& N. Dec. 749, 755–756 (1988) (concluding that a mother
and her children abandoned their LPR status based
solely on the mother’s intent); In re Ali, No. A44 143 723,
2006 WL 3088820 (BIA, Sept. 11, 2006) (holding that a
child could not have abandoned his LPR status if his
mother had not abandoned hers). And once again, that is
so even though neither §1181(b) nor any other statutory
provision says that the BIA should look to the parent in
assessing the child’s eligibility for reentry.
But Escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these
divergent results: The Board imputes matters involving an
alien’s state of mind, while declining to impute objective
conditions or characteristics. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233–
234, and n. 4. On one side of the line, knowledge of inadmissibility is all and only about a mental state. See, e.g.,
Senica, 16 F. 3d, at 1015; In re Ahmed, 2006 WL 448156.
Likewise, abandonment of status turns on an alien’s “intention of . . . returning to the United States” to live as a
