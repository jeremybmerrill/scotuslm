HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ
Opinion of the Court

permanent resident, Zamora, 17 I. & N. Dec., at 396; the
Board thus explained that imputing abandonment is
“consistent with the . . . longstanding policy that a child
cannot form the intent necessary to establish his or her
own domicile,” Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 234, n. 4. And
as that analogy recalls, the 7-year domicile requirement of
the former §212(c) also involved intent and so lent itself to
imputation. See Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; supra, at 8.
But the 5- and 7-year clocks of §1229b(a) fall on the other
side of the line, because they hinge not on any state of
mind but on the objective facts of immigration status and
place of residence. See Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233
(“[W]e find that residence is different from domicile because it ‘contains no element of subjective intent’ ” (quoting Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F. 3d, at 1031 (Fernandez, J.,
dissenting))). The BIA’s varied rulings on imputation thus
largely follow from one straightforward distinction.4
Similarly, Escobar belies respondents’ claim that the
BIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it
thought Congress had left it no other choice. The Board,
to be sure, did not highlight the statute’s gaps or ambiguity;
rather, it read §1229b(a)’s text to support its conclusion
that each alien must personally meet that section’s dura——————
4 Respondents aver that the BIA deviates from this principle in imputing to a child his parent’s “ ‘firm resettlement’ ” in another country,
which renders an alien ineligible for asylum without regard to intent.
See Sawyers Brief 39; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 52. But the Government denies that it has a “settled imputation rule” in that context.
Reply Brief for Petitioner 13. And the sources on which respondents
rely are slender reeds: a 40-year old ruling by a regional commissioner
(not the Board itself) that considered the conduct of both the parents
and the child, see Matter of Ng, 12 I. & N. Dec. 411 (1967), and a Ninth
Circuit decision imputing a parent’s resettlement even though the
Board had focused only on the child’s actions, see Vang v. INS, 146
F. 3d 1114, 1117 (1998). Based on these scant decisions, we cannot
conclude that the Board has any policy on imputing resettlement, let
alone one inconsistent with Escobar.
