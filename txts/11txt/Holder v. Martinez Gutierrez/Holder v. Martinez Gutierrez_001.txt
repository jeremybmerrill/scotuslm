HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. MARTINEZ 

GUTIERREZ 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 10–1542. Argued January 18, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012*
Title 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a) authorizes the Attorney General to cancel the
removal of an alien from the United States who, among other things,
has held the status of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least
five years, §1229b(a)(1), and has lived in the United States for at
least seven continuous years after a lawful admission, §1229b(a)(2).
These cases concern whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA
or Board) should impute a parent’s years of continuous residence or
LPR status to his or her child. That issue arises because a child may
enter the country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of his
parents does—meaning that a parent may satisfy §1229b(a)(1) or
§1229b(a)(2), while his child, considered independently, does not. In
In re Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec. 231, the BIA concluded that an alien
must meet §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own. But the Ninth Circuit found the Board’s position unreasonable, holding that
§1229b(a)(1) and §1229b(a)(2) require imputation. See MercadoZazueta v. Holder, 580 F. 3d 1102; Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430
F. 3d 1013.
Respondent Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered the country with
his family in 1989, when he was 5 years old. Martinez Gutierrez’s father was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an LPR.
But Martinez Gutierrez was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR
status until 2003. Two years after that, he was apprehended for
smuggling undocumented aliens across the border. Admitting the offense, he sought cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge
