acquisition of LPR status. In doing so, Congress eliminated the very term—“domicile”—on which the appeals courts
had founded their imputation decisions. See supra, at 8.
That alteration dooms respondents’ position, because the
doctrine of congressional ratification applies only when
Congress reenacts a statute without relevant change. See
Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S.
335, 349 (2005).3 So the statutory history here provides no
basis for holding that the BIA flouted a congressional
command in adopting its no-imputation policy.
Nor do the INA’s purposes demand imputation here, as
both respondents claim. According to Martinez Gutierrez,
the BIA’s approach contradicts that statute’s objectives of
“providing relief to aliens with strong ties to the United
States” and “promoting family unity.” Martinez Gutierrez
Brief 40, 44; see Sawyers Brief 37. We agree—indeed, we
have stated—that the goals respondents identify underlie
or inform many provisions of immigration law. See Fiallo
v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787, 795, n. 6 (1977); INS v. Errico, 385
U. S. 214, 220 (1966). But they are not the INA’s only
goals, and Congress did not pursue them to the nth degree. To take one example, §1229b(a)’s third paragraph
makes aliens convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for

3 Sawyers contends that §1229b(a)(2)’s replacement term—“resided
continuously”—is a “term of art” in the immigration context which
incorporates “an intent component” and so means the same thing as
“domiciled.” Sawyers Brief 25–26 (emphasis deleted). Thus, Sawyers
argues, we should read §1229b(a) as reenacting §212(c) without meaningful change. See id., at 25. But even assuming that Congress could
ratify judicial decisions based on the term “domicile” through a new
statute using a synonym for that term, we do not think “resided continuously” qualifies. The INA defines “residence” as a person’s “principal, actual dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent,” 8 U. S. C.
§1101(a)(33) (emphasis added), and we find nothing to suggest that
Congress added an intent element, inconsistent with that definition, by
requiring that the residence have been maintained “continuously for 7
years.”
