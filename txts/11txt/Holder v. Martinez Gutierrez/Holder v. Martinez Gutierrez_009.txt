Opinion of the Court

the Ninth Circuit doubled down on its contrary view,
declaring the BIA’s position unreasonable and requiring
imputation under both §§1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2). See id.,
at 1103 (“[T]he rationale and holding of Cuevas-Gaspar
apply equally to the five-year permanent residence and
the seven-year continuance residence requirements” of
§1229b(a)).

Two cases are before us. In 1989, at the age of five,
respondent Carlos Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered
the United States with his family. Martinez Gutierrez’s
father was lawfully admitted to the country two years
later as an LPR. But Martinez Gutierrez himself was
neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until
2003. Two years after that, Martinez Gutierrez was apprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the
border. He admitted the offense, and sought cancellation
of removal. The Immigration Judge concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his father’s
immigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez
could not satisfy either §1229b(a)(1) or §1229b(a)(2) on his
own. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1542, pp. 20a–
22a (citing Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F. 3d 1013). The BIA
reversed, and after entry of a removal order on remand,
reaffirmed its disposition in an order relying on Escobar,
see App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1542, at 5a–6a. The
Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez Gutierrez’s petition
for review and remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of the court’s contrary decisions. See
411 Fed. Appx. 121 (2011).
Respondent Damien Sawyers was lawfully admitted as
an LPR in October 1995, when he was 15 years old. At
that time, his mother had already resided in the country
for six consecutive years following a lawful entry. After
Sawyers’s conviction of a drug offense in August 2002, the
