v.
DAMIEN ANTONIO SAWYERS
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[May 21, 2012]

JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
An immigration statute, 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a), authorizes
the Attorney General to cancel the removal of an alien
from the United States so long as the alien satisfies certain criteria. One of those criteria relates to the length of
time an alien has lawfully resided in the United States,
and another to the length of time he has held permanent
resident status here. We consider whether the Board of
Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) could reasonably
conclude that an alien living in this country as a child
must meet those requirements on his own, without counting a parent’s years of residence or immigration status.
We hold that the BIA’s approach is based on a permissible
construction of the statute.
