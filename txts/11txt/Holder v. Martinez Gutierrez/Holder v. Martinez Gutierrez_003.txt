language to provide for imputation. But in enacting §1229b(a), Congress eliminated the very term—“domicile”—on which the appeals
courts had founded their imputation decisions. And the doctrine of
congressional ratification applies only when Congress reenacts a
statute without relevant change. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 349.
Nor do the INA’s purposes demand imputation. As respondents
correctly observe, many provisions of immigration law advance the
goals of promoting family unity and providing relief to aliens with
strong ties to this country. But these are not the INA’s only goals,
and Congress did not pursue them at all costs. For example, aliens
convicted of aggravated felonies are ineligible for cancellation of
removal, regardless of the strength of their family ties, see
§1229b(a)(3). In addition, as these cases show, not every alien with
LPR status can immediately get the same for a spouse or minor child.
A silent statute cannot be read as requiring imputation just because
that rule would be family-friendly. Pp. 7–10.
(c) Respondents advance two additional arguments for why the
Board’s position is not entitled to Chevron deference. First, they
claim that the Board’s approach to §1229b(a) is arbitrary because it is
inconsistent with the Board’s acceptance of imputation under other,
similar provisions that are silent on the matter. See §1182(k) and
§1181(b). But the Board’s decision in Escobar provided a reasoned
explanation for these divergent results: The Board imputes matters
involving an alien’s state of mind, while declining to impute objective
conditions or characteristics. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233–234, and
n. 4. Section 1229b(a) hinges on the objective facts of immigration
status and place of residence. See id., at 233. So the Board’s
approach to §1229b(a) largely follows from one straightforward
distinction.
Second, respondents claim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation
rule only because it thought Congress had left it no other choice. But
Escobar belies this contention.
The Board did explain how
§1229b(a)’s text supports its no-imputation policy. But the Board also brought its experience and expertise to bear on the matter: It noted that there was no precedent in its decisions for imputing status or
residence, and it argued that allowing imputation under §1229b(a)
would create anomalies in the statutory scheme. Escobar thus expressed the BIA’s view that statutory text, administrative practice,
and regulatory policy all pointed toward disallowing imputation. In
making that case, the opinion reads like a multitude of agency interpretations to which this and other courts have routinely deferred.
