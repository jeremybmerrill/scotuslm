HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ
Opinion of the Court

Government initiated removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of
removal because he was a few months shy of the seven
years of continuous residence required under §1229b(a)(2).
See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1543, p. 13a. (No one
doubted that Sawyers had by that time held LPR status
for five years, as required under §1229b(a)(1).) The Board
affirmed, relying on its reasoning in Escobar. See In
re Sawyers, No. A44 852 478, 2007 WL 4711443 (Dec.
26, 2007). Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for
review, arguing that the Board should have counted his
mother’s years of residency while he was a minor toward
§1229b(a)(2)’s 7-year requirement. As in Gutierrez, the
Court of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the
case to the BIA. See 399 Fed. Appx. 313 (2010).
We granted the Government’s petitions for certiorari,
564 U. S. ___ (2011), consolidated the cases, and now
reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgments.
II
The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation
of removal to satisfy §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own,
without counting a parent’s years of continuous residence
or LPR status. That position prevails if it is a reasonable
construction of the statute, whether or not it is the only
possible interpretation or even the one a court might think
best. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844, and n. 11
(1984); see also INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415,
424–425 (1999) (according Chevron deference to the
Board’s interpretations of the INA). We think the BIA’s
view on imputation meets that standard, and so need not
decide if the statute permits any other construction.
The Board’s approach is consistent with the statute’s
text, as even respondents tacitly concede.
Section
1229b(a) does not mention imputation, much less require
