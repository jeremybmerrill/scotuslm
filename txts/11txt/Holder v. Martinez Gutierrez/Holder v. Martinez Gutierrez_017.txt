Opinion of the Court

tional requirements. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 235. But the
Board also explained that “there [was] no precedent” in its
decisions for imputing status or residence, and distinguished those statutory terms, on the ground just explained, from domicile or abandonment of LPR status. Id.,
at 234; see id., at 233–234, and n. 4. And the Board argued that allowing imputation under §1229b(a) would
create anomalies in administration of the statutory
scheme by permitting even those who had not obtained
LPR status—or could not do so because of a criminal
history—to become eligible for cancellation of removal.
See id., at 234–235, and n. 5. The Board therefore saw
neither a “logical” nor a “legal” basis for adopting a policy
of imputation. Id., at 233. We see nothing in this decision
to suggest that the Board thought its hands tied, or that it
might have reached a different result if assured it could do
so. To the contrary, the decision expressed the BIA’s view,
based on its experience implementing the INA, that statutory text, administrative practice, and regulatory policy all
pointed in one direction: toward disallowing imputation.
In making that case, the decision reads like a multitude
of agency interpretations—not the best example, but far
from the worst—to which we and other courts have routinely deferred. We see no reason not to do so here.
Because the Board’s rejection of imputation under
§1229b(a) is “based on a permissible construction of the
statute,” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843, we reverse the Ninth
Circuit’s judgments and remand the cases for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
