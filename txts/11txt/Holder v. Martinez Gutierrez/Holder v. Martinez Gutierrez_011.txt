Opinion of the Court

it. The provision calls for “the alien”—not, say, “the alien
or one of his parents”—to meet the three prerequisites for
cancellation of removal. Similarly, several of §1229b(a)’s
other terms have statutory definitions referring to only a
single individual. See, e.g., §1101(a)(13)(A) (“The terms
‘admission’ and ‘admitted’ mean, with respect to an alien,
the lawful entry of the alien into the United States” (emphasis added)); §1101(a)(33) (“The term ‘residence’ means
the place of general abode; the place of general abode of
a person means his principal, actual dwelling” (emphasis
added)). Respondents contend that none of this language
“forecloses” imputation: They argue that if the Board
allowed imputation, “[t]he alien” seeking cancellation
would “still have to satisfy the provision’s durational
requirements”—just pursuant to a different computational
rule. Brief for Respondent Martinez Gutierrez in No. 10–
1542, p. 16 (hereinafter Martinez Gutierrez Brief); see
Brief for Respondent Sawyers in No. 10–1543, pp. 11, 15
(hereinafter Sawyers Brief). And they claim that the
Board’s history of permitting imputation under similarly
“silent” statutes supports this construction. Martinez
Gutierrez Brief 16; see Sawyers Brief 15–16; infra, at 10–
11. But even if so—even if the Board could adopt an
imputation rule consistent with the statute’s text—that
would not avail respondents. Taken alone, the language of
§1229b(a) at least permits the Board to go the other way—
to say that “the alien” must meet the statutory conditions
independently, without relying on a parent’s history.
For this reason, respondents focus on §1229b(a)’s history
and context—particularly, the provision’s relationship to
the INA’s former §212(c) and its associated imputation
rule. Section 212(c)—§1229b(a)’s predecessor—generally
allowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an
alien with LPR status who had maintained a “lawful
unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years” in this
country. 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.). Like §1229b(a),
