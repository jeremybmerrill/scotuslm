Opinion of the Court

some other immigration status.1 (The third paragraph is
not at issue in these cases.)
The question we consider here is whether, in applying
this statutory provision, the BIA should impute a parent’s
years of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her
child. That question arises because a child may enter the
country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of
his parents does. A parent may therefore satisfy the requirements of §§1229b(a)(1) and (2), while his or her
child, considered independently, does not. In these circumstances, is the child eligible for cancellation of removal?
The Ninth Circuit, the first court of appeals to confront
this issue, held that such an alien could obtain relief. See
Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F. 3d 1013 (2005). Enrique Cuevas-Gaspar and his parents came to the United
States illegally in 1985, when he was one year old. CuevasGaspar’s mother was lawfully admitted to the country
in 1990, as an LPR. But Cuevas-Gaspar was lawfully
admitted only in 1997, when he too received LPR status.
That meant that when Cuevas-Gaspar committed a removable offense in 2002, he could not independently satisfy §1229b(a)(2)’s requirement of seven consecutive years of
residence after a lawful entry.2 (The parties agreed that
he just met §1229b(a)(1)’s 5-year status requirement.) The
Board deemed Cuevas-Gaspar ineligible for relief on that
account, but the Ninth Circuit found that position unrea——————
1 The

INA defines “admitted” as referring to “the lawful entry of
the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by
an immigration officer.” 8 U. S. C. §1101 (a)(13)(A). The 7-year clock of
§1229b(a)(2) thus begins with an alien’s lawful entry.
2 The 7-year clock stopped running on the date of Cuevas-Gaspar’s
offense under a statutory provision known as the “stop-time” rule. See
§1229b(d)(1) (“For purposes of this section, any period of continuous
residence . . . in the United States shall be deemed to end . . . when the
alien is served a notice to appear . . . or . . . when the alien has committed an offense . . . that renders the alien . . . removable from the United
States . . . , whichever is earliest”).
