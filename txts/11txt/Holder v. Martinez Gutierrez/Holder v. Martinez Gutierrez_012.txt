HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ
Opinion of the Court

§212(c) was silent on imputation. Yet the Second, Third,
and Ninth Circuits (the only appellate courts to consider
the question) concluded that, in determining eligibility for
relief under §212(c), the Board should impute a parent’s
years of domicile to his or her child. See Rosario v. INS,
962 F. 2d 220 (CA2 1992); Lepe-Guitron v. INS, 16 F. 3d
1021, 1024–1026 (CA9 1994); Morel v. INS, 90 F. 3d 833,
840–842 (CA3 1996). Those courts reasoned that at common law, a minor’s domicile was “the same as that of its
parents, since most children are presumed not legally
capable of forming the requisite intent to establish their
own domicile.” Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; see Mississippi
Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 48
(1989) (defining “domicile” as “physical presence in a place
in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one’s
intent to remain there”). So by the time Congress replaced
§212(c) with §1229b(a), the BIA often imputed a parent’s
years of domicile to a child in determining eligibility for
cancellation of removal. Sawyers argues that against this
backdrop, Congress “would have understood the language
it chose [in §1229b(a)] to provide for imputation.” Sawyers
Brief 10.
But we cannot conclude that Congress ratified an imputation requirement when it passed §1229b(a). As all parties
agree, Congress enacted §§1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2) to resolve
an unrelated question about §212(c)’s meaning. See id.,
at 17; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 28; Brief for Petitioner
25. Courts had differed on whether an alien’s “seven
consecutive years” of domicile under §212(c) all had to
post-date the alien’s obtaining LPR status. See CuevasGaspar, 430 F. 3d, at 1027–1028 (canvassing split). Congress addressed that split by creating two distinct durational conditions: the 5-year status requirement of subsection (a)(1), which runs from the time an alien becomes an
LPR, and the 7-year continuous-residency requirement of
subsection (a)(2), which can include years preceding the
