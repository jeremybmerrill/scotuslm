HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ
Opinion of the Court

sonable. According to the Court of Appeals, the Board
should have “imputed” to Cuevas-Gaspar his mother’s
years of continuous residence during the time he lived
with her as an “unemancipated minor.” Id., at 1029. That
approach, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, followed from both
the INA’s “priorit[ization]” of familial relations and the
Board’s “consistent willingness” to make imputations from
a parent to a child in many areas of immigration law. Id.,
at 1026.
The Board responded by reiterating its opposition to
imputation under both relevant paragraphs of §1229b(a).
In In re Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec. 231 (2007), the Board
considered whether a child could rely on a parent’s period
of LPR status to satisfy §1229b(a)(1)’s 5-year clock. The
Board expressly “disagree[d] with the reasoning” of CuevasGaspar, rejecting the Ninth Circuit’s understanding of
both the statute and the Board’s prior policies. 24 I. & N.
Dec., at 233–234, and n. 4. Accordingly, the Board announced that it would “decline to extend” Cuevas-Gaspar
to any case involving §1229b(a)(1), and that it would
ignore the decision even as to §1229b(a)(2) outside the
Ninth Circuit. 24 I. & N. Dec., at 235. A year later, in
Matter of Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. & N. Dec. 599 (2008), the
BIA took the final step: It rejected imputation under
§1229b(a)(2) in a case arising in the Ninth Circuit, maintaining that the court should abandon Cuevas-Gaspar and
defer to the Board’s intervening reasoned decision in
Escobar. See Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 600–601
(citing National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v.
Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967 (2005)).
The BIA’s position on imputation touched off a split in
the courts of appeals. The Third and Fifth Circuits both
deferred to the BIA’s approach as a reasonable construction of §1229b(a). See Augustin v. Attorney Gen., 520 F. 3d
264 (CA3 2008); Deus v. Holder, 591 F. 3d 807 (CA5 2009).
But in Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F. 3d 1102 (2009),
