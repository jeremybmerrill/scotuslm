SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus

JUDULANG v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 10–694.

Argued October 12, 2011—Decided December 12, 2011

Federal immigration law governs both the exclusion of aliens from admission to this country and the deportation of aliens previously admitted. Before 1996, these two kinds of action occurred in different
procedural settings; since then, the Government has employed a unified “removal proceeding” for exclusions and deportations alike. But
the immigration laws have always provided separate lists of substantive grounds for the two actions. One list specifies what crimes render an alien excludable, see 8 U. S. C. §1182(a), while another—
sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent—list specifies what
crimes render an alien deportable, see §1227(a).
Until repealed in 1996, §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act permitted the Attorney General to grant discretionary relief to an
excludable alien, if the alien had lawfully resided in the United
States for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country
and if the alien was not excludable on one of two specified grounds.
By its terms, §212(c) applied only in exclusion proceedings, but the
Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) extended it decades ago to deportation proceedings as well. Although Congress substituted a narrower discretionary remedy for §212(c) in 1996, see §1229b, §212(c)’s
broader relief remains available to an alien whose removal is based
on a guilty plea entered before §212(c)’s repeal, INS v. St. Cyr, 533
U. S. 289, 326.
In deciding whether to exclude such an alien, the BIA first checks
the statutory ground identified by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the basis for exclusion. Unless that ground is one of
the two falling outside §212(c)’s scope, the alien is eligible for discretionary relief. The BIA then determines whether to grant relief
based on such factors as the seriousness of the offense.
