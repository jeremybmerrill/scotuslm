Opinion of the Court

proceeding” and an alien already here channeled to a
“deportation proceeding.” See Landon v. Plasencia, 459
U. S. 21, 25–26 (1982) (comparing the two). Since that
time, the Government has used a unified procedure,
known as a “removal proceeding,” for exclusions and deportations alike. See 8 U. S. C. §§1229, 1229a. But the
statutory bases for excluding and deporting aliens have
always varied. Now, as before, the immigration laws
provide two separate lists of substantive grounds, principally involving criminal offenses, for these two actions.
One list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien
excludable (or in the term the statute now uses, “inadmissible”), see §1182(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), while another—
sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent—list
specifies what kinds of crime render an alien deportable
from the country, see §1227(a).
An additional, historic difference between exclusion
and deportation cases involved the ability of the Attorney
General to grant an alien discretionary relief. Until repealed in 1996, §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act, 66 Stat. 187, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.), authorized
the Attorney General to admit certain excludable aliens.
See also §136(p) (1926 ed.) (predecessor provision to
§212(c)). The Attorney General could order this relief
when the alien had lawfully resided in the United States
for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the
country, unless the alien was excludable on one of two
specified grounds. See §1182(c) (1994 ed.).1 But by its

relevant part of §212(c), in the version of the exclusion statute
all parties use, read as follows:
“Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily
proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,
and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven
consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney
General without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section
(other than paragraphs (3) and (9)(C)).” 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.).
