Opinion of the Court

ernment notes that the immigration laws have always
drawn distinctions between exclusion and deportation.
See Brief for Respondent 51. And the Government presses
a policy reason for making §212(c) relief more readily
available in exclusion cases. Doing so, it argues, will
provide an incentive for some resident aliens (i.e., those
eligible for a waiver from exclusion, but not deportation) to
report themselves to immigration officials, by applying for
advance permission to exit and reenter the country. In
contrast, applying §212(c) uniformly might lead all aliens
to “try to evade immigration officials for as long as possible,” because they could in any event “seek [discretionary]
relief if caught.” Id., at 52.
In the end, we think this dispute beside the point, and
we do not resolve it. The BIA may well have legitimate
reasons for limiting §212(c)’s scope in deportation cases.
But still, it must do so in some rational way. If the BIA
proposed to narrow the class of deportable aliens eligible
to seek §212(c) relief by flipping a coin—heads an alien
may apply for relief, tails he may not—we would reverse
the policy in an instant. That is because agency action
must be based on non-arbitrary, “ ‘relevant factors,’ ” State

According to Judulang, the BIA is treating the former as if they were
seeking admission, while applying the “comparable grounds” approach
only to the latter. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16–18. That is the
kind of distinction the Second Circuit held in Francis v. INS, 532 F. 2d
268 (1976), violated equal protection. See supra, at 3–4. But the
Government contends that it is drawing no such line—that it is applying the comparable-grounds policy to all deportable aliens. Brief for
Respondent 29. We think the available evidence tends to support the
Government’s representation. See In re Meza-Castillo, No. A091 366
529, 2009 WL 455596 (BIA, Feb. 9, 2009) (applying comparable-grounds
analysis to a deportable alien who had left and returned to the country); In re Valenzuela-Morales, No. A40 443 512, 2008 WL 2079382
(BIA, Apr. 23, 2008) (same). But in light of our holding that the
comparable-grounds approach is arbitrary and capricious, we need not
resolve this dispute about the BIA’s practice.
