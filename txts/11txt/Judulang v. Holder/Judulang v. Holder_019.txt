Opinion of the Court

with “a crime involving moral turpitude committed within
five years . . . after the date of admission,” see
§1227(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). And if that were the deportation
charge, the alien could apply for relief, because the ground
corresponds to the “moral turpitude” ground used in exclusion cases. See In re Salmon, 16 I. & N. Dec. 734
(1978). So everything hangs on the charge. And the
Government has provided no reason to think that immigration officials must adhere to any set scheme in deciding
what charges to bring, or that those officials are exercising
their charging discretion with §212(c) in mind. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 34–36. So at base everything hangs on the
fortuity of an individual official’s decision. An alien appearing before one official may suffer deportation; an
identically situated alien appearing before another may
gain the right to stay in this country.
In a foundational deportation case, this Court recognized the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in
this country, and reversed an agency decision that would
“make his right to remain here dependent on circumstances so fortuitous and capricious.” Delgadillo v. Carmichael,
332 U. S. 388, 391 (1947). We think the policy before us
similarly flawed. The comparable-grounds approach does
not rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien (or
any group of aliens) should be deported. It instead distinguishes among aliens—decides who should be eligible for
discretionary relief and who should not—solely by comparing the metes and bounds of diverse statutory categories
into which an alien falls. The resulting Venn diagrams
have no connection to the goals of the deportation process
or the rational operation of the immigration laws. Judge
Learned Hand wrote in another early immigration case
that deportation decisions cannot be made a “sport of
chance.” See Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 158 F. 2d 878, 879
(CA2 1947) (quoted in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449,
455 (1963)). That is what the comparable-grounds rule
