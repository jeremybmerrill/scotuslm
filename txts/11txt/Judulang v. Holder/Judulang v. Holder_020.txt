JUDULANG v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

brings about, and that is what the APA’s “arbitrary and
capricious” standard is designed to thwart.
B
The Government makes three arguments in defense of
the comparable-grounds rule—the first based on statutory
text, the next on history, the last on cost. We find none of
them persuasive.

The Government initially contends that the comparablegrounds approach is more faithful to “the statute’s language,” Brief for Respondent 21—or otherwise said, that
“lifting that limit ‘would take immigration practice even
further from the statutory text,’ ” id., at 22 (quoting Matter
of Hernandez-Casillas, 20 I. & N. Dec. 262, 287 (1990)). In
the Government’s view, §212(c) is “phrased in terms of
waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion”; that
phrasing, says the Government, counsels a comparative
analysis of grounds when applying §212(c) in the deportation context. Brief for Respondent 21; see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 34 (“[T]he reason [the comparable-grounds approach]

these. What §212(c) actually says, then, is that the Attorney General may admit any excludable alien, except if
the alien is charged with two specified grounds. And that
