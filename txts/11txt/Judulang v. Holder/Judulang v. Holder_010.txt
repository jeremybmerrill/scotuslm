JUDULANG v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

(CA11 2009).
That approach evaluates whether the
ground for deportation charged in a case has a close analogue in the statute’s list of exclusion grounds. See In re
Blake, 23 I. & N. Dec. 722, 728 (2005); In re Brieva-Perez,
23 I. & N. Dec. 766, 772–773 (2005).3 If the deportation
ground consists of a set of crimes “substantially equivalent” to the set of offenses making up an exclusion ground,
then the alien can seek §212(c) relief. Blake, 23 I. & N.
Dec., at 728. But if the deportation ground charged covers
significantly different or more or fewer offenses than any
exclusion ground, the alien is not eligible for a waiver.
Such a divergence makes §212(c) inapplicable even if the
particular offense committed by the alien falls within an
exclusion ground.
Two contrasting examples from the BIA’s cases
may help to illustrate this approach. Take first an
alien convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine, whom
DHS seeks to deport on the ground that he has committed an “aggravated felony” involving “illicit trafficking
in a controlled substance.” 8 U. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(B),
1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Under the comparable-grounds rule, the
immigration judge would look to see if that deportation
ground covers substantially the same offenses as an exclusion ground. And according to the BIA in Matter of Meza,
20 I. & N. Dec. 257 (1991), the judge would find an adequate match—the exclusion ground applicable to aliens
who have committed offenses “relating to a controlled
substance,” 8 U. S. C. §§1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) and (a)(2)(C).
Now consider an alien convicted of first-degree sexual
abuse of a child, whom DHS wishes to deport on the
ground that he has committed an “aggravated felony”

and Brieva-Perez clarified a 2004 regulation issued by the BIA
stating that an alien is ineligible for §212(c) relief when deportable “on
a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section 212.”
8 CFR §1212.3(f)(5) (2010).
