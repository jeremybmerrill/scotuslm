terms, §212(c) did not apply when an alien was being
deported.
This discrepancy threatened to produce an odd result in
a case called Matter of L-, 1 I. & N. Dec. 1 (1940), leading
to the first-ever grant of discretionary relief in a deportation case. L- was a permanent resident of the United
States who had been convicted of larceny. Although L-’s
crime made him inadmissible, he traveled abroad and
then returned to the United States without any immigration official’s preventing his entry. A few months later,
the Government caught up with L- and initiated a deportation action based on his larceny conviction. Had the
Government apprehended L- at the border a short while
earlier, he would have been placed in an exclusion proceeding where he could have applied for discretionary
relief. But because L- was instead in a deportation proceeding, no such relief was available. Responding to this
apparent anomaly, Attorney General Robert Jackson (on
referral of the case from the BIA) determined that L- could
receive a waiver: L-, Jackson said, “should be permitted to
make the same appeal to discretion that he could have
made if denied admission” when returning from his recent
trip. Id., at 6. In accord with this decision, the BIA
adopted a policy of allowing aliens in deportation proceedings to apply for discretionary relief under §212(c) whenever they had left and reentered the country after becoming deportable. See Matter of S-, 6 I. & N. Dec. 392,
394–396 (1954).
But this approach created another peculiar asymmetry:
Deportable aliens who had traveled abroad and returned
could receive §212(c) relief, while those who had never left

The parenthetical clause of this section prevented the Attorney General from waiving exclusion for aliens who posed a threat to national
security, §1182(a)(3), and aliens who engaged in international child
abduction, §1182(a)(9)(C).
