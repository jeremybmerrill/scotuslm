Opinion of the Court 


II

This case requires us to decide whether the BIA’s policy
for applying §212(c) in deportation cases is “arbitrary
[or] capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA), 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A).7 The scope of our review
under this standard is “narrow”; as we have often recognized, “a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of
the agency.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,
Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29,
43 (1983); see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v.
Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 416 (1971). Agencies, the BIA among
them, have expertise and experience in administering
their statutes that no court can properly ignore. But
courts retain a role, and an important one, in ensuring
that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.
When reviewing an agency action, we must assess, among
other matters, “ ‘whether the decision was based on a
consideration of the relevant factors and whether there

(upholding the comparable-grounds policy); Caroleo v. Gonzales, 476 

F. 3d 158, 162–163, 168 (CA3 2007) (same); Kim v. Gonzales, 468 F. 3d
58, 62–63 (CA1 2006) (same).
7 The Government urges us instead to analyze this case under the
second step of the test we announced in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), to govern
judicial review of an agency’s statutory interpretations. See Brief for
Respondent 19. Were we to do so, our analysis would be the same,
because under Chevron step two, we ask whether an agency interpretation is “ ‘arbitrary or capricious in substance.’ ” Mayo Foundation for
Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. ___ , ___ (2011)
(slip op., at 7) (quoting Household Credit Services, Inc. v. Pfennig, 541
U. S. 232, 242 (2004)). But we think the more apt analytic framework
in this case is standard “arbitrary [or] capricious” review under the
APA. The BIA’s comparable-grounds policy, as articulated in In re
Blake, 23 I. & N. Dec. 722 (2005) and In re Brieva-Perez, 23 I. & N. Dec.
766 (2005), is not an interpretation of any statutory language—nor
could it be, given that §212(c) does not mention deportation cases, see
infra, at 16–17, and n. 11.
