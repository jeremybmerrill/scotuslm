JUDULANG v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

B
Petitioner Joel Judulang is a native of the Philippines
who entered the United States in 1974 at the age of eight.
Since that time, he has lived continuously in this country
as a lawful permanent resident. In 1988, Judulang took
part in a fight in which another person shot and killed
someone. Judulang was charged as an accessory and
eventually pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. He
received a 6-year suspended sentence and was released on
probation immediately after his plea.
In 2005, after Judulang pleaded guilty to another criminal offense (this one involving theft), DHS commenced an
action to deport him. DHS charged Judulang with having
committed an “aggravated felony” involving “a crime of
violence,” based on his old manslaughter conviction. 8
U. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).5 The Immigration Judge ordered Judulang’s deportation, and the
BIA affirmed. As part of its decision, the BIA considered
whether Judulang could apply for §212(c) relief. It held
that he could not do so because the “crime of violence”
deportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion
ground, including the one for crimes involving moral
turpitude. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a. The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit denied Judulang’s petition for review
in reliance on circuit precedent upholding the BIA’s
comparable-grounds approach. Judulang v. Gonzales,
249 Fed. Appx. 499, 502 (2007) (citing Abebe v. Gonzales,
493 F. 3d 1092 (2007)).
We granted certiorari, 563 U. S. ___ (2011), to resolve a
circuit split on the approach’s validity.6 We now reverse.

5 DHS also charged two other grounds for deportation, but the BIA
did not rule on those grounds and they are not before us.
6 Compare Blake v. Carbone, 489 F. 3d 88, 103 (CA2 2007) (rejecting
the BIA’s approach and holding instead that “[i]f the offense that
renders [an alien] deportable would render a similarly situated [alien]
excludable, the deportable [alien] is eligible for a waiver of deporta-
