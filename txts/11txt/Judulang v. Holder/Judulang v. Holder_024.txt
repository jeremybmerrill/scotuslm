JUDULANG v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

dorsed the comparable-grounds approach on several occasions. See Meza, 20 I. & N. Dec., at 259; Matter of Montenegro, 20 I. & N. Dec. 603, 604–605 (1992); Matter of
Gabryelsky, 20 I. & N. Dec. 750, 753–754 (1993); In re
Esposito, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1, 6–7 (1995); In re JimenezSantillano, 21 I. & N. Dec. 567, 571–572 (1996). But just
a few years later, the BIA issued a series of unpublished
opinions that asked only whether a deportable alien’s
prior conviction fell within an exclusion ground. See, e.g.,
In re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892
(Dec. 1, 2003). Not until the BIA’s decisions in Blake and
Brieva-Perez did the pendulum stop swinging. That history hardly supports the Government’s view of a consistent
agency practice.12

The Government finally argues that the comparablegrounds rule saves time and money. The Government
claims that comparing deportation grounds to exclusion
grounds can be accomplished in just a few “precedential
decision[s],” which then can govern broad swaths of cases.
See Brief for Respondent 46. By contrast, the Government
argues, Judulang’s approach would force it to determine
whether each and every crime of conviction falls within an
exclusion ground. Further, the Government contends that
Judulang’s approach would grant eligibility to a greater

we find the BIA’s prior practice so unsettled, we likewise
reject Judulang’s argument that Blake and Brieva-Perez were impermissibly retroactive. To succeed on that theory, Judulang would have
to show, at a minimum, that in entering his guilty plea, he had reasonably relied on a legal rule from which Blake and Brieva-Perez departed.
See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270 (1994) (stating
that retroactivity analysis focuses on “considerations of fair notice,
reasonable reliance, and settled expectations”). The instability of the
BIA’s prior practice prevents Judulang from making this showing:
The BIA sometimes recognized aliens in Judulang’s position as eligible
for §212(c) relief, but sometimes did not.
