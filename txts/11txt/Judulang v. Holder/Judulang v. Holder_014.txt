JUDULANG v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

has been a clear error of judgment.’ ” State Farm, 463
U. S., at 43 (quoting Bowman Transp., Inc. v. ArkansasBest Freight System, Inc., 419 U. S. 281, 285 (1974)). That
task involves examining the reasons for agency decisions—or, as the case may be, the absence of such reasons.
See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502,
515 (2009) (noting “the requirement that an agency provide reasoned explanation for its action”).
The BIA has flunked that test here. By hinging a deportable alien’s eligibility for discretionary relief on the
chance correspondence between statutory categories—a
matter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this
country—the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a
reasoned manner.
A
The parties here spend much time disputing whether
the BIA must make discretionary relief available to deportable and excludable aliens on identical terms. As this
case illustrates, the comparable-grounds approach does
not do so. If Judulang were seeking entry to this country,
he would be eligible for §212(c) relief; voluntary manslaughter is “a crime involving moral turpitude,” and so
his conviction falls within an exclusion ground. But Judulang cannot apply for relief from deportation because the
“crime of violence” ground charged in his case does not
match any exclusion ground (including the one for “turpitudinous” crimes). See infra, at 13. Judulang argues that
this disparity is impermissible because any disparity
between excludable and deportable aliens is impermissible: If an alien may seek §212(c) relief in an exclusion
case, he also must be able to seek such relief in a deportation case. See Brief for Petitioner 47–51.8 But the Gov——————
8 Judulang also argues that the BIA is making an impermissible distinction between two groups of deportable aliens—those who have
recently left and returned to the country and those who have not.
