JUDULANG v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

could not. In Francis v. INS, 532 F. 2d 268 (1976), the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that
this disparity violated equal protection. Id., at 273 (“[A]n
alien whose ties with this country are so strong that he
has never departed after his initial entry should receive at
least as much consideration as an individual who may
leave and return from time to time”). The BIA acquiesced
in the Second Circuit’s decision, see Matter of Silva, 16
I. & N. Dec. 26 (1976), thus applying §212(c) in deportation proceedings regardless of an alien’s travel history.
All this might have become academic when Congress
repealed §212(c) in 1996 and substituted a new discretionary remedy, known as “cancellation of removal,” which is
available in a narrow range of circumstances to excludable
and deportable aliens alike. See 8 U. S. C. §1229b. But in
INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 326 (2001), this Court concluded that the broader relief afforded by §212(c) must
remain available, on the same terms as before, to an alien
whose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before
§212(c)’s repeal. We reasoned that aliens had agreed to
those pleas with the possibility of discretionary relief in
mind and that eliminating this prospect would ill comport
with “ ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable
reliance, and settled expectations.’ ” Id., at 323 (quoting
Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270 (1994)).
Accordingly, §212(c) has had an afterlife for resident
aliens with old criminal convictions.
When the BIA is deciding whether to exclude such an
alien, applying §212(c) is an easy matter. The Board
first checks the statutory ground that the Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified as the basis
for exclusion; the Board may note, for example, that
DHS has charged the alien with previously committing
a “crime involving moral turpitude,” see 8 U. S. C.
§1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Unless the charged ground is one of
the pair falling outside §212(c)’s scope, see n. 1, supra, the
