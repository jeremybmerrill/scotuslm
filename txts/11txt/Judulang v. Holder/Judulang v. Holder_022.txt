JUDULANG v. HOLDER
Opinion of the Court

comparable-grounds rule—or, for that matter, any other
method for extending discretionary relief to deportation
cases. We well understand the difficulties of operating in
such a text-free zone; indeed, we appreciate the Government’s yearning for a textual anchor. But §212(c), no
matter how many times read or parsed, does not provide
one.

In disputing Judulang’s contentions, the Government
also emphasizes the comparable-grounds rule’s vintage.
See Brief for Respondent 22–23, 30–43. As an initial
matter, we think this a slender reed to support a significant government policy. Arbitrary agency action becomes
no less so by simple dint of repetition. (To use a prior
analogy, flipping coins to determine §212(c) eligibility
would remain as arbitrary on the thousandth try as on the
first.) And longstanding capriciousness receives no special
exemption from the APA. In any event, we cannot detect
the consistency that the BIA claims has marked its approach to this issue. To the contrary, the BIA has repeatedly vacillated in its method for applying §212(c) to deportable aliens.
Prior to 1984, the BIA endorsed a variety of approaches.
In Matter of T-, 5 I. & N. Dec. 389, 390 (1953), for example,
the BIA held that an alien was not eligible for §212(c)
relief because her “ground of deportation” did not appear
in the exclusion statute. That decision anticipated the
comparable-grounds approach that the BIA today uses.
But in Tanori, the BIA pronounced that a deportable alien
could apply for a waiver because “the same facts”—in that
case, a marijuana conviction—would have allowed him to
seek §212(c) relief in an exclusion proceeding. 15 I. & N.
Dec., at 568. That approach is more nearly similar to the
one Judulang urges here. And then, in Matter of Granados, 16 I. & N. Dec. 726, 728 (1979), the BIA tried to have
