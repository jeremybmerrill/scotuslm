Opinion of the Court

alien is eligible for discretionary relief. The Board then
determines whether to grant that relief based on such
factors as “the seriousness of the offense, evidence of
either rehabilitation or recidivism, the duration of the
alien’s residence, the impact of deportation on the family,
the number of citizens in the family, and the character of
any service in the Armed Forces.” St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at
296, n. 5.
By contrast, when the BIA is deciding whether to deport
an alien, applying §212(c) becomes a tricky business.
Recall that §212(c) applies on its face only to exclusion
decisions. So the question arises: How is the BIA to determine when an alien should receive §212(c) relief in the
deportation context?
One approach that the BIA formerly used considered
how the alien would fare in an exclusion proceeding. To
perform this analysis, the Board would first determine
whether the criminal conviction making the alien deportable fell within a statutory ground for exclusion. Almost all
convictions did so, largely because the “crime involving
moral turpitude” ground encompasses so many offenses.2
Assuming that threshold inquiry were met, the Board
would mimic its approach in exclusion cases—first making
sure the statutory ground at issue was not excepted from
§212(c) and then conducting the multi-factor analysis. See
Matter of Tanori, 15 I. & N. Dec. 566, 567–568 (1976);
In re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892
(BIA, Dec. 1, 2003).
A second approach is the one challenged here; definitively adopted in 2005 (after decades of occasional use), it
often is called the “comparable-grounds” rule. See, e.g., De
la Rosa v. U. S. Attorney General, 579 F. 3d 1327, 1332

2 Firearms offenses are the most significant crimes falling outside the
statutory grounds for exclusion. See Matter of Hernandez-Casillas, 20
I. & N. Dec. 262, 282, n. 4 (1990).
