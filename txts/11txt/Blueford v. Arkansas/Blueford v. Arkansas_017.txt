SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

that conclusion. In Green, the jury convicted the defendant on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder
without returning a verdict on the charged offense of firstdegree murder. This Court concluded that this result was
an “implicit acquittal” on the greater offense of firstdegree murder, barring retrial. 355 U. S., at 190. The
defendant “was forced to run the gantlet once on that
charge and the jury refused to convict him. When given
the choice between finding him guilty of either first or
second degree murder it chose the latter.” Ibid.; see also
Price, 398 U. S., at 329 (“[T]his Court has consistently
refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after
an acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied
by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the
jury was given a full opportunity to return a verdict on
the greater charge” (footnote omitted)). Notably, Green
acknowledged that its finding of an “implicit acquittal”
was an “assumption,” because the jury had made no express statement with respect to the greater offense. 355
U. S., at 190–191.
Blueford’s position is even stronger because his jury was
not silent on the murder counts, but announced that it
was “unanimous against” conviction. And the trial judge
specifically instructed the jury to consider manslaughter
only after acquitting Blueford of the murder counts.
Courts in several acquittal-first jurisdictions have held
that a jury’s deadlock on a lesser included offense justifies
the assumption that the jury acquitted on any greater
offenses. See State v. Tate, 256 Conn. 262, 283–285, 773
A. 2d. 308, 323–324 (2001); Stone v. Superior Ct. of San
Diego Cty., 31 Cal. 3d 503, 511–512, n. 5, 646 P. 2d 809,
815, n. 5 (1982). That assumption is not even necessary
here because the jury unmistakably announced acquittal.
