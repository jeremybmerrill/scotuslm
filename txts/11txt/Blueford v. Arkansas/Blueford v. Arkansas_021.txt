Even if the majority were correct that the jury might
have reconsidered an acquitted count—a doubtful assumption for the reasons just explained—that would not defeat
Blueford’s double jeopardy claim. It “has been long established as an integral part of double jeopardy jurisprudence” that “a defendant could be put in jeopardy even in
a prosecution that did not culminate in a conviction or an
acquittal.” Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 34 (1978). This
rule evolved in response to the “abhorrent” practice under
the Stuart monarchs of terminating prosecutions, and
thereby evading the bar on retrials, when it appeared that
the Crown’s proof might be insufficient. Washington, 434
U. S., at 507; see, e.g., Ireland’s Case, 7 How. St. Tr. 79,
120 (1678). Accordingly, retrial is barred if a jury is discharged before returning a verdict unless the defendant
consents or there is a “manifest necessity” for the discharge. Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580; see also King v. Perkins,
90 Eng. Rep. 1122 (K. B. 1698).
In Perez, this Court explained that “manifest necessity”
is a high bar: “[T]he power ought to be used with the
greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very
plain and obvious causes.” 9 Wheat., at 580. Since Perez,
this Court has not relaxed the showing required. See, e.g.,
Washington, 434 U. S., at 506 (requiring a “ ‘high degree’ ”
of necessity); Downum, 372 U. S., at 736 (“imperious
necessity”); see also, e.g., United States v. Coolidge, 25
F. Cas. 622, 623 (No. 14,858) (CC Mass. 1815) (Story, J.)
(“extraordinary and striking circumstances”). Before declaring a mistrial, therefore, a trial judge must weigh
heavily a “defendant’s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.” Wade v. Hunter, 336
U. S. 684, 689 (1949). And in light of the historical abuses
