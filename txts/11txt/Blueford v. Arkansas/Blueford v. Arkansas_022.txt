BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

against which the Double Jeopardy Clause guards, a trial
judge must tread with special care where a mistrial would
“help the prosecution, at a trial in which its case is going
badly, by affording it another, more favorable opportunity
to convict the accused.” Gori v. United States, 367 U. S.
364, 369 (1961); see Green, 355 U. S., at 188.
A jury’s genuine inability to reach a verdict constitutes
manifest necessity. But in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, a
jury that advances to the consideration of a lesser included
offense has not demonstrated an inability to decide a defendant’s guilt or innocence on a greater—it has acquitted on the greater. Under Green, that is unquestionably
true if the jury convicts on the lesser. See id., at 189. It
would be anomalous if the Double Jeopardy Clause offered
less protection to a defendant whose jury has deadlocked
on the lesser and thus convicted of nothing at all. See
Stone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 511–512, n. 5, 646 P. 2d, at 815, n. 5.
I would therefore hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause
requires a trial judge, in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, to
honor a defendant’s request for a partial verdict before
declaring a mistrial on the ground of jury deadlock.
Courts in acquittal-first jurisdictions have so held. See,
e.g., Tate, 256 Conn., at 285–287, 773 A. 2d, at 324–325;
Whiteaker v. State, 808 P. 2d 270, 274 (Alaska App. 1991);
Stone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 519, 646 P. 2d, at 820; State v.
Pugliese, 120 N. H. 728, 730, 422 A. 2d 1319, 1321 (1980)
(per curiam); State v. Castrillo, 90 N. M. 608, 611, 566
P. 2d 1146, 1149 (1977); see also N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law
Ann. §310.70 (West 2002). Requiring a partial verdict in
an acquittal-first jurisdiction ensures that the jurisdiction
takes the bitter with the sweet. In general, an acquittalfirst instruction increases the likelihood of conviction on a
greater offense. See People v. Boettcher, 69 N. Y. 2d 174,
182, 505 N. E. 2d 594, 597 (1987). True, such an instruction may also result in deadlock on a greater, preventing a
State “from obtaining a conviction on the lesser charge
