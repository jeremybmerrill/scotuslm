BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

to those offenses. The Court thus grants the State what
the Constitution withholds: “the proverbial ‘second bite at
the apple.’ ” Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 17 (1978).
I respectfully dissent.

The bar on retrials following acquittals is “the most
fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence.” Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 571; see, e.g.,
United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662, 671 (1896); 4 W.
Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 329
(1769). This prohibition stops the State, “with all its
resources and power,” from mounting abusive, harassing
reprosecutions, Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187
(1957), which subject a defendant to “embarrassment,
expense, anxiety, and insecurity, and the possibility that
he may be found guilty even though innocent,” United
States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 136 (1980).
In ascertaining whether an acquittal has occurred,
“form is not to be exalted over substance.” Sanabria v.
United States, 437 U. S. 54, 66 (1978). Rather, we ask
whether the factfinder has made “a substantive determination that the prosecution has failed to carry its burden.”
Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U. S. 462, 468 (2005). Jurisdictions have different procedures respecting the announcement of verdicts and the entry of judgments, but
that diversity has no constitutional significance. Jeopardy
terminates upon a determination, however characterized,
that the “evidence is insufficient” to prove a defendant’s
“factual guilt.” Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140, 144
(1986). Thus, we have treated as acquittals a trial judge’s
directed verdict of not guilty, Smith, 543 U. S., at 468; an
appellate reversal of a conviction for insufficiency of the
evidence, Burks, 437 U. S., at 10; and, most pertinent
here, a jury’s announcement of a not guilty verdict that
