SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

was “not followed by any judgment,” Ball, 163 U. S., at
671.
A straightforward application of that principle suffices
to decide this case. Arkansas is a classic “acquittal-first”
or “hard-transition” jurisdiction. See generally People v.
Richardson, 184 P. 3d 755, 764, n. 7 (Colo. 2008). Arkansas’ model jury instructions require a jury to complete its
deliberations on a greater offense before it may consider
a lesser. 1 Ark. Model Jury Instr., Crim., No. 302 (2d
ed. 1994). As a matter of Arkansas law, “[b]efore it may
consider any lesser-included offense, the jury must first
determine that the proof is insufficient to convict on the
greater offense. Thus, the jury must, in essence, acquit
the defendant of the greater offense before considering his
or her guilt on the lesser-included offense.” Hughes v.
State, 347 Ark. 696, 706–707, 66 S. W. 3d 645, 651 (2002).1
Here, the trial judge instructed Blueford’s jury to consider the offenses in order, from the charged offense of
capital murder to the lesser included offenses of firstdegree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.
The judge told the jury to proceed past capital murder only
upon a unanimous finding of a “reasonable doubt” as to
that offense—that is, upon an acquittal. See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 363 (1970). The State’s closing arguments repeated this directive: “[B]efore you can consider a
lesser included of capital murder, you must first, all 12,
vote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.” App.
55. And the forewoman’s colloquy with the judge leaves no
doubt that the jury understood the instructions to mandate unanimous acquittal on a greater offense as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser: The forewoman

1 The

State has taken the same position. See Brief for Appellee in
Boyd v. State, No. CR 06–973 (Ark.), p. 13 (“[U]nanimity is the essence
of a jury verdict as it pertains to acquitting a defendant of the charged
offense and the subsequent consideration of lesser-included offenses”).
