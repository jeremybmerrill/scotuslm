BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS
Opinion of the Court

sir.
“THE COURT: Did not vote on that.
“JUROR NUMBER ONE: No, sir. We couldn’t get
past the manslaughter. Were we supposed to go past
that? I thought we were supposed to go one at a
time.” Id., at 64–65.
Following this exchange, the court gave another Allen
instruction and sent the jurors back to the jury room.
After deliberations resumed, Blueford’s counsel asked the
court to submit new verdict forms to the jurors, to be
completed “for those counts that they have reached a
verdict on.” Id., at 67. The prosecution objected on the
grounds that the jury was “still deliberating” and that a
verdict of acquittal had to be “all or nothing.” Id., at 68.
The court denied Blueford’s request. To allow for a partial
verdict, the court explained, would be “like changing
horses in the middle of the stream,” given that the jury
had already received instructions and verdict forms. Ibid.
The court informed counsel that it would declare a mistrial “if the jury doesn’t make a decision.” Id., at 69.
When the jury returned a half hour later, the foreperson
stated that they had not reached a verdict. The court
declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.
The State subsequently sought to retry Blueford. He
moved to dismiss the capital and first-degree murder
charges on double jeopardy grounds, citing the foreperson’s report that the jurors had voted unanimously against
guilt on those offenses. The trial court denied the motion,
and the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal. According to the State Supreme Court, the
foreperson’s report had no effect on the State’s ability to
retry Blueford, because the foreperson “was not making a
formal announcement of acquittal” when she disclosed the
jury’s votes. 2011 Ark. 8, p. 9, ___ S. W. 3d ___, ___. This
was not a case, the court observed, “where a formal verdict
