offenses: capital murder, first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. A fifth form allowed the jury
to return a verdict of acquittal, if the jury found Blueford
not guilty of any offense. There was no form allowing the
jury to acquit on some offenses but not others. As stated
in the court’s instructions, the jury could either “find the
defendant guilty of one of these offenses” or “acquit him

“THE COURT: Okay. Manslaughter?
“JUROR NUMBER ONE: Nine for, three against.
