BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

makes an error of law.” Koon v. United States, 518 U. S.
81, 100 (1996).

At its core, the Double Jeopardy Clause reflects the
wisdom of the founding generation, familiar to “ ‘every
person acquainted with the history of governments,’ ” that
“ ‘state trials have been employed as a formidable engine
in the hands of a dominant administration. . . . To prevent
this mischief the ancient common law . . . provided that
one acquittal or conviction should satisfy the law.’ ” Ex
parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 171 (1874) (quoting Commonwealth v. Olds, 15 Ky. 137, 139 (1824)). The Double Jeopardy Clause was enacted “ ‘[t]o perpetuate this wise rule,
so favorable and necessary to the liberty of the citizen
in a government like ours.’ ” 18 Wall., at 171. This case
demonstrates that the threat to individual freedom from
reprosecutions that favor States and unfairly rescue them
from weak cases has not waned with time. Only this
Court’s vigilance has.
I respectfully dissent.
