BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS
Opinion of the Court

jury’s options in this case were limited to two: either convict on one of the offenses, or acquit on all. The instructions explained those options in plain terms, and the
verdict forms likewise contemplated no other outcome.
There were separate forms to convict on each of the possible offenses, but there was only one form to acquit, and it
was to acquit on all of them. When the foreperson disclosed the jury’s votes on capital and first-degree murder,
the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to
add another option—that of acquitting on some offenses
but not others. That, however, is precisely the relief
Blueford seeks—relief the Double Jeopardy Clause does
not afford him.

The jury in this case did not convict Blueford of any
offense, but it did not acquit him of any either. When the
jury was unable to return a verdict, the trial court properly declared a mistrial and discharged the jury. As a
consequence, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not stand
in the way of a second trial on the same offenses.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is
Affirmed.

—————— 

discussion of the applicable legal principles concerns just that, and the 

dissent in any event does not dispute that we have never required a 

trial court to consider any particular means of breaking a jury impasse.
