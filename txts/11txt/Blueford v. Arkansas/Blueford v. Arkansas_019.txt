after full deliberation, consideration, and compromise
among the individual jurors.” Harrison v. Gillespie, 640
F. 3d 888, 906 (CA9 2011) (en banc). And when that decision was announced in open court, it became entitled to
full double jeopardy protection. See, e.g., Commonwealth
v. Roth, 437 Mass. 777, 796, 776 N. E. 2d 437, 450–451
(2002) (declining to give effect to “ ‘ “the verdict received
from the lips of the foreman in open court” ’ ” would “elevate form over substance”); Stone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 511, 646
P. 2d, at 814–815 (“[I]n determining what verdict, if any, a
jury intended to return, the oral declaration of the jurors
endorsing the result is the true return of the verdict”
(internal quotation marks omitted)); see also, e.g., Dixon v.
State, 29 Ark. 165, 171 (1874) (technical defect in verdict

in writing, but may be announced by the foreman of the
jury orally”); State v. Mills, 19 Ark. 476 (1858) (“The verdict was of no validity until delivered, by the jury, in
Court”).
The majority’s example of a jury that takes a preliminary vote on greater offenses, advances to the consideration of a lesser, and then returns to a greater, is inapposite.
See ante, at 7. In the majority’s example, the jury has
not announced its vote in open court. Moreover, the
instructions in this case did not contemplate that the
jury’s deliberations could take the course that the majority
imagines. Arkansas’ model instruction requires acquittal
as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser offense, and
the Double Jeopardy Clause entitles an acquittal to finality. Indeed, the purpose of an acquittal-first instruction is
to ensure careful and conclusive deliberation on a greater
offense. See United States v. Tsanas, 572 F. 2d 340, 346
(CA2 1978) (Friendly, J.) (acquittal-first instruction avoids
“the danger that the jury will not adequately discharge its
duties with respect to the greater offense, and instead will
move too quickly to the lesser”). True, Arkansas’ instruc-
