BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

tion does not expressly forbid reconsideration, but it does
not expressly permit reconsideration either. In any event,
nothing indicates that the jury’s announced decisions were
tentative, compromises, or mere steps en route to a final
verdict, and the Double Jeopardy Clause demands that
ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant. See
Downum v. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 738 (1963).
The fact that the jury was not given the express option
of acquitting on individual offenses is irrelevant. See ante,
at 3, 9. Arkansas law ascribes no significance to the presence of such options on a verdict form. See Rowland v.
State, 263 Ark. 77, 85, 562 S. W. 2d 590, 594 (1978) (“The
jury may prepare and present its own form of verdict”).
The lack of a state procedural vehicle for the entry of a
judgment of acquittal does not prevent the recognition of
an acquittal for constitutional purposes. See Hudson v.
Louisiana, 450 U. S. 40, 41, n. 1 (1981).
Finally, the majority’s distinction of Green and Price is
unavailing. The majority observes that Green and Price,
unlike this case, involved final decisions. Ante, at 8. As I
have explained, I view the forewoman’s announcements of
acquittal in this case as similarly final. In any event,
Green clarified that the defendant’s “claim of former jeopardy” was “not based on his previous conviction for second
degree murder but instead on the original jury’s refusal to
convict him of first degree murder.” 355 U. S., at 190,
n. 11; accord, id., at 194, n. 14. That is, the jury’s silence
on the greater offense spoke with sufficient clarity to
justify the assumption of acquittal and to invoke the Double Jeopardy Clause. Id., at 191; see also Price, 398 U. S.,
at 329. In light of the forewoman’s announcement, this is
an a fortiori case.
In short, the Double Jeopardy Clause demands an inquiry into the substance of the jury’s actions. Blueford’s
jury had the option to convict him of capital and firstdegree murder, but expressly declined to do so. That
