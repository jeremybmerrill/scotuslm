Opinion of the Court

“this Court’s long-established jurisprudence that habeas
prisoners, including capital prisoners,” have no right to
counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Brief for Petitioner
18; see Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 10, 12 (1989)
(plurality opinion); id., at 14–15 (KENNEDY, J., concurring
in judgment); cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 755
(1991) (reserving question of whether the Sixth Amendment guarantees counsel when a habeas proceeding provides the first opportunity to raise a claim). But we do not
understand the State’s basis for linking use of the “interests of justice” standard to cases in which an individual
has a Sixth Amendment right. A statute need not draw
the same lines as the Constitution, and neither §3006A
nor §3599 does so in addressing the substitution of
counsel. Section 3006A applies the “interests of justice”
standard to substitution motions even when the Sixth
Amendment does not require representation; that is
presumptively so, for example, when a court provides
counsel to a non-capital habeas petitioner.
See
§§3006A(a)(2)(B), (c). And whatever standard we adopt for
§3599 will likewise apply both to litigants who have and to
litigants who lack a Sixth Amendment right, because the
section offers counsel on the same terms to capital defendants and habeas petitioners. In providing statutory rights
to counsel, Congress declined to track the Sixth Amendment; accordingly, the scope of that Amendment cannot
answer the statutory question presented here.
The State’s stronger argument relates to delay in capital
proceedings. Under the “interests of justice” standard, the
State contends, substitution motions will become a mechanism to defer enforcement of a death sentence, contrary
to historic restrictions on “abuse of the writ” and to the
goals of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996 (AEDPA). See Brief for Petitioner 19–22. But this
argument, like the last, forgets that §3599 reaches not just
habeas petitioners but also criminal defendants, who have
