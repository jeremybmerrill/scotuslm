MARTEL v. CLAIR
Opinion of the Court

addition, the statute authorized courts to appoint counsel
for federal habeas petitioners when “the interests of
justice so require[d],” §3006A(g); and under that provision, courts almost always appointed counsel to represent
petitioners convicted of capital offenses, see Ruthenbeck,
Dueling with Death in Federal Courts, 4 ABA Criminal
Justice, No. 3, pp. 2, 42 (Fall, 1989). In all cases in which
a court had appointed counsel, §3006A further provided
(as it continues to do) that substitution motions should be
decided “in the interests of justice.” §3006A(c). So in
those days, a court would have used that standard to
evaluate a request like Clair’s.
In 1988, Congress enacted the legislation now known as
§3599 to govern appointment of counsel in capital cases,
thus displacing §3006A for persons facing execution (but
retaining that section for all others). See Anti-Drug Abuse
Act, 102 Stat. 4393–4394, 21 U. S. C. §§848(q)(4)–(10)
(1988 ed.) (recodified at 18 U. S. C. §3599 (2006 ed. and
Supp. IV)). The new statute grants federal capital defendants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of
representation, in light of what it calls “the seriousness
of the possible penalty and . . . the unique and complex
nature of the litigation.” §3599(d) (2006 ed.). Habeas
petitioners facing execution now receive counsel as a
matter of right, not an exercise of the court’s discretion.
See §3599(a)(2). And the statute aims in multiple ways to
improve the quality of representation afforded to capital
petitioners and defendants alike. Section 3599 requires
lawyers in capital cases to have more legal experience
than §3006A demands.
Compare §§3599(b)–(d) with
§3006A(b). Similarly, §3599 authorizes higher rates of
compensation, in part to attract better counsel. Compare
§3599(g)(1) with §3006A(d) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). And
§3599 provides more money for investigative and expert
services. Compare §§3599(f) (2006 ed.), (g)(2) (2006 ed.,
Supp. IV), with §3006A(e) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). As we
