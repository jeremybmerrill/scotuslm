MARTEL v. CLAIR
Opinion of the Court

not been convicted or sentenced and therefore have no
incentive to delay. Moreover, the State’s claim misjudges
the capacity of the “interests of justice” standard to deal
with such issues. Protecting against abusive delay is an
interest of justice. Because that is so, courts addressing
substitution motions in both capital and non-capital cases
routinely consider issues of timeliness. See, e.g., Hunter v.
Delo, 62 F. 3d 271, 274 (CA8 1995) (citing “the need to
thwart abusive delay” in affirming the denial of a habeas
petitioner’s substitution motion); United States v. White,
451 F. 2d 1225, 1226 (CA6 1971) (per curiam) (approving a
District Court’s refusal to change counsel under §3006A(c)
“on the morning of the trial”). Indeed, we will do so, just
paragraphs from here, in this very case. See infra, at 15–
16. The standard we adopt thus takes account of, rather
than ignores or opposes, the State’s interest in avoiding
undue delay.3

3 The State also makes a more specific argument based on AEDPA,
see Brief for Petitioner 26–29, but we think it is not well taken. The
State notes that the “interests of justice” standard enables a court,
when ruling on a substitution motion, to take account of a lawyer’s
effectiveness. That consideration, according to the State, conflicts
with AEDPA’s injunction that “[t]he ineffectiveness or incompetence of
counsel during Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings
shall not be a ground for relief in a [habeas] proceeding arising under
section 2254.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(i); see §2261(e) (using similar language). But most naturally read, §2254(i) prohibits a court from
granting substantive habeas relief on the basis of a lawyer’s ineffectiveness in post-conviction proceedings, not from substituting counsel
on that ground. Cf. Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip
op., at 18) (holding that §2254(i) does not preclude equitable tolling of a
statute of limitations based on attorney misconduct in habeas proceedings). Indeed, if the State were right, we would also have to find that
AEDPA silently repealed §3006A’s instruction to courts to apply the
“interests of justice” standard in non-capital habeas cases. We see
nothing to suggest that Congress had that result in mind.
