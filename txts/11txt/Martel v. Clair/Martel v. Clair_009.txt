Opinion of the Court

Cal., June 30, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 20–91.
Clair sought review of his substitution motion pro se,
while the FPD filed a notice of appeal from the denial of
his habeas petition. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit instructed the FPD to address whether substitution of counsel was now warranted, and in October 2005,
the FPD informed the court that “the attorney-client
relationship ha[d] broken down to such an extent that substitution of counsel [would be] appropriate.” Attorney
for Appellant’s Response to Court’s Sept. 15, 2005 Order,
in No. 05–99005 (CA9), Record, Doc. 9, p. 1. The State did
not comment or object, and the Court of Appeals provided
Clair with a new lawyer going forward. Clair then asked
the District Court to vacate the denial of his habeas petition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), arguing
that he should be allowed to explore the significance of
the new physical evidence for his case. The District Court
(with a new judge assigned, because the judge previously
handling the case had retired) rejected that request on the
ground that the new evidence did not pertain to any of the
claims presented in Clair’s habeas petition. See App. to
Pet. for Cert. 9–10. Clair appealed that decision as well.1
After consolidating Clair’s appeals, the Ninth Circuit
vacated the trial court’s denial of both Clair’s request for
new counsel and his habeas petition. See Clair v. Ayers,
403 Fed. Appx. 276 (2010). The Court of Appeals’ opinion
focused on Clair’s substitution motion. Holding that the
“interests of justice” standard should apply to that motion,

1 While

litigating his Rule 60(b) motion in the District Court, Clair
also pursued discovery in the California state courts relating to the
newly found physical evidence. On the basis of material he obtained,
Clair filed another petition for state habeas relief, alleging (among
other claims) actual innocence and improper suppression of exculpatory
material under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The California
Supreme Court summarily denied that petition. See In re Clair, No.
S169188 (Aug. 24, 2011).
