Opinion of the Court

III
The remaining question is whether the District Court
abused its discretion in denying Clair’s second request for
new counsel under §3599’s “interests of justice” standard.
We do not think the court did so, although the court’s
failure to make any inquiry into Clair’s allegations makes
this decision harder than necessary.
As its name betrays, the “interests of justice” standard
contemplates a peculiarly context-specific inquiry. So we
doubt that any attempt to provide a general definition of
the standard would prove helpful. In reviewing substitution motions, the courts of appeals have pointed to several
relevant considerations. Those factors may vary a bit from
circuit to circuit, but generally include: the timeliness of
the motion; the adequacy of the district court’s inquiry
into the defendant’s complaint; and the asserted cause for
that complaint, including the extent of the conflict or
breakdown in communication between lawyer and client
(and the client’s own responsibility, if any, for that conflict). See, e.g., United States v. Prime, 431 F. 3d 1147,
1154 (CA9 2005); United States v. Doe, 272 F. 3d 116, 122–
123 (CA2 2001); Hunter, 62 F. 3d, at 274; United States v.
Welty, 674 F. 2d 185, 188 (CA3 1982). Because a trial
court’s decision on substitution is so fact-specific, it deserves deference; a reviewing court may overturn it only
for an abuse of discretion.
The District Court here received Clair’s second substitution motion on the eve of deciding his 10-year-old habeas
petition. Recall that three months earlier, following an
evidentiary hearing and post-hearing briefing, Clair had
written the court to complain about his attorneys. In that
first letter, Clair accused his lawyers of refusing to cooperate with a private detective and, more generally, of
forgoing efforts to prove his innocence. After making
proper inquiry, the court learned that Clair and his attorneys had worked through their dispute and Clair no long-
