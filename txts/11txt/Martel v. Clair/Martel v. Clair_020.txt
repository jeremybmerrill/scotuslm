MARTEL v. CLAIR
Opinion of the Court

403 Fed. Appx., at 279. The District Court could properly
have rejected that motion, consistent with its order precluding further submissions (effectively remitting Clair to
state court to pursue the matter). See Mayle v. Felix, 545
U. S. 644, 663 (2005). And if that is so, the court also
acted within its discretion in denying Clair’s request to
substitute counsel, even without the usually appropriate
inquiry. The court was not required to appoint a new
lawyer just so Clair could file a futile motion. We accordingly find that the Court of Appeals erred in overturning
the District Court’s decision.4
The judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.

——————
4 We note as well that the Court of Appeals ordered the wrong remedy
even assuming the District Court had abused its discretion in denying
Clair’s substitution motion without inquiry. The way to cure that error
would have been to remand to the District Court to decide whether
substitution was appropriate at the time of Clair’s letter. Unless that
court determined that counsel should have been changed, the Court of
Appeals had no basis for vacating the denial of Clair’s habeas petition.
