MARTEL v. CLAIR
Opinion of the Court

the Ninth Circuit ruled that the District Court abused its
discretion by failing to inquire into the complaints in
Clair’s second letter. See id., at 278. The Court of Appeals then considered how to remedy that error, given that
Clair had received new counsel while on appeal. It decided that “the most reasonable solution” was to “treat Clair’s
current counsel as if he were the counsel who might have
been appointed” in June 2005, and to allow him to make
whatever submissions he would have made then, including a motion to amend Clair’s habeas petition in light of
new evidence. Id., at 279.
We granted certiorari to review this judgment, 564 U. S.
__ (2011), and now reverse.
II
We first consider the standard that district courts
should use to adjudicate federal habeas petitioners’ motions to substitute counsel in capital cases. The question
arises because the relevant statute, 18 U. S. C. §3599,
contains a notable gap. Section 3599 first guarantees that
indigent defendants in federal capital cases will receive
the assistance of counsel, from pretrial proceedings
through stay applications. See §§3599(a)(1), (a)(2), (e). It
next grants a corresponding right to people like Clair who
seek federal habeas relief from a state death sentence, for
all post-conviction proceedings and related activities. See
§§3599(a)(2), (e); McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 854–
855 (1994); Harbison v. Bell, 556 U. S. 180, 183–185
(2009). And the statute contemplates that both sets of
litigants may sometimes substitute counsel; it notes that
an attorney appointed under the section may be “replaced
by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney’s own
motion or upon motion of the defendant.” §3599(e).2 But

2 Section

3599(e) provides in full:
“Unless replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney’s
own motion or upon motion of the defendant, each attorney so appoint-
