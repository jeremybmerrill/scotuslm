REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

ney General specifies their applicability, i.e., from July
2006 until at least February 2007. Six Circuits have held
that the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to
pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney General so
specifies. United States v. Johnson, 632 F. 3d 912, 922–
927 (CA5 2011); United States v. Valverde, 628 F. 3d 1159,
1162–1164 (CA9 2010); United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d
408, 414–419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F.
3d 222, 226–229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551
F. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008); United States v. Madera, 528 F.
3d 852, 856–859 (CA11 2008) (per curiam). Five Circuits
have held that they apply from the date of the Act’s enactment, and prior to any such specification, at least with
respect to pre-Act offenders who had already registered
under state law. United States v. Fuller, 627 F. 3d 499,
506 (CA2 2010); United States v. DiTomasso, 621 F. 3d 17,
24 (CA1 2010); United States v. Shenandoah, 595 F. 3d
151, 163 (CA3 2010); United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d
926, 932 (CA10 2008); United States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912,
918–919 (CA8 2008). In light of this split, we agreed to
consider the question.

A

The question before us is whether the Act requires
pre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General
validly specifies that the Act’s registration provisions apply to them. We believe that it does not. For one thing,
a natural reading of the textual language supports our
conclusion. The text consists of four statements. See

shall register, and keep the registration current.” Statement Two says that a sex offender must initially register
before completing his “sentence of imprisonment” (or, if
the sentence does not involve imprisonment, within three
days of conviction). Statement Three says that the sex
