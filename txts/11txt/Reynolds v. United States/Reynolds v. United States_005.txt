REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

requirements . . . to sex offenders convicted before the
enactment of this chapter . . . .” §16913(d) (emphasis
added). In our view, these provisions, read together, mean
that the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to
pre-Act offenders until the Attorney General specifies that
they do apply. We reverse a Court of Appeals determination that, in effect, holds the contrary.

A

The new federal Act reflects Congress’ awareness that
pre-Act registration law consisted of a patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration systems. See
73 Fed. Reg. 38045 (2008). The Act seeks to make those
systems more uniform and effective. It does so by repealing several earlier federal laws that also (but less effectively) sought uniformity; by setting forth comprehensive
registration-system standards; by making federal funding
contingent on States’ bringing their systems into compliance with those standards; by requiring both state and
federal sex offenders to register with relevant jurisdictions
(and to keep registration information current); and by
creating federal criminal sanctions applicable to those who
violate the Act’s registration requirements. 18 U. S. C.
§2250(a) (criminal provision); 42 U. S. C. §§16911(10),
16913–16916 (2006 ed. and Supp. III) (registration requirements); §16925 (federal funding); §129, 120 Stat. 600
(repeal of earlier laws).
The Act’s criminal penalty applies to “[w]ho[m]ever . . .
is required to register under [the Act].” 18 U. S. C.
§2250(a). It says that such a person (a federal sex offender
or a nonfederal sex offender who travels in interstate
commerce) must not knowingly fail “to register or update
a registration as required by [the Act].” Ibid. (emphasis
added); see Appendix, infra, at 14.
