REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

The new Act became law on July 27, 2006.
On February 28, 2007, the Attorney General promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that “[t]he requirements of
[the Act] apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders
convicted of the offense for which registration is required
prior to the enactment of that Act.” 72 Fed. Reg. 8897
(codified at 28 CFR §72.3). Subsequently, the Attorney
General promulgated further rules, regulations, and specifications. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38030 (2008); 75 Fed. Reg.
81849 (2010); 76 Fed. Reg. 1630 (2011). The present case
focuses upon the applicability of the Act’s registration
requirements to pre-Act offenders during the period between (1) July 27, 2006 (when the Act took effect) and
(2) the moment when the Attorney General promulgated
a valid rule specifying the registration requirements’ applicability, namely, February 28, 2007 (or a later date if
the February 28 specification was invalid).

July 2005; he then registered as a Missouri sex offender;
but he moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without
updating his Missouri registration information (as Missouri law required) and without registering in Pennsylvania. A federal grand jury indicted him, charging him with,
between September 16 and October 16, 2007, having
“knowingly failed to register and update a registration as
required by [the Act].” App. 13; see 18 U. S. C. §2250(a).
In the Government’s view, Reynolds’ failure to update his
address information when he moved to Pennsylvania
violated the requirement that a “sex offender” update
registration information within “3 business days after
each change of . . . residence.” 42 U. S. C. §16913(c).
Reynolds moved to dismiss the indictment on the
