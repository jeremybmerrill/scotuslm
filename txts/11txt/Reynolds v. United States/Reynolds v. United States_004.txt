BILLY JOE REYNOLDS, PETITIONER v. UNITED 

STATES 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[January 23, 2012]


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification
Act (Act), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U. S. C. §16901 et seq. (2006
ed. and Supp. III), requires those convicted of certain sex
crimes to provide state governments with (and to update)
information, such as names and current addresses, for
inclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.
§§16912(a), 16913–16914, 16919(a) (2006 ed.). The Act
makes it a crime for a person who is “required to register” under the Act and who “travels in interstate or foreign
commerce” knowingly to “fai[l] to register or update a registration . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §2250(a). The question before us concerns the date on which this federal registration requirement took effect with respect to sex offenders
convicted before the Act became law.
The Act defines the term “sex offender” as including
these pre-Act offenders. 42 U. S. C. §16911(1); see Carr v.
United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7). It
says that “[a] sex offender shall register.” §16913(a). And
it further says that “[t]he Attorney General shall have the
authority to specify the applicability of the [registration]
