REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Third, the Government argues against our interpretation on the ground that the Act says only that the Attorney General “shall have the authority to specify the
applicability” of the Act’s registration requirements to preAct offenders; it does not say that he “shall specify” or
otherwise require him to do so. The Act’s language, the
Government continues, consequently gives the Attorney
General the power not to specify anything; that power is
inconsistent with Congress’ intent to ensure the speedy
registration of thousands of “lost” pre-Act offenders, supra,
at 10; and we can avoid this result only by reading the
Act’s registration requirements as applying immediately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders (though
the Attorney General would have the power to make
exceptions).
This argument bases too much upon too little. There is
no reason to believe that Congress feared that the Attorney General would refuse to apply the new requirements
to pre-Act offenders. See, e.g., H. R. Rep., at 23–24; Protecting Our Nation’s Children from Sexual Predators and
Violent Criminals: What Needs To Be Done? Hearing
before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary,
109th Cong., 1st Sess., 4–13 (2005); Office of the Press
Sec’y, The White House, President Signs H. R. 4472,

(July 27, 2006), http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/

need for a mandatory requirement to avoid that unrealistic
possibility. There is consequently no need to read the
language unnaturally as giving the Attorney General the
authority only to make exceptions from an implicit (unstated) rule that would otherwise apply the new registration requirements to all pre-Act offenders across the board
and immediately.
Finally, we note that some lower courts have read the
