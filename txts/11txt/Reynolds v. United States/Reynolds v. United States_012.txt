Opinion of the Court

be prosecuted until he traveled interstate, there is no
interstate requirement for a federal pre-Act offender. And
to apply the Act to either of these pre-Act offenders from
the date of enactment would require reading into the
statute, silent on the point, some kind of unsaid equivalent (e.g., registering or updating within a “reasonable
time” or “within three days of first post-Act travel in interstate commerce” or “as preexisting state law requires”).
Pre-Act offenders, aware of such complexities, lacunae,
and difficulties, might, on their own, reach different conclusions about whether, or how, the new registration
requirements applied to them. A ruling from the Attorney
General, however, could diminish or eliminate those uncertainties, thereby helping to eliminate the very kind of
vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to
avoid. Cf., e.g., United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 266
(1997) (noting that “the canon of strict construction of
criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by
so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it
only to conduct clearly covered”).
B
The Government makes three principal arguments to
the contrary. First, it says that our interpretation of the
Act conflicts with one basic statutory purpose, namely, the
“establish[ment of] a comprehensive national system for
the registration of [sex] offenders,” 42 U. S. C. §16901,
that includes offenders who committed their offenses
before the Act became law. The Act reflects that purpose
when it defines “sex offender” broadly to include any
“individual who was convicted of a sex offense.” §16911(1).
And we have recognized that purpose in stating that, in
general, the Act’s criminal provisions apply to any pre-Act
offender required to register under the Act who later
travels interstate and fails to register. See Carr, 560
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).
