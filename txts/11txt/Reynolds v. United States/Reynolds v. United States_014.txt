Opinion of the Court

“implementation” of the new Act “in a particular jurisdiction.” Some jurisdictions might not implement the Act
for up to five years. See 42 U. S. C. §16924; see also Dept. of
Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Justice Department
Finds 24 Jurisdictions Have Substantially Implemented
SORNA Requirements (July 28, 2011) (stating that as
of July 28, 2011, 14 States had implemented the
Act’s requirements), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/
pressreleases/2011/SMART_PR-072811.htm (all Internet
materials as visited Jan. 19, 2012, and available in Clerk
of Court’s case file). Yet, the Government concludes, it is
absurd to believe that Congress would have desired so
long a delay in the application of its new registration
requirements.
The problem with this argument, however, is that reading the two categories similarly (a matter which we need
not decide) would not require a long delay in applying the
registration requirements to post-Act offenders who committed a crime in a jurisdiction that is slow to implement
the new requirements. At most, that reading would require the Attorney General to promulgate a rule applicable to all preimplementation offenders. That rule could
specify that the Act’s preregistration provisions apply to
some or to all those offenders. And it could do so quickly,
well before a jurisdiction implements the Act’s requirements. Indeed, the Attorney General’s Interim Rule and
the Department of Justice’s final guidelines, both issued
before any jurisdiction implemented the Act’s requirements, state that the Act’s requirements apply to “all sex
offenders,” including all preimplementation offenders. See
