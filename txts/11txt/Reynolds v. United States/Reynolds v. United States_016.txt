Opinion of the Court

Attorney General’s specification authority as applying
only to those pre-Act sex offenders unable to comply with
the statute’s “initial registration” requirements. See 42
U. S. C. §16913(b). That, however, is not what the statute
says. Rather, its Fourth Statement, §16913(d), says that
the Attorney General has the authority (1) to specify the
applicability of the registration requirements to pre-Act
(and preimplementation) offenders, “and ” (2) to prescribe
rules for their registration, “and ” (3) to prescribe registration rules for other categories of sex offenders who are
unable to comply with the initial registration requirements. See supra, at 3. The word “and” means that the
Attorney General’s authority extends beyond those pre-Act
“sex offenders who are unable to comply” with the initial
registration requirements.
III
For these reasons, we conclude that the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until
the Attorney General so specifies. Whether the Attorney
General’s Interim Rule sets forth a valid specification
consequently matters in the case before us. And we reverse the Third Circuit’s judgment to the contrary. We
remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
So ordered.
