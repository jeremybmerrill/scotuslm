REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

Attorney General the power to reduce congressionally
imposed requirements fits that bill, because such a power
is little more than a formalized version of the timehonored practice of prosecutorial discretion.
The Court points out that there might have been need
for “different federal registration treatment of different
categories of pre-Act offenders,” ante, at 8, and that absent
a “ruling from the Attorney General” pre-Act offenders
would be uncertain “about whether, or how, the new registration requirements applied to them,” ante, at 9. But
attending to those details would certainly come within the
Attorney General’s authority to “specify” application of the
Act—and so would the temporary suspension of registration requirements pending the Attorney General’s resolution of those details. And of course the uncertainty of
where to register could form the basis for the Attorney
General’s exercise of his discretion not to prosecute in
individual cases. Neither problem, it seems to me, justifies the extraordinary interpretation that this Act does not
apply to pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney
General, in his discretion, says so.
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
