REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Doing so could require newly registering or re-registering
“a large number” of pre-Act offenders. That effort could
prove expensive. And it might not prove feasible to do so
immediately. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38063 (recognizing these
problems). Congress’ concern about these problems is reflected in the Act’s providing the States with three years
to bring their systems into compliance with federal standards while permitting the Attorney General to extend that
3-year grace period to five years. 42 U. S. C. §16924.
These same considerations might have warranted different federal registration treatment of different categories of pre-Act offenders. Cf. 73 Fed. Reg. 38035–38036,
and 38046–38047 (final Department of Justice guidelines
allowing States to meet Act requirements without registering certain categories of pre-Act offenders); 76 Fed. Reg.
1635–1636 (supplemental guidelines allowing the same).
At least Congress might well have so thought. And consequently, Congress might well have looked for a solution.
Asking the Department of Justice, charged with responsibility for implementation, to examine these pre-Act
offender problems and to apply the new registration requirements accordingly could have represented one efficient and desirable solution (though we express no view
on Reynolds’ related constitutional claim). Cf. 42 U. S. C.
§§16912(b), 16914(a)(7), (b)(7), 16919, 16941, 16945
(granting the Attorney General authority to administer
various aspects of the Act). And that is just the solution
that the Act’s language says that Congress adopted.
Finally, our reading of the Act takes Congress to have
filled potential lacunae (created by related Act provisions)
in a manner consistent with basic background principles
of criminal law. The Second Statement, for example, says
that a sex offender must register before completing his
prison term, but the provision says nothing about when a
pre-Act offender who completed his prison term pre-Act
must register. Although a state pre-Act offender could not
