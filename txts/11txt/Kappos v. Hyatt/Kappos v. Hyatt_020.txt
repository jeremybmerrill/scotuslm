SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

ing the evidence for the first time in a §145 proceeding.
Because there is no suggestion here that the applicant’s
failure to present the evidence in question to the PTO was
anything other than the product of negligence or a lack
of foresight, I agree that the applicant was entitled to
present his additional evidence to the District Court. But
I do not understand today’s decision to foreclose a district
court’s authority, consistent with “ ‘the ordinary course of
equity practice and procedure,’ ” ante, at 13 (quoting Butterworth, 112 U. S., at 61), to exclude evidence “deliberately suppressed” from the PTO or otherwise withheld in
bad faith. For the reasons set out by the Court, see ante, at
13–14, an applicant has little to gain by such tactics; such
cases will therefore be rare. In keeping with longstanding
historical practice, however, I understand courts to retain
their ordinary authority to exclude evidence from a §145
proceeding when its admission would be inconsistent with
regular equity practice and procedure.
With those observations, I join the Court’s opinion in
full.
