KAPPOS v. HYATT
Opinion of the Court

considered judgment may lose significant force”). For this
reason, we conclude that the proper means for the district
court to accord respect to decisions of the PTO is through
the court’s broad discretion over the weight to be given to
evidence newly adduced in the §145 proceedings.
The Director warns that allowing the district court
to consider all admissible evidence and to make de novo
findings will encourage patent applicants to withhold
evidence from the PTO intentionally with the goal of presenting that evidence for the first time to a nonexpert
judge. Brief for Petitioner 23. We find that scenario
unlikely. An applicant who pursues such a strategy would
be intentionally undermining his claims before the PTO on
the speculative chance that he will gain some advantage
in the §145 proceeding by presenting new evidence to a
district court judge.
IV
For these reasons, we conclude that there are no limitations on a patent applicant’s ability to introduce new
evidence in a §145 proceeding beyond those already present in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Moreover, if new evidence is
presented on a disputed question of fact, the district court
must make de novo factual findings that take account
of both the new evidence and the administrative record
before the PTO. In light of these conclusions, the Federal
Circuit was correct to vacate the judgment of the District
Court, which excluded newly presented evidence under the
view that it “need not consider evidence negligently submitted after the end of administrative proceedings.” Civ.

The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded to
the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
