FICE, PETITIONER v. GILBERT P. HYATT

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[April 18, 2012]


JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Patent Act of 1952, 35 U. S. C. §100 et seq., grants
a patent applicant whose claims are denied by the Patent
and Trademark Office (PTO) the opportunity to challenge
the PTO’s decision by filing a civil action against the
Director of the PTO in federal district court. In such a
proceeding, the applicant may present evidence to the
district court that he did not present to the PTO. This
case requires us to consider two questions. First, we must
decide whether there are any limitations on the applicant’s ability to introduce new evidence before the district
court. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that
there are no evidentiary restrictions beyond those already
imposed by the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Second, we must determine
what standard of review the district court should apply
when considering new evidence. On this question, we hold
that the district court must make a de novo finding when
new evidence is presented on a disputed question of fact.
