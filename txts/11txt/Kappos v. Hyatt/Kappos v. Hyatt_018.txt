ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[April 18, 2012] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
concurring.
As the Court today recognizes, a litigant in a 35 U. S. C.
§145 proceeding is permitted to introduce evidence not
presented to the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO)
“ ‘according to the ordinary course of equity practice and
procedure.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Butterworth v. United
States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U. S. 50, 61 (1884)). Dating back
to §145’s original predecessor, Congress contemplated that
courts would manage such actions “according to the course
and principles of courts of equity.” Act of July 4, 1836,
ch. 357, §17, 5 Stat. 124. And this Court and other courts
have acknowledged and applied that principle on numerous occasions. See, e.g., Gandy v. Marble, 122 U. S. 432,
439 (1887) (describing Rev. Stat. 4915 (R. S. 4915) proceeding as “a suit according to the ordinary course of
equity practice and procedure”); In re Hien, 166 U. S. 432,
438 (1897) (same); In re Squire, 22 F. Cas. 1015, 1016 (No.
13,269) (CC ED Mo. 1877) (in an R. S. 4915 proceeding,
the parties were “at liberty to introduce additional evidence” under “the rules and practice of a court of equity”);
ante, at 10, 12, n. 4 (citing same cases).
Consistent with ordinary equity practice and procedure,
