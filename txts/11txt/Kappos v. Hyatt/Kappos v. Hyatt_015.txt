KAPPOS v. HYATT
Opinion of the Court

Morgan, on the other hand, concerned a different situation from the one presented in this case. First, Morgan
addressed an interference proceeding. See 153 U. S., at
125 (emphasizing that “the question decided in the Patent Office is one between contesting parties as to priority of
invention”). Although interference proceedings were previously governed by R. S. 4915, they are now governed
by a separate section of the Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. §146,
and therefore do not implicate §145. In addition, Morgan
did not involve a proceeding in which new evidence was
presented to the District Court. See 153 U. S., at 122
(stating that the case “was submitted, without any additional testimony, to the Circuit Court”).

Because in this case we are concerned only with §145
proceedings in which new evidence has been presented
to the District Court, Butterworth rather than Morgan
guides our decision. In Butterworth, this Court observed
that an R. S. 4915 proceeding should be conducted “according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure” and that it should be “prepared and heard upon all
competent evidence adduced and upon the whole merits.”
112 U. S., at 61. Likewise, we conclude that a district
court conducting a §145 proceeding may consider “all competent evidence adduced,” id., at 61, and is not limited to
considering only new evidence that could not have been
presented to the PTO. Thus, we agree with the Federal
Circuit that “Congress intended that applicants would be
free to introduce new evidence in §145 proceedings subject
only to the rules applicable to all civil actions, the Federal
——————
Office’ ” authorized under R. S. 4911, the predecessor to current §141.
Id., at 439 (quoting Butterworth, supra, at 61). And, finally, in Hoover
Co. v. Coe, 325 U. S. 79 (1945), the Court cited Butterworth to support
its description of an R. S. 4915 proceeding as a “formal trial.” 325 U. S.,
at 83, and n. 4.
