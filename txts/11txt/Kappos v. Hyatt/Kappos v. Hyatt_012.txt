Opinion of the Court

the Commissioner or by the Supreme Court of the District
of Columbia. Ibid. The district court, in a proceeding that
was distinct from the appeal considered on the administrative record by the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia, would “adjudge” whether the applicant was
“entitled, according to law, to receive a patent for his
invention . . . as the facts in the case may appear.” Ibid.
In 1878, Congress codified this provision of the 1870 Act
as Revised Statute §4915 (R. S. 4915). That statute was
the immediate predecessor to §145, and its core language
remains largely unchanged in §145. Accordingly, both
parties agree that R. S. 4915 and the judicial decisions
interpreting that statute should inform our understanding
of §145.

This Court described the nature of R. S. 4915 proceedings in two different cases: Butterworth v. United States ex
rel. Hoe, 112 U. S. 50 (1884), and Morgan v. Daniels, 153
U. S. 120 (1894). In Butterworth, the Court held that the
Secretary of the Interior, the head of the federal department in which the Patent Office was a bureau, had no
authority to review a decision made by the Commissioner
of Patents in an interference proceeding. In its discussion,
the Court described the remedy provided by R. S. 4915 as
“a proceeding in a court of the United States having
original equity jurisdiction under the patent laws, according to the ordinary course of equity practice and
procedure. It is not a technical appeal from the
Patent-Office, like that authorized [before the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia], confined to
the case as made in the record of that office, but is
prepared and heard upon all competent evidence adduced and upon the whole merits.” 112 U. S., at 61.
The Butterworth Court also cited several lower court
