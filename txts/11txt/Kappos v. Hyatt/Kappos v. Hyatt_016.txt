Opinion of the Court

Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” 625 F. 3d, at 1331.
We also agree with the Federal Circuit’s longstanding
view that, “where new evidence is presented to the district
court on a disputed fact question, a de novo finding will be
necessary to take such evidence into account together with
the evidence before the board.” Fregeau v. Mossinghoff,
776 F. 2d 1034, 1038 (1985). As we noted in Zurko,
the district court acts as a factfinder when new evidence
is introduced in a §145 proceeding. 527 U. S., at 164. The
district court must assess the credibility of new witnesses
and other evidence, determine how the new evidence
comports with the existing administrative record, and
decide what weight the new evidence deserves. As a
logical matter, the district court can only make these
determinations de novo because it is the first tribunal to
hear the evidence in question. Furthermore, a de novo
standard adheres to this Court’s instruction in Butterworth that an R. S. 4915 proceeding be heard “upon the
whole merits” and conducted “according to the ordinary
course of equity practice and procedure.” 112 U. S., at 61.

Although we reject the Director’s proposal for a stricter
evidentiary rule and an elevated standard of review in
§145 proceedings, we agree with the Federal Circuit that
the district court may, in its discretion, “consider the
proceedings before and findings of the Patent Office in
deciding what weight to afford an applicant’s newlyadmitted evidence.” 625 F. 3d, at 1335. Though the PTO
has special expertise in evaluating patent applications,
the district court cannot meaningfully defer to the PTO’s
factual findings if the PTO considered a different set of
facts. Supra, at 8; cf. Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 19) (noting that
“if the PTO did not have all material facts before it, its
