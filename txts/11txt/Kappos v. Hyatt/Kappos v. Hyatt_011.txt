The 1836 Act provided that a patent applicant could
bring a bill in equity in federal district court if his application was denied on the ground that it would interfere

Although the court was generally one of first instance, it also functioned as an appellate court when it sat en banc. Voorhees, The District of Columbia Courts: A Judicial Anomaly, 29 Cath. U. L. Rev. 917,
