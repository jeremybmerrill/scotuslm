Opinion of the Court

1336. We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and now
affirm.

The Director challenges both aspects of the Federal
Circuit’s decision. First, the Director argues that a district
court should admit new evidence in a §145 action only if
the proponent of the evidence had no reasonable opportunity to present it to the PTO in the first instance. Second, the Director contends that, when new evidence is
introduced, the district court should overturn the PTO’s factual findings only if the new evidence clearly establishes
that the agency erred. Both of these arguments share
the premise that §145 creates a special proceeding that is
distinct from a typical civil suit filed in federal district
court and that is thus governed by a different set of procedural rules. To support this interpretation of §145, the
Director relies on background principles of administrative
law and pre-existing practice under a patent statute that
predated §145. For the reasons discussed below, we find
that neither of these factors justifies a new evidentiary
rule or a heightened standard of review for factual findings in §145 proceedings.

To address the Director’s challenges, we begin with the
text of §145. See, e.g., Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U. S.

against the Director.” The section further explains that
the district court “may adjudge that such applicant is
entitled to receive a patent for his invention, as specified
in any of his claims involved in the decision of the [PTO],
as the facts in the case may appear and such adjudication
shall authorize the Director to issue such patent on compliance with the requirements of law.” By its terms, §145
