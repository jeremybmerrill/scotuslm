KAPPOS v. HYATT
Opinion of the Court

cation that, in his view, supported the claims that the
Board held were not patentable. The District Court determined that it could not consider Hyatt’s declaration
because applicants are “ ‘precluded from presenting new issues, at least in the absence of some reason of justice put
forward for failure to present the issue to the Patent Office.’ ” Hyatt v. Dudas, Civ. Action No. 03–0901 (D DC,
Sept. 30, 2005), p. 9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a (quoting
DeSeversky v. Brenner, 424 F. 2d 857, 858 (CADC 1970)).
Because the excluded declaration was the only additional
evidence submitted by Hyatt in the §145 proceeding, the
evidence remaining before the District Court consisted
entirely of the PTO’s administrative record. Therefore,
the District Court reviewed all of the PTO’s factual findings under the APA’s deferential “substantial evidence”
standard. See supra, at 2; see also Mazzari v. Rogan, 323
F. 3d 1000, 1004–1005 (CA Fed. 2003). Applying that
standard, the District Court granted summary judgment
to the Director.
Hyatt appealed to the Federal Circuit. A divided panel
affirmed, holding that the APA imposed restrictions on the
admission of new evidence in a §145 proceeding and that
the district court’s review is not “wholly de novo.” Hyatt v.
Doll, 576 F. 3d 1246, 1269–1270 (2009). The Federal
Circuit granted rehearing en banc and vacated the District
Court’s grant of summary judgment. The en banc court
first held “that Congress intended that applicants would
be free to introduce new evidence in §145 proceedings
subject only to the rules applicable to all civil actions, the
Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure,” even if the applicant had no justification for
failing to present the evidence to the PTO. 625 F. 3d 1320,
1331 (2010). Reaffirming its precedent, the court also held
that when new, conflicting evidence is introduced in a
§145 proceeding, the district court must make de
novo findings to take such evidence into account. Id., at
