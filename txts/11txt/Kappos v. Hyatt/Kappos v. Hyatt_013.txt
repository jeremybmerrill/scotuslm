KAPPOS v. HYATT
Opinion of the Court

cases, which similarly described R. S. 4915 proceedings
as “altogether independent” from the hearings before the
Patent Office and made clear that the parties were “at
liberty to introduce additional evidence” under “the rules
and practice of a court of equity.” In re Squire, 22 F. Cas.
1015, 1016 (No. 13,269) (CC ED Mo. 1877); see also Whipple v. Miner, 15 F. 117, 118 (CC Mass. 1883) (describing
the federal court’s jurisdiction in an R. S. 4915 proceeding
as “an independent, original jurisdiction”); Butler v. Shaw,
21 F. 321, 327 (CC Mass. 1884) (holding that “the court
may receive new evidence, and has the same powers as in
other cases in equity”).
Ten years later, in Morgan, this Court again confronted
a case involving proceedings under R. S. 4915. 153 U. S.
120. There, a party challenged a factual finding by the
Patent Office, but neither side presented additional evidence in the District Court. Id., at 122–123. This Court
described the parties’ dispute as one over a question of
fact that had already “been settled by a special tribunal
[e]ntrusted with full power in the premises” and characterized the resulting District Court proceeding not as an
independent civil action, but as “something in the nature
of a suit to set aside a judgment.” Id., at 124. Consistent
with that view, the Court held that the agency’s findings
should not be overturned by “a mere preponderance of
evidence.” Ibid.
Viewing Butterworth and Morgan together, one might
perceive some tension between the two cases. Butterworth
appears to describe an R. S. 4915 proceeding as an original
civil action, seeking de novo adjudication of the merits of
a patent application. Morgan, on the other hand, appears
to describe an R. S. 4915 proceeding as a suit for judicial
review of agency action, governed by a deferential standard of review. To resolve that apparent tension, the Director urges us to disregard the language in Butterworth as
mere dicta and to follow Morgan. He argues that Butter-
