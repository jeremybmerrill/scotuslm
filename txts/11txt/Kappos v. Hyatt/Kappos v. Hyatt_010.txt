Opinion of the Court

exhaustion do not apply in a §145 proceeding. The Director argues that applicants must present all available
evidence to the PTO to permit the PTO to develop the
necessary facts and to give the PTO the opportunity to
properly apply the Patent Act in the first instance. Brief
for Petitioner 21–22 (citing McKart v. United States, 395
U. S. 185, 193–194 (1969)). But as this Court held in
McKart, a primary purpose of administrative exhaustion
“is, of course, the avoidance of premature interruption of
the administrative process.” Id., at 193. That rationale
does not apply here because, by the time a §145 proceeding occurs, the PTO’s process is complete. Section 145,
moreover, does not provide for remand to the PTO to
consider new evidence, and there is no pressing need for
such a procedure because a district court, unlike a court of
appeals, has the ability and the competence to receive new
evidence and to act as a factfinder. In light of these aspects of §145 proceedings—at least in those cases in which
new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed question of fact—we are not persuaded by the Director’s suggestion that §145 proceedings are governed by the
deferential principles of agency review.
C
Having concluded that neither the statutory text nor
background principles of administrative law support an
evidentiary limit or a heightened standard of review for
factual findings in §145 proceedings, we turn to the evidentiary and procedural rules that were in effect when
Congress enacted §145 in 1952. Although §145 is a relatively modern statute, the language in that provision
originated in the Act of July 8, 1870 (1870 Act), ch. 230, 16
Stat. 198, and the history of §145 proceedings can be
traced back to the Act of July 4, 1836 (1836 Act), ch. 357, 5
Stat. 117. Thus, we begin our inquiry with the 1836 Act,
which established the Patent Office, the PTO’s predeces-
