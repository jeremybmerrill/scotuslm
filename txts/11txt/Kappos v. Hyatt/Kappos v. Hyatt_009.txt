KAPPOS v. HYATT
Opinion of the Court

neither imposes unique evidentiary limits in district court
proceedings nor establishes a heightened standard of review for factual findings by the PTO.
B
In the absence of express support for his position in the
text of §145, the Director argues that the statute should
be read in light of traditional principles of administrative
law, which Congress codified in the APA. The Director
notes that §145 requires a district court to review the
reasoned decisionmaking of the PTO, an executive agency
with specific authority and expertise. Accordingly, the
Director contends that a district court should defer to the
PTO’s factual findings. The Director further contends
that, given the traditional rule that a party must exhaust
his administrative remedies, a district court should consider new evidence only if the party did not have an opportunity to present it to the agency.
We reject the Director’s contention that background
principles of administrative law govern the admissibility
of new evidence and require a deferential standard of
review in a §145 proceeding. Under the APA, judicial
review of an agency decision is typically limited to the
administrative record. See 5 U. S. C. §706. But, as the
Director concedes, §145 proceedings are not so limited,
for the district court may consider new evidence. When the
district court does so, it must act as a factfinder. Zurko,
527 U. S., at 164. In that role, it makes little sense for the
district court to apply a deferential standard of review
to PTO factual findings that are contradicted by the new
evidence. The PTO, no matter how great its authority or
expertise, cannot account for evidence that it has never
seen. Consequently, the district court must make its own
findings de novo and does not act as the “reviewing court”
envisioned by the APA. See 5 U. S. C. §706.
We also conclude that the principles of administrative
