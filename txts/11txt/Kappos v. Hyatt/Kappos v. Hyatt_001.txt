KAPPOS, UNDER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, 

PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE v. HYATT 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
No. 10–1219. Argued January 9, 2012—Decided April 18, 2012
Under the Patent Act of 1952, if a Patent and Trade Office (PTO) examiner denies a patent application, 35 U. S. C. §131, the applicant may
file an administrative appeal with the PTO’s Board of Patent Appeals
and Interferences, §134. If the Board also denies the application, the
applicant may appeal directly to the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit under §141. Alternatively, the applicant may file a civil action against the PTO Director under §145, which permits the applicant to present evidence that was not presented to the PTO.
Respondent Hyatt filed a patent application covering multiple
claims. The patent examiner denied all of the claims for lack of an
adequate written description. Hyatt appealed to the Board, which
approved some claims but denied others. Pursuant to §145, Hyatt
filed a civil action against the Director, but the District Court declined to consider Hyatt’s newly proffered written declaration in support of the adequacy of his description, thus limiting its review to the
administrative record. Applying the deferential “substantial evidence” standard of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to the
PTO’s factual findings, the court granted summary judgment to the
Director. On appeal, the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment, holding that patent applicants can introduce new evidence in §145 proceedings, subject only to the limitations in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It also reaffirmed
its precedent that when new, conflicting evidence is introduced, the
district court must make de novo findings to take such evidence into
account.
