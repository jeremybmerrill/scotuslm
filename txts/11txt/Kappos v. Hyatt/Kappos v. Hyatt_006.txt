Opinion of the Court

dressed the standard that governs the Federal Circuit’s
review of the PTO’s factual findings. We held that the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. §701
et seq., applies to §141 proceedings and that the Federal
Circuit therefore should set aside the PTO’s factual findings only if they are “ ‘unsupported by substantial evidence.’ ” 527 U. S., at 152 (quoting 5 U. S. C. §706).
In Zurko, we also noted that, unlike §141, §145 permits
the applicant to present new evidence to the district court

This opportunity to present new evidence is significant,
not the least because the PTO generally does not accept
oral testimony. See Brief for Petitioner 40, n. 11. We have
not yet addressed, however, whether there are any limitations on the applicant’s ability to introduce new evidence
in such a proceeding or the appropriate standard of review
that a district court should apply when considering such
evidence.

among other information, a written description of the
invention and of the manner and process of making and

Board, which eventually approved 38 claims, but denied
the rest. Hyatt then filed a §145 action in Federal District Court against the Director of the PTO (Director), petitioner here.
To refute the Board’s conclusion that his patent application lacked an adequate written description, Hyatt submitted a written declaration to the District Court. In the
declaration, Hyatt identified portions of the patent specifi-
