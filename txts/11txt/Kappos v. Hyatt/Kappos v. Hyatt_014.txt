Opinion of the Court

worth “shed[s] no light on the extent to which new evidence was admissible in R. S. 4915 proceedings or on the
standard of review that applied in such suits.” Brief for
Petitioner 33. The Director maintains that Morgan, in
contrast, firmly established that a district court in such
a proceeding performs a deferential form of review, governed by traditional principles of administrative law. We
reject the Director’s position.3
We think that the differences between Butterworth and
Morgan are best explained by the fact that the two cases
addressed different circumstances. Butterworth discussed
the character of an R. S. 4915 proceeding in which a disappointed patent applicant challenged the Board’s denial
of his application. Although that discussion was not
strictly necessary to Butterworth’s holding it was also not
the kind of ill-considered dicta that we are inclined to ignore.
The Butterworth Court carefully examined the various provisions providing relief from the final denial of a patent
application by the Commissioner of Patents to determine
that the Secretary of the Interior had no role to play in
that process. 112 U. S., at 59–64. The Court further
surveyed the decisions of the lower courts with regard to
the nature of an R. S. 4915 proceeding and concluded that
its view was “the uniform and correct practice in the Circuit Courts.” Id., at 61. We note that this Court reiterated Butterworth’s well-reasoned interpretation of R. S.
4915 in three later cases.4

3 Both parties cite additional cases from the lower courts that they
claim support their view of the statute, but these cases are too diverse
to support any firm inferences about Congress’ likely intent in enacting
§145.
4 In Gandy v. Marble, 122 U. S. 432 (1887), the Court described an
R. S. 4915 proceeding as “a suit according to the ordinary course of
equity practice and procedure” rather than a “technical appeal from
the Patent Office.” Id., at 439 (citing Butterworth, 112 U. S., at 61).
Likewise, in In re Hien, 166 U. S. 432 (1897), the Court distinguished
an R. S. 4915 proceeding from the “ ‘technical appeal from the Patent
