Opinion of the Court

damages action implicit in the Fifth Amendment’s Due
Process Clause. Id., at 248–249. In doing so, the Court
emphasized the unavailability of “other alternative forms
of judicial relief.” Id., at 245. And the Court noted that
there was “no evidence” that Congress (or the Constitution) intended to foreclose such a remedy. Id., at 247.
In Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980), the Court
considered a claim for damages brought by the estate of
a federal prisoner who (the estate said) had died as the
result of government officials’ “deliberat[e] indifferen[ce]”
to his medical needs—indifference that violated the
Eighth Amendment. Id., at 16, n. 1, 17 (citing Estelle v.
Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976)). The Court implied an action
for damages from the Eighth Amendment. 446 U. S., at
17–18. It noted that state law offered the particular plaintiff no meaningful damages remedy. Id., at 17, n. 4.
Although the estate might have brought a damages claim
under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the defendant in any
such lawsuit was the employer, namely the United States,
not the individual officers who had committed the violation. Id., at 21. A damages remedy against an individual
officer, the Court added, would prove a more effective
deterrent. Ibid. And, rather than leave compensation to
the “vagaries” of state tort law, a federal Bivens action
would provide “uniform rules.” 446 U. S., at 23.
Since Carlson, the Court has had to decide in several
different instances whether to imply a Bivens action. And
in each instance it has decided against the existence of
such an action. These instances include:
(1) A federal employee’s claim that his federal employer
dismissed him in violation of the First Amendment, Bush,
supra, at 386–388 (congressionally created federal civil
service procedures provide meaningful redress);
(2) A claim by military personnel that military superiors violated various constitutional provisions, Chappell v.
Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 298–300 (1983) (special factors
