MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

U. S., at 70, and n. 4 (majority opinion), with id., at 76–77,
82 (dissenting opinion). In rejecting the dissent’s suggestion, the Court explained that the context in Malesko was
“fundamentally different” from the contexts at issue in
earlier cases, including Carlson. 534 U. S., at 70. That
difference, the Court said, reflected in part the nature of
the defendant, i.e., a corporate employer rather than an
individual employee, ibid., and in part reflected the existence of alternative “effective” state tort remedies, id., at
72–73. This last-mentioned factor makes it difficult to
square Pollard’s argument with Malesko’s reasoning.
Second, Pollard argues that, because of the “vagaries” of
state tort law, Carlson, 446 U. S., at 23, we should consider only whether federal law provides adequate alternative
remedies. See id., at 18–19, 23 (considering adequacy of
federal remedies); see also, e.g., Schweiker, supra, at 423
(similar); Bush, 462 U. S., at 378 (similar). But cf. Carlson, supra, at 24 (“ ‘[R]elevant Indiana statute would not
permit survival of the [state tort] claim’ ”). This argument
flounders, however, on the fact that the Court rejected it
in Malesko. Compare 534 U. S., at 72–73 (majority opinion), with id., at 79–80 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (making
similar suggestion). State tort law, after all, can help to
deter constitutional violations as well as to provide compensation to a violation’s victim. And it is consequently
unsurprising that several cases have considered the adequacy or inadequacy of state-law remedies when determining whether to imply a Bivens remedy. See, e.g., Bivens,
403 U. S., at 394 (state tort law “inconsistent or even
hostile” to Fourth Amendment); Davis, 442 U. S., at 245,
n. 23 (noting no state-law remedy available); cf. Malesko,
supra, at 70 (noting that the Court has implied Bivens
action only where any alternative remedy against individual officers was “nonexistent” or where plaintiff “lacked
any alternative remedy” at all).
Third, Pollard argues that state tort law does not pro-
