Opinion of the Court

from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.” Ibid. Our reasoning is best understood if we set
forth and explain why we reject Pollard’s arguments to the
contrary.
III
Pollard (together with supporting amici) asks us to
imply a Bivens action for four basic reasons—none of
which we find convincing. First, Pollard argues that this
Court has already decided in Carlson that a federal prisoner may bring an Eighth Amendment-based Bivens
action against prison personnel; and we need do no more
than simply apply Carlson’s holding here. Carlson, however, was a case in which a federal prisoner sought damages from personnel employed by the government, not
personnel employed by a private firm. 446 U. S., at 25.
And for present purposes that fact—of employment
status—makes a critical difference.
For one thing, the potential existence of an adequate
“alternative, existing process” differs dramatically in the
two sets of cases. Prisoners ordinarily cannot bring statelaw tort actions against employees of the Federal Government. See 28 U. S. C. §§2671, 2679(b)(1) (Westfall Act)
(substituting United States as defendant in tort action
against federal employee); Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225,
238, 241 (2007) (Westfall Act immunizes federal employee
through removal and substitution of United States as
defendant). But prisoners ordinarily can bring state-law
tort actions against employees of a private firm. Infra, at
9–10.
For another thing, the Court specifically rejected Justice
Stevens’ somewhat similar suggestion in his dissenting
opinion in Malesko, namely that a prisoner’s suit against a
private prison-management firm should fall within Carlson’s earlier holding because such a firm, like a federal
employee, is a “federal agent.” Compare Malesko, 534
