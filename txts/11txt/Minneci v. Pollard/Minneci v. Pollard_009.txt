MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

related to the military counsel against implying a Bivens
action), see also United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669,
683–684 (1987) (similar);
(3) A claim by recipients of Social Security disability
benefits that benefits had been denied in violation of the
Fifth Amendment, Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412,

Bivens actions against government agencies rather than
particular individuals who act unconstitutionally);

Although the Court, in reaching its decisions, has not
always similarly emphasized the same aspects of the
cases, Wilkie fairly summarizes the basic considerations
that underlie those decisions. 551 U. S., at 550. We consequently apply its approach here. And we conclude that
Pollard cannot assert a Bivens claim.
That is primarily because Pollard’s Eighth Amendment
claim focuses upon a kind of conduct that typically falls
within the scope of traditional state tort law. And in the
case of a privately employed defendant, state tort law
provides an “alternative, existing process” capable of
protecting the constitutional interests at stake. 551 U. S.,
at 550. The existence of that alternative here constitutes
a “convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain
