MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

remedial determination that is appropriate for a
common-law tribunal, paying particular heed, however, to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.’ ” 551
U. S., at 550 (quoting Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367,
378 (1983)).
These standards seek to reflect and to reconcile the
Court’s reasoning set forth in earlier cases. In Bivens
itself the Court held that the Fourth Amendment implicitly authorized a court to order federal agents to pay damages to a person injured by the agents’ violation of the
Amendment’s constitutional strictures. 403 U. S., at 389.
The Court noted that “ ‘where federally protected rights

It added that the interests protected on the one hand by
state “trespass” and “invasion of privacy” laws and on the

liberty.” Id., at 395. And it found “no special factors
counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action
