MINNECI v. POLLARD
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

in judgment).
Indeed, there is stronger cause for providing a federal
remedy in this case than there was in Malesko. There, the
question presented was whether a Bivens action lies
against a private corporation that manages a facility
housing federal prisoners. Malesko, 534 U. S., at 63.
Suing a corporate employer, the majority observed in
Malesko, would not serve to deter individual officers from
conduct transgressing constitutional limitations on their
authority. Id., at 70–71. Individual deterrence, the Court
reminded, was the consideration central to the Bivens
decision. Malesko, 534 U. S., at 70. Noting the availability of state tort remedies, the majority in Malesko declined
to “exten[d] Bivens beyond [that decision’s] core premise,”
i.e., deterring individual officers. Malesko, 534 U. S., at
71–73. Pollard’s case, in contrast, involves Bivens’ core
concern: His suit seeking damages directly from individual officers would have precisely the deterrent effect the
Court found absent in Malesko.
For the reasons stated, I would hold that relief potentially available under state tort law does not block Pollard’s recourse to a federal remedy for the affront to the
Constitution he suffered. Accordingly, I would affirm the
Ninth Circuit’s judgment.
