Opinion of the Court

vide remedies adequate to protect the constitutional interests at issue here. Pollard’s claim, however, is a claim for
physical or related emotional harm suffered as a result of
aggravated instances of the kind of conduct that state
tort law typically forbids. That claim arose in California,
where state tort law provides for ordinary negligence
actions, for actions based upon “want of ordinary care or
skill,” for actions for “negligent failure to diagnose or
treat,” and for actions based upon the failure of one with a
custodial duty to care for another to protect that other
from “ ‘unreasonable risk of physical harm.’ ” See Cal. Civ.
Code Ann. §§1714(a), 1714.8(a) (West 2009 and Supp.
2012); Giraldo v. California Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 168 Cal. App. 4th 231, 248, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d
371, 384 (2008) (quoting Haworth v. State, 60 Haw. 557,
562, 592 P. 2d 820, 824 (1979)). California courts have
specifically applied this law to jailers, including private
operators of prisons. Giraldo, supra, at 252, 85 Cal. Rptr.
3d, at 387 (“[J]ailers owe prisoners a duty of care to protect them from foreseeable harm”); see also Lawson v.
Superior Ct., 180 Cal. App. 4th 1372, 1389–1390, 1397,
103 Cal. Rptr. 3d 834, 849–850, 855 (2010) (same).
Moreover, California’s tort law basically reflects general
principles of tort law present, as far as we can tell, in the
law of every State. See Restatement (Second) of Torts
§§314A(4), 320 (1963–1964). We have found specific authority indicating that state law imposes general tort
duties of reasonable care (including medical care) on prison employees in every one of the eight States where privately managed secure federal facilities are currently located. See Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisions,
