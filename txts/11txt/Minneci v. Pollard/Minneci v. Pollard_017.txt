MARGARET MINNECI, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

RICHARD LEE POLLARD ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 10, 2012]


JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting.
Were Pollard incarcerated in a federal- or state-operated
facility, he would have a federal remedy for the Eighth
Amendment violations he alleges. See Carlson v. Green,
446 U. S. 14 (1980) (Bivens action); Estelle v. Gamble, 429
U. S. 97 (1976) (42 U. S. C. §1983 action). For the reasons
stated in the dissenting opinion I joined in Correctional
Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 75–83 (2001)
(opinion of Stevens, J.), I would not deny the same character of relief to Pollard, a prisoner placed by federal contract in a privately operated prison. Pollard may have
suffered “aggravated instances” of conduct state tort law
forbids, ante, at 9 (opinion of the Court), but that same
aggravated conduct, when it is engaged in by official actors,* also offends the Federal Constitution, see Estelle,
429 U. S., at 105–106. Rather than remitting Pollard to
the “vagaries” of state tort law, Carlson, 446 U. S., at 23,
I would hold his injuries, sustained while serving a federal sentence, “compensable according to uniform rules of
federal law,” Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics
Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 409 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring
——————
* The Ninth Circuit ruled that petitioners acted under color of federal
law, Pollard v. The GEO Group, Inc., 629 F. 3d 843, 854 (2010), and
petitioners did not seek this Court’s review of that determination, see
Brief for Petitioners 37, n. 8.
