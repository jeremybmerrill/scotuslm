MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

and several members of the medical staff. As the Federal
Magistrate Judge interpreted Pollard’s complaint, he
claimed that these employees had deprived him of adequate medical care, had thereby violated the Eighth
Amendment’s prohibition against “cruel and unusual”
punishment, and had caused him injury. He sought
damages.
Pollard said that a year earlier he had slipped on a cart
left in the doorway of the prison’s butcher shop. The
prison medical staff took x rays, thought he might have
fractured both elbows, brought him to an outside clinic for
further orthopedic evaluation, and subsequently arranged
for surgery. In particular, Pollard claimed:

(2) During several visits to the outside clinic, prison
guards made Pollard wear arm restraints that were connected in a way that caused him continued pain;
(3) Prison medical (and other) personnel failed to follow
the outside clinic’s instructions to put Pollard’s left elbow
in a posterior splint, failed to provide necessary physical
therapy, and failed to conduct necessary studies, including
nerve conduction studies;
(4) At times when Pollard’s arms were in casts or similarly disabled, prison officials failed to make alternative
arrangements for him to receive meals, with the result
that (to avoid “being humiliated” in the general food service area, id., at 35) Pollard had to auction off personal
items to obtain funds to buy food at the commissary;
(5) Prison officials deprived him of basic hygienic care
to the point where he could not bathe for two weeks;
(6) Prison medical staff provided him with insufficient
medicine, to the point where he was in pain and could not
sleep; and
