MINNECI v. POLLARD
Opinion of the Court

relevant here will universally prove to be, or remain, as we
have described them. Nonetheless, we are certain enough
about the shape of present law as applied to the kind of
case before us to leave different cases and different state
laws to another day. That is to say, we can decide whether to imply a Bivens action in a case where an Eighth
Amendment claim or state law differs significantly from
those at issue here when and if such a case arises. The
possibility of such a different future case does not provide
sufficient grounds for reaching a different conclusion here.
For these reasons, where, as here, a federal prisoner
seeks damages from privately employed personnel working at a privately operated federal prison, where the conduct allegedly amounts to a violation of the Eighth
Amendment, and where that conduct is of a kind that
typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law
(such as the conduct involving improper medical care at
issue here), the prisoner must seek a remedy under state
tort law. We cannot imply a Bivens remedy in such a case.
The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.
So ordered.
