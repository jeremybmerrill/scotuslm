BREYER, J., dissenting

assessment at the center of this case was even imposed.
Compare App. 108 (reflecting that the audit of the 2004
budget was completed by April 25, 2005) with id., at 25
(reflecting approval of the special assessment on July 30,
2005).
More specifically, the Court suggests that the Constitution prohibits the union’s classification of money spent
“ ‘lobbying . . . the electorate’ ” as a chargeable expense.
See ante, at 20. But California state law explicitly permits
the union to classify some lobbying expenses as chargeable. See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §3515.8 (West 2010) (a

concern too is misplaced. The union has offered to pay for
neutral arbitration of such disputes before the American
Arbitration Association. App. 103–104. And, again, insofar as the Court casts doubt on the constitutional validity
of the basic system, the Court does so without the benefit
of argument.
Finally, the Court argues that (Step 1) Hudson is “pred-
