KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
BREYER, J., dissenting

ployees who raised a general objection at the beginning of
the year. The union has honored their objections by subtracting from their special payments the same 44% that it
subtracts from each of their ordinary monthly payments.
App. 309. And we know that the special assessment here
did not even work temporary constitutional harm. That is
because audited figures showed that the union’s total
nonchargeable (e.g., political) expenses for that year ended
up as a lower percentage of total expenses than the previous year. Hence the objecting nonmembers ended up
being charged too little, not too much, even with the special assessment thrown into the mix.
Let me put the point more specifically. The union’s
June 2005 Hudson notice said that the union would
charge objecting nonmembers roughly 56% of the dues
paid by union members. See App. 102. That 56% figure
represented the chargeable portion of expenditures according to the audited figures from 2004. Thus, if the fee
charged to a union member pursuant to the 2005 notice
was $400, the fee charged to an objecting nonmember was
$224. The union similarly prorated the special assessment charging objecting nonmembers 56% of the assessment it imposed upon members. Thus, if the special
assessment amounted to $50 for a member, it amounted to
$28 for an objecting nonmember. And total dues in this
example would have amounted to $450 for a member and
$252 for a nonmember.
In the event, the union’s chargeable expenses for 2005—
including the funds raised pursuant to the special assessment—amounted to more than 56% of its total expenditures. The auditor’s reports show that the union’s total
expenditures in 2005 amounted to $40,045,409. Id.,
at 166. Chargeable expenses amounted to $27,552,746,
which works out to 69% of the total budget. Ibid. Thus, a
substantially larger portion of the union’s 2005 spending
was chargeable (69%) than it had been in 2004 (56%).
