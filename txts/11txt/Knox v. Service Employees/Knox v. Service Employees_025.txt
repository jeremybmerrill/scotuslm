Opinion of the Court

result, a broad array of ballot questions and campaigns for
public office may be said to have an effect on present and
future contracts between public-sector workers and their
employers. If the concept of “germaneness” were as broad
as the SEIU advocates, public-sector employees who do
not endorse the unions’ goals would be essentially unprotected against being compelled to subsidize political and
ideological activities to which they object.
Second, even if the SEIU’s statistics are accurate, it does
not follow that it was proper for the union to charge objecting nonmembers 56.35%—or any other particular percentage—of the special assessment. Unless it is possible to
determine in advance with some degree of accuracy the
percentage of union funds that will be used during an
upcoming year for chargeable purposes—and the SEIU
argues that this is not possible—there is at least a risk
that, at the end of the year, unconsenting nonmembers
will have paid either too much or too little. Which side
should bear this risk?
The answer is obvious: the side whose constitutional
rights are not at stake. “Given the existence of acceptable
alternatives, [a] union cannot be allowed to commit dissenters’ funds to improper uses even temporarily.” Ellis,
466 U. S., at 444. Thus, if unconsenting nonmembers pay
too much, their First Amendment rights are infringed. On
the other hand, if unconsenting nonmembers pay less than
their proportionate share, no constitutional right of the
union is violated because the union has no constitutional
right to receive any payment from these employees. See
Davenport, 551 U. S., at 185. The union has simply lost
for a few months the “extraordinary” benefit of being empowered to compel nonmembers to pay for services that
they may not want and in any event have not agreed to
fund.
As we have noted, by allowing unions to collect any fees
from nonmembers and by permitting unions to use opt-out
