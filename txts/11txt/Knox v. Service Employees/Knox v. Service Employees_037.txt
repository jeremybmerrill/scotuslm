KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
BREYER, J., dissenting

chargeable percentage for the fee-year 2006–2007. Id., at
158. Since political expenditures during calendar year
2005 turned out to be lower than in 2004, the new chargeable share amounted to about 69% of the total fee bill.
Ibid.
Simplifying further to illustrate, I shall describe the
system as (1) using audited accounts for Year One to
determine the proportion of the fee that objectors must
pay during Year Two, and (2) using audited accounts for
Year Two to determine the proportion of the fee that objectors must pay during Year Three. If Year One’s
chargeable share (as applied to Year Two) turns out to be
too high, Year Two’s audited accounts will reflect that fact,
and the payable share for Year Three will be reduced
accordingly.
This system does not put typical objectors to any disadvantage. If, say, in Year One total expenses were
$1 million, collective-bargaining expenses amounted to
$600,000, and political expenses amounted to $400,000,
then the union cannot charge objecting nonmembers more
than 60% of normal dues in Year Two. If in Year Two
collective-bargaining expenses turned out to be a lesser
share of total expenses, say 30%, then the union cannot
charge objecting nonmembers more than 30% of the total
fee in Year Three. Normally, what the objecting nonmembers lose on the swings they will gain on the roundabouts.
This kind of basic administrative system is imperfect.
The nature of a union’s expenditures, including nonchargeable political expenditures, varies from year to year,
for political needs differ at different stages of political
cycles. Thus, last year’s percentages will often fail to
match this year’s expenditures patterns. And the possibility that an objecting nonmember’s funds will temporarily
help the union pay for a nonchargeable political expenditure (say, in Year Two) is always present—though in this
case that did not happen. See infra, at 6–7.
