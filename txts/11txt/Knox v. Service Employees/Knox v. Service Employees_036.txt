BREYER, J., dissenting

nonmembers’ constitutional right not to support “‘ideological
causes not germane to [the union’s] duties as collectivebargaining agent.’ ” Id., at 294 (quoting Ellis v. Railway
Clerks, 466 U. S. 435, 447 (1984)). See also Keller v. State
Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 17 (1990) (explaining that Hudson
“outlined a minimum set of procedures by which a union
in an agency-shop relationship could meet its requirement
under Abood”). The Court, in my view, should not depart,
or create an exception, from Hudson’s framework here.

Because the administrative details of the fee collection
process are critical, I shall begin by explaining how I understand that process to work. The union here followed
a basic administrative system that ensures that the
fee charged to objecting nonmembers matches their pro
rata share of the union’s chargeable expenditures, but it
achieves that match only over a period of several years.
At the end of 2004, independent auditors determined the
amount of chargeable (e.g., collective-bargaining related)
expenditures and the amount of nonchargeable (e.g., nongermane political) expenditures that the union actually made during 2004. The union then used the resulting
proportion (which was about 56% chargeable, 44% nonchargeable) as the basis for apportioning the next year’s
dues. Thus in June 2005, the union sent all represented
employees a Hudson notice setting forth that (roughly) 56
to 44 figure. App. 96–106. It provided time for nonmembers to object or to challenge the figure or underlying data.
Id., at 98–104. And it then applied the resulting figure to
determine the percentage of the total fee that objecting
nonmembers would have to pay during the next fee-year,
which ran from July 2005 to June 2006. Id., at 102. At
the end of 2005, auditors again examined the union’s
actual expenditures made during 2005. And the union
then used those newly audited figures to determine the
