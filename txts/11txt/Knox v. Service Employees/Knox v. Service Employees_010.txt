KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
Opinion of the Court

typical spending regime and to focus on activities that
were political or ideological in nature.” Id., at *8. In light
of this fact, the court held that it would be inappropriate
for the union to rely on previous annual expenditures to
estimate that 56.35% of the new fee would go toward
chargeable expenses. The court ordered the SEIU to send
out a new notice giving all class members 45 days to object
and to provide those who objected with a full refund of
their contributions to the Political Fight-Back Fund. Id.,

1120. The majority therefore inquired whether the procedure that the SEIU employed reasonably accommodated
the interests of the union, the employer, and nonmember
employees. Id., at 1120–1123. Judge Wallace dissented,
arguing that the majority had misinterpreted Hudson and
sanctioned the abridgment of the First Amendment rights
of nonmembers. 628 F. 3d, at 1123–1139.
We granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).

The SEIU argues that we should dismiss this case as
moot. In opposing the petition for certiorari, the SEIU
defended the decision below on the merits. After certiorari
was granted, however, the union sent out a notice offering
a full refund to all class members, and the union then
promptly moved for dismissal of the case on the ground of
mootness. Such postcertiorari maneuvers designed to
insulate a decision from review by this Court must be
viewed with a critical eye. See City News & Novelty, Inc.
v. Waukesha, 531 U. S. 278, 283–284 (2001). The voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case moot because a dismissal for mootness
