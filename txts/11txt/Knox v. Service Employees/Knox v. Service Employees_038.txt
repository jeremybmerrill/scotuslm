BREYER, J., dissenting

Nonetheless this kind of system enjoys an offsetting
administrative virtue. It bases fees upon audited accounts, thereby avoiding the difficulties and disagreements that would surround an effort to determine the
relevant proportions by trying to measure union expenditures as they occur or by trying to make predictions about
the nature of future expenditures. It consequently gives
workers reliable information. It gives workers advance
notice of next year’s payable charge. It gives nonmembers
a “reasonably prompt” opportunity to object. Hudson, 475

year’s expenses (Year Two) turns out to be lower than last
year’s (Year One), it provides offsetting compensation in
the form of a lower payable share for the following year
(Year Three).
In any event, these features are characteristic of an
administrative system that “calculat[es]” shares of a union’s fee “on the basis of its expenses during the preceding
year.” Id., at 307, n. 18. Hudson stated specifically that
the “[u]nion cannot be faulted for calculating its fee” on
that basis. Ibid. And no party here has challenged the
constitutional validity of that basic administrative system.

If the union’s basic administrative system does not
violate the Constitution, then how could its special assessment have done so? In my view, it did not violate the
Constitution, and I shall explain my basis for thinking
so by considering separately (1) those nonmembers who
objected initially to the 2005 Hudson notice, and (2) those
nonmembers who did not initially object.

The special assessment as administered here has
worked no constitutional harm upon those nonunion em-
