DIANNE KNOX, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 1000
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 21, 2012] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
joins, concurring in the judgment.
When a public-sector union imposes a special assessment intended to fund solely political lobbying efforts, the
First Amendment requires that the union provide nonmembers an opportunity to opt out of the contribution of
funds. I therefore concur in the Court’s judgment.
I concur only in the judgment, however, because I cannot agree with the majority’s decision to address unnecessarily significant constitutional issues well outside the
scope of the questions presented and briefing. By doing so,
the majority breaks our own rules and, more importantly,
disregards principles of judicial restraint that define the
Court’s proper role in our system of separated powers.
I
The Political Fight-Back Fund was to be used by Service
Employees International Union, Local 1000 (SEIU), “specifically in the political arenas of California” to defeat
perceived antiunion initiatives and to elect a sympathetic
Governor and legislature. App. 25; see also id., at 31. As
the majority explains, such political efforts are not “germane” to the union’s function as a bargaining representative, and accordingly are not chargeable to objecting
nonmembers. See Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S.
