KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
BREYER, J., dissenting

administrative calculation problems, is apparently to depart yet further from the Court’s earlier holdings. It
seems to say that an objector can withhold 100%, not
simply of a special assessment made for political purposes,
but of any special assessment whatsoever, including an
assessment made solely for the purpose of paying for extra
chargeable costs, such as extended contract negotiations,
pension plan experts, or newly assessed contributions to
replenish a national union’s collective-bargaining assistance funds. See ante, at 21–22. Although this rule is
comparatively simple to administer, it cannot be reconciled with the Court’s previous constitutional holdings.
Abood, along with every related case the Court has ever
decided, makes clear that the Constitution allows a union
to assess nonmembers a pro rata share of fees insofar
as they are used to pay for these kinds of collectivebargaining expenses. See 431 U. S., at 234–236; see also
Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 524 (1991);
Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 760 (1961); Ellis, 466

U. S. 177, 181 (2007); Locke v. Karass, 555 U. S. 207, 210
(2009). How could the majority now hold to the contrary?
If there are good reasons for requiring departure from
the basic Hudson-approved administrative system, they
are not the reasons the Court provides. It suggests that
the basic Hudson administrative system gives the union
the freedom to misclassify, arguing, for example, that the
union has adopted an overly broad definition of chargeability. See ante, at 20–21. The 2005 proportion, however,
rested upon audited 2004 accounts. While petitioners
argue in this Court that the union misclassified parts
of the special assessment (which was not imposed until
2005), no brief filed in this case (and certainly no court
below) has challenged the accuracy of the 2004 figures or
the resulting chargeable/nonchargeable allocation. Indeed, the 2004 accounts were audited before the special
