KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
Opinion of the Court

were at least 66.26% chargeable. See Brief for Respondent 5, n. 6. This argument is unpersuasive for several
reasons.
First, the SEIU’s understanding of the breadth of chargeable expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place
much reliance on its statistics. In its brief, the SEIU
argues broadly that all funds spent on “lobbying . . . the
electorate” are chargeable. See id., at 51. But “lobbying
. . . the electorate” is nothing but another term for supporting political causes and candidates, and we have never
held that the First Amendment permits a union to compel
nonmembers to support such political activities. On the
contrary, as long ago as Street, we noted the important
difference between a union’s authority to engage in collective bargaining and related activities on behalf of nonmember employees in a bargaining unit and the union’s
use of nonmembers’ money “to support candidates for
public office” or “to support political causes which [they]
oppos[e].” 367 U. S., at 768.
The sweep of the SEIU’s argument is highlighted by its
discussion of the use of fees paid by objecting nonmembers
to defeat Proposition 76. According to the SEIU, these
expenditures were “germane” to the implementation of its
contracts because, if Proposition 76 had passed, it would
have “effectively permitted the Governor to abrogate the
Union’s collective bargaining agreements under certain
circumstances, undermining the Union’s ability to perform
its representation duty of negotiating effective collective
bargaining agreements.” Brief for Respondent 49–50

If we were to accept this broad definition of germaneness, it would effectively eviscerate the limitation on the
use of compulsory fees to support unions’ controversial
political activities. Public-employee salaries, pensions,
and other benefits constitute a substantial percentage of
the budgets of many States and their subdivisions. As a
