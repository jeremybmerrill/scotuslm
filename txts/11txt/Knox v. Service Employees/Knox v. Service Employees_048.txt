BREYER, J., dissenting

protection it provides primarily helps only those who are
politically near neutral. See generally Sunstein & Thaler,
Libertarian Paternalism is not an Oxymoron, 70 U. Chi.
L. Rev. 1159, 1161 (2003) (explaining that default rules
play an important role when individuals do not have “welldefined preferences”). Consequently, the Court, which
held recently that the Constitution permits a State to impose an opt-in requirement, see Davenport, 551 U. S., at
185, has never said that it mandates such a requirement.
There is no good reason for the Court suddenly to enter
the debate, much less now to decide that the Constitution
resolves it.
Of course, principles of stare decisis are not absolute.
But the Court cannot be right when it departs from those
principles without benefit of argument in a matter of such
importance.
For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.
