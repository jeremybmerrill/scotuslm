KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
BREYER, J., dissenting

icated on the assumption that a union’s allocation of funds
for chargeable and nonchargeable purposes is not likely to
vary greatly from one year to the next,” ante, at 18; that
(Step 2) this assumption does not apply to midyear assessments; hence (Step 3) what appears binding precedent
(namely Hudson) does not bind the Court in its interpretation of the Constitution as applied to those assessments.

I must jump this logical ship, however, at Step 1. I
cannot find in Hudson the “assumption” of uniform expenditures that the Court says underlies it. The assumption does not appear there explicitly. And it is hard to

kind of union-related matters currently visible on the
political agenda. Cf., e.g., App. 102, 158, 223 (union’s
chargeability proportion varies significantly over three
years, from 56.35% in 2004, to 68.8% in 2005, to 60.3% in
2006). And it is hard to believe that the Members of this
Court, when deciding Abood, were not fully aware of these
obvious facts.

A stronger case can be made for allowing nonmember
employees who did not object at the beginning of the dues
year to object (for the first time) to a special assessment.
That is because, unlike the nonmember who objected
initially, the union will not permit that initially nonobjecting nonmember to withhold anything from the special
assessment fee. Nonetheless, there are powerful reasons
not to allow the nonmember who did not object initially to
the annual fee to object now for the first time to the midyear special assessment.
For one thing, insofar as a new objection permits the
