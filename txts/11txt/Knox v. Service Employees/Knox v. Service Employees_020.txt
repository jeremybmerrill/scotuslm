KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
Opinion of the Court

sented. Thus, the effect of the SEIU’s procedure was to
force many nonmembers to subsidize a political effort
designed to restrict their own rights.
As Hudson held, procedures for collecting fees from
nonmembers must be carefully tailored to minimize impingement on First Amendment rights, and the procedure
used in this case cannot possibly be considered to have
met that standard. After the dues increase was adopted,
the SEIU wrote to all employees in the relevant bargaining units to inform them of this development. It would
have been a relatively simple matter for the union to cast
this letter in the form of a new Hudson notice, so that
nonmembers could decide whether they wanted to pay for
the union’s electoral project.
The SEIU argues that we should not be troubled by its
failure to provide a new notice because nonmembers who
objected to the special assessment but were nonetheless
required to pay it would have been given the chance to
recover the funds in question by opting out when the next
annual notice was sent. If the special assessment was
used entirely or in part for nonchargeable purposes, they
suggest, the percentage of the union’s annual expenditures
for chargeable purposes would decrease, and therefore the
amount of the dues payable by objecting nonmembers the
following year would also decrease. This decrease, however, would not fully recompense nonmembers who did not
opt out after receiving the regular notice but would have
opted out if they had been permitted to do so when the
special assessment was announced.5 And in any event,
even a full refund would not undo the violation of First
Amendment rights. As we have recognized, the First

nonmembers, after paying the full amount of the special assessment, would be required during the subsequent year to pay at least
as much as those nonmembers who did opt out when they received the
initial Hudson notice.
