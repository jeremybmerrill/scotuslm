KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
Opinion of the Court

involving a “mandated association” among those who are
required to pay the subsidy. Id., at 414. Such situations
are exceedingly rare because, as we have stated elsewhere,
mandatory associations are permissible only when they
serve a “compelling state interes[t] . . . that cannot be
achieved through means significantly less restrictive of
associational freedoms.” Roberts, supra, at 623. Second,
even in the rare case where a mandatory association can

collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic
consequences, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 48–49, the compulsory
fees constitute a form of compelled speech and association
that imposes a “significant impingement on First Amendment rights.” Ellis, supra, at 455. Our cases to date have

recognition to the critical First Amendment rights at
stake.
“The primary purpose” of permitting unions to collect
fees from nonmembers, we have said, is “to prevent nonmembers from free-riding on the union’s efforts, sharing
the employment benefits obtained by the union’s collective
bargaining without sharing the costs incurred.” Davenport, 551 U. S., at 181. Such free-rider arguments, however,
are generally insufficient to overcome First Amend-
