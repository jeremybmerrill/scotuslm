of fee collection comports with the Constitution. See Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, 181, 185
(2007); Hudson, 475 U. S., at 306, n. 16; Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209, 238 (1977); see also ante,
at 12–13. They did not argue that the Constitution requires an opt-in system of fee collection in the context of
special assessments or dues increases or, indeed, in any
context. Not surprisingly, respondents did not address
such a prospect.
Under this Court’s Rule 14.1(a), “[o]nly the questions set
out in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court.” “[W]e disregard [that rule] ‘only

at 22 (emphasis added); see also ante, at 17 (“[T]he
union should have sent out a new notice allowing nonmembers to opt in to the special fee rather than requiring
them to opt out”). The majority thus decides, for the very
first time, that the First Amendment does require an optin system in some circumstances: the levying of a special
assessment or dues increase. The majority announces its
novel rule without any analysis of potential countervailing
arguments and without any reflection on the reliance
interests our old rules have engendered.
The majority’s choice to reach an issue not presented by
the parties, briefed, or argued, disregards our rules. See
Yee, 503 U. S., at 535. And it ignores a fundamental
premise of our adversarial system: “ ‘that appellate courts
