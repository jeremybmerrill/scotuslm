Opinion of the Court

ment objections. Consider the following examples:
“If a community association engages in a clean-up
campaign or opposes encroachments by industrial development, no one suggests that all residents or property owners who benefit be required to contribute. If
a parent-teacher association raises money for the
school library, assessments are not levied on all parents. If an association of university professors has as
a major function bringing pressure on universities to
observe standards of tenure and academic freedom,
most professors would consider it an outrage to be required to join. If a medical association lobbies against
regulation of fees, not all doctors who share in the
benefits share in the costs.”2
Acceptance of the free-rider argument as a justification
for compelling nonmembers to pay a portion of union dues
represents something of an anomaly—one that we have
found to be justified by the interest in furthering “labor
peace.” Hudson, 475 U. S., at 303. But it is an anomaly
nevertheless.
Similarly, requiring objecting nonmembers to opt out
of paying the nonchargeable portion of union dues—as
opposed to exempting them from making such payments
unless they opt in—represents a remarkable boon for
unions. Courts “do not presume acquiescence in the loss of
fundamental rights.” College Savings Bank v. Florida
Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 682
(1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Once it is
recognized, as our cases have, that a nonmember cannot
be forced to fund a union’s political or ideological activities, what is the justification for putting the burden on
the nonmember to opt out of making such a payment?
