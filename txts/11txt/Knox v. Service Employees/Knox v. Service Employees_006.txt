KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
Opinion of the Court

307, n. 20 (1986). See also Davenport v. Washington Ed.
Assn., 551 U. S. 177, 181 (2007) (“[A]gency-shop arrangements in the public sector raise First Amendment concerns because they force individuals to contribute money
to unions as a condition of government employment”);
Street, supra, at 749 (union shop presents First Amendment “questions of the utmost gravity”). Thus, in Abood v.
Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), we held that a
public-sector union, while permitted to bill nonmembers
for chargeable expenses, may not require nonmembers to
fund its political and ideological projects. And in Hudson,
we identified procedural requirements that a union must
meet in order to collect fees from nonmembers without
violating their rights. 475 U. S., at 302–311. The First
Amendment, we held, does not permit a public-sector
union to adopt procedures that have the effect of requiring
objecting nonmembers to lend the union money to be used
for political, ideological, and other purposes not germane
to collective bargaining. Id., at 305. In the interest of
administrative convenience, however, we concluded that
a union “cannot be faulted” for calculating the fee that
nonmembers must pay “on the basis of its expenses during
the preceding year.” Id., at 307, n. 18.
Hudson concerned a union’s regular annual fees. The
present case, by contrast, concerns the First Amendment
requirements applicable to a special assessment or dues
increase that is levied to meet expenses that were not
disclosed when the amount of the regular assessment was
set.

In June 2005, respondent, the Service Employees International Union, Local 1000 (SEIU), sent out its regular
Hudson notice informing employees what the agency fee
would be for the year ahead. The notice set monthly dues
at 1% of an employee’s gross monthly salary but capped
