KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

of fees levied to cover nonchargeable expenses, our prior
decisions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of what
the First Amendment can tolerate.” Ante, at 14 (emphasis
added); see also ante, at 21–22 (“[B]y allowing unions to
collect any fees from nonmembers and by permitting
unions to use opt-out rather than opt-in schemes when
annual dues are billed, our cases have substantially impinged upon the First Amendment rights of nonmembers”); ante, at 11–12 (“Once it is recognized . . . that a
nonmember cannot be forced to fund a union’s political or
ideological activities, what is the justification for putting
the burden on the nonmember to opt out of making such a
payment? Shouldn’t the default rule comport with the
probable preferences of most nonmembers?”).
To cast serious doubt on longstanding precedent is a
step we historically take only with the greatest caution
and reticence. To do so, as the majority does, on our own
invitation and without adversarial presentation is both
unfair and unwise. It deprives the parties and potential
amici of the opportunity to brief and argue the question.
It deprives us of the benefit of argument that the parties,
with concrete interests in the question, are surely better
positioned than we to set forth. See NASA, 562 U. S., at
___, n. 10 (opinion for the Court by ALITO, J.) (slip op.,
at 11, n. 10) (“It is undesirable for us to decide a matter
of this importance in a case in which we do not have the
benefit of briefing by the parties and in which potential
amici had little notice that the matter might be decided”).
Not content with our task, prescribed by Article III, of
answering constitutional questions, the majority today
decides to ask them as well.
