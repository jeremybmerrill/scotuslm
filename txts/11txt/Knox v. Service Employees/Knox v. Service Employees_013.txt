of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 797 (1988) (The First
Amendment protects “the decision of both what to say and
what not to say” (emphasis deleted)). And the ability of

scheme that compelled such funding. The subject of the
speech at issue—promoting the sale of mushrooms—was

The federal Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act required that fresh mushroom
handlers pay assessments used primarily to fund advertisements promoting mushroom sales. A large producer
objected to subsidizing these generic ads, and even though
we applied the less demanding standard used in prior
