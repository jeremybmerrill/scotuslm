would permit a resumption of the challenged conduct as
soon as the case is dismissed. See City of Mesquite v.
Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982). And
here, since the union continues to defend the legality of
the Political Fight-Back fee, it is not clear why the union

The union argues that concerns about voluntary cessation are inapplicable in this case because petitioners do

refused to accept refund requests by fax or e-mail and has
made refunds conditional upon the provision of an original
signature and a Social Security number. Id., at 18–19. As
