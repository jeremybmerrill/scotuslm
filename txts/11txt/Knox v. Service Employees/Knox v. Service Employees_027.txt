Opinion of the Court

*
*
*
The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.

——————
remand in order to provide adequate assurance that members of
the class are not compelled to subsidize nonchargeable activities to
which they object. See supra, at 7–8. Petitioners argue strenuously that
these procedures must be narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on
their free-speech rights. See Brief for Petitioners 11–17. We see no
sensible way to address this dispute without confronting the question
whether, in the particular context present here, an opt-out regime
suffices.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would apparently have us proceed on the assumption that an opt-out regime is permitted. She would then have us
decide what sort of opt-out procedures would be sufficient if such a
regime were allowed at all. But that is a question that simply cannot
be answered. It would be like asking what sort of procedural requirements would be required if the government set out to do something
else that the First Amendment flatly prohibits—for example, requiring
prepublication approval of newspapers.
There is also no merit in JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s and JUSTICE BREYER’s
comments about prior precedent. This case concerns the procedures
that must be followed when a public-sector union announces a special
assessment or mid-year dues increase. No prior decision of this Court
has addressed that question, and Hudson says not one word on the
subject.
