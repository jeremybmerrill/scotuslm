KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES
Opinion of the Court 


IV 

By authorizing a union to collect fees from nonmembers
and permitting the use of an opt-out system for the collection of fees levied to cover nonchargeable expenses, our
prior decisions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of
what the First Amendment can tolerate. The SEIU, however, asks us to go farther. It asks us to approve a procedure under which (a) a special assessment billed for use
in electoral campaigns was assessed without providing a
new opportunity for nonmembers to decide whether they
wished to contribute to this effort and (b) nonmembers
who previously opted out were nevertheless required to
pay more than half of the special assessment even
though the union had said that the purpose of the fund
was to mount a political campaign and that it would not
be used for ordinary union expenses. This aggressive use
of power by the SEIU to collect fees from nonmembers is
indefensible.
A
First, we see no justification for the union’s failure to
provide a fresh Hudson notice. Hudson rests on the principle that nonmembers should not be required to fund a
union’s political and ideological projects unless they choose
to do so after having “a fair opportunity” to assess the impact of paying for nonchargeable union activities. 475
U. S., at 303. Giving employees only one opportunity per
year to make this choice is tolerable if employees are able
at the time in question to make an informed choice. But
