Opinion of the Court

The King in particular accepted the “freedom of elections,”
a right “thought to be of the greatest necessity and importance to the English church.” J. Holt, Magna Carta
App. IV, p. 317, cl. 1 (1965).
That freedom in many cases may have been more theoretical than real. See, e.g., W. Warren, Henry II 312
(1973) (recounting the writ sent by Henry II to the electors
of a bishopric in Winchester, stating: “I order you to hold a
free election, but forbid you to elect anyone but Richard
my clerk”). In any event, it did not survive the reign of
Henry VIII, even in theory. The Act of Supremacy of 1534,
26 Hen. 8, ch. 1, made the English monarch the supreme
head of the Church, and the Act in Restraint of Annates,
25 Hen. 8, ch. 20, passed that same year, gave him the
authority to appoint the Church’s high officials. See G.
Elton, The Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commentary 331–332 (1960). Various Acts of Uniformity, enacted
subsequently, tightened further the government’s grip on
the exercise of religion. See, e.g., Act of Uniformity, 1559,
1 Eliz., ch. 2; Act of Uniformity, 1549, 2 & 3 Edw. 6, ch. 1.
The Uniformity Act of 1662, for instance, limited service
as a minister to those who formally assented to prescribed
tenets and pledged to follow the mode of worship set forth
in the Book of Common Prayer. Any minister who refused
to make that pledge was “deprived of all his Spiritual
Promotions.” Act of Uniformity, 1662, 14 Car. 2, ch. 4.
Seeking to escape the control of the national church, the
Puritans fled to New England, where they hoped to elect
their own ministers and establish their own modes of
worship. See T. Curry, The First Freedoms: Church and
State in America to the Passage of the First Amendment 3
(1986); McConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev.
1409, 1422 (1990). William Penn, the Quaker proprietor
of what would eventually become Pennsylvania and Delaware, also sought independence from the Church of Eng-
