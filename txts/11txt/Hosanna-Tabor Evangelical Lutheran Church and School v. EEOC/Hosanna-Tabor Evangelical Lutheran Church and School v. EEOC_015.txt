HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH
AND SCHOOL v. EEOC
Opinion of the Court

United States, which declares, that ‘Congress shall make
no law respecting a religious establishment.’ ” 22 Annals
of Cong. 982–983 (1811). Madison explained:
“The bill enacts into, and establishes by law, sundry
rules and proceedings relative purely to the organization and polity of the church incorporated, and
comprehending even the election and removal of the
Minister of the same; so that no change could be made
therein by the particular society, or by the general
church of which it is a member, and whose authority
it recognises.” Id., at 983 (emphasis added).
B
Given this understanding of the Religion Clauses—and
the absence of government employment regulation generally—it was some time before questions about government
interference with a church’s ability to select its own ministers came before the courts. This Court touched upon the
issue indirectly, however, in the context of disputes over
church property. Our decisions in that area confirm that
it is impermissible for the government to contradict a
church’s determination of who can act as its ministers.
In Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679 (1872), the Court considered a dispute between antislavery and proslavery
factions over who controlled the property of the Walnut
Street Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Kentucky. The
General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church had recognized the antislavery faction, and this Court—applying
not the Constitution but a “broad and sound view of the
relations of church and state under our system of laws”—
declined to question that determination. Id., at 727. We
explained that “whenever the questions of discipline, or of
faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have been
decided by the highest of [the] church judicatories to which
the matter has been carried, the legal tribunals must
accept such decisions as final, and as binding on them.”
