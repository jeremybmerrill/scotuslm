Opinion of the Court

C
Until today, we have not had occasion to consider whether this freedom of a religious organization to select its
ministers is implicated by a suit alleging discrimination in
employment. The Courts of Appeals, in contrast, have had
extensive experience with this issue. Since the passage of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e
et seq., and other employment discrimination laws, the
Courts of Appeals have uniformly recognized the existence
of a “ministerial exception,” grounded in the First Amendment, that precludes application of such legislation to
claims concerning the employment relationship between a
religious institution and its ministers.2
We agree that there is such a ministerial exception. The
members of a religious group put their faith in the hands
of their ministers. Requiring a church to accept or retain
an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to
do so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision. Such action interferes with the internal governance
of the church, depriving the church of control over the
selection of those who will personify its beliefs. By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free
Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group’s right to
shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.
