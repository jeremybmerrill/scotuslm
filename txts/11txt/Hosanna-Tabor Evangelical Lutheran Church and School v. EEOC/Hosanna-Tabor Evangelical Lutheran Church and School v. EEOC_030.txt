EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

COMMISSION ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[January 11, 2012]


JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE KAGAN joins,
concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion, but I write separately to
clarify my understanding of the significance of formal
ordination and designation as a “minister” in determining
whether an “employee”1 of a religious group falls within
the so-called “ministerial” exception. The term “minister”
is commonly used by many Protestant denominations to
refer to members of their clergy, but the term is rarely if
ever used in this way by Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, or Buddhists.2 In addition, the concept of ordination
as understood by most Christian churches and by Judaism
——————
1 It is unconventional to refer to many persons who clearly fall within the “ministerial” exception, such as Protestant ministers, Catholic
priests, and Jewish rabbis, as “employees,” but I use the term in the
sense in which it is used in the antidiscrimination laws that are often
implicated in cases involving the exception. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.
§2000e(f) (Title VII); §12111(4) (ADA); 29 U. S. C. §630(f) (ADEA);
§206(e) (Equal Pay Act and Fair Labor Standards Act).
2 See 9 Oxford English Dictionary 818 (2d ed. 1989) (def. 4(b)) (noting
the term “minister” used in various phrases “applied as general designations for a person officially charged with spiritual functions in the
Christian Church”); 9 Encyclopedia of Religion 6044–6045 (2d ed.
2005). See also, e.g., 9 New Catholic Encyclopedia 870 (1967).
