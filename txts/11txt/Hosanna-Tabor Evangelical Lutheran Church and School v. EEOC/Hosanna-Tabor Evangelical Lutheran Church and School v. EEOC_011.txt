HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH

AND SCHOOL v. EEOC 

Opinion of the Court 


remanded, directing the District Court to proceed to the
merits of Perich’s retaliation claims. The Court of Appeals
recognized the existence of a ministerial exception barring
certain employment discrimination claims against religious institutions—an exception “rooted in the First
Amendment’s guarantees of religious freedom.” 597 F. 3d
769, 777 (2010). The court concluded, however, that
Perich did not qualify as a “minister” under the exception,
noting in particular that her duties as a called teacher
were identical to her duties as a lay teacher. Id., at 778–
781. Judge White concurred. She viewed the question
whether Perich qualified as a minister to be closer than
did the majority, but agreed that the “fact that the duties
of the contract teachers are the same as the duties of the
called teachers is telling.” Id., at 782, 784.
We granted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).
II
The First Amendment provides, in part, that “Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” We have said
that these two Clauses “often exert conflicting pressures,”
Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 719 (2005), and that
there can be “internal tension . . . between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause,” Tilton v.
Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 677 (1971) (plurality opinion).
Not so here. Both Religion Clauses bar the government
from interfering with the decision of a religious group to
fire one of its ministers.
A
Controversy between church and state over religious
offices is hardly new. In 1215, the issue was addressed in
the very first clause of Magna Carta. There, King John
agreed that “the English church shall be free, and shall
have its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired.”
