HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN 

CHURCH AND SCHOOL, PETITIONER v.

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

COMMISSION ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[January 11, 2012]


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Certain employment discrimination laws authorize
employees who have been wrongfully terminated to sue
their employers for reinstatement and damages. The
question presented is whether the Establishment and Free
Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment bar such an
action when the employer is a religious group and the
employee is one of the group’s ministers.
I
