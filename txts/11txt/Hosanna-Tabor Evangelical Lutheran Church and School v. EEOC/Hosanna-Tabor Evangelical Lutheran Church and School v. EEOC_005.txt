Syllabus
firing Perich was pretextual misses the point of the ministerial exception. The purpose of the exception is not to safeguard a church’s
decision to fire a minister only when it is made for a religious reason.
The exception instead ensures that the authority to select and control
who will minister to the faithful is the church’s alone. Pp. 19–20.
(c) Today the Court holds only that the ministerial exception bars
an employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a minister,
challenging her church’s decision to fire her. The Court expresses no
view on whether the exception bars other types of suits. Pp. 20–21.
597 F. 3d 769, reversed.
ROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. THOMJ., filed a concurring opinion. ALITO, J., filed a concurring opinion,
in which KAGAN, J., joined.
