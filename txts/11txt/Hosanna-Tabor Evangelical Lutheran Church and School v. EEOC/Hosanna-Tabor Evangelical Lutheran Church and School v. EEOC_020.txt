Opinion of the Court

Native American Church were denied state unemployment
benefits after it was determined that they had been fired
from their jobs for ingesting peyote, a crime under Oregon
law. We held that this did not violate the Free Exercise
Clause, even though the peyote had been ingested for
sacramental purposes, because the “right of free exercise
does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply
with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the
ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that
his religion prescribes (or proscribes).” Id., at 879 (internal quotation marks omitted).
It is true that the ADA’s prohibition on retaliation, like
Oregon’s prohibition on peyote use, is a valid and neutral
law of general applicability. But a church’s selection of its
ministers is unlike an individual’s ingestion of peyote.
Smith involved government regulation of only outward
physical acts. The present case, in contrast, concerns
government interference with an internal church decision
that affects the faith and mission of the church itself. See
id., at 877 (distinguishing the government’s regulation of
“physical acts” from its “lend[ing] its power to one or
the other side in controversies over religious authority or
dogma”). The contention that Smith forecloses recognition
of a ministerial exception rooted in the Religion Clauses
has no merit.
III
Having concluded that there is a ministerial exception
grounded in the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment,
we consider whether the exception applies in this case.
We hold that it does.
Every Court of Appeals to have considered the question
has concluded that the ministerial exception is not limited
to the head of a religious congregation, and we agree. We
are reluctant, however, to adopt a rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister. It is enough
