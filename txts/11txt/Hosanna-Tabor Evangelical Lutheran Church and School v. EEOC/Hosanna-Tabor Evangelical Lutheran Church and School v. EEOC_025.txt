HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH
AND SCHOOL v. EEOC
Opinion of the Court

the ministerial exception.3
The EEOC and Perich suggest that Hosanna-Tabor’s
asserted religious reason for firing Perich—that she violated the Synod’s commitment to internal dispute resolution—was pretextual. That suggestion misses the point of
the ministerial exception. The purpose of the exception is
not to safeguard a church’s decision to fire a minister only
when it is made for a religious reason. The exception
instead ensures that the authority to select and control
who will minister to the faithful—a matter “strictly ecclesiastical,” Kedroff, 344 U. S., at 119—is the church’s
alone.4
IV
The EEOC and Perich foresee a parade of horribles that
will follow our recognition of a ministerial exception to
employment discrimination suits. According to the EEOC
and Perich, such an exception could protect religious
organizations from liability for retaliating against employ——————
3 Perich does not dispute that if the ministerial exception bars her
retaliation claim under the ADA, it also bars her retaliation claim
under Michigan law.
4 A conflict has arisen in the Courts of Appeals over whether the ministerial exception is a jurisdictional bar or a defense on the merits.
Compare Hollins, 474 F. 3d, at 225 (treating the exception as jurisdictional); and Tomic v. Catholic Diocese of Peoria, 442 F. 3d 1036, 1038–
1039 (CA7 2006) (same), with Petruska, 462 F. 3d, at 302 (treating the
exception as an affirmative defense); Bryce, 289 F. 3d, at 654 (same);
Bollard v. California Province of Soc. of Jesus, 196 F. 3d 940, 951 (CA9
1999) (same); and Natal, 878 F. 2d, at 1576 (same). We conclude that
the exception operates as an affirmative defense to an otherwise
cognizable claim, not a jurisdictional bar. That is because the issue
presented by the exception is “whether the allegations the plaintiff
makes entitle him to relief,” not whether the court has “power to hear
[the] case.” Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___,
___ (2010) (slip op., at 4–5) (internal quotation marks omitted). District
courts have power to consider ADA claims in cases of this sort, and to
decide whether the claim can proceed or is instead barred by the
ministerial exception.
