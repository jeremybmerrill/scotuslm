Opinion of the Court

The EEOC brought suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been fired in retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich intervened in the
litigation, claiming unlawful retaliation under both the
ADA and the Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights
Act, Mich. Comp. Laws §37.1602(a) (1979). The EEOC
and Perich sought Perich’s reinstatement to her former
position (or frontpay in lieu thereof), along with backpay,
compensatory and punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and
other injunctive relief.
Hosanna-Tabor moved for summary judgment. Invoking what is known as the “ministerial exception,” the
Church argued that the suit was barred by the First
Amendment because the claims at issue concerned the
employment relationship between a religious institution
and one of its ministers. According to the Church, Perich
was a minister, and she had been fired for a religious
reason—namely, that her threat to sue the Church violated the Synod’s belief that Christians should resolve their
disputes internally.
The District Court agreed that the suit was barred by
the ministerial exception and granted summary judgment
in Hosanna-Tabor’s favor. The court explained that
“Hosanna-Tabor treated Perich like a minister and held her
out to the world as such long before this litigation began,”
and that the “facts surrounding Perich’s employment in a
religious school with a sectarian mission” supported the
Church’s characterization. 582 F. Supp. 2d, at 891–892.
In light of that determination, the court concluded that it
could “inquire no further into her claims of retaliation.”
Id., at 892.
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated and
—————— 

§12203(a), appears in a different subchapter—subchapter IV. The 

EEOC and Perich contend, and Hosanna-Tabor does not dispute, that 

these defenses therefore do not apply to retaliation claims.
