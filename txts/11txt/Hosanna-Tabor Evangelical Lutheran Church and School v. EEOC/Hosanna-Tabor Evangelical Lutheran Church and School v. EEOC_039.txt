HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH
AND SCHOOL v. EEOC
ALITO, J., concurring

Roman Catholic Church’s insistence on clerical celibacy
may be much better known than the Lutheran Church’s
doctrine of internal dispute resolution, but popular familiarity with a religious doctrine cannot be the determinative
factor.
What matters in the present case is that Hosanna-Tabor
believes that the religious function that respondent performed made it essential that she abide by the doctrine of
internal dispute resolution; and the civil courts are in no
position to second-guess that assessment. This conclusion
rests not on respondent’s ordination status or her formal
title, but rather on her functional status as the type of
employee that a church must be free to appoint or dismiss
in order to exercise the religious liberty that the First
Amendment guarantees.
