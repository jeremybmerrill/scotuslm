HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH
AND SCHOOL v. EEOC
THOMAS, J., concurring

er its ministerial designation will be rejected, and a corresponding fear of liability, may cause a religious group to
conform its beliefs and practices regarding “ministers” to
the prevailing secular understanding. See Corporation of
Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 336 (1987) (“[I]t is a significant burden on a religious organization to require it, on
pain of substantial liability, to predict which of its activities a secular court will consider religious. The line is
hardly a bright one, and an organization might understandably be concerned that a judge would not understand
its religious tenets and sense of mission. Fear of potential
liability might affect the way an organization carried out
what it understood to be its religious mission” (footnote
omitted)). These are certainly dangers that the First
Amendment was designed to guard against.
The Court thoroughly sets forth the facts that lead to its
conclusion that Cheryl Perich was one of Hosanna-Tabor’s
ministers, and I agree that these facts amply demonstrate
Perich’s ministerial role. But the evidence demonstrates
that Hosanna-Tabor sincerely considered Perich a minister. That would be sufficient for me to conclude that Perich’s suit is properly barred by the ministerial exception.
