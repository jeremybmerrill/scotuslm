HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH

AND SCHOOL v. EEOC 

ALITO, J., concurring


trum, some faiths consider the ministry to consist of all or
a very large percentage of their members.4 Perhaps this
explains why, although every circuit to consider the issue
has recognized the “ministerial” exception, no circuit has
made ordination status or formal title determinative of the
exception’s applicability.
The Fourth Circuit was the first to use the term “ministerial exception,” but in doing so it took pains to clarify
that the label was a mere shorthand. See Rayburn v.
General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 772 F. 2d
1164, 1168 (1985) (noting that the exception’s applicability
“does not depend upon ordination but upon the function of
the position”). The Fourth Circuit traced the exception
back to McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F. 2d 553 (CA5
1972), which invoked the Religion Clauses to bar a Title
VII sex-discrimination suit brought by a woman who was
described by the court as a Salvation Army “minister,” id.,
at 554, although her actual title was “officer.” See
McClure v. Salvation Army, 323 F. Supp. 1100, 1101 (ND
Ga. 1971). A decade after McClure, the Fifth Circuit made
clear that formal ordination was not necessary for the
“ministerial” exception to apply. The court held that the
members of the faculty at a Baptist seminary were covered
by the exception because of their religious function in
conveying church doctrine, even though some of them
were not ordained ministers. See EEOC v. Southwestern
Baptist Theological Seminary, 651 F. 2d 277 (1981).
The functional consensus has held up over time, with
the D. C. Circuit recognizing that “[t]he ministerial exception has not been limited to members of the clergy.”

instance, Jehovah’s Witnesses consider all baptized disciples to
be ministers. See The Watchtower, Who Are God’s Ministers Today?

heavenly and earthly—are ministers”).
