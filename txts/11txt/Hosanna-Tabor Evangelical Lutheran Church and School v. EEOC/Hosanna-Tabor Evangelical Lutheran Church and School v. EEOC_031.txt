and some other religions. Because virtually every religion
in the world is represented in the population of the United
States, it would be a mistake if the term “minister” or the
concept of ordination were viewed as central to the important issue of religious autonomy that is presented in

messenger or teacher of its faith. If a religious group
believes that the ability of such an employee to perform
these key functions has been compromised, then the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom protects the
group’s right to remove the employee from his or her
position.
