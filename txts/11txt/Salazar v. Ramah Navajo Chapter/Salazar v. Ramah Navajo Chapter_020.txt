Opinion of the Court

tee reports and other legislative history as to how the
funds should or are expected to be spent do not establish
any legal requirements on the agency.” Ibid. (internal
quotation marks omitted). An agency’s discretion to spend
appropriated funds is cabined only by the “text of the
appropriation,” not by Congress’ expectations of how the
funds will be spent, as might be reflected by legislative
history. Int’l Union, UAW, 746 F. 2d, at 860–861. That
principle also reflects the same ideas underlying Ferris. If
a contractor’s right to payment varied based on a future
court’s uncertain interpretation of legislative history, it
would increase the Government’s cost of contracting. Cf.
Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 644. That long-run expense
would likely far exceed whatever money might be saved in
any individual case.
IV
As the Government points out, the state of affairs resulting in this case is the product of two congressional
decisions which the BIA has found difficult to reconcile.
On the one hand, Congress obligated the Secretary to
accept every qualifying ISDA contract, which includes a
promise of “full” funding for all contract support costs. On
the other, Congress appropriated insufficient funds to pay
in full each tribal contractor. The Government’s frustration is understandable, but the dilemma’s resolution is the
responsibility of Congress.
Congress is not short of options. For instance, it could
reduce the Government’s financial obligation by amending
ISDA to remove the statutory mandate compelling the BIA
to enter into self-determination contracts, or by giving the
BIA flexibility to pay less than the full amount of contract
support costs. It could also pass a moratorium on the
formation of new self-determination contracts, as it has
done before. See §328, 112 Stat. 2681–291 to 292. Or
Congress could elect to make line-item appropriations,
