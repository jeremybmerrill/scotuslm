Opinion of the Court

sum from which “not to exceed” between $91 and $125
million was allocated for contract support costs, an
amount that exceeded the sum due any tribal contractor.
Within those constraints, the ability to direct those funds
was “ ‘committed to agency discretion by law.’ ” Lincoln v.
Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 193 (1993) (quoting 5 U. S. C.
§701(a)(2)). Nothing, for instance, prevented the BIA

contract support costs rather than other tribes’, whether

See §450j–1(b) (“[T]he Secretary is not required to reduce
funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe
to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under this [Act]”). The upshot is that the
funds appropriated by Congress were legally available to
pay any individual tribal contractor in full. See 1 GAO
Redbook, p. 4–6 (3d ed. 2004).
The Government’s contractual promise to pay each
tribal contractor the “full amount of funds to which the
contractor [was] entitled,” §450j–1(g), was therefore binding. We have expressly rejected the Government’s argument that “the tribe should bear the risk that a total
