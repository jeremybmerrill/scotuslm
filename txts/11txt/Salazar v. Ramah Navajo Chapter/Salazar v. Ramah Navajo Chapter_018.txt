Opinion of the Court

expenditures for contract support costs.8 That contention
is puzzling. Congress expressly provided in ISDA that
tribal contractors were entitled to sue for “money damages” under the Contract Disputes Act upon the Government’s failure to pay, 25 U. S. C. §§450m–1(a), (d), and
judgments against the Government under that Act are
payable from the Judgment Fund, 41 U. S. C. §7108(a).9
Indeed, we cited the Contract Disputes Act, Judgment
Fund, and Anti-Deficiency Act in Cherokee Nation, explaining that if the Government commits its appropriations in a manner that leaves contractual obligations
unfulfilled, “the contractor [is] free to pursue appropriate
legal remedies arising because the Government broke its
contractual promise.” 543 U. S., at 642.
Third, the Government invokes cases in which courts
have rejected contractors’ attempts to recover for amounts
beyond the maximum appropriated by Congress for a
particular purpose. See, e.g., Sutton v. United States, 256
U. S. 575 (1921). In Sutton, for instance, Congress made a
specific line-item appropriation of $23,000 for the completion of a particular project. Id., at 577. We held that the
sole contractor engaged to complete that project could not
recover more than that amount for his work.
The Ferris and Sutton lines of cases are distinguishable,

8 The Judgment Fund is a “permanent, indefinite appropriation” enacted by Congress to pay final judgments against the United States
when, inter alia, “[p]ayment may not legally be made from any other
source of funds.” 31 CFR §256.1 (2011).
9 For that reason, the Government’s reliance on Office of Personnel
Management v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414 (1990), is misplaced. In
Richmond, we held that the Appropriations Clause does not permit
plaintiffs to recover money for Government-caused injuries for which
Congress “appropriated no money.” Id., at 424. Richmond, however,
indicated that the Appropriations Clause is no bar to recovery in a case
like this one, in which “the express terms of a specific statute” establish
“a substantive right to compensation” from the Judgment Fund. Id.,
at 432.
