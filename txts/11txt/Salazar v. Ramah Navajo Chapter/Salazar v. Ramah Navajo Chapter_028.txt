ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

makes clear that funds allocated to one contractor are not
available to another. Thus, the principle in Ferris does not
apply.
It is true, as the Court notes, ante, at 10, that each of
the Tribes’ contracts provides that the Act and the contract “shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the
Contractor.” App. 203; see also §450l(c) (Model Agreement
§1(a)(2)). But a provision can be construed “liberally” as
opposed to “strictly” only when there is some ambiguity to
construe. And here there is none. Congress spoke clearly
when it said that the provision of funds was “subject to the
availability of appropriations,” that spending on contract
support costs was “not to exceed” a specific amount, and
that the Secretary was “not required” to make funds allocated for one tribe’s costs “available” to another. The
unambiguous meaning of these provisions is that when
the Secretary has allocated the maximum amount of funds
appropriated each fiscal year for contract support costs,
there are no other appropriations “available” to pay any
remaining costs.
This is hardly a typical government contracts case.
Many government contracts contain a “subject to the
availability of appropriations” clause, and many appropriations statutes contain “not to exceed” language. But this
case involves not only those provisions but a third, relieving the Secretary of any obligation to make funds “available” to one contractor by reducing payments to others.
Such provisions will not always appear together, but when
they do, we must give them effect. Doing so here, I would
hold that the Tribes are not entitled to payment of their
contract support costs in full, and I would reverse the
contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit.
