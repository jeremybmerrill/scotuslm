SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER
Opinion of the Court

allocating funds to cover tribes’ contract support costs on
a contractor-by-contractor basis. On the other hand, Congress could appropriate sufficient funds to the BIA to meet
the tribes’ total contract support cost needs. Indeed, there
is some evidence that Congress may do just that. See
H. R. Rep. No. 112–151, p. 42 (2011) (“The Committee
believes that the Bureau should pay all contract support
costs for which it has contractually agreed and directs the
Bureau to include the full cost of the contract support
obligations in its fiscal year 2013 budget submission”).
The desirability of these options is not for us to say. We
make clear only that Congress has ample means at hand
to resolve the situation underlying the Tribes’ suit. Any
one of the options above could also promote transparency
about the Government’s fiscal obligations with respect to
ISDA’s directive that contract support costs be paid in
full. For the period in question, however, it is the Government—not the Tribes—that must bear the consequences of
Congress’ decision to mandate that the Government enter
into binding contracts for which its appropriation was
sufficient to pay any individual tribal contractor, but
“insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.”
Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 637.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
