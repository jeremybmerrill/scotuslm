Opinion of the Court

rected that each tribal self-determination contract “shall
. . . contain, or incorporate [it] by reference.” §450l(a)(1).
The model contract specifies that “ ‘[s]ubject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall make available to the Contractor the total amount specified in the
annual funding agreement’ ” between the Secretary and
the tribe. §450l(c), (model agreement §1(b)(4)). That
amount “ ‘shall not be less than the applicable amount
determined pursuant to [§450j–1(a)],’ ” which includes
contract support costs. Ibid.; §450j–1(a)(2). The contract
indicates that “ ‘[e]ach provision of [ISDA] and each provision of this Contract shall be liberally construed for the
benefit of the Contractor . . . .’ ” §450l(c), (model agreement §1(a)(2)). Finally, the Act makes clear that if
the Government fails to pay the amount contracted for,
then tribal contractors are entitled to pursue “money damages” in accordance with the Contract Disputes Act.
§450m–1(a).
B
During Fiscal Years (FYs) 1994 to 2001, respondent
Tribes contracted with the Secretary of the Interior to
provide services such as law enforcement, environmental
protection, and agricultural assistance. The Tribes fully
performed. During each FY, Congress appropriated a
total amount to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) “for the
operation of Indian programs.” See, e.g., Department of
the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,
2000, 113 Stat. 1501A–148. Of that sum, Congress provided that “not to exceed [a particular amount] shall be
available for payments to tribes and tribal organizations for contract support costs” under ISDA. E.g., ibid.
Thus, in FY 2000, for example, Congress appropriated
$1,670,444,000 to the BIA, of which “not to exceed
$120,229,000” was allocated for contract support costs.
