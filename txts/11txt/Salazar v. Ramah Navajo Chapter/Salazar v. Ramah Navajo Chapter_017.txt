SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER
Opinion of the Court

Government, and the Tribes do not share the dissent’s
reading of §450j–1(b) is strong evidence that its interpretation is not, as it claims, “unambiguous[ly]” correct.
Post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Because ISDA is construed in favor of tribes, that conclusion is fatal to the
dissent.
C
The remaining counterarguments are unpersuasive.
First, the Government suggests that today’s holding could
cause the Secretary to violate the Anti-Deficiency Act,
which prevents federal officers from “mak[ing] or authoriz[ing] an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount
available in an appropriation.” 31 U. S. C. §1341(a)(1)(A).
But a predecessor version of that Act was in place when
Ferris and Dougherty were decided, see GAO Redbook, pp.
6–9 to 6–10, and the Government did not prevail there.
As Dougherty explained, the Anti-Deficiency Act’s requirements “apply to the official, but they do not affect the
rights in this court of the citizen honestly contracting with
the Government.” 18 Ct. Cl., at 503; see also Ferris, 27 Ct.
Cl., at 546 (“An appropriation per se merely imposes limitations upon the Government’s own agents; . . . but its
insufficiency does not pay the Government’s debts, nor
cancel its obligations”).7
Second, the Government argues that Congress could not
have intended for respondents to recover from the Judgment Fund, 31 U. S. C. §1304, because that would allow
the Tribes to circumvent Congress’ intent to cap total
——————
7 We have some doubt whether a Government employee would violate
the Anti-Deficiency Act by obeying an express statutory command to
enter a contract, as was the case here. But we need not decide the
question, for this case concerns only the contractual rights of tribal
contractors, not the consequences of entering into such contracts for
agency employees.
