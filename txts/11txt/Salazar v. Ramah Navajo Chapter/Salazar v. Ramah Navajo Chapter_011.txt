SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER
Opinion of the Court

an agency overcommits its funds such that it cannot fulfill
its contractual commitments, even the Government has
acknowledged that “[t]he risk of over-obligation may be
found to fall on the agency,” not the contractor. Brief for
Federal Parties in Cherokee Nation v. Leavitt, O. T. 2004,
No. 02–1472 et al., p. 24 (hereinafter Brief for Federal
Parties).
The rule likewise furthers “the Government’s own longrun interest as a reliable contracting partner in the myriad workaday transaction of its agencies.” United States v.
Winstar Corp., 518 U. S. 839, 883 (1996) (plurality opinion). If the Government could be trusted to fulfill its
promise to pay only when more pressing fiscal needs did
not arise, would-be contractors would bargain warily—if
at all—and only at a premium large enough to account for
the risk of nonpayment. See, e.g., Logue, Tax Transitions,
Opportunistic Retroactivity, and the Benefits of Government Precommitment, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 1129, 1146 (1996).
In short, contracting would become more cumbersome and
expensive for the Government, and willing partners more
scarce.

The principles underlying Cherokee Nation and Ferris
dictate the result in this case. Once “Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the
contracts at issue, the Government normally cannot back
out of a promise to pay on grounds of ‘insufficient appropriations,’ even if the contract uses language such as
‘subject to the availability of appropriations,’ and even if
an agency’s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to
pay all the contracts the agency has made.” Cherokee
Nation, 543 U. S., at 637; see also id., at 638 (“[T]he Government denies none of this”).
That condition is satisfied here. In each FY between
1994 and 2001, Congress appropriated to the BIA a lump-
