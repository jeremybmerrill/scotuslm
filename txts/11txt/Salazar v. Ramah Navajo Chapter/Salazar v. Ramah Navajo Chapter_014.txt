Opinion of the Court

III

A

The Government primarily seeks to distinguish this case
from Cherokee Nation and Ferris on the ground that Congress here appropriated “not to exceed” a given amount for
contract support costs, thereby imposing an express cap
on the total funds available. See Brief for Petitioners 26,
49. The Government argues, on this basis, that Ferris and
Cherokee Nation involved “contracts made against the backdrop of unrestricted, lump-sum appropriations,” while this
case does not. See Brief for Petitioners 49, 26.
That premise, however, is inaccurate. In Ferris, Congress appropriated “[f]or improving Delaware River below
Bridesburg, Pennsylvania, forty-five thousand dollars.” 20
Stat. 364. As explained in the Government’s own appropriations law handbook, the “not to exceed” language at
issue in this case has an identical meaning to the quoted
language in Ferris. See GAO Redbook, p. 6–5 (“Words like
‘not to exceed’ are not the only way to establish a maximum limitation. If the appropriation includes a specific
amount for a particular object (such as ‘For Cuban cigars,
$100’), then the appropriation is a maximum which may
not be exceeded”). The appropriation in Cherokee Nation
took a similar form. See, e.g., 108 Stat. 2527–2528 (“For
expenses necessary to carry out . . . ISDA [and certain
other enumerated Acts], $1,713,052,000”). There is no basis, therefore, for distinguishing the class of appropriation in those cases from this one. In each case, the agency
remained free to allocate funds among multiple contractors, so long as the contracts served the purpose Congress
identified.
This result does not leave the “not to exceed” language
in Congress’ appropriation without legal effect. To the
contrary, it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming
other funds to pay contract support costs—thereby protecting funds that Congress envisioned for other BIA
