SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

This condition is repeated in the Tribes’ contracts with the
Government. App. 206; see also §450l(c) (Model Agreement §1(b)(4)). The question in this case is whether appropriations were “available” during fiscal years 1994
through 2001 to pay all the contract support costs incurred
by the Tribes. Only if appropriations were “available”
may the Tribes hold the Government liable for the unpaid
amounts.
Congress restricted the amount of funds “available” to
pay the Tribes’ contract support costs in two ways. First,
in each annual appropriations statute for the Department of the Interior from fiscal year 1994 to 2001, Congress provided that spending on contract support costs for
all tribes was “not to exceed” a certain amount. The
fiscal year 1995 appropriations statute is representative.
It provided: “For operation of Indian programs . . . ,
$1,526,778,000, . . . of which not to exceed $95,823,000
shall be for payments to tribes and tribal organizations for
contract support costs . . . .” 108 Stat. 2510–2511. As the
Court acknowledges, ante, at 11–12, the phrase “not to
exceed” has a settled meaning in federal appropriations
law. By use of the phrase, Congress imposed a cap on the
total funds available for contract support costs in each
fiscal year. See 2 General Accounting Office, Principles of
Federal Appropriations Law, p. 6–8 (2d ed. 1992) (hereinafter GAO Redbook) (“[T]he most effective way to establish
a maximum . . . earmark is by the words ‘not to exceed’ or
‘not more than’ ”).
Second, in §450j–1(b) itself—in the very same sentence
that conditions funding on the “availability of appropriations”—Congress provided that “the Secretary [of the
Interior] is not required to reduce funding for programs,
projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under [the Act].”
An agency may be required to shift funds from one object
to another, within statutory limits, when doing so is
