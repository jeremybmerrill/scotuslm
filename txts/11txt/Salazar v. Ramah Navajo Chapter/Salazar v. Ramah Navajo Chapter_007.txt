SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER
Opinion of the Court

During each relevant FY, Congress appropriated sufficient funds to pay in full any individual tribal contractor’s
contract support costs. Congress did not, however, appropriate sufficient funds to cover the contract support costs
due all tribal contractors collectively. Between FY 1994
and 2001, appropriations covered only between 77% and
92% of tribes’ aggregate contract support costs. The extent of the shortfall was not revealed until each fiscal year
was well underway, at which point a tribe’s performance
of its contractual obligations was largely complete. See
644 F. 3d 1054, 1061 (CA10 2011). Lacking funds to pay
each contractor in full, the Secretary paid tribes’ contract
support costs on a uniform, pro rata basis. Tribes responded to these shortfalls by reducing ISDA services to
tribal members, diverting tribal resources from non-ISDA
programs, and forgoing opportunities to contract in furtherance of Congress’ self-determination objective. GAO,

Respondent Tribes sued for breach of contract pursuant
to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U. S. C. §§601–613, alleging that the Government failed to pay the full amount of
contract support costs due from FY 1994 through 2001,
as required by ISDA and their contracts. The United
States District Court for the District of New Mexico granted
summary judgment for the Government. A divided panel
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed. The court reasoned that Congress made
sufficient appropriations “legally available” to fund any
individual tribal contractor’s contract support costs, and
that the Government’s contractual commitment was therefore binding. 644 F. 3d, at 1063–1065. In such cases, the
Court of Appeals held that the Government is liable to
each contractor for the full contract amount. Judge Hartz
dissented, contending that Congress intended to set a
