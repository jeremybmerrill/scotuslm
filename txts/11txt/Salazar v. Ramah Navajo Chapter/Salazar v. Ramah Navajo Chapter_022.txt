CHAPTER ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

[June 18, 2012] 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE
GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE ALITO join,
dissenting.
Today the Court concludes that the Federal Government
must pay the full amount of contract support costs incurred by the respondent Tribes, regardless of whether
there are any appropriated funds left for that purpose.
This despite the facts that payment of such costs is
“subject to the availability of appropriations,” a condition
expressly set forth in both the statute and the contracts
providing for such payment, 25 U. S. C. §§450j–1(b),
450l(c) (Model Agreement §1(b)(4)); that payment of the
costs for all tribes is “not to exceed” a set amount, e.g., 108
Stat. 2511, an amount that would be exceeded here; and
that the Secretary “is not required to reduce funding for
programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make
funds available to another tribe,” §450j–1(b). Because the
Court’s conclusion cannot be squared with these unambiguous restrictions on the payment of contract support costs,
I respectfully dissent.
The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act provides: “Notwithstanding any other provision
in [the Act], the provision of funds under this [Act] is
subject to the availability of appropriations . . . .” Ibid.
