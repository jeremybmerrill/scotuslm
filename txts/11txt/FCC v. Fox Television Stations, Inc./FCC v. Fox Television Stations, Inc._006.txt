FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

this case. The Court need not repeat all that history, but
some preliminary discussion is necessary to understand
the constitutional issue the case now presents.
A
Title 18 U. S. C. §1464 provides that “[w]hoever utters
any obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of
radio communication shall be fined . . . or imprisoned not
more than two years, or both.” The Federal Communi­
cations Commission (Commission) has been instructed by
Congress to enforce §1464 between the hours of 6 a.m.
and 10 p.m., see Public Telecommunications Act of 1992,
§15(a), 106 Stat. 954, note following 47 U. S. C. §303,
p. 113 (Broadcasting of Indecent Programming). And the
Commission has applied its regulations to radio and tele­
vision broadcasters alike, see Fox I, supra, at 505–506;
see also 47 CFR §73.3999 (2010) (Commission regulation
prohibiting the broadcast of any obscene material or any
indecent material between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.). Although
the Commission has had the authority to regulate inde­
cent broadcasts under §1464 since 1948 (and its prede­
cessor commission, the Federal Radio Commission, since
1927), it did not begin to enforce §1464 until the 1970’s.

Current Controversy over Broadcast Indecency, 63 Fed.

This Court first reviewed the Commission’s indecency
policy in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978).
In Pacifica, the Commission determined that George
Carlin’s “Filthy Words” monologue was indecent. It con­
tained “ ‘language that describes, in terms patently offen­
sive as measured by contemporary community standards
for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities
and organs, at times of the day when there is a reasonable
risk that children may be in the audience.’ ” Id., at 732
(quoting 56 F. C. C. 2d 94, 98 (1975)). This Court upheld
