FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, ET AL.,
PETITIONERS v. ABC, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
[June 21, 2012]

JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in the judgment.
In my view, the Court’s decision in FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978), was wrong when it
issued. Time, technological advances, and the Commission’s untenable rulings in the cases now before the Court
show why Pacifica bears reconsideration. Cf. FCC v. Fox
Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 532–535 (2009)
(THOMAS, J., concurring).
