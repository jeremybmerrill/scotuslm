Opinion of the Court

observation is hardly surprising given that the challenged
orders, which are contained in the permanent Commission
record, describe in strongly disapproving terms the inde­
cent material broadcast by Fox, see, e.g., 21 FCC Rcd., at
13310–13311, ¶30 (noting the “explicit, graphic, vulgar,
and shocking nature of Ms. Richie’s comments”), and Fox’s
efforts to protect children from being exposed to it, see id.,
at 13311, ¶33 (finding Fox had failed to exercise “ ‘rea­
sonable judgment, responsibility, and sensitivity to the
public’s needs and tastes to avoid [a] patently offensive
broadcas[t]’ ”). Commission sanctions on broadcasters for
indecent material are widely publicized. See, e.g., F. C. C.
Fines Fox, N. Y. Times, Feb. 26, 2008, p. E2; F. C. C. Plans
Record Fine for CBS, Washington Post, Sept. 24, 2004,
p. E1. The challenged orders could have an adverse impact
on Fox’s reputation that audiences and advertisers alike
are entitled to take into account.
With respect to ABC, the Government with good reason
does not argue no sanction was imposed. The fine against
ABC and its network affiliates for the seven seconds of
nudity was nearly $1.24 million. See Brief for Respondent
ABC, Inc., et al. 7 (hereinafter ABC Brief). The Govern­
ment argues instead that ABC had notice that the scene in
NYPD Blue would be considered indecent in light of a
1960 decision where the Commission declared that the
“televising of nudes might well raise a serious question of
programming contrary to 18 U. S. C. §1464.” Brief for
Petitioners 32 (quoting Enbanc Programming Inquiry, 44
FCC 2303, 2307 (internal quotation marks omitted)). This
argument does not prevail. An isolated and ambiguous
statement from a 1960 Commission decision does not
suffice for the fair notice required when the Government
intends to impose over a $1 million fine for allegedly im­
permissible speech. The Commission, furthermore, had
released decisions before sanctioning ABC that declined to
find isolated and brief moments of nudity actionably inde­
