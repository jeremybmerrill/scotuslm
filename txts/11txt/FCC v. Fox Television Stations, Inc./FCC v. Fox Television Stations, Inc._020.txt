FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

cent. See, e.g., In re Application of WGBH, 69 F. C. C.
2d, at 1251, 1255 (declining to find broadcasts containing nudity to be indecent and emphasizing the difference
between repeated and isolated expletives); In re WPBN/
WTOM License Subsidiary, Inc., 15 FCC Rcd. 1838,
1840 (2000) (finding full frontal nudity in Schindler’s List not indecent). This is not to say, of course, that
a graphic scene from Schindler’s List involving nude
concentration camp prisoners is the same as the shower
scene from NYPD Blue. It does show, however, that the
Government can point to nothing that would have given
ABC affirmative notice that its broadcast would be consid­
ered actionably indecent. It is likewise not sufficient for
the Commission to assert, as it did in its order, that
though “the depiction [of nudity] here is not as lengthy or
repeated” as in some cases, the shower scene nonetheless
“does contain more shots or lengthier depictions of nudity”
than in other broadcasts found not indecent. 23 FCC Rcd.,
at 3153. This broad language fails to demonstrate that
ABC had fair notice that its broadcast could be found
indecent. In fact, a Commission ruling prior to the airing
of the NYPD Blue episode had deemed 30 seconds of nude
buttocks “very brief ” and not actionably indecent in the
context of the broadcast. See Letter from Norman Gold­
stein to David Molina, FCC File No. 97110028 (May 26,
1999), in App. to Brief for Respondent ABC Television
Affiliates Assn. et al. 1a; see also Letter from Edythe Wise
to Susan Cavin, FCC File No. 91100738 (Aug. 13, 1992),
id., at 18a, 19a. In light of this record of agency decisions,
and the absence of any notice in the 2001 Guidance that
seven seconds of nude buttocks would be found indecent,
ABC lacked constitutionally sufficient notice prior to being
sanctioned.
The Commission failed to give Fox or ABC fair notice
prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives
and momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent.
