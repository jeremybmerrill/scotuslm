Opinion of the Court

the Commission’s ruling. The broadcaster’s statutory
challenge was rejected. The Court held the Commission
was not engaged in impermissible censorship within the
meaning of 47 U. S. C. §326 (1976 ed.), see 438 U. S., at
735–739, and that §1464’s definition of indecency was not
confined to speech with an appeal to the prurient interest,
see id., at 738–741. Finding no First Amendment viola­

under which regulations of broadcasters are assessed. It
observed that “broadcast media have established a uniquely
pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans,” id., at
748, and that “broadcasting is uniquely accessible to chil­

a radio broadcast, as distinguished from the verbal shock
treatment administered by respondent here”).
From 1978 to 1987, the Commission did not go beyond
the narrow circumstances of Pacifica and brought no
indecency enforcement actions. See In re Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 3 FCC Rcd. 930 (1987); see also In re Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation, 69 F. C. C. 2d 1250,
1254 (1978) (Commission declaring it “intend[s] strictly to
observe the narrowness of the Pacifica holding”). Recog­
nizing that Pacifica provided “no general prerogative to
intervene in any case where words similar or identical to
those in Pacifica are broadcast over a licensed radio or
television station,” the Commission distinguished between
