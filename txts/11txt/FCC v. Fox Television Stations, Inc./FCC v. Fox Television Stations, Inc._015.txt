Opinion of the Court

order finding the display of the woman’s nude buttocks
in NYPD Blue was actionably indecent. See In re Complaints Against Various Television Licensees Concerning
Their February 24, 2003 Broadcast of the Program “NYPD
Blue”, 23 FCC Rcd. 3147 (2008). The Commission deter­
mined that, regardless of medical definitions, displays of
buttocks fell within the category of displays of sexual or
excretory organs because the depiction was “widely associ­
ated with sexual arousal and closely associated by most
people with excretory activities.” Id., at 3150. The scene
was deemed patently offensive as measured by contempo­
rary community standards, ibid.; and the Commission
determined that “[t]he female actor’s nudity is presented
in a manner that clearly panders to and titillates the
audience,” id., at 3153. Unlike in the Fox case, the Com­
mission imposed a forfeiture of $27,500 on each of the 45
ABC-affiliated stations that aired the indecent episode. In
a summary order the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit vacated the forfeiture order, determin­
ing that it was bound by its Fox decision striking down the
entirety of the Commission’s indecency policy. See 404
Fed. Appx., at 533.
The Government sought review of both judgments, see
Brief for Petitioners 1, and this Court granted certiorari,
564 U. S. ____ (2011). These are the cases before us.

A fundamental principle in our legal system is that laws
which regulate persons or entities must give fair notice of
conduct that is forbidden or required. See Connally v.
General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 391 (1926) (“[A] statute
which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in
terms so vague that men of common intelligence must
necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its appli­
cation, violates the first essential of due process of law”);
Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 162 (1972)
