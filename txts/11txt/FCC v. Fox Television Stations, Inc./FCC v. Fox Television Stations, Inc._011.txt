Opinion of the Court

(2004) (Golden Globes Order). Reversing a decision by its
enforcement bureau, the Commission found the use of
the F-word actionably indecent. Id., at 4975–4976. The
Commission held that the word was “one of the most vul­

The Commission held “the mere fact that specific words or
phrases are not sustained or repeated does not mandate a
finding that material that is otherwise patently offensive
to the broadcast medium is not indecent.” Id., at 4980; see
also id., at 4982 (“Just as the Court [in Pacifica] held
that . . . the George Carlin routine ‘could have enlarged
a child’s vocabulary in an instant,’ we believe that even
isolated broadcasts of the ‘F-Word’ in situations such as
that here could do so as well”).

Even though the incidents at issue in these cases took
place before the Golden Globes Order, the Commission

for a voluntary remand so that it could respond to the
