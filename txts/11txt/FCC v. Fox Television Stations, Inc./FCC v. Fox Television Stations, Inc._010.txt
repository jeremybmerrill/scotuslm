FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

offensive)).
B
It was against this regulatory background that the three
incidents of alleged indecency at issue here took place.
First, in the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, broadcast by
respondent Fox Television Stations, Inc., the singer Cher
exclaimed during an unscripted acceptance speech: “I’ve
also had my critics for the last 40 years saying that I was
on my way out every year. Right. So f *** ‘em.” 613 F. 3d,
at 323. Second, Fox broadcast the Billboard Music Awards
again in 2003. There, a person named Nicole Richie
made the following unscripted remark while presenting an
award: “Have you ever tried to get cow s*** out of a Prada
purse? It’s not so f ***ing simple.” Ibid. The third in­
cident involved an episode of NYPD Blue, a regular tele­
vision show broadcast by respondent ABC Television
Network. The episode broadcast on February 25, 2003,
showed the nude buttocks of an adult female character for
approximately seven seconds and for a moment the side
of her breast. During the scene, in which the character
was preparing to take a shower, a child portraying her boy­
friend’s son entered the bathroom. A moment of awk­
wardness followed. 404 Fed. Appx. 530, 533–534 (CA2
2011). The Commission received indecency complaints
about all three broadcasts. See Fox I, 556 U. S., at 510;
404 Fed. Appx., at 534.
After these incidents, but before the Commission issued
Notices of Apparent Liability to Fox and ABC, the Com­
mission issued a decision sanctioning NBC for a comment
made by the singer Bono during the 2003 Golden Globe
Awards. Upon winning the award for Best Original Song,
Bono exclaimed: “ ‘This is really, really, f ***ing brilliant.
Really, really great.’ ” In re Complaints Against Various
Broadcast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the “Golden
Globe Awards” Program, 19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4976, n. 4
