Opinion of the Court

Policies Regarding Broadcast Indecency, 16 FCC Rcd.
7999. In that document the Commission restated that for
material to be indecent it must depict sexual or excretory
organs or activities and be patently offensive as measured
by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium. Id., at 8002. Describing the framework of what
it considered patently offensive, the Commission explained
that three factors had proved significant:
“(1) [T]he explicitness or graphic nature of the de­
scription or depiction of sexual or excretory organs or
activities; (2) whether the material dwells on or re­
peats at length descriptions of sexual or excretory or­
gans or activities; (3) whether the material appears to
pander or is used to titillate, or whether the material
appears to have been presented for its shock value.”
Id., at 8003 (emphasis deleted).

explained that “[r]epetition of and persistent focus on
sexual or excretory material have been cited consistently
as factors that exacerbate the potential offensiveness of
broadcasts. In contrast, where sexual or excretory refer­

against a finding of indecency.” Id., at 8008. The Com­
mission then gave examples of material that was not
found indecent because it was fleeting and isolated, id., at
8008–8009 (citing, e.g., L. M. Communications of South
Carolina, Inc. (WYBB(FM)), 7 FCC Rcd. 1595 (MMB 1992)
(finding “a fleeting and isolated utterance” in the context
of live and spontaneous programming not actionable)), and
contrasted it with fleeting references that were found
patently offensive in light of other factors, 16 FCC Rcd., at
8009 (citing, e.g., Tempe Radio, Inc. (KUPD–FM), 12 FCC
Rcd. 21828 (MMB 1997) (finding fleeting language that
clearly refers to sexual activity with a child to be patently
