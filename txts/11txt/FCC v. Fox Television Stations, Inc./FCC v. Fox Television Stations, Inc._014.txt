FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

was per se nonactionable.” Id., at 518. Having found the
agency’s action to be neither arbitrary nor capricious, the
Court remanded for the Court of Appeals to address re­
spondents’ First Amendment challenges. Id., at 529–530.
On remand from Fox I, the Court of Appeals held the
Commission’s indecency policy unconstitutionally vague
and invalidated it in its entirety. 613 F. 3d, at 327.
The Court of Appeals found the policy, as expressed in
the 2001 Guidance and subsequent Commission decisions,
failed to give broadcasters sufficient notice of what would
be considered indecent. Surveying a number of Commis­
sion adjudications, the court found the Commission was
inconsistent as to which words it deemed patently offen­
sive. See id., at 330. It also determined that the Com­
mission’s presumptive prohibition on the F-word and the
S-word was plagued by vagueness because the Commission
had on occasion found the fleeting use of those words not
indecent provided they occurred during a bona fide news
interview or were “demonstrably essential to the nature
of an artistic or educational work.” Id., at 331 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The Commission’s application
of these exceptions, according to the Court of Appeals,
left broadcasters guessing whether an expletive would be
deemed artistically integral to a program or whether a
particular broadcast would be considered a bona fide news
interview. The Court of Appeals found the vagueness in­
herent in the policy had forced broadcasters to “choose
between not airing . . . controversial programs [or] risking
massive fines or possibly even loss of their licenses.” Id.,
at 334. And the court found that there was “ample evi­
dence in the record” that this harsh choice had led to a
chill of protected speech. Ibid.
