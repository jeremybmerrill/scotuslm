Opinion of the Court

Therefore, the Commission’s standards as applied to these
broadcasts were vague, and the Commission’s orders must
be set aside.
III
It is necessary to make three observations about the
scope of this decision. First, because the Court resolves
these cases on fair notice grounds under the Due Process
Clause, it need not address the First Amendment implica­
tions of the Commission’s indecency policy. It is argued
that this Court’s ruling in Pacifica (and the less rigorous
standard of scrutiny it provided for the regulation of
broadcasters, see 438 U. S. 726) should be overruled be­
cause the rationale of that case has been overtaken by
technological change and the wide availability of multiple
other choices for listeners and viewers. See, e.g., ABC
Brief 48–57; Brief for Respondent Fox Television Stations,
Inc., et al. 15–26. The Government for its part maintains
that when it licenses a conventional broadcast spectrum,
the public may assume that the Government has its own
interest in setting certain standards. See Brief for Peti­
tioners 40–53. These arguments need not be addressed
here. In light of the Court’s holding that the Commission’s
policy failed to provide fair notice it is unnecessary to
reconsider Pacifica at this time.
This leads to a second observation. Here, the Court
rules that Fox and ABC lacked notice at the time of their
broadcasts that the material they were broadcasting could
be found actionably indecent under then-existing policies.
Given this disposition, it is unnecessary for the Court
to address the constitutionality of the current indecency
policy as expressed in the Golden Globes Order and sub­
sequent adjudications. The Court adheres to its normal
practice of declining to decide cases not before it. See,
e.g., Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 631 (1950) (“Broader
