FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.
Opinion of the Court

parties’ objections. Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC,
489 F. 3d 444, 453 (2007). In its remand order, the Com­
mission applied its tripartite definition of patently offen­
sive material from its 2001 Order and found that both
broadcasts fell well within its scope. See In re Complaints
Regarding Various Television Broadcasts Between February 2, 2002, and March 8, 2005, 21 FCC Rcd. 13299 (2006)
(Remand Order); see also Fox I, supra, at 511–513 (dis­
cussing in detail the Commission’s findings). As pertains
to the constitutional issue in these cases, the Commission
noted that under the policy clarified in the Golden Globes
Order, “categorically requiring repeated use of expletives
in order to find material indecent is inconsistent with
our general approach to indecency enforcement.” Remand
Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308; see also id., at 13325
(“[U]nder our Golden Globe precedent, the fact that Cher
used the ‘F-word’ once does not remove her comment from
the realm of actionable indecency”). Though the Commis­
sion deemed Fox should have known Nicole Richie’s com­

ond Circuit’s remand. Id., at 13321. The Commission
acknowledged that “it was not apparent that Fox could be
penalized for Cher’s comment at the time it was broad­
cast.” And so, as in the Golden Globes case it imposed no
penalty for that broadcast. Id., at 13324, 13326.
Fox and various intervenors returned to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, raising ad­
ministrative, statutory, and constitutional challenges to
the Commission’s indecency regulations. See Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC, 489 F. 3d 444. In a 2-to-1 deci­
sion, with Judge Leval dissenting, the Court of Appeals
found the Remand Order arbitrary and capricious because
“the FCC has made a 180-degree turn regarding its treat­
ment of ‘fleeting expletives’ without providing a reasoned
