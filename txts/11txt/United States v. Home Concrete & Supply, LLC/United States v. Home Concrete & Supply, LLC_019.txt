Opinion of SCALIA, J.

to foreclose administrative revision of our decisions: “the
only permissible reading of the statute.” 545 U. S., at 984.
Thus, having decided to stand by Colony and to stand by
Brand X as well, the plurality should have found—in order
to reach the decision it did—that the Treasury Department’s current interpretation was unreasonable.
Instead of doing what Brand X would require, however,
the plurality manages to sustain the justifiable reliance of
taxpayers by revising yet again the meaning of Chevron—
and revising it yet again in a direction that will create
confusion and uncertainty. See United States v. Mead
Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 245–246 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Bressman, How Mead Has Muddled Judicial Review
of Agency Action, 58 Vand. L. Rev. 1443, 1457–1475
(2005). Of course there is no doubt that, with regard to
the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury Department

Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to
make rules carrying the force of law.” 533 U. S., at 226–
227. We have given Chevron deference to a Treasury
Regulation before. See Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed.
and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)
(slip op., at 11–12). But in order to evade Brand X and yet
reaffirm Colony, the plurality would add yet another lopsided story to the ugly and improbable structure that our
law of administrative review has become: To trigger the
Brand X power of an authorized “gap-filling” agency to
give content to an ambiguous text, a pre-Chevron determination that language is ambiguous does not alone suffice;
the pre-Chevron Court must in addition have found that
Congress wanted the particular ambiguity in question to
be resolved by the agency. And here, today’s plurality
opinion finds, “[t]here is no reason to believe that the
linguistic ambiguity noted by Colony reflects a postChevron conclusion that Congress had delegated gapfilling power to the agency.” Ante, at 10. The notion,
