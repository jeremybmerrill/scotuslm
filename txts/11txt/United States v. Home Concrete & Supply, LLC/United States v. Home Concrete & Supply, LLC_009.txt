Opinion of the Court

The Court in Colony addressed a similar argument about
the word “amount.” It wrote:
“The Commissioner states that the draftsman’s use
of the word ‘amount’ (instead of, for example, ‘item’)
suggests a concentration on the quantitative aspect of
the error—that is whether or not gross income was
understated by as much as 25%.” 357 U. S., at 32.
But the Court, while recognizing the Commissioner’s logic,
rejected the argument (and the significance of the word
“amount”) as insufficient to prove the Commissioner’s
conclusion. And the addition of the word “item” in a different subsection similarly fails to exert an interpretive
force sufficiently strong to affect our conclusion. The
word’s appearance in subsection (e)(2), we concede, is new.
But to rely in the case before us on this solitary word
change in a different subsection is like hoping that a new
batboy will change the outcome of the World Series.

Finally, the Government points to Treasury Regulation
§301.6501(e)–1, which was promulgated in final form in
December 2010. See 26 CFR §301.6501(e)–1 (2011). The
regulation, as relevant here, departs from Colony and
interprets the operative language of the statute in the
Government’s favor. The regulation says that “an understated amount of gross income resulting from an overstatement of unrecovered cost or other basis constitutes an
omission from gross income.” §301.6501(e)–1(a)(1)(iii). In
the Government’s view this new regulation in effect overturns Colony’s interpretation of this statute.
The Government points out that the Treasury Regulation constitutes “an agency’s construction of a statute
which it administers.” Chevron, U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984).
