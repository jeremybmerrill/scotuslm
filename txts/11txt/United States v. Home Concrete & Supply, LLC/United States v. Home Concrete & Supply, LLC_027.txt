KENNEDY, J., dissenting

It is also significant that, after 1954, the statute continued to address the omission of a substantial “amount” that
should have been included in gross income. In the same
round of revisions to the Tax Code, Congress established
an extended limitations period in certain cases where
“items” had been omitted from an estate or gift tax return.
26 U. S. C. §6501(e)(2) (1958 ed.). There is at least some
evidence that this term was used at that time to “mak[e]

apply “merely because of differences between the taxpayer
and the Government as to the valuation of property.”
Staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, Summary of the New Provisions of the Internal

“items” to achieve the same result when it reenacted the
statutory provision at issue is presumed to have been
purposeful. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23
(1983). This consideration casts further doubt on the
premise that the new version of the statute, §6501(e)(1)(A)
(2006 ed., Supp. IV), necessarily has the same meaning as
its predecessor.

In the instant case the Court concludes these statutory
changes are “too fragile to bear the significant argumentative weight the Government seeks to place upon them.”
Ante, at 5. But in this context, the changes are meaningful. Colony made clear that the text of the earlier version
of the statute could not be described as unambiguous, although it ultimately concluded that an overstatement of
basis was not an omission from gross income. See 357
U. S., at 33. The statutory revisions, which were not
considered in Colony, may not compel the opposite conclusion under the new statute; but they strongly favor it. As
a result, there was room for the Treasury Department to
