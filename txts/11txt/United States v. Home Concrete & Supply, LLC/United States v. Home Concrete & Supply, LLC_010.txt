UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC
Opinion of the Court
Opinion of BREYER, J.

See also Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v.
United States, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (applying Chevron in
the tax context). The Court has written that a “court’s
prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency
construction otherwise entitled to Chevron deference only
if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute . . . .”
National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X
Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982 (2005) (emphasis
added). And, as the Government notes, in Colony itself
the Court wrote that “it cannot be said that the language
is unambiguous.” 357 U. S., at 33. Hence, the Government
concludes, Colony cannot govern the outcome in this case.
The question, rather, is whether the agency’s construction
is a “permissible construction of the statute.” Chevron,

regulation embodies a reasonable, hence permissible,
construction of the statute, the Government believes it
must win.
B
We do not accept this argument. In our view, Colony
has already interpreted the statute, and there is no longer
any different construction that is consistent with Colony
and available for adoption by the agency.
C
The fatal flaw in the Government’s contrary argument
is that it overlooks the reason why Brand X held that a
“prior judicial construction,” unless reflecting an “unambiguous” statute, does not trump a different agency construction of that statute. 545 U. S., at 982. The Court
reveals that reason when it points out that “it is for agencies, not courts, to fill statutory gaps.” Ibid. The fact that
a statute is unambiguous means that there is “no gap for
the agency to fill” and thus “no room for agency discre-
