Opinion of SCALIA, J.

the Commissioner’s interpretation would “create a patent
incongruity in the tax law”; and because it found its interpretation “in harmony with the [now] unambiguous language” of the 1954 Code. Ante, at 10–11 (internal quotation marks omitted). But these are the sorts of arguments
that courts always use in resolving ambiguities. They do

Part IV–C.

amendments.” Post, at 7–8 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). This
passage is reminiscent of Professor K. C. Davis’s vision
that administrative procedure is developed by “a partnership between legislators and judges,” who “working [as]
partners produce better law than legislators alone could
