UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

relevant statutory amendments. Courts instead should be
open to an agency’s adoption of a different interpretation
where, as here, Congress has given new instruction by an
amended statute.
Under the circumstances, the Treasury Department had
authority to adopt its reasonable interpretation of the new
tax provision at issue. See Mayo Foundation for Medical
Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. __, __ (2011)
(slip op., at 10). This was also the conclusion reached in
well-reasoned opinions issued in several cases before the
Courts of Appeals. E.g., Intermountain, 650 F. 3d, at 705–
706 (reaching this conclusion “because the Court in Colony
never purported to interpret [the new provision]; because
[the new provision]’s ‘omits from gross income’ text is at
least ambiguous, if not best read to include overstatements of basis; and because neither the section’s structure
nor its [history and context] removes this ambiguity”).
The Department’s clarification of an ambiguous statute,
applicable to these taxpayers, did not upset legitimate
settled expectations. Given the statutory changes described above, taxpayers had reason to question whether
Colony’s holding extended to the revised §6501(e)(1). See,
e.g., CC & F Western Operations L. P. v. Commissioner,
273 F. 3d 402, 406, n. 2 (CA1 2001) (“Whether Colony’s
main holding carries over to section 6501(e)(1) is at least
doubtful”). Having worked no change in the law, and
instead having interpreted a statutory provision without
an established meaning, the Department’s regulation does
not have an impermissible retroactive effect. Cf. Smiley v.
Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741, 744,
n. 3 (1996) (rejecting retroactivity argument); Manhattan
Gen. Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, 297 U. S. 129, 135
(1936) (same). It controls in this case.

For these reasons, and with respect, I dissent.
