UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC
Opinion of the Court

turns in April 2000; (2) the returns overstated the basis
of certain property that the taxpayers had sold; (3) as a
result the returns understated the gross income that the
taxpayers received from the sale of the property; and
(4) the understatement exceeded the statute’s 25% threshold. We also take as undisputed that the Commissioner
asserted the relevant deficiency within the extended 6year limitations period, but outside the default 3-year
period. Thus, unless the 6-year statute of limitations
applies, the Government’s efforts to assert a tax deficiency
came too late. Our conclusion—that the extended limitations period does not apply—follows directly from this
Court’s earlier decision in Colony.
II
In Colony this Court interpreted a provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the operative language of
which is identical to the language now before us. The
Commissioner there had determined
“that the taxpayer had understated the gross profits
on the sales of certain lots of land for residential purposes as a result of having overstated the ‘basis’ of
such lots by erroneously including in their cost certain
unallowable items of development expense.” Id., at
30.
The Commissioner’s assessment came after the ordinary
3-year limitations period had run. And, it was consequently timely only if the taxpayer, in the words of the
1939 Code, had “omit[ted] from gross income an amount
properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return . . . .”
26 U. S. C. §275(c) (1940 ed.). The Code provision applicable to this case, adopted in 1954, contains materially
indistinguishable language. See §6501(e)(1)(A) (2000 ed.)
(same, but replacing “per centum” with “percent”). See also
Appendix, infra.
