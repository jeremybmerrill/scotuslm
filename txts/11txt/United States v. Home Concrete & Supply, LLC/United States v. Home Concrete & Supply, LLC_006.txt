UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC
Opinion of the Court

This “history,” the Court said, “shows . . . that the Congress intended an exception to the usual three-year statute of limitations only in the restricted type of situation
already described,” a situation that did not include overstatements of basis. Id., at 36.
The Court wrote that Congress, in enacting the

“manifested no broader purpose than to give the
Commissioner an additional two [now three] years to

Commissioner is at a special disadvantage . . . [because] the return on its face provides no clue to the existence of the omitted item. . . . [W]hen, as here [i.e.,
where the overstatement of basis is at issue], the understatement of a tax arises from an error in reporting
an item disclosed on the face of the return the Commissioner is at no such disadvantage . . . whether the
error be one affecting ‘gross income’ or one, such as
overstated deductions, affecting other parts of the return.” Ibid. (emphasis added).
Finally, the Court noted that Congress had recently
enacted the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. And the
Court observed that “the conclusion we reach is in harmony with the unambiguous language of §6501(e)(1)(A),”
id., at 37, i.e., the provision relevant in this present case.

provision that Colony interpreted. The operative language
is identical. It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to
give the same language here a different interpretation
without effectively overruling Colony, a course of action
that basic principles of stare decisis wisely counsel us not
