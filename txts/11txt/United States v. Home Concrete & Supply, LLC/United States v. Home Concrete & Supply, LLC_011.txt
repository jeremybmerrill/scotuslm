Opinion of the Court
Opinion of BREYER, J.

tion.” Id., at 982–983.
In so stating, the Court sought to encapsulate what
earlier opinions, including Chevron, made clear. Those
opinions identify the underlying interpretive problem as
that of deciding whether, or when, a particular statute in
effect delegates to an agency the power to fill a gap, thereby implicitly taking from a court the power to void a reasonable gap-filling interpretation. Thus, in Chevron the
Court said that, when
“Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to
fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the
agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute
by regulation. . . . Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit
rather than explicit. [But in either instance], a court
may not substitute its own construction of a statutory
provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the
administrator of an agency.” 467 U. S., at 843–844.

Chevron and later cases find in unambiguous language
a clear sign that Congress did not delegate gap-filling
authority to an agency; and they find in ambiguous language at least a presumptive indication that Congress did
delegate that gap-filling authority. Thus, in Chevron the
Court wrote that a statute’s silence or ambiguity as to
a particular issue means that Congress has not “directly
addressed the precise question at issue” (thus likely delegating gap-filling power to the agency). 467 U. S., at 843.
In Mead the Court, describing Chevron, explained:
“Congress . . . may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particular
provision or fill a particular gap. Yet it can still be
