Opinion of the Court

to take. John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552
U. S. 130, 139 (2008) (“[S]tare decisis in respect to statutory interpretation has special force, for Congress remains
free to alter what we have done” (internal quotation marks
omitted)); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.

The Government, in an effort to convince us to interpret
the operative language before us differently, points to
differences in other nearby parts of the 1954 Code. It
suggests that these differences counsel in favor of a different interpretation than the one adopted in Colony. For
example, the Government points to a new provision,
§6501(e)(1)(A)(i), which says:
“In the case of a trade or business, the term ‘gross income’ means the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services (if such
amounts are required to be shown on the return) prior
to the diminution by the cost of such sales or services.”
If the section’s basic phrase “omi[ssion] from gross income”
does not apply to overstatements of basis (which is what
Colony held), then what need would there be for clause (i),
which leads to the same result in a specific subset of
cases?
And why, the Government adds, does a later paragraph,
referring to gifts and estates, speak of a taxpayer who
“omits . . . items includible in [the] gross estate”? See
§6501(e)(2) (emphasis added). By speaking of “items”
there does it not imply that omission of an “amount” covers more than omission of individual items—indeed that
it includes overstatements of basis, which, after all, diminish the amount of the profit that should have been reported as gross income?
In our view, these points are too fragile to bear the significant argumentative weight the Government seeks to
place upon them. For example, at least one plausible
