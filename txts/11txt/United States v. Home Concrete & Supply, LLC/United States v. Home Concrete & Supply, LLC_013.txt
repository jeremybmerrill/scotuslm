Opinion of the Court
Opinion of BREYER, J.

pretation (the interpretation once again advanced here)
would “create a patent incongruity in the tax law.” Id., at
36–37. And it reached this conclusion despite the fact
that, in the years leading up to Colony, the Commissioner
had consistently advocated the opposite in the circuit
courts. See, e.g., Uptegrove, 204 F. 2d 570; Reis, 142 F. 2d
900; Goodenow v. Commisioner, 238 F. 2d 20 (CA8 1956);
American Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T. C. 386
(1942). Cf. Slaff v. Commisioner, 220 F. 2d 65 (CA9 1955);
Davis v. Hightower, 230 F. 2d 549 (CA5 1956). Thus, the
Court was aware it was rejecting the expert opinion of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue. And finally, after
completing its analysis, Colony found its interpretation of
the 1939 Code “in harmony with the [now] unambiguous
language” of the 1954 Code, which at a minimum suggests
that the Court saw nothing in the 1954 Code as inconsistent with its conclusion. 357 U. S., at 37.
It may be that judges today would use other methods to
determine whether Congress left a gap to fill. But that
is beside the point. The question is whether the Court in
Colony concluded that the statute left such a gap. And, in
our view, the opinion (written by Justice Harlan for the
Court) makes clear that it did not.
Given principles of stare decisis, we must follow that
interpretation. And there being no gap to fill, the Government’s gap-filling regulation cannot change Colony’s
interpretation of the statute. We agree with the taxpayer
that overstatements of basis, and the resulting understatement of gross income, do not trigger the extended
limitations period of §6501(e)(1)(A). The Court of Appeals
reached the same conclusion. See 634 F. 3d 249 (CA4
2011). And its judgment is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
