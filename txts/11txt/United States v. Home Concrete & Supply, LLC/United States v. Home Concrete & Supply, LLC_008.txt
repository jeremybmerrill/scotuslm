UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC
Opinion of the Court

reason why Congress might have added clause (i) has
nothing to do with any desire to change the meaning of the
general rule. Rather when Congress wrote the 1954 Code
(prior to Colony), it did not yet know how the Court would
interpret the provision’s operative language. At least one
lower court had decided that the provision did not apply to
overstatements about the cost of goods that a business
later sold. See Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner,
204 F. 2d 570 (CA3 1953). But see Reis v. Commissioner,
142 F. 2d 900, 902–903 (CA6 1944). And Congress could
well have wanted to ensure that, come what may in the
Supreme Court, Uptegrove’s interpretation would remain
the law where a “trade or business” was at issue.
Nor does our interpretation leave clause (i) without
work to do. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001)
(noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid making any provision “superfluous, void, or insignificant”
(internal quotation marks omitted)). That provision also
explains how to calculate the denominator for purposes of
determining whether a conceded omission amounts to 25%
of “gross income.” For example, it tells us that a merchant
who fails to include $10,000 of revenue from sold goods
has not met the 25% test if total revenue is more than
$40,000, regardless of the cost paid by the merchant to
acquire those goods. But without clause (i), the general
statutory definition of “gross income” requires subtracting
the cost from the sales price. See 26 U. S. C. §§61(a)(3),
1012. Under such a definition of “gross income,” the calculation would take (1) total revenue from sales, $40,000,
minus (2) “the cost of such sales,” say, $25,000. The
$10,000 of revenue would thus amount to 67% of the
“gross income” of $15,000. And the clause does this work
in respect to omissions from gross income irrespective of
our interpretation regarding overstatements of basis.
The Government’s argument about subsection (e)(2)’s
use of the word “item” instead of “amount” is yet weaker.
