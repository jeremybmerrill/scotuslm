UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

possibly produce.”2 That romantic, judge-empowering
image was obliterated by this Court in Vermont Yankee
Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun­
cil, Inc., 435 U. S. 519 (1978), which held that Congress
prescribes and we obey, with no discretion to add to the
administrative procedures that Congress has created. It
seems to me that the dissent’s vision of a troika partnership (legislative-executive-judicial) is a similar mirage.
The discourse, conversation, and exchange that the dissent perceives is peculiarly one-sided. Congress prescribes; and where Congress’s prescription is ambiguous
the Executive can (within the scope of the ambiguity)
clarify that prescription; and if the product is constitutional the courts obey. I hardly think it amounts to a
“discourse” that Congress or (as this Court would allow in
its Brand X decision) the Executive can change its prescription so as to render our prior holding irrelevant.
What is needed for the system to work is that Congress,
the Executive, and the private parties subject to their
dispositions, be able to predict the meaning that the courts
will give to their instructions. That goal would be obstructed if the judicially established meaning of a technical legal term used in a very specific context could be
overturned on the basis of statutory indications as feeble
as those asserted here.
