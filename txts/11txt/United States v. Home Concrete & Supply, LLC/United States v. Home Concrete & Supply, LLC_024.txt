UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

concluding the Department’s interpretation is permissible,
and for this respectful dissent, now follows.
I
The statute at issue in Colony, 26 U. S. C. §275(c) (1940
ed.), was enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of
1939. It provided for a longer period of limitations if
the Government assessed income taxes against a taxpayer
who had “omit[ted] from gross income an amount . . . in
excess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income
stated in the return.”
There was disagreement in the courts about the meaning of this provision in the statute as first enacted. The
Tax Court of the United States, and the United States
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, held that an overstatement of basis constituted an omission from gross
income and could trigger the extended limitations period.
See, e.g., Reis v. Commissioner, 142 F. 2d 900, 902–903
(1944); American Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T. C.
386 (1942). The United States Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit came to the opposite conclusion in a case
where a corporation misreported its income after inflating
the cost of goods it sold from inventory. See Uptegrove
Lumber Co. v. Commissioner, 204 F. 2d 570, 571–573
(1953). In the Third Circuit’s view there could be an
omission only where the taxpayer had left an entire “item
of gain out of his computation of gross income.” Id., at
571. In the Colony decision, issued in 1958, this Court
resolved that dispute against the Government. Acknowledging that “it cannot be said that the language is unambiguous,” 357 U. S., at 33, and relying in large part on the
legislative history of the 1939 Code, the Court concluded
that the mere overstatement of basis did not constitute an
omission from gross income under §275(c).
If the Government is to prevail in the instant case the
regulation in question must be a proper implementation of
