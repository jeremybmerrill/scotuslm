PETITIONERS v. SEB S. A. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[May 31, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
We consider whether a party who “actively induces in­
fringement of a patent” under 35 U. S. C. §271(b) must know
that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.
I
This case concerns a patent for an innovative deep fryer
designed by respondent SEB S. A., a French maker of
home appliances. In the late 1980’s, SEB invented a “cool­
touch” deep fryer, that is, a deep fryer for home use with
external surfaces that remain cool during the frying proc­
ess. The cool-touch deep fryer consisted of a metal frying
pot surrounded by a plastic outer housing. Attached to the
housing was a ring that suspended the metal pot and
insulated the housing from heat by separating it from the
pot, creating air space between the two components. SEB
obtained a U. S. patent for its design in 1991, and some­
time later, SEB started manufacturing the cool-touch fryer
and selling it in this country under its well-known “T-Fal”
brand. Superior to other products in the American market
at the time, SEB’s fryer was a commercial success.
