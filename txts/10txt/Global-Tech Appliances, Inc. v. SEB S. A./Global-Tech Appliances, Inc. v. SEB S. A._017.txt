GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.
Opinion of the Court

requirements give willful blindness an appropriately
limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence.
Under this formulation, a willfully blind defendant is one
who takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high
probability of wrongdoing and who can almost be said to
have actually known the critical facts. See G. Williams,
Criminal Law §57, p. 159 (2d ed. 1961) (“A court can prop­
erly find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said
that the defendant actually knew”). By contrast, a reck­
less defendant is one who merely knows of a substantial
and unjustified risk of such wrongdoing, see ALI, Model
Penal Code §2.02(2)(c) (1985), and a negligent defendant is
one who should have known of a similar risk but, in fact,
did not, see §2.02(2)(d).
The test applied by the Federal Circuit in this case
departs from the proper willful blindness standard in two
important respects. First, it permits a finding of knowl­
edge when there is merely a “known risk” that the induced
acts are infringing. Second, in demanding only “deliberate
indifference” to that risk, the Federal Circuit’s test does
not require active efforts by an inducer to avoid knowing
about the infringing nature of the activities.
In spite of these flaws, we believe that the evidence
when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for
SEB is sufficient under the correct standard. The jury
could have easily found that before April 1998 Pentalpha
willfully blinded itself to the infringing nature of the sales
it encouraged Sunbeam to make.10
