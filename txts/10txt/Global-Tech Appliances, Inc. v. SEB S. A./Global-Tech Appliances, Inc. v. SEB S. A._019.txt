GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.
Opinion of the Court

doubt that inference. Asked whether the attorney would
have fared better had he known of SEB’s design, Sham
was nonresponsive. All he could say was that a patent
search is not an “easy job” and that is why he hired attor­
neys to perform them. App. 112a.
Taken together, this evidence was more than sufficient
for a jury to find that Pentalpha subjectively believed
there was a high probability that SEB’s fryer was pat­
ented, that Pentalpha took deliberate steps to avoid know­
ing that fact, and that it therefore willfully blinded itself
to the infringing nature of Sunbeam’s sales.
