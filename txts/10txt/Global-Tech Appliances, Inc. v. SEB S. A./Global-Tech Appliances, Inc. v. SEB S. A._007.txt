GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.
Opinion of the Court

known risk that the induced acts may violate an existing
patent. Instead, Pentalpha maintains, actual knowledge
of the patent is needed.
A
In assessing Pentalpha’s argument, we begin with the
text of §271(b)—which is short, simple, and, with respect
to the question presented in this case, inconclusive. Sec­
tion 271(b) states: “Whoever actively induces infringement
of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.”
Although the text of §271(b) makes no mention of intent,
we infer that at least some intent is required. The term
“induce” means “[t]o lead on; to influence; to prevail on; to
move by persuasion or influence.” Webster’s New Interna­
tional Dictionary 1269 (2d ed. 1945). The addition of the
adverb “actively” suggests that the inducement must
involve the taking of affirmative steps to bring about the
desired result, see id., at 27.
When a person actively induces another to take some
action, the inducer obviously knows the action that he or
she wishes to bring about. If a used car salesman induces
a customer to buy a car, the salesman knows that the
desired result is the purchase of the car. But what if it
is said that the salesman induced the customer to buy a
damaged car? Does this mean merely that the salesman
induced the customer to purchase a car that happened to
be damaged, a fact of which the salesman may have been
unaware? Or does this mean that the salesman knew that
the car was damaged? The statement that the salesman
induced the customer to buy a damaged car is ambiguous.
So is §271(b). In referring to a party that “induces
infringement,” this provision may require merely that the
inducer lead another to engage in conduct that happens to
amount to infringement, i.e., the making, using, offering to
sell, selling, or importing of a patented invention. See
