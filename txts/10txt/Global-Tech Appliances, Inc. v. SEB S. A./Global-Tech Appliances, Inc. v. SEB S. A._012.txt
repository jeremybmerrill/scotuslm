Opinion of the Court

edge of the patent was needed. 377 U. S., at 488, and n. 8;
id., at 514 (White, J., concurring); id., at 524–527 (Black,
J., dissenting).5 Justice Black’s opinion, which explained
the basis for the majority’s view, concluded that the lan­
guage of §271(c) supported this interpretation. See id., at
525. His opinion also relied on an amendment to this
language that was adopted when the bill was in commit­
tee. Id., at 525–527.
Four Justices disagreed with this interpretation and
would have held that a violator of §271(c) need know only
that the component is specially adapted for use in a prod­
uct that happens to infringe a patent. See id., at 488–490,
n. 8. These Justices thought that this reading was sup­
ported by the language of §271(c) and the pre-1952 case
law, and they disagreed with the inference drawn by the
majority from the amendment of §271(c)’s language. Ibid.
While there is much to be said in favor of both views
expressed in Aro II, the “holding in Aro II has become
a fixture in the law of contributory infringement under
[section] 271(c),” 5 R. Moy, Walker on Patents §15:20,
p. 15–131 (4th ed. 2009)—so much so that SEB has not
asked us to overrule it, see Brief for Respondent 19, n. 3.
Nor has Congress seen fit to alter §271(c)’s intent re­
quirement in the nearly half a century since Aro II was
decided. In light of the “ ‘special force’ ” of the doctrine of
stare decisis with regard to questions of statutory inter­
pretation, see John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,
552 U. S. 130, 139 (2008), we proceed on the premise that
§271(c) requires knowledge of the existence of the patent
that is infringed.

5 Although Justice Black disagreed with the judgment and was thus
in dissent, he was in the majority with respect to the interpretation of
§271(c), and his opinion sets out the reasoning of the majority on this
point. Three other Justices joined his opinion, and a fourth, Justice
White, endorsed his reasoning with respect to the interpretation of
§271(c). See 377 U. S., at 514 (White, J., concurring).
