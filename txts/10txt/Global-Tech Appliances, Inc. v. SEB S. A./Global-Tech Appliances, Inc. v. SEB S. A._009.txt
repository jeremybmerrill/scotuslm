GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.
Opinion of the Court

be used in an invention that happened to infringe a pat­
ent. He wrote that it was “well settled that where one
makes and sells one element of a combination covered by a
patent with the intention and for the purpose of bringing
about its use in such a combination he is guilty of con­
tributory infringement.” Thomson-Houston Elec. Co. v.
Ohio Brass Co., 80 F. 712, 721 (CA6 1897).3
On the other hand, this Court, in Henry v. A. B. Dick
Co., 224 U. S. 1 (1912), overruled on other grounds, Motion
Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S.
502 (1917), stated that “if the defendants [who were ac­

Paper before American Association of Inventors and Manufacturers,
Washington, D. C., Contributory Infringement of Patents 9 (Jan. 1895)
(reading late 19th-century case law to require only that a party “inten­
tionally contribut[e] to the act, which the Court holds to be an in­
fringement” (emphasis in original)). Other authorities from this era
likewise suggest that it was sufficient if the seller intended a compo­
nent part to be used in a manner that happened to infringe a patent.
See, e.g., Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper
Co., 152 U. S. 425, 433 (1894) (“There are doubtless many cases to the
effect that the manufacture and sale of a single element of a combina­
tion, with intent that it shall be united to the other elements, and so
complete the combination, is an infringement”); Individual Drinking
Cup Co. v. Errett, 297 F. 733, 739–740 (CA2 1924) (“[B]efore one may be
held for contributory infringement, it must be shown that he had
knowingly done some act without which the infringement would not
have occurred”); New York Scaffolding Co. v. Whitney, 224 F. 452, 459
(CA8 1915) (“Contributory infringement is the intentional aiding of one
person by another in the unlawful making, or selling, or using of a third
person’s patented invention”); 3 Deller §507, at 1764–1765 (“[W]here a
person furnishes one part of a patented combination, intending that it
shall be assembled with the other parts thereof, and that the complete
combination shall be used or sold; that person is liable to an action, as
infringer of the patent on the complete combination”); 3 W. Robinson,
Patents §924, p. 101 (1890) (“To make or sell a single element with the
intent that it shall be united to the other elements, and so complete
the combination, is infringement”).
