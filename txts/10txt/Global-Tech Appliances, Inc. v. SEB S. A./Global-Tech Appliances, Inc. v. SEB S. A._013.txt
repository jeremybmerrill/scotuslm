GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.
Opinion of the Court

Based on this premise, it follows that the same knowl­
edge is needed for induced infringement under §271(b). As
noted, the two provisions have a common origin in the pre­
1952 understanding of contributory infringement, and the
language of the two provisions creates the same difficult
interpretive choice. It would thus be strange to hold that
knowledge of the relevant patent is needed under §271(c)
but not under §271(b).
Accordingly, we now hold that induced infringement
under §271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts
constitute patent infringement.

Returning to Pentalpha’s principal challenge, we agree
that deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent
exists is not the appropriate standard under §271(b). We
nevertheless affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals
because the evidence in this case was plainly sufficient to
support a finding of Pentalpha’s knowledge under the
doctrine of willful blindness.
A
The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in
criminal law. Many criminal statutes require proof that a
defendant acted knowingly or willfully, and courts apply­
ing the doctrine of willful blindness hold that defendants
cannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately
shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts
that are strongly suggested by the circumstances. The
traditional rationale for this doctrine is that defendants
who behave in this manner are just as culpable as those
who have actual knowledge. Edwards, The Criminal
Degrees of Knowledge, 17 Mod. L. Rev. 294, 302 (1954)

authorities that “up to the present day, no real doubt has
been cast on the proposition that [willful blindness] is as
