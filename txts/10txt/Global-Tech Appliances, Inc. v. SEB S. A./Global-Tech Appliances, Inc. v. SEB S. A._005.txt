GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.
Opinion of the Court

In 1997, Sunbeam Products, Inc., a U. S. competitor of
SEB, asked petitioner Pentalpha Enterprises, Ltd., to
supply it with deep fryers meeting certain specifications.
Pentalpha is a Hong Kong maker of home appliances and
a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner Global-Tech Ap­
pliances, Inc.1
In order to develop a deep fryer for Sunbeam, Pentalpha
purchased an SEB fryer in Hong Kong and copied all but
its cosmetic features. Because the SEB fryer bought in
Hong Kong was made for sale in a foreign market, it bore
no U. S. patent markings. After copying SEB’s design,
Pentalpha retained an attorney to conduct a right-to-use
study, but Pentalpha refrained from telling the attorney
that its design was copied directly from SEB’s.
The attorney failed to locate SEB’s patent, and in Au­
gust 1997 he issued an opinion letter stating that Pental­

had found. That same month, Pentalpha started selling
its deep fryers to Sunbeam, which resold them in the
United States under its trademarks. By obtaining its
product from a manufacturer with lower production costs,
Sunbeam was able to undercut SEB in the U. S. market.
After SEB’s customers started defecting to Sunbeam,
SEB sued Sunbeam in March 1998, alleging that Sun­
beam’s sales infringed SEB’s patent. Sunbeam notified
Pentalpha of the lawsuit the following month. Unde­
terred, Pentalpha went on to sell deep fryers to Fingerhut
Corp. and Montgomery Ward & Co., both of which resold
them in the United States under their respective trade­
marks.
SEB settled the lawsuit with Sunbeam, and then sued
Pentalpha, asserting two theories of recovery: First, SEB
claimed that Pentalpha had directly infringed SEB’s
patent in violation of 35 U. S. C. §271(a), by selling or
