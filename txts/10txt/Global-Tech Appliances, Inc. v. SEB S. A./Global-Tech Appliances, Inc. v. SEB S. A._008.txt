Opinion of the Court

§271(a).2 On the other hand, the reference to a party
that “induces infringement” may also be read to mean that
the inducer must persuade another to engage in conduct
that the inducer knows is infringement. Both readings are
possible.

Finding no definitive answer in the statutory text, we
turn to the case law that predates the enactment of §271
as part the Patent Act of 1952. As we recognized in Aro
Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476
(1964) (Aro II), “[t]he section was designed to ‘codify in
statutory form principles of contributory infringement’
which had been ‘part of our law for about 80 years.’ ” Id.,
at 485–486, n. 6 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1923, 82d Cong.,
2d Sess., 9 (1952)).
Unfortunately, the relevant pre-1952 cases are less clear
than one might hope with respect to the question pre­
sented here. Before 1952, both the conduct now covered
by §271(b) (induced infringement) and the conduct now
addressed by §271(c) (sale of a component of a patented
invention) were viewed as falling within the overarching
concept of “contributory infringement.” Cases in the latter
category—i.e., cases in which a party sold an item that
was not itself covered by the claims of a patent but that
enabled another party to make or use a patented machine,
process, or combination—were more common.
The pre-1952 case law provides conflicting signals re­
garding the intent needed in such cases. In an oft-cited
decision, then-Judge Taft suggested that it was sufficient
if the seller of the component part intended that the part

2 Direct infringement has long been understood to require no more
than the unauthorized use of a patented invention. See Aro Mfg. Co. v.
Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476, 484 (1964); 3 A. Deller,
Walker on Patents §453, p. 1684 (1937) (hereinafter Deller). Thus, a
direct infringer’s knowledge or intent is irrelevant.
