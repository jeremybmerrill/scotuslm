Opinion of the Court

offering to sell its deep fryers; and second, SEB claimed
that Pentalpha had contravened §271(b) by actively induc­
ing Sunbeam, Fingerhut, and Montgomery Ward to sell or
to offer to sell Pentalpha’s deep fryers in violation of SEB’s
patent rights.
Following a 5-day trial, the jury found for SEB on both
theories and also found that Pentalpha’s infringement had
been willful. Pentalpha filed post-trial motions seeking
a new trial or judgment as a matter of law on several
grounds. As relevant here, Pentalpha argued that there
was insufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of
induced infringement under §271(b) because Pentalpha
did not actually know of SEB’s patent until it received the
notice of the Sunbeam lawsuit in April 1998.
The District Court rejected Pentalpha’s argument, as
did the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
affirmed the judgment, SEB S. A. v. Montgomery Ward &
Co., 594 F. 3d 1360 (2010). Summarizing a recent en banc
decision, the Federal Circuit stated that induced in­
fringement under §271(b) requires a “plaintiff [to] show
that the alleged infringer knew or should have known
that his actions would induce actual infringements” and
that this showing includes proof that the alleged infringer
knew of the patent. Id., at 1376. Although the record
contained no direct evidence that Pentalpha knew of
SEB’s patent before April 1998, the court found adequate
evidence to support a finding that “Pentalpha deliberately
disregarded a known risk that SEB had a protective pat­
ent.” Id., at 1377. Such disregard, the court said, “is not
different from actual knowledge, but is a form of actual
knowledge.” Ibid.
We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).
