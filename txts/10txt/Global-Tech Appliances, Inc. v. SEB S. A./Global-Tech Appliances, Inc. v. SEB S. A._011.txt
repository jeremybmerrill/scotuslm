GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.
Opinion of the Court

as we explain below, that conclusion compels this same
knowledge for liability under §271(b).

As noted above, induced infringement was not consid­
ered a separate theory of indirect liability in the pre-1952
case law. Rather, it was treated as evidence of “contribu­

other covered by §271(c).
Aro II concerned §271(c), which states in relevant part:

of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity
of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing
use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.” (Em­
phasis added.)
This language contains exactly the same ambiguity as

This question closely divided the Aro II Court. In a
badly fractured decision, a majority concluded that knowl­
