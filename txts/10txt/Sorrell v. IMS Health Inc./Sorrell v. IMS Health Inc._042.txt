BREYER, J., dissenting

310 U. S. 573, 580–581 (1940) (“A controversy like this
always calls for fresh reminder that courts must not sub
stitute their notions of expediency and fairness for those
which have guided the agencies to whom the formulation
and execution of policy have been entrusted”).
Nothing in Vermont’s statute undermines the ability of
persons opposing the State’s policies to speak their mind
or to pursue a different set of policy objectives through
the democratic process. Whether Vermont’s regulatory
statute “targets” drug companies (as opposed to affecting
them unintentionally) must be beside the First Amendment
point.
This does not mean that economic regulation having
some effect on speech is always lawful. Courts typically
review the lawfulness of statutes for rationality and of
regulations (if federal) to make certain they are not “arbi
trary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U. S. C.
§706(2)(A). And our valuable free-speech tradition may
play an important role in such review. But courts do not
normally view these matters as requiring “heightened”
First Amendment scrutiny—and particularly not the un
forgiving brand of “intermediate” scrutiny employed by
the majority. Because the imposition of “heightened”
scrutiny in such instances would significantly change the
legislative/judicial balance, in a way that would signifi
cantly weaken the legislature’s authority to regulate
commerce and industry, I would not apply a “heightened”
First Amendment standard of review in this case.
III
Turning to the constitutional merits, I believe Vermont’s
statute survives application of Central Hudson’s “interme
diate” commercial speech standard as well as any more
limited “economic regulation” test.
