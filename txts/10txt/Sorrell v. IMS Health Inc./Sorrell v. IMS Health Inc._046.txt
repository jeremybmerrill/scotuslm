BREYER, J., dissenting

B
The legitimate state interests that the statute serves are
“substantial.” Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 564. Ver
mont enacted its statute
“to advance the state’s interest in protecting the pub
lic health of Vermonters, protecting the privacy of
prescribers and prescribing information, and to en
sure costs are contained in the private health care
sector, as well as for state purchasers of prescription
drugs, through the promotion of less costly drugs and
ensuring prescribers receive unbiased information.”
§4631(a).
These objectives are important. And the interests they
embody all are “neutral” in respect to speech. Cf. ante, at
24.
The protection of public health falls within the tradi
tional scope of a State’s police powers. Hillsborough
County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S.
707, 719 (1985). The fact that the Court normally exempts
the regulation of “misleading” and “deceptive” information
even from the rigors of its “intermediate” commercial
speech scrutiny testifies to the importance of securing
“unbiased information,” see 44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., at
501 (opinion of Stevens, J.); Central Hudson, supra, at
563, as does the fact that the FDA sets forth as a federal
regulatory goal the need to ensure a “fair balance” of
information about marketed drugs, 21 CFR §§202.1(e)(1),
202.1(e)(5)(ii). As major payers in the health care system,
health care spending is also of crucial state interest. And
this Court has affirmed the importance of maintaining
“privacy” as an important public policy goal—even in
respect to information already disclosed to the public for
particular purposes (but not others). See Department of
Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U. S.
749, 762–771 (1989); see also Solove, A Taxonomy of Pri
