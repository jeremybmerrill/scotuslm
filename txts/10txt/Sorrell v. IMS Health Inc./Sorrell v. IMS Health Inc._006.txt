SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
Opinion of the Court

doctors through a process called “detailing.” This often involves a scheduled visit to a doctor’s office to persuade
the doctor to prescribe a particular pharmaceutical. De
tailers bring drug samples as well as medical studies
that explain the “details” and potential advantages of var
ious prescription drugs. Interested physicians listen, ask
questions, and receive followup data. Salespersons can be
more effective when they know the background and pur
chasing preferences of their clientele, and pharmaceutical
salespersons are no exception. Knowledge of a physician’s prescription practices—called “prescriber-identifying
information”—enables a detailer better to ascertain which
doctors are likely to be interested in a particular drug and
how best to present a particular sales message. Detailing
is an expensive undertaking, so pharmaceutical companies
most often use it to promote high-profit brand-name drugs
protected by patent. Once a brand-name drug’s patent
expires, less expensive bioequivalent generic alternatives
are manufactured and sold.
Pharmacies, as a matter of business routine and federal
law, receive prescriber-identifying information when proc
essing prescriptions. See 21 U. S. C. §353(b); see also
Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 9.1 (2009); Rule 9.2.
Many pharmacies sell this information to “data miners,”
firms that analyze prescriber-identifying information and
produce reports on prescriber behavior. Data miners lease
these reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers subject to
nondisclosure agreements. Detailers, who represent the
manufacturers, then use the reports to refine their mar
keting tactics and increase sales.
In 2007, Vermont enacted the Prescription Confidential
ity Law. The measure is also referred to as Act 80. It has
several components. The central provision of the present
case is §4631(d).
