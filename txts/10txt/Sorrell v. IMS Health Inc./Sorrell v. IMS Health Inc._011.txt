Opinion of the Court

in other words, could be sold or given away for purposes
other than marketing. The District Court and the Court of
Appeals accepted the State’s reading. See 630 F. 3d,
at 276. At oral argument in this Court, however, the
State for the first time advanced an alternative reading of
§4631(d)—namely, that pharmacies, health insurers, and
similar entities may not sell prescriber-identifying infor
mation for any purpose, subject to the statutory exceptions
set out at §4631(e). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–20. It might
be argued that the State’s newfound interpretation comes
too late in the day. See Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537
U. S. 51, 56, n. 4 (2002) (waiver); New Hampshire v.
Maine, 532 U. S. 742, 749 (2001) (judicial estoppel). The
respondents, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals
were entitled to rely on the State’s plausible interpretation
of the law it is charged with enforcing. For the State to
change its position is particularly troubling in a First
Amendment case, where plaintiffs have a special interest
in obtaining a prompt adjudication of their rights, despite
potential ambiguities of state law. See Houston v. Hill,
482 U. S. 451, 467–468, and n. 17 (1987); Zwickler v.
Koota, 389 U. S. 241, 252 (1967).
In any event, §4631(d) cannot be sustained even under
the interpretation the State now adopts. As a consequence
this Court can assume that the opening clause of §4631(d)
prohibits pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities
from selling prescriber-identifying information, subject to
the statutory exceptions set out at §4631(e). Under that
reading, pharmacies may sell the information to private or
academic researchers, see §4631(e)(1), but not, for exam
ple, to pharmaceutical marketers. There is no dispute as
to the remainder of §4631(d). It prohibits pharmacies,
health insurers, and similar entities from disclosing or
otherwise allowing prescriber-identifying information to
be used for marketing. And it bars pharmaceutical manu
facturers and detailers from using the information for
