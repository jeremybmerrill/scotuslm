SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
BREYER, J., dissenting

and entirely commercial. See supra, at 6–9.
The Court reaches its conclusion through the use of
important First Amendment categories—“content-based,”
“speaker-based,” and “neutral”—but without taking full
account of the regulatory context, the nature of the speech
effects, the values these First Amendment categories seek
to promote, and prior precedent. See supra, at 2–6, 9–13,
17. At best the Court opens a Pandora’s Box of First
Amendment challenges to many ordinary regulatory
practices that may only incidentally affect a commercial
message. See, e.g., supra, at 7–8, 9–11. At worst, it re
awakens Lochner’s pre-New Deal threat of substituting
judicial for democratic decisionmaking where ordinary
economic regulation is at issue. See Central Hudson, 447
U. S., at 589 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).
Regardless, whether we apply an ordinary commercial
speech standard or a less demanding standard, I believe
Vermont’s law is consistent with the First Amendment.
And with respect, I dissent.
