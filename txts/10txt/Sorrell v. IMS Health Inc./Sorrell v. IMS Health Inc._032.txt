contexts in which speech takes place. See, e.g., Snyder v.
Phelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 5–6).
Thus, the First Amendment imposes tight constraints
upon government efforts to restrict, e.g., “core” political
speech, while imposing looser constraints when the gov
ernment seeks to restrict, e.g., commercial speech, the
speech of its own employees, or the regulation-related
speech of a firm subject to a traditional regulatory pro
gram. Compare Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988)
(political speech), with Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp.
v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980)

These test-related distinctions reflect the constitutional
importance of maintaining a free marketplace of ideas,
a marketplace that provides access to “social, political,

(Holmes, J., dissenting). Without such a marketplace, the
public could not freely choose a government pledged to
implement policies that reflect the people’s informed will.
At the same time, our cases make clear that the First
Amendment offers considerably less protection to the
maintenance of a free marketplace for goods and services.
See Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 623
(1995) (“We have always been careful to distinguish com
mercial speech from speech at the First Amendment’s
core”). And they also reflect the democratic importance of
permitting an elected government to implement through
effective programs policy choices for which the people’s
elected representatives have voted.
Thus this Court has recognized that commercial speech
including advertising has an “informational function” and
