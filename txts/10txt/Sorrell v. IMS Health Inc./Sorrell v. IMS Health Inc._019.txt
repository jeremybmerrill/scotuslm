Opinion of the Court

disclosure is a regulation of speech, and the ‘sale’ of [in
formation] is simply disclosure for profit”).
This Court has held that the creation and dissemination
of information are speech within the meaning of the First
Amendment. See, e.g., Bartnicki, supra, at 527 (“[I]f the
acts of ‘disclosing’ and ‘publishing’ information do not
constitute speech, it is hard to imagine what does fall
within that category, as distinct from the category of
expressive conduct” (some internal quotation marks omit
ted)); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 481
(1995) (“information on beer labels” is speech); Dun &
Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749,
759 (1985) (plurality opinion) (credit report is “speech”).
Facts, after all, are the beginning point for much of the
speech that is most essential to advance human knowl
edge and to conduct human affairs. There is thus a
strong argument that prescriber-identifying information is
speech for First Amendment purposes.
The State asks for an exception to the rule that informa
tion is speech, but there is no need to consider that re
quest in this case. The State has imposed content- and
speaker-based restrictions on the availability and use of
prescriber-identifying information. So long as they do not
engage in marketing, many speakers can obtain and use
the information. But detailers cannot. Vermont’s statute
could be compared with a law prohibiting trade magazines
from purchasing or using ink. Cf. Minneapolis Star, 460
U. S. 575. Like that hypothetical law, §4631(d) imposes a
speaker- and content-based burden on protected expres
sion, and that circumstance is sufficient to justify applica
tion of heightened scrutiny. As a consequence, this case
can be resolved even assuming, as the State argues, that
prescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.
