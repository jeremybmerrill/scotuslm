v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 488 (1955)

and that it might be thought that the particular legisla

(“[R]egulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial
transactions is not to be pronounced unconstitutional” if it

To apply a strict First Amendment standard virtually as
a matter of course when a court reviews ordinary economic
regulatory programs (even if that program has a modest
impact upon a firm’s ability to shape a commercial mes

constitutional approach. Since ordinary regulatory pro
grams can affect speech, particularly commercial speech,
in myriad ways, to apply a “heightened” First Amendment
standard of review whenever such a program burdens
speech would transfer from legislatures to judges the

requiring fruit growers to pay for advertising they dis
agree with does not “justify reliance on the First Amend
ment as a basis for reviewing economic regulations”). Cf.

speech is made by the Government); United States v.
United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405, 411 (2001) (applying
greater scrutiny where compelled speech was not “ancil
lary to a more comprehensive program restricting market
ing autonomy”). To apply a “heightened” standard of
review in such cases as a matter of course would risk what
