SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
BREYER, J., dissenting

then-Justice Rehnquist, dissenting in Central Hudson,
described as a
“retur[n] to the bygone era of Lochner v. New York,
198 U. S. 45 (1905), in which it was common practice
for this Court to strike down economic regulations
adopted by a State based on the Court’s own notions
of the most appropriate means for the State to imple

B
There are several reasons why the Court should review
Vermont’s law “under the standard appropriate for the
review of economic regulation,” not “under a heightened
standard appropriate for the review of First Amendment
issues.” Glickman, 521 U. S., at 469. For one thing, Ver
mont’s statute neither forbids nor requires anyone to say
anything, to engage in any form of symbolic speech, or to
endorse any particular point of view, whether ideological
or related to the sale of a product. Cf. id., at 469–470.
(And I here assume that Central Hudson might otherwise
apply. See Part III, infra.)
For another thing, the same First Amendment stan
dards that apply to Vermont here would apply to similar
regulatory actions taken by other States or by the Federal
Government acting, for example, through Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulation. (And the Federal Gov
ernment’s ability to pre-empt state laws that interfere
with existing or contemplated federal forms of regulation
is here irrelevant.)
Further, the statute’s requirements form part of a tra
ditional, comprehensive regulatory regime. Cf. United
Foods, supra, at 411. The pharmaceutical drug industry
has been heavily regulated at least since 1906. See Pure
Food and Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768. Longstanding statutes
and regulations require pharmaceutical companies to
engage in complex drug testing to ensure that their drugs
