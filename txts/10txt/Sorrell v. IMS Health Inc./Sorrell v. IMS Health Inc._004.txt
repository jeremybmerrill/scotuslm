SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
Syllabus
use of prescriber-identifying information undermines the doctor
patient relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment de
cisions. But if pharmaceutical marketing affects treatment decisions,
it can do so only because it is persuasive. Fear that speech might
persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it. Pp. 17–21.
(c) While Vermont’s goals of lowering the costs of medical ser
vices and promoting public health may be proper, §4631(d) does not
advance them in a permissible way. Vermont seeks to achieve those
objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by
certain speakers—i.e., by diminishing detailers’ ability to influence
prescription decisions. But “the fear that people would make bad de
cisions if given truthful information” cannot justify content-based
burdens on speech. Thompson v. Western States Medical Center, 535
U. S. 357, 374. That precept applies with full force when the audi
ence—here, prescribing physicians—consists of “sophisticated and
experienced” consumers. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 775. The
instant law’s defect is made clear by the fact that many listeners find
detailing instructive. Vermont may be displeased that detailers with
prescriber-indentifying information are effective in promoting brand
name drugs, but the State may not burden protected expression in
order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction. Vermont nowhere
contends that its law will prevent false or misleading speech within
the meaning of this Court’s First Amendment precedents. The
State’s interest in burdening detailers’ speech thus turns on nothing
more than a difference of opinion. Pp. 21–24.
