SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
Opinion of the Court

that a law is content-based and, in practice, viewpoint
discriminatory. See R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 382 (“Content
based regulations are presumptively invalid”); id., at 391–
392. The State argues that a different analysis applies
here because, assuming §4631(d) burdens speech at all, it
at most burdens only commercial speech. As in previous
cases, however, the outcome is the same whether a special
commercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial
scrutiny is applied. See, e.g., Greater New Orleans Broad
casting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U. S. 173, 184
(1999). For the same reason there is no need to determine
whether all speech hampered by §4631(d) is commercial,
as our cases have used that term. Cf. Board of Trustees
of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 474 (1989)
(discussing whether “pure speech and commercial speech”
were inextricably intertwined, so that “the entirety must
. . . be classified as noncommercial”).
Under a commercial speech inquiry, it is the State’s
burden to justify its content-based law as consistent with
the First Amendment. Thompson v. Western States Medi
cal Center, 535 U. S. 357, 373 (2002). To sustain the
targeted, content-based burden §4631(d) imposes on pro
tected expression, the State must show at least that the
statute directly advances a substantial governmental in
terest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that
interest. See Fox, supra, at 480–481; Central Hudson Gas
& Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S.
557, 566 (1980). There must be a “fit between the legisla
ture’s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those
ends.” Fox, supra, at 480 (internal quotation marks omit
ted). As in other contexts, these standards ensure not only
that the State’s interests are proportional to the resulting burdens placed on speech but also that the law does
not seek to suppress a disfavored message. See Turner
Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at 662–663.
The State’s asserted justifications for §4631(d) come
