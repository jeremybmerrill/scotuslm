SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
Opinion of the Court

Network, 507 U. S., at 428. For instance, the State might
have advanced its asserted privacy interest by allowing
the information’s sale or disclosure in only a few narrow
and well-justified circumstances. See, e.g., Health In
surance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42
U. S. C. §1320d–2; 45 CFR pts. 160 and 164 (2010). A
statute of that type would present quite a different case
than the one presented here. But the State did not enact
a statute with that purpose or design. Instead, Vermont
made prescriber-identifying information available to an
almost limitless audience. The explicit structure of the
statute allows the information to be studied and used by
all but a narrow class of disfavored speakers. Given the
information’s widespread availability and many permissi
ble uses, the State’s asserted interest in physician confi
dentiality does not justify the burden that §4631(d) places
on protected expression.
The State points out that it allows doctors to forgo the
advantages of §4631(d) by consenting to the sale, disclo
sure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information.
See §4631(c)(1). It is true that private decisionmaking can
avoid governmental partiality and thus insulate privacy
measures from First Amendment challenge. See Rowan v.
Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728 (1970); cf. Bolger v. Youngs
Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 72 (1983). But that
principle is inapposite here. Vermont has given its doctors
a contrived choice: Either consent, which will allow your
prescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and
used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which will
allow your information to be used by those speakers whose
message the State supports. Section 4631(d) may offer a
limited degree of privacy, but only on terms favorable to
the speech the State prefers. Cf. Rowan, supra, at 734,
737, 739, n. 6 (sustaining a law that allowed private par
ties to make “unfettered,” “unlimited,” and “unreviewable”
choices regarding their own privacy). This is not to say
