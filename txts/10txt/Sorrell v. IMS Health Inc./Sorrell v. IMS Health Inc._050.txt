BREYER, J., dissenting

office door entirely has no similar tendency to lower costs
(by focusing greater attention upon the comparative ad
vantages and disadvantages of generic drug alternatives).
And it would not protect the confidentiality of information
already released to, say, data miners. In any event, physi
cians are unlikely to turn detailers away at the door, for
those detailers, whether delivering a balanced or imbal
anced message, are nonetheless providers of much useful
information. See Manchanda & Honka, The Effects and
Role of Direct-to-Physician Marketing in the Pharmaceuti
cal Industry: An Integrative Review, 5 Yale J. Health Pol’y
L. & Ethics 785, 793–797, 815–816 (2005); Ziegler, Lew, &

ceutical Sales Representatives, 273 JAMA 1296 (1995).
Forcing doctors to choose between targeted detailing and
no detailing at all could therefore jeopardize the State’s
interest in promoting public health.
The majority also suggests that if the “statute provided
that prescriber-identifying information could not be sold or
disclosed except in narrow circumstances then the State
might have a stronger position.” Ante, at 24–25; see also
ante, at 17. But the disclosure-permitting exceptions here
are quite narrow, and they serve useful, indeed essential
purposes. See supra, at 14. Compare Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.
18, §4631(e) with note following 42 U. S. C. §1320d–2, p.
1190, and 45 CFR §164.512 (uses and disclosures not
requiring consent under the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996). Regardless, this alterna
tive is not “a more limited restriction,” Central Hudson,
supra, at 564 (emphasis added), for it would impose a
greater, not a lesser, burden upon the dissemination of
information.
Respondents’ alternatives are no more helpful. Respon
dents suggest that “Vermont can simply inform physicians
that pharmaceutical companies . . . use prescription his
tory information to communicate with doctors.” Brief for
