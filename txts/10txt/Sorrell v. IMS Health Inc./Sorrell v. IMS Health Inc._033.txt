SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
BREYER, J., dissenting

is not “valueless in the marketplace of ideas.” Central
Hudson, supra, at 563; Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809,
826 (1975). But at the same time it has applied a less
than strict, “intermediate” First Amendment test when
the government directly restricts commercial speech.
Under that test, government laws and regulations may
significantly restrict speech, as long as they also “directly
advance” a “substantial” government interest that could
not “be served as well by a more limited restriction.”
Central Hudson, supra, at 564. Moreover, the Court has
found that “sales practices” that are “misleading, decep

mediate” standard. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island,
517 U. S. 484, 501 (1996) (opinion of Stevens, J.); see also
Central Hudson, supra, at 563; Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy
v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,
772 (1976). And the Court has emphasized the need, in
applying an “intermediate” test, to maintain the
“ ‘commonsense’ distinction between speech proposing
a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area
traditionally subject to government regulation, and
other varieties of speech.” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar
Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 455–456 (1978) (quoting Virginia
Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 771, n. 24; emphasis
added).
The Court has also normally applied a yet more lenient
approach to ordinary commercial or regulatory legislation
that affects speech in less direct ways. In doing so, the
Court has taken account of the need in this area of law to
defer significantly to legislative judgment—as the Court
has done in cases involving the Commerce Clause or the
Due Process Clause. See Glickman, supra, at 475–476.
“Our function” in such cases, Justice Brandeis said, “is
only to determine the reasonableness of the legislature’s
belief in the existence of evils and in the effectiveness of
