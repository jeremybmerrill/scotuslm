objections than many other uses permitted by §4631(d).
In any event, this asserted interest is contrary to basic
First Amendment principles. Speech remains protected
even when it may “stir people to action,” “move them to
tears,” or “inflict great pain.” Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S.
___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15). The more benign and,
many would say, beneficial speech of pharmaceutical
marketing is also entitled to the protection of the First
Amendment. If pharmaceutical marketing affects treat
ment decisions, it does so because doctors find it persua
sive. Absent circumstances far from those presented here,
the fear that speech might persuade provides no lawful
basis for quieting it. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444,
447 (1969) (per curiam).

The State contends that §4631(d) advances important public policy goals by lowering the costs of medical
services and promoting public health. If prescriber
identifying information were available for use by detailers,
the State contends, then detailing would be effective in
promoting brand-name drugs that are more expensive and
less safe than generic alternatives. This logic is set out at
length in the legislative findings accompanying §4631(d).
Yet at oral argument here, the State declined to acknowl
edge that §4631(d)’s objective purpose and practical effect
were to inhibit detailing and alter doctors’ prescription
decisions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6. The State’s reluctance
to embrace its own legislature’s rationale reflects the
vulnerability of its position.
While Vermont’s stated policy goals may be proper,
§4631(d) does not advance them in a permissible way. As
the Court of Appeals noted, the “state’s own explanation of
how” §4631(d) “advances its interests cannot be said to be
direct.” 630 F. 3d, at 277. The State seeks to achieve its
policy objectives through the indirect means of restraining
