Opinion of the Court

information could not be sold or disclosed except in narrow
circumstances then the State might have a stronger posi
tion. Here, however, the State gives possessors of the
information broad discretion and wide latitude in disclos
ing the information, while at the same time restricting
the information’s use by some speakers and for some pur
poses, even while the State itself can use the information
to counter the speech it seeks to suppress. Privacy is a
concept too integral to the person and a right too essential
to freedom to allow its manipulation to support just those
ideas the government prefers.
When it enacted §4631(d), the Vermont Legislature
found that the “marketplace for ideas on medicine safety
and effectiveness is frequently one-sided in that brand
name companies invest in expensive pharmaceutical mar
keting campaigns to doctors.” 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,
§1(4). “The goals of marketing programs,” the legislature
said, “are often in conflict with the goals of the state.”
§1(3). The text of §4631(d), associated legislative findings,
and the record developed in the District Court establish
that Vermont enacted its law for this end. The State has
burdened a form of protected expression that it found too
persuasive. At the same time, the State has left unbur
dened those speakers whose messages are in accord with
its own views. This the State cannot do.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
