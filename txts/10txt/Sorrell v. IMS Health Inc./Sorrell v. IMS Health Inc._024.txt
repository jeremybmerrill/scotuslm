SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
Opinion of the Court

pharmaceutical marketers can sustain a broad content
based rule like §4631(d). Many are those who must en
dure speech they do not like, but that is a necessary cost of
freedom. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,
210–211 (1975); Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 21
(1971). In any event the State offers no explanation why
remedies other than content-based rules would be inade
quate. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S.
484, 503 (1996) (opinion of Stevens, J.). Physicians can,
and often do, simply decline to meet with detailers, includ
ing detailers who use prescriber-identifying information.
See, e.g., App. 180, 333–334. Doctors who wish to forgo
detailing altogether are free to give “No Solicitation” or
“No Detailing” instructions to their office managers or to
receptionists at their places of work. Personal privacy
even in one’s own home receives “ample protection” from
the “resident’s unquestioned right to refuse to engage in
conversation with unwelcome visitors.” Watchtower Bible
& Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U. S.
150, 168 (2002); see also Bolger, supra, at 72. A physi
cian’s office is no more private and is entitled to no greater
protection.
Vermont argues that detailers’ use of prescriber
identifying information undermines the doctor-patient
relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment
decisions. According to the State, “unwanted pressure
occurs” when doctors learn that their prescription deci
sions are being “monitored” by detailers. 2007 Vt. Laws
No. 80, §1(27). Some physicians accuse detailers of “spy
ing” or of engaging in “underhanded” conduct in order to
“subvert” prescription decisions. App. 336, 380, 407–408;
see also id., at 326–328. And Vermont claims that detail
ing makes people “anxious” about whether doctors have
their patients’ best interests at heart. Id., at 327. But the
State does not explain why detailers’ use of prescriber
identifying information is more likely to prompt these
