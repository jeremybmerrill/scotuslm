SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
BREYER, J., dissenting

oversees the form and content of labeling, advertising, and
sales proposals of drugs, but not of furniture. See 21 CFR
pts. 201–203. Given the ubiquity of content-based regula
tory categories, why should the “content-based” nature of
typical regulation require courts (other things being equal)
to grant legislators and regulators less deference? Cf.
Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S.
469, 481 (1989) (courts, in First Amendment area, should
“provide the Legislative and Executive Branches needed
leeway” when regulated industries are at issue).
Nor, in the context of a regulatory program, is it un
usual for particular rules to be “speaker-based,” affecting
only a class of entities, namely, the regulated firms. An
energy regulator, for example, might require the manu
facturers of home appliances to publicize ways to reduce
energy consumption, while exempting producers of indus
trial equipment. See, e.g., 16 CFR pt. 305 (2011) (prescrib
ing labeling requirements for certain home appliances);
Nev. Admin. Code §§704.804, 704.808 (2010) (requiring
utilities to provide consumers with information on conser
vation). Or a trade regulator might forbid a particular
firm to make the true claim that its cosmetic product
contains “cleansing grains that scrub away dirt and ex
cess oil” unless it substantiates that claim with detailed
backup testing, even though opponents of cosmetics use
need not substantiate their claims. Morris, F. T. C. Or
ders Data to Back Ad Claims, N. Y. Times, Nov. 3, 1973,
p. 32; Boys’ Life, Oct. 1973, p. 64; see 36 Fed. Reg. 12058
(1971). Or the FDA might control in detail just what a
pharmaceutical firm can, and cannot, tell potential pur
chasers about its products. Such a firm, for example,
could not suggest to a potential purchaser (say, a doctor)
that he or she might put a pharmaceutical drug to an “off
label” use, even if the manufacturer, in good faith and
with considerable evidence, believes the drug will help.
All the while, a third party (say, a researcher) is free to
