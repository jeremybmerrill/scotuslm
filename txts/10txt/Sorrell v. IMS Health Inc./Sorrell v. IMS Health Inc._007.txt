Opinion of the Court

tronic transmission intermediary, a pharmacy, or other
similar entity shall not sell, license, or exchange
for value regulated records containing prescriber
identifiable information, nor permit the use of
regulated records containing prescriber-identifiable
information for marketing or promoting a prescription
drug, unless the prescriber consents . . . . Pharmaceu
tical manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers
shall not use prescriber-identifiable information for
marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless
the prescriber consents . . . .”
The quoted provision has three component parts. The
provision begins by prohibiting pharmacies, health insur
ers, and similar entities from selling prescriber-identifying
information, absent the prescriber’s consent. The parties
here dispute whether this clause applies to all sales or
only to sales for marketing. The provision then goes on to
prohibit pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities from allowing prescriber-identifying information to be
used for marketing, unless the prescriber consents. This
prohibition in effect bars pharmacies from disclosing the
information for marketing purposes. Finally, the provi
sion’s second sentence bars pharmaceutical manufacturers
and pharmaceutical marketers from using prescriber
identifying information for marketing, again absent the
prescriber’s consent. The Vermont attorney general may
pursue civil remedies against violators. §4631(f).
Separate statutory provisions elaborate the scope of the
prohibitions set out in §4631(d). “Marketing” is defined to
include “advertising, promotion, or any activity” that is
“used to influence sales or the market share of a prescrip
tion drug.” §4631(b)(5). Section 4631(c)(1) further pro
vides that Vermont’s Department of Health must allow “a
prescriber to give consent for his or her identifying infor
mation to be used for the purposes” identified in §4631(d).
