BREYER, J., dissenting

are both “safe” and “effective.” 21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1),
355(d). Only then can the drugs be marketed, at which
point drug companies are subject to the FDA’s exhaustive
regulation of the content of drug labels and the manner in
which drugs can be advertised and sold. §352(f)(2); 21
CFR pts. 201–203 (2010).
Finally, Vermont’s statute is directed toward informa
tion that exists only by virtue of government regulation.
Under federal law, certain drugs can be dispensed only by
a pharmacist operating under the orders of a medical
practitioner. 21 U. S. C. §353(b). Vermont regulates the
qualifications, the fitness, and the practices of pharma
cists themselves, and requires pharmacies to maintain a
“patient record system” that, among other things, tracks
who prescribed which drugs. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26,
§§2041(a), 2022(14) (Supp. 2010); Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy
Admin. Rules (Pharmacy Rules) 9.1, 9.24(e) (2009). But
for these regulations, pharmacies would have no way to
know who had told customers to buy which drugs (as is
the case when a doctor tells a patient to take a daily dose
of aspirin).
Regulators will often find it necessary to create tailored
restrictions on the use of information subject to their
regulatory jurisdiction. A car dealership that obtains
credit scores for customers who want car loans can be
prohibited from using credit data to search for new cus
tomers. See 15 U. S. C. §1681b (2006 ed. and Supp. III);
cf. Trans Union Corp. v. FTC, 245 F. 3d 809, reh’g denied,
267 F. 3d 1138 (CADC 2001). Medical specialists who
obtain medical records for their existing patients cannot
purchase those records in order to identify new patients.
See 45 CFR §164.508(a)(3) (2010). Or, speaking hypo
thetically, a public utilities commission that directs local
gas distributors to gather usage information for individual
customers might permit the distributors to share the data
with researchers (trying to lower energy costs) but forbid
