Opinion of the Court

based burden on detailers is dispelled by the record and by
formal legislative findings. As the District Court noted,
“[p]harmaceutical manufacturers are essentially the only
paying customers of the data vendor industry”; and the
almost invariable rule is that detailing by pharmaceutical
manufacturers is in support of brand-name drugs. 631
F. Supp. 2d, at 451. Vermont’s law thus has the effect of
preventing detailers—and only detailers—from communi
cating with physicians in an effective and informative
manner. Cf. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 766 (1993)
(explaining the “considerable value” of in-person solicita
tion). Formal legislative findings accompanying §4631(d)
confirm that the law’s express purpose and practical effect
are to diminish the effectiveness of marketing by manu
facturers of brand-name drugs. Just as the “inevitable
effect of a statute on its face may render it unconstitu
tional,” a statute’s stated purposes may also be considered.
United States v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 384 (1968). Here,
the Vermont Legislature explained that detailers, in
particular those who promote brand-name drugs, convey
messages that “are often in conflict with the goals of the
state.” 2007 Vt. No. 80, §1(3). The legislature designed
§4631(d) to target those speakers and their messages for
disfavored treatment. “In its practical operation,” Ver
mont’s law “goes even beyond mere content discrimina
tion, to actual viewpoint discrimination.” R. A. V. v. St.
Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 391 (1992). Given the legislature’s
expressed statement of purpose, it is apparent that
§4631(d) imposes burdens that are based on the content
of speech and that are aimed at a particular viewpoint.
Act 80 is designed to impose a specific, content-based
burden on protected expression. It follows that heightened
judicial scrutiny is warranted. See Cincinnati v. Discovery
Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 418 (1993) (applying height
ened scrutiny to “a categorical prohibition on the use of
newsracks to disseminate commercial messages”); id., at
