BREYER, J., dissenting

tients); §§4631(e)(5)–(6) (as otherwise provided by state or
federal law). Cf. Trans Union Corp., 245 F. 3d, at 819
(rejecting an underinclusiveness challenge because an
exception to the Fair Credit Reporting Act concerned
“ ‘exactly the sort of thing the Act seeks to promote’ ” (quot
ing Trans Union Corp. v. FTC, 81 F. 3d 228, 234 (CADC
1996)).
Nor can the majority find record support for its claim
that the statute helps “favored” speech and imposes a
“burde[n]” upon “disfavored speech by disfavored speak
ers.” Ante, at 19. The Court apparently means that the
statute (1) prevents pharmaceutical companies from creat
ing individualized messages that would help them sell
their drugs more effectively, but (2) permits “counterde
tailing” programs, which often promote generic drugs, to
create such messages using prescriber-identifying data. I
am willing to assume, for argument’s sake, that this con
sequence would significantly increase the statute’s nega
tive impact upon commercial speech. But cf. 21 CFR
§§202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii) (FDA’s “fair balance” require
ment); App. 193 (no similar FDA requirement for nondrug
manufacturers). The record before us, however, contains
no evidentiary basis for the conclusion that any such
individualized counterdetailing is widespread, or exists at
all, in Vermont.
The majority points out, ante, at 4, that Act 80, of which
§4631 was a part, also created an “evidence-based pre
scription drug education program,” in which the Vermont
Department of Health, the Department of Vermont Health
Access, and the University of Vermont, among others,
work together “to provide information and education on
the therapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescrip
tion drugs” to health professionals responsible for pre
scribing and dispensing prescription drugs, Vt. Stat. Ann.,
Tit. 18, §4622(a)(1). See generally §§4621–4622. But that
program does not make use of prescriber-identifying data.
