BREYER, J., dissenting

claratory judgment and injunction prohibiting the en
forcement of this statute. See 28 U. S. C. §2201; App. 49–
128. And they have neither shown nor claimed that they
could obtain significant amounts of “prescriber-identifiable
information” if the first two prohibitions are valid. If, as
I believe, the first two statutory prohibitions (related to
selling and disclosing the information) are valid, then
the dispute about the validity of the third provision is
not “ ‘real and substantial’ ” or “ ‘definite and concrete.’ ”
MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 127
(2007) (quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S.
227, 240–241 (1937)) (Article III does not permit courts to
entertain such disputes).
The Court, however, strikes down all three provisions,
and so I add that I disagree with the majority as to the
constitutionality of the third restriction as well—basically
for the reasons I have already set out. The prohibition
against pharmaceutical firms using this prescriber
identifying information works no more than modest First
Amendment harm; the prohibition is justified by the need
to ensure unbiased sales presentations, prevent unneces
sarily high drug costs, and protect the privacy of prescrib
ing physicians. There is no obvious equally effective, more
limited alternative.
V
In sum, I believe that the statute before us satisfies the
“intermediate” standards this Court has applied to restric
tions on commercial speech. A fortiori it satisfies less
demanding standards that are more appropriately applied
in this kind of commercial regulatory case—a case where
the government seeks typical regulatory ends (lower drug
prices, more balanced sales messages) through the use of
ordinary regulatory means (limiting the commercial use
of data gathered pursuant to a regulatory mandate). The
speech-related consequences here are indirect, incidental,
