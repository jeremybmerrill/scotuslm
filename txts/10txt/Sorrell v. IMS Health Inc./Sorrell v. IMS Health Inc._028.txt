SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
Opinion of the Court

the government, assess the value of the information pre
sented.” Edenfield, supra, at 767.
It is true that content-based restrictions on protected
expression are sometimes permissible, and that principle
applies to commercial speech. Indeed the government’s
legitimate interest in protecting consumers from “commer
cial harms” explains “why commercial speech can be sub
ject to greater governmental regulation than noncommer
cial speech.” Discovery Network, 507 U. S., at 426; see also
44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., 502 (opinion of Stevens, J.). The
Court has noted, for example, that “a State may choose to
regulate price advertising in one industry but not in oth

Amendment precedents. See Thompson, 535 U. S., at 373.
Nor does the State argue that the provision challenged
here will prevent false or misleading speech. Cf. post, at
10–11 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (collecting regulations that
the government might defend on this ground). The State’s
interest in burdening the speech of detailers instead turns
on nothing more than a difference of opinion. See Bolger,
463 U. S., at 69; Thompson, supra, at 376.

ment, presents serious and unresolved issues with respect
to personal privacy and the dignity it seeks to secure. In
considering how to protect those interests, however, the
State cannot engage in content-based discrimination to
advance its own side of a debate.
If Vermont’s statute provided that prescriber-identifying
