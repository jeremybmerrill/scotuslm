WILLIAM H. SORRELL, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 

VERMONT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

IMS HEALTH INC. ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[June 23, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and
JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
The Vermont statute before us adversely affects expres
sion in one, and only one, way. It deprives pharmaceutical
and data-mining companies of data, collected pursuant to
the government’s regulatory mandate, that could help
pharmaceutical companies create better sales messages.
In my view, this effect on expression is inextricably related
to a lawful governmental effort to regulate a commercial
enterprise. The First Amendment does not require courts
to apply a special “heightened” standard of review when
reviewing such an effort. And, in any event, the statute
meets the First Amendment standard this Court has
previously applied when the government seeks to regulate
commercial speech. For any or all of these reasons, the
Court should uphold the statute as constitutional.
I
The Vermont statute before us says pharmacies and
certain other entities
“shall not [1] sell . . . regulated records containing
prescriber-identifiable information, nor [2] permit the
use of [such] records . . . for marketing or promoting a
prescription drug, unless the prescriber consents.” Vt.
Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §4631(d) (Supp. 2010).
