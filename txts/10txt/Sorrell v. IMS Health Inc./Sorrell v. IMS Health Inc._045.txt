SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
BREYER, J., dissenting

Reply Brief for Petitioners 11.
The majority cites testimony by two witnesses in sup
port of its statement that “States themselves may supply
the prescriber-identifying information used in [counterde
tailing] programs.” Ante, at 4. One witness explained that
academic detailers in Pennsylvania work with state health
officials to identify physicians serving patients whose
health care is likewise state provided. App. 375. The
other, an IMS Health officer, observed that Vermont has
its own multipayer database containing prescriber
identifying data, which could be used to talk to doctors
about their prescription patterns and the lower costs
associated with generics. Id., at 313. But nothing in the
record indicates that any “counterdetailing” of this kind
has ever taken place in fact in Vermont. State-sponsored
health care professionals sometimes meet with small
groups of doctors to discuss best practices and generic
drugs generally. See University of Vermont, College of
Medicine, Office of Primary Care, Vermont Academic
Detailing Program (July 2010), http://www.med.uvm.edu/
ahec/downloads/VTAD_overview_2010.07.08.pdf (all Inter
net materials as visited June 21, 2011, and available in
Clerk of Court’s case file). Nothing in Vermont’s statute
prohibits brand-name manufacturers from undertaking a
similar effort.
The upshot is that the only commercial-speech-related
harm that the record shows this statute to have brought
about is the one I have previously described: The with
holding of information collected through a regulatory
program, thereby preventing companies from shaping a
commercial message they believe maximally effective. The
absence of precedent suggesting that this kind of harm
is serious reinforces the conclusion that the harm here is
modest at most.
