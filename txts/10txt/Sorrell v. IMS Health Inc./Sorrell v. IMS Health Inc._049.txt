SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
BREYER, J., dissenting

20.1(i) (forbidding disclosure of patient or prescriber in
formation to “unauthorized persons” without consent).
Exceptions to this norm are comparatively few. See, e.g.,
ibid. (identifying “authorized persons”); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.
18, §4631(e); App. 248, 255 (indicating that prescriber
identifying data is not widely disseminated). There is no
indication that the State of Vermont, or others in the
State, makes use of this information for counterdetailing
efforts. See supra, at 15.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers and the data miners
who sell information to those manufacturers would like to
create (and did create) an additional exception, which
means additional circulation of otherwise largely confi
dential information. Vermont’s statute closes that door.
At the same time, the statute permits doctors who wish
to permit use of their prescribing practices to do so.
§§4631(c)–(d). For purposes of Central Hudson, this would
seem sufficiently to show that the statute serves a mean
ingful interest in increasing the protection given to pre
scriber privacy. See Fox, 492 U. S., at 480 (in commercial
speech area, First Amendment requires “a fit that is not
necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not
necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope
is in proportion to the interest served” (internal quotation
marks omitted)); see also United States v. Edge Broadcast
ing Co., 509 U. S. 418, 434 (1993) (The First Amendment
does not “require that the Government make progress on
every front before it can make progress on any front”);
Burson, 504 U. S., at 207 (plurality opinion).

The majority cannot point to any adequately supported,
similarly effective “more limited restriction.” Central
Hudson, 447 U. S., at 564. It says that doctors “can, and
often do, simply decline to meet with detailers.” Ante, at
20. This fact, while true, is beside the point. Closing the
