BREYER, J., dissenting

commercial speech” because of the government’s “interest
in preventing commercial harms”), with ante, at 9–10, 11,
17–18, 24 (suggesting that Discovery Network supports
heightened scrutiny when regulations target commercial
speech).

The Court (suggesting a standard yet stricter than
Central Hudson) says that we must give content-based
restrictions that burden speech “heightened” scrutiny. It
adds that “[c]ommercial speech is no exception.” Ante,
at 10–11. And the Court then emphasizes that this is a
case involving both “content-based” and “speaker-based”
restrictions. See ante, at 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22,
24.
But neither of these categories—“content-based” nor
“speaker-based”—has ever before justified greater scrutiny
when regulatory activity affects commercial speech. See,
e.g., Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Mitchell, 333 F. Supp.
582 (DC 1971) (three-judge court), summarily aff’d
sub nom. Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Acting Attorney
General, 405 U. S. 1000 (1972) (upholding ban on radio
and television marketing of tobacco). And the absence of
any such precedent is understandable.
Regulatory programs necessarily draw distinctions on
the basis of content. Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S.,
at 761, 762 (“If there is a kind of commercial speech that
lacks all First Amendment protection, . . . it must be dis
tinguished by its content”). Electricity regulators, for
example, oversee company statements, pronouncements,
and proposals, but only about electricity. See, e.g., Vt.
Pub. Serv. Bd. Rules 3.100 (1983), 4.200 (1986), 5.200
(2004). The Federal Reserve Board regulates the content
of statements, advertising, loan proposals, and interest
rate disclosures, but only when made by financial institu
tions. See 12 CFR pts. 226, 230 (2011). And the FDA
