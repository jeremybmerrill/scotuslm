SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
Opinion of the Court

First Amendment rights as incorporated by the Four
teenth Amendment, the respondents sought declaratory
and injunctive relief against the petitioners, the Attorney
General and other officials of the State of Vermont.
After a bench trial, the United States District Court for
the District of Vermont denied relief. 631 F. Supp. 2d 434
(2009). The District Court found that “[p]harmaceutical
manufacturers are essentially the only paying customers
of the data vendor industry” and that, because detailing
unpatented generic drugs is not “cost-effective,” pharma
ceutical sales representatives “detail only branded drugs.”
Id., at 451, 442. As the District Court further concluded, “the Legislature’s determination that [prescriber
identifying] data is an effective marketing tool that en
ables detailers to increase sales of new drugs is supported
in the record.” Id., at 451. The United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. It
held that §4631(d) violates the First Amendment by bur
dening the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data
miners without an adequate justification. 630 F. 3d 263.
Judge Livingston dissented.
The decision of the Second Circuit is in conflict with de
cisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit concerning similar legislation enacted by
Maine and New Hampshire. See IMS Health Inc. v. Mills,
616 F. 3d 7 (CA1 2010) (Maine); Ayotte, supra (New Hampshire). Recognizing a division of authority regarding the
constitutionality of state statutes, this Court granted
certiorari. 562 U. S. __ (2011).
