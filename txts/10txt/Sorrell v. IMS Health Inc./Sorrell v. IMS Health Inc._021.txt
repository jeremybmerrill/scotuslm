Opinion of the Court

under two general headings. First, the State contends
that its law is necessary to protect medical privacy, includ
ing physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment,
and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship. Sec
ond, the State argues that §4631(d) is integral to the
achievement of policy objectives—namely, improved public
health and reduced healthcare costs. Neither justification
withstands scrutiny.

Vermont argues that its physicians have a “reasonable
expectation” that their prescriber-identifying information
“will not be used for purposes other than . . . filling and
processing” prescriptions. See 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,
§1(29). It may be assumed that, for many reasons, physi
cians have an interest in keeping their prescription deci
sions confidential. But §4631(d) is not drawn to serve that
interest. Under Vermont’s law, pharmacies may share
prescriber-identifying information with anyone for any rea
son save one: They must not allow the information to
be used for marketing. Exceptions further allow pharma
cies to sell prescriber-identifying information for certain
purposes, including “health care research.” §4631(e). And
the measure permits insurers, researchers, journalists,
the State itself, and others to use the information. See
§4631(d); cf. App. 370–372; id., at 211. All but conceding
that §4631(d) does not in itself advance confidentiality
interests, the State suggests that other laws might impose
separate bars on the disclosure of prescriber-identifying
information. See Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 20.1.
But the potential effectiveness of other measures cannot
justify the distinctive set of prohibitions and sanctions
imposed by §4631(d).
Perhaps the State could have addressed physician confi
dentiality through “a more coherent policy.” Greater New
