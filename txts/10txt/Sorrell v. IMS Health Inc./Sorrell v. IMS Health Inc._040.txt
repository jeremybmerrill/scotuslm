BREYER, J., dissenting

tell the doctor not to use the drug for that purpose. See 21
CFR pt. 99; cf. Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm.,
531 U. S. 341, 350–351 (2001) (discussing effect of similar
regulations in respect to medical devices); see also Pro
posed Rule, Revised Effectiveness Determination; Sun

76 Fed. Reg. 35672 (2011) (proposing to prohibit market
ing of sunscreens with sun protection factor (SPF) of
greater than 50 due to insufficient data “to indicate that
there is additional clinical benefit”).
If the Court means to create constitutional barriers to
regulatory rules that might affect the content of a com
mercial message, it has embarked upon an unprecedented
task—a task that threatens significant judicial interfer
ence with widely accepted regulatory activity. Cf., e.g., 21
CFR pts. 201–203. Nor would it ease the task to limit its
“heightened” scrutiny to regulations that only affect cer
tain speakers. As the examples that I have set forth
illustrate, many regulations affect only messages sent by a
small class of regulated speakers, for example, electricity
generators or natural gas pipelines.
The Court also uses the words “aimed” and “targeted”
when describing the relation of the statute to drug manu
facturers. Ante, at 8, 9, 12, 16. But, for the reasons just
set forth, to require “heightened” scrutiny on this basis is
to require its application early and often when the State
seeks to regulate industry. Any statutory initiative stems
from a legislative agenda. See, e.g., Message to Congress,
May 24, 1937, H. R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 4
(request from President Franklin Roosevelt for legislation
to ease the plight of factory workers). Any administrative
initiative stems from a regulatory agenda. See, e.g., Exec.
Order No. 12866, 58 Fed. Reg. 51735 (1993) (specifying
how to identify regulatory priorities and requiring agen
cies to prepare agendas). The related statutes, regula
tions, programs, and initiatives almost always reflect a
