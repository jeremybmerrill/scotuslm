SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.
Opinion of the Court

429 (“[T]he very basis for the regulation is the difference
in content between ordinary newspapers and commercial
speech” in the form of “commercial handbills . . . . Thus,
by any commonsense understanding of the term, the ban
in this case is ‘content based’ ” (some internal quotation
marks omitted)); see also Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 658 (1994) (explaining that
strict scrutiny applies to regulations reflecting “aversion”
to what “disfavored speakers” have to say). The Court has
recognized that the “distinction between laws burdening
and laws banning speech is but a matter of degree” and
that the “Government’s content-based burdens must sat

United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529
U. S. 803, 812 (2000). Lawmakers may no more silence

115 (1991) (content-based financial burden); Minneapolis
Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm’r of Revenue, 460
U. S. 575 (1983) (speaker-based financial burden).
The First Amendment requires heightened scrutiny
whenever the government creates “a regulation of speech
because of disagreement with the message it conveys.”
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989);
see also Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48
(1986) (explaining that “ ‘content-neutral’ speech regula
tions” are “those that are justified without reference to the
content of the regulated speech” (internal quotation marks
omitted)). A government bent on frustrating an impend
ing demonstration might pass a law demanding two years’
notice before the issuance of parade permits. Even if the
hypothetical measure on its face appeared neutral as to
content and speaker, its purpose to suppress speech and
its unjustified burdens on expression would render it
unconstitutional. Ibid. Commercial speech is no excep
