treatment options. The Vermont Legislature, however,
later repealed that provision. 2008 Vt. Laws No. 89, §3.
Act 80 was accompanied by legislative findings. Vt. Acts
No. 80, §1. Vermont found, for example, that the “goals of
marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals

by an association of pharmaceutical manufacturers that
produce brand-name drugs. These entities are the re
