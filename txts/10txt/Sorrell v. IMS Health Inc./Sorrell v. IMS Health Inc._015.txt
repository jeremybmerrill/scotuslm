Opinion of the Court

tion. See Discovery Network, supra, at 429–430 (commer
cial speech restriction lacking a “neutral justification” was
not content neutral). A “consumer’s concern for the free
flow of commercial speech often may be far keener than
his concern for urgent political dialogue.” Bates v. State
Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 364 (1977). That reality has
great relevance in the fields of medicine and public health,
where information can save lives.

The State argues that heightened judicial scrutiny is
unwarranted because its law is a mere commercial regula
tion. It is true that restrictions on protected expression
are distinct from restrictions on economic activity or, more
generally, on nonexpressive conduct. It is also true that
the First Amendment does not prevent restrictions di
rected at commerce or conduct from imposing inciden
tal burdens on speech. That is why a ban on race-based
hiring may require employers to remove “ ‘White Appli
cants Only’ ” signs, Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and
Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 62 (2006); why “an
ordinance against outdoor fires” might forbid “burning a
flag,” R. A. V., supra, at 385; and why antitrust laws can
prohibit “agreements in restraint of trade,” Giboney v.
Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 502 (1949).
But §4631(d) imposes more than an incidental burden
on protected expression. Both on its face and in its practi
cal operation, Vermont’s law imposes a burden based on
the content of speech and the identity of the speaker. See
supra, at 8–11. While the burdened speech results from
an economic motive, so too does a great deal of vital ex
pression. See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 818
(1975); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 266
(1964); see also United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533
U. S. 405, 410–411 (2001) (applying “First Amendment
scrutiny” where speech effects were not incidental and
