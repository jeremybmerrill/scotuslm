Opinion of the Court

agreed, to discuss the events of the prior weekend. Deny
ing any wrongdoing, J. D. B. explained that he had been in
the neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he
was seeking work mowing lawns. DiCostanzo pressed
J. D. B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain
work; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one
of the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her

The assistant principal urged J. D. B. to “do the right

99a. DiCostanzo then warned that he may need to seek a
secure custody order if he believed that J. D. B. would

J. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 668, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 137 (2009). The court
described the sequence of events set forth in the text. See id., at 670–
671, 686 S. E. 2d, at 139. (“Immediately following J. D. B.’s initial
confession, Investigator DiCostanzo informed J. D. B. that he did not
have to speak with him and that he was free to leave” (internal quota
