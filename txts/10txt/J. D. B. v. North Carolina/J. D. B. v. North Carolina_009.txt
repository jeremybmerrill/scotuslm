J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

& Leo, The Problem of False Confessions in the Post-DNA
World, 82 N. C. L. Rev. 891, 906–907 (2004)); see also
Miranda, 384 U. S., at 455, n. 23. That risk is all the
more troubling—and recent studies suggest, all the more
acute—when the subject of custodial interrogation is a
juvenile. See Brief for Center on Wrongful Convictions of
Youth et al. as Amici Curiae 21–22 (collecting empirical
studies that “illustrate the heightened risk of false confes
sions from youth”).
Recognizing that the inherently coercive nature of cus
todial interrogation “blurs the line between voluntary and
involuntary statements,” Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 435,
this Court in Miranda adopted a set of prophylactic mea
sures designed to safeguard the constitutional guarantee
against self-incrimination. Prior to questioning, a suspect
“must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that
any statement he does make may be used as evidence
against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an
attorney, either retained or appointed.” 384 U. S., at 444;
see also Florida v. Powell, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip
op., at 8) (“The four warnings Miranda requires are in
variable, but this Court has not dictated the words in
which the essential information must be conveyed”). And,
if a suspect makes a statement during custodial interroga
tion, the burden is on the Government to show, as a “pre
requisit[e]” to the statement’s admissibility as evidence in
the Government’s case in chief, that the defendant “volun
tarily, knowingly and intelligently” waived his rights.4
Miranda, 384 U. S., at 444, 475–476; Dickerson, 530 U. S.,
at 443–444.
——————
4 Amici on behalf of J. D. B. question whether children of all ages can
comprehend Miranda warnings and suggest that additional procedural
safeguards may be necessary to protect their Miranda rights. Brief for
Juvenile Law Center et al. as Amici Curiae 13–14, n. 7. Whatever the
merit of that contention, it has no relevance here, where no Miranda
warnings were administered at all.
