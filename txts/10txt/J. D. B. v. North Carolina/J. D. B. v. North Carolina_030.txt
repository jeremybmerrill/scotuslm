ALITO, J., dissenting

repeatedly cautioned against upsetting the careful “bal­
ance” that Miranda struck, Moran, supra, at 424, and it
has “refused to sanction attempts to expand [the] Miranda
holding” in ways that would reduce its “clarity.” See
Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658 (citing cases). Given this prac­
tice, there should be a “strong presumption” against the
Court’s new departure from the established custody test.
See United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630, 640 (2004)
(plurality opinion). In my judgment, that presumption
cannot be overcome here.
A
The Court’s rationale for importing age into the custody
standard is that minors tend to lack adults’ “capacity to
exercise mature judgment” and that failing to account for
that “reality” will leave some minors unprotected under
Miranda in situations where they perceive themselves to
be confined. See ante, at 10, 8. I do not dispute that many
suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to
police pressure than the average adult. As the Court
notes, our pre-Miranda cases were particularly attuned to
this “reality” in applying the constitutional requirement of
voluntariness in fact. Ante, at 9 (relying on Haley, 332
U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and Gallegos, 370 U. S.,
at 54). It is no less a “reality,” however, that many per­
sons over the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police
pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person. See
Payne, 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a “men­
tally dull 19-year-old youth” relevant in voluntariness
inquiry). Yet the Miranda custody standard has never
accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any
other individual defendants.
Indeed, it has always been the case under Miranda that
the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same
fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as
those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.
