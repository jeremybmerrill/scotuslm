Opinion of the Court

A divided panel of the North Carolina Court of Appeals
affirmed. In re J. D. B., 196 N. C. App. 234, 674 S. E. 2d
795 (2009). The North Carolina Supreme Court held, over
two dissents, that J. D. B. was not in custody when he
confessed, “declin[ing] to extend the test for custody to
include consideration of the age . . . of an individual sub
jected to questioning by police.” In re J. D. B., 363 N. C.
664, 672, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 140 (2009).3
We granted certiorari to determine whether the
Miranda custody analysis includes consideration of a
juvenile suspect’s age. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).

A

Any police interview of an individual suspected of a
crime has “coercive aspects to it.” Oregon v. Mathiason,
429 U. S. 492, 495 (1977) (per curiam). Only those inter
rogations that occur while a suspect is in police custody,
however, “heighte[n] the risk” that statements obtained
are not the product of the suspect’s free choice. Dickerson
v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 435 (2000).
By its very nature, custodial police interrogation entails
“inherently compelling pressures.” Miranda, 384 U. S., at
467. Even for an adult, the physical and psychological
isolation of custodial interrogation can “undermine the
individual’s will to resist and . . . compel him to speak
where he would not otherwise do so freely.” Ibid. Indeed,
the pressure of custodial interrogation is so immense that
it “can induce a frighteningly high percentage of people to
confess to crimes they never committed.” Corley v. United
States, 556 U. S. __, __ (2009) (slip op., at 16) (citing Drizin
——————
3 J. D. B.’s challenge in the North Carolina Supreme Court focused on
the lower courts’ conclusion that he was not in custody for purposes of
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). The North Carolina Su
preme Court did not address the trial court’s holding that the state
ments were voluntary, and that question is not before us.
