Opinion of the Court

Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115 (1982); accord,
Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 58 (2007); Roper v.
Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569 (2005); Johnson v. Texas, 509
U. S. 350, 367 (1993). It is a fact that “generates common
sense conclusions about behavior and perception.” Alva
rado, 541 U. S., at 674 (BREYER, J., dissenting). Such
conclusions apply broadly to children as a class. And, they
are self-evident to anyone who was a child once himself,
including any police officer or judge.
Time and again, this Court has drawn these common
sense conclusions for itself. We have observed that chil
dren “generally are less mature and responsible than
adults,” Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115–116; that they “often
lack the experience, perspective, and judgment to recog
nize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to them,”
Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 635 (1979) (plurality opin
ion); that they “are more vulnerable or susceptible to . . .
outside pressures” than adults, Roper, 543 U. S., at 569;
and so on. See Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 17) (finding no reason to “reconsider”
these observations about the common “nature of juve
niles”). Addressing the specific context of police interroga
tion, we have observed that events that “would leave a
man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a
lad in his early teens.” Haley v. Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 599
(1948) (plurality opinion); see also Gallegos v. Colorado,
370 U. S. 49, 54 (1962) (“[N]o matter how sophisticated,” a
juvenile subject of police interrogation “cannot be com
pared” to an adult subject). Describing no one child in
particular, these observations restate what “any parent
knows”—indeed, what any person knows—about children
generally. Roper, 543 U. S., at 569.5

is unnecessary to establish these commonsense propositions, the
literature confirms what experience bears out. See, e.g., Graham v.
