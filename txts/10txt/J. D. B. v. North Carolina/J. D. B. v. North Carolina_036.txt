ALITO, J., dissenting

making that determination.
C
Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task
is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into
account in other legal contexts. In particular, the Court
relies on the fact that the age of a defendant is a relevant
factor under the reasonable-person standard applicable in
negligence suits. Ante, at 11 (citing Restatement (Third)
of Torts §10, Comment b, p. 117 (2005)). But negligence is
generally a question for the jury, the members of which
can draw on their varied experiences with persons of
different ages. It also involves a post hoc determination,
in the reflective atmosphere of a deliberation room, about
whether the defendant conformed to a standard of care.
The Miranda custody determination, by contrast, must be
made in the first instance by police officers in the course of
an investigation that may require quick decisionmaking.
See Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658 (noting “the importance”
under Miranda of providing “a workable rule ‘to guide
police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to
reflect on and balance the social and individual interests
involved in the specific circumstances they confront’ ”);
Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 668, 669 (“[T]he custody inquiry
states an objective rule designed to give clear guidance to
the police”).
Equally inapposite are the Eighth Amendment cases the
Court cites in support of its new rule. Ante, at 9, 11, 12
(citing Eddings, 455 U. S. 104, Roper, 543 U. S. 551, and
Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010)). Those decisions
involve the “judicial exercise of independent judgment”
about the constitutionality of certain punishments. E.g.,
id., at ___ (slip op., at 16). Like the negligence standard,
they do not require on-the-spot judgments by the police.
Nor do state laws affording extra protection for juveniles
during custodial interrogation provide any support for
