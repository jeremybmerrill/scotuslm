J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
Syllabus

Held: A child’s age properly informs Miranda’s custody analysis. Pp. 5–
18.
(a) Custodial police interrogation entails “inherently compelling
pressures,” Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 467, that “can induce
a frighteningly high percentage of people to confess to crimes they
never committed,” Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. Recent
studies suggest that risk is all the more acute when the subject of
custodial interrogation is a juvenile. Whether a suspect is “in cus
tody” for Miranda purposes is an objective determination involving
two discrete inquires: “first, what were the circumstances surround
ing the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a
reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the
interrogation and leave.” Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112
(footnote omitted). The police and courts must “examine all of the
circumstances surrounding the interrogation,” Stansbury v. Califor
nia, 511 U. S. 318, 322, including those that “would have affected
how a reasonable person” in the suspect’s position “would perceive
his or her freedom to leave,” id., at 325. However, the test involves
no consideration of the particular suspect’s “actual mindset.” Yar
borough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 667. By limiting analysis to ob
jective circumstances, the test avoids burdening police with the task
of anticipating each suspect’s idiosyncrasies and divining how those
particular traits affect that suspect’s subjective state of mind. Berke
mer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 430–431. Pp. 5–8.
(b) In some circumstances, a child’s age “would have affected how a
reasonable person” in the suspect’s position “would perceive his or
her freedom to leave.” Stansbury, 511 U. S., at 325. Courts can ac
count for that reality without doing any damage to the objective na
ture of the custody analysis. A child’s age is far “more than a chrono
logical fact.” Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115. It is a fact
that “generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and percep
tion,” Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 674, that apply broadly to children as a
class. Children “generally are less mature and responsible than
adults,” Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115; they “often lack the experience,
perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could
be detrimental to them,” Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 635; and
they “are more vulnerable or susceptible to . . . outside pressures”
than adults, Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569. In the specific
context of police interrogation, events that “would leave a man cold
and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a” teen. Haley v. Ohio,
332 U. S. 596, 599. The law has historically reflected the same as
sumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise
mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to under
stand the world around them. Legal disqualifications on children as
