J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

Our various statements to this effect are far from
unique. The law has historically reflected the same as
sumption that children characteristically lack the capacity
to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incom
plete ability to understand the world around them. See,
e.g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of Eng
land *464–*465 (hereinafter Blackstone) (explaining that
limits on children’s legal capacity under the common law
“secure them from hurting themselves by their own im
provident acts”). Like this Court’s own generalizations,
the legal disqualifications placed on children as a class—
e.g., limitations on their ability to alienate property, enter

Commentaries on American Law *78–*79, *90 (G. Comstock ed., 11th
ed. 1867); see generally id., at *233 (explaining that, under the common
law, “[t]he necessity of guardians results from the inability of infants to
take care of themselves . . . and this inability continues, in contempla

*465 (“It is generally true, that an infant can neither aliene his lands,
nor do any legal act, nor make a deed, nor indeed any manner of
contract, that will bind him”); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569
(2005) (“In recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsi
bility of juveniles, almost every State prohibits those under 18 years
of age from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental
consent”).
