J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
ALITO, J., dissenting

“the characteristics of the accused,” Schneckloth v. Busta
monte, 412 U. S. 218, 226 (1973), and then “weigh[ed] . . .
the circumstances of pressure against the power of resis­
tance of the person confessing.” Stein v. New York, 346
U. S. 156, 185 (1953).
All manner of individualized, personal characteristics
were relevant in this voluntariness inquiry. Among the
most frequently mentioned factors were the defendant’s
education, physical condition, intelligence, and mental
health. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 693 (1993);
see Clewis v. Texas, 386 U. S. 707, 712 (1967) (“only a
fifth-grade education”); Greenwald v. Wisconsin, 390 U. S.
519, 520–521 (1968) (per curiam) (had not taken blood­
pressure medication); Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560,
562, n. 4, 567 (1958) (“mentally dull” and “ ‘slow to learn’ ”);
Fikes v. Alabama, 352 U. S. 191, 193, 196, 198 (1957) (“low
mentality, if not mentally ill”). The suspect’s age also
received prominent attention in several cases, e.g.,
Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49, 54 (1962), especially
when the suspect was a “mere child.” Haley v. Ohio, 332
U. S. 596, 599 (1948) (plurality opinion). The weight
assigned to any one consideration varied from case to case.
But all of these factors, along with anything else that
might have affected the “individual’s . . . capacity for
effective choice,” were relevant in determining whether
the confession was coerced or compelled. See Miranda
v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 506–507 (1966) (Harlan, J.,
dissenting).
The all-encompassing nature of the voluntariness in­
quiry had its benefits. It allowed courts to accommodate a
“complex of values,” Schneckloth, supra, at 223, 224, and
to make a careful, highly individualized determination as
to whether the police had wrung “a confession out of [the]
accused against his will.” Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S.
199, 206–207 (1960). But with this flexibility came a
decrease in both certainty and predictability, and the
