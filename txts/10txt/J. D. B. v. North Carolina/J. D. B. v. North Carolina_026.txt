ALITO, J., dissenting

voluntariness standard proved difficult “for law enforce­
ment officers to conform to, and for courts to apply in a
consistent manner.” Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S.
428, 444 (2000).
In Miranda, the Court supplemented the voluntariness
inquiry with a “set of prophylactic measures” designed to
ward off the “ ‘inherently compelling pressures’ of custodial
interrogation.” See Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. __, __
(2010) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467).
Miranda greatly simplified matters by requiring police to
give suspects standard warnings before commencing any
custodial interrogation. See id., at 479. Its requirements
are no doubt “rigid,” see Fare v. Michael C., 439 U. S.
1310, 1314 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers), and they
often require courts to suppress “trustworthy and highly
probative” statements that may be perfectly “voluntary
under [a] traditional Fifth Amendment analysis.” Fare v.
Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 718 (1979). But with this rigid­
ity comes increased clarity. Miranda provides “a worka­
ble rule to guide police officers,” New York v. Quarles, 467
U. S. 649, 658 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted),
and an administrable standard for the courts. As has
often been recognized, this gain in clarity and administra­
bility is one of Miranda’s “principal advantages.” Berke
mer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 430 (1984); see also Mis
souri v. Seibert, 542 U. S. 600, 622 (2004) (KENNEDY, J., con­
curring in judgment).
No less than other facets of Miranda, the threshold
requirement that the suspect be in “custody” is “designed
to give clear guidance to the police.” Yarborough v. Alva
rado, 541 U. S. 652, 668, 669 (2004). Custody under
Miranda attaches where there is a “formal arrest” or a
“restraint on freedom of movement” akin to formal arrest.
California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1125 (1983) (per
curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). This stan­
dard is “objective” and turns on how a hypothetical “rea­
