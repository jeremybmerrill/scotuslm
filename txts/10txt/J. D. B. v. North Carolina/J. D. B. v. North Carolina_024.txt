ALITO, J., dissenting

to effect a fundamental transformation of the Miranda
custody test—from a clear, easily applied prophylactic
rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the
voluntariness test that the Miranda Court found to be
unsatisfactory.
For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down
this road. First, many minors subjected to police interro­
gation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects
the one-size-fits-all Miranda custody rule may not be a
bad fit. Second, many of the difficulties in applying the
Miranda custody rule to minors arise because of the
unique circumstances present when the police conduct
interrogations at school. The Miranda custody rule has
always taken into account the setting in which question­
ing occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such
cases will address many of these problems. Third, in cases
like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially
young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness
standard can take special care to ensure that incriminat­
ing statements were not obtained through coercion.
Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does
not require the extreme makeover of Miranda that today’s
decision may portend.

In the days before Miranda, this Court’s sole metric for
evaluating the admissibility of confessions was a volun­
tariness standard rooted in both the Fifth Amendment’s
Self-Incrimination Clause and the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bram v. United States,
168 U. S. 532, 542 (1897) (Self-Incrimination Clause);
Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936) (due process).
The question in these voluntariness cases was whether the
particular “defendant’s will” had been “overborne.”
Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528, 534 (1963). Courts took
into account both “the details of the interrogation” and
