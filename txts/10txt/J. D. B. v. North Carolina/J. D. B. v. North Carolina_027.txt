J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
ALITO, J., dissenting

sonable person in the position of the individual being
questioned would gauge the breadth of his or her freedom
of action.” Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322–
323, 325 (1994) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks

Until today, the Court’s cases applying this test have
focused solely on the “objective circumstances of the inter­
rogation,” id., at 323, not the personal characteristics of
the interrogated. E.g., Berkemer, supra, at 442, and n. 35;

the questioning was through.6 The totality of these
circumstances—the external circumstances, that is, of the
interrogation itself—is what has mattered in this Court’s
cases. Personal characteristics of suspects have consis­

size-fits-all reasonable-person standard. Stansbury, supra,
at 323 (“[C]ustody depends on the objective circumstances
of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored
by either the interrogating officers or the person being
questioned”).
For example, in Berkemer v. McCarty, supra, police
officers conducting a traffic stop questioned a man who
had been drinking and smoking marijuana before he was
pulled over. Id., at 423. Although the suspect’s inebria­
