J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
ALITO, J., dissenting

tics in these and other custody cases should come as no
surprise. To account for such individualized considera­
tions would be to contradict Miranda’s central premise.
The Miranda Court’s decision to adopt its inflexible pro­
phylactic requirements was expressly based on the notion
that “[a]ssessments of the knowledge the defendant pos­
sessed, based on information as to his age, education,
intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be
more than speculation.” 384 U. S., at 468–469.

In light of this established practice, there is no denying
that, by incorporating age into its analysis, the Court is
embarking on a new expansion of the established custody
standard. And since Miranda is this Court’s rule, “not a
constitutional command,” it is up to the Court “to justify
its expansion.” Cf. Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 688
(1988) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). This the Court fails to
do.
In its present form, Miranda’s prophylactic regime
already imposes “high cost[s]” by requiring suppression of
confessions that are often “highly probative” and “volun­
tary” by any traditional standard. Oregon v. Elstad, 470
U. S. 298, 312 (1985); see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 444
(under Miranda “statements which may be by no means
involuntary, made by a defendant who is aware of his
‘rights,’ may nonetheless be excluded and a guilty defen­
dant go free as a result”). Nonetheless, a “core virtue” of
Miranda has been the clarity and precision of its guidance
to “police and courts.” Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680,
694 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Moran,
475 U. S., at 425 (“[O]ne of the principal advantages of
Miranda is the ease and clarity of its application” (inter­
nal quotation marks omitted)). This increased clarity “has
been thought to outweigh the burdens” that Miranda
imposes. Fare, 442 U. S., at 718. The Court has, however,
