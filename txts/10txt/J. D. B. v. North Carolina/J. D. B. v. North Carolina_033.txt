J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
ALITO, J., dissenting

teristic that may generate “conclusions about behavior and
perception.” Ante, at 9 (internal quotation marks omit­
ted). Under today’s decision, why should police officers
and courts “blind themselves,” ante, at 1, to the fact that a
suspect has “only a fifth-grade education”? See Clewis,
386 U. S., at 712 (voluntariness case). Alternatively, what
if the police know or should know that the suspect is “a
college-educated man with law school training”? See
Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 440 (1958), overruled
by Miranda, supra, at 479, and n. 48. How are these
individual considerations meaningfully different from age
in their “relationship to a reasonable person’s understand­
ing of his freedom of action”? Ante, at 11. The Court
proclaims that “[a] child’s age . . . is different,” ante, at 12,
but the basis for this ipse dixit is dubious.
I have little doubt that today’s decision will soon be cited
by defendants—and perhaps by prosecutors as well—for
the proposition that all manner of other individual charac­
teristics should be treated like age and taken into account
in the Miranda custody calculus. Indeed, there are al­
ready lower court decisions that take this approach. See
United States v. Beraun-Panez, 812 F. 2d 578, 581, modi­
fied 830 F. 2d 127 (CA9 1987) (“reasonable person who
was an alien”); In re Jorge D., 202 Ariz. 277, 280, 43
P. 3d 605, 608 (App. 2002) (age, maturity, and experience);
State v. Doe, 130 Idaho 811, 818, 948 P. 2d 166, 173
(1997) (same); In re Joshua David C., 116 Md. App. 580,
594, 698 A. 2d 1155, 1162 (1997) (“education, age, and
intelligence”).
In time, the Court will have to confront these issues,
and it will be faced with a difficult choice. It may choose
to distinguish today’s decision and adhere to the arbitrary
proclamation that “age . . . is different.” Ante, at 12. Or it
may choose to extend today’s holding and, in doing so,
further undermine the very rationale for the Miranda
regime.
