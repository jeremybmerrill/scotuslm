J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

463 U. S. 1121, 1125, n. 3 (1983) (per curiam).
The benefit of the objective custody analysis is that it is
“designed to give clear guidance to the police.” Alvarado,
541 U. S., at 668. But see Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 441
(recognizing the “occasiona[l] . . . difficulty” that police and
courts nonetheless have in “deciding exactly when a sus
pect has been taken into custody”). Police must make in
the-moment judgments as to when to administer Miranda
warnings. By limiting analysis to the objective circum
stances of the interrogation, and asking how a reasonable
person in the suspect’s position would understand his
freedom to terminate questioning and leave, the objective
test avoids burdening police with the task of anticipating
the idiosyncrasies of every individual suspect and divining
how those particular traits affect each person’s subjective
state of mind. See id., at 430–431 (officers are not re
quired to “make guesses” as to circumstances “unknow
able” to them at the time); Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 668
(officers are under no duty “to consider . . . contingent
psychological factors when deciding when suspects should
be advised of their Miranda rights”).
B
The State and its amici contend that a child’s age has no
place in the custody analysis, no matter how young the
child subjected to police questioning. We cannot agree. In
some circumstances, a child’s age “would have affected
how a reasonable person” in the suspect’s position “would
perceive his or her freedom to leave.” Stansbury, 511
U. S., at 325. That is, a reasonable child subjected to
police questioning will sometimes feel pressured to submit
when a reasonable adult would feel free to go. We think
it clear that courts can account for that reality without
doing any damage to the objective nature of the custody
analysis.
A child’s age is far “more than a chronological fact.”
