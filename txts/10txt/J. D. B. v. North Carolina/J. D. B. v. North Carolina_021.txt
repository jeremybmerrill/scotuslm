J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA
Opinion of the Court

age from the custody analysis comes at no cost to juve
niles’ constitutional rights because the due process volun
tariness test independently accounts for a child’s youth.
To be sure, that test permits consideration of a child’s age,
and it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendant’s
inculpatory statements at trial. See Gallegos, 370 U. S., at
53–55; Haley, 332 U. S., at 599–601; see also post, at 17–
18 (“[C]ourts should be instructed to take particular care
to ensure that [young children’s] incriminating statements
were not obtained involuntarily”). But Miranda’s proce
dural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness
test is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation
is at stake. See 384 U. S., at 458 (“Unless adequate pro
tective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion
inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained
from the defendant can truly be the product of his free
choice”); Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 442 (“[R]eliance on the
traditional totality-of-the-circumstances test raise[s] a risk
of overlooking an involuntary custodial confession”); see
also supra, at 5–6. To hold, as the State requests, that a
child’s age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been
taken into custody—and thus to ignore the very real dif
ferences between children and adults—would be to deny
children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that
Miranda guarantees to adults.

The question remains whether J. D. B. was in custody
when police interrogated him. We remand for the state
courts to address that question, this time taking account
of all of the relevant circumstances of the interrogation,
including J. D. B.’s age at the time. The judgment of the
North Carolina Supreme Court is reversed, and the case
is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
