Opinion of the Court

Because these measures protect the individual against
the coercive nature of custodial interrogation, they are
required “ ‘only where there has been such a restriction on
a person’s freedom as to render him “in custody.” ’ ” Stans
bury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322 (1994) (per curiam)
(quoting Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 495 (1977)
(per curiam)).
As we have repeatedly emphasized,
whether a suspect is “in custody” is an objective inquiry.
“Two discrete inquiries are essential to the determina
tion: first, what were the circumstances surrounding
the interrogation; and second, given those circum
stances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she
was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and
leave. Once the scene is set and the players’ lines and
actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an ob
jective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there
a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement
of the degree associated with formal arrest.” Thomp
son v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995) (internal quo
tation marks, alteration, and footnote omitted).
See also Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 662–663
(2004); Stansbury, 511 U. S., at 323; Berkemer v. McCarty,
468 U. S. 420, 442, and n. 35 (1984). Rather than demar
cate a limited set of relevant circumstances, we have
required police officers and courts to “examine all of the
circumstances surrounding the interrogation,” Stansbury,
511 U. S., at 322, including any circumstance that “would
have affected how a reasonable person” in the suspect’s
position “would perceive his or her freedom to leave,” id.,
at 325. On the other hand, the “subjective views harbored
by either the interrogating officers or the person being
questioned” are irrelevant. Id., at 323. The test, in other
words, involves no consideration of the “actual mindset” of
the particular suspect subjected to police questioning.
