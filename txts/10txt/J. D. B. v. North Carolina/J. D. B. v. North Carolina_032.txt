ALITO, J., dissenting

Miranda custody rule is now to be radically transformed
into one that takes into account the wide range of individ­
ual characteristics that are relevant in determining
whether a confession is voluntary, the Court must shoul­
der the burden of explaining why age is different from
these other personal characteristics.
Why, for example, is age different from intelligence?
Suppose that an officer, upon going to a school to question
a student, is told by the principal that the student has an
I. Q. of 75 and is in a special-education class. Cf. In re
J. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 666, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 136–137
(2009). Are those facts more or less important than the
student’s age in determining whether he or she “felt . . . at
liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave”? See
Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995). An I. Q.
score, like age, is more than just a number. Ante, at 8
(“[A]ge is far ‘more than a chronological fact’ ”). And an
individual’s intelligence can also yield “conclusions” simi­
lar to those “we have drawn ourselves” in cases far afield
of Miranda. Ante, at 12. Compare ibid. (relying on Ed
dings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), and Roper v.
Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005)), with Smith v. Texas, 543
U. S. 37, 44–45 (2004) (per curiam).
How about the suspect’s cultural background? Suppose
the police learn (or should have learned, see ante, at 11)
that a suspect they wish to question is a recent immigrant
from a country in which dire consequences often befall any
person who dares to attempt to cut short any meeting with
the police.9 Is this really less relevant than the fact that a
suspect is a month or so away from his 18th birthday?
The defendant’s education is another personal charac­

United States v. Chalan, 812 F. 2d 1302, 1307 (CA10 1987) (re­
jecting claim that Native American suspect was “in custody” for
Miranda purposes because, by custom, obedience to tribal authorities
was “expected of all tribal members”).
