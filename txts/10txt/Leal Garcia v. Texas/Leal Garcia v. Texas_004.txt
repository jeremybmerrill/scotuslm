LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS
Per Curiam

at 760. Here, the United States studiously refuses to
argue that Leal was prejudiced by the Vienna Convention
violation, contending instead that the Court should issue a
stay simply in light of the possibility that Leal might be
able to bring a Vienna Convention claim in federal court,
regardless of whether his conviction will be found to be
invalid. We decline to follow the United States’ suggestion
of granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on
hypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to
say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any
prospect of success. We may note that in a portion of its
opinion vacated by the Fifth Circuit on procedural
grounds, the District Court found that any violation of the
Vienna Convention would have been harmless. Leal v.
Quarterman, 2007 WL 4521519, *7 (WD Tex.), vacated in
part sub nom. Leal Garcia v. Quarterman, 573 F. 3d 214,
224–225 (2009).
The applications for stay of execution presented to
JUSTICE SCALIA and by him referred to the Court are
denied. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus is
denied.*
It is so ordered.
