LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS
BREYER, J., dissenting

Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 1 (hereinafter
U. S. Brief); see also id., at 11–13, 26, 30. The United
States has signed and ratified the Vienna Convention, a
treaty under which the United States has promised,
among other things, to inform an arrested foreign na
tional, such as Leal, that he has a right to request the
assistance of his country’s consulate. Vienna Convention
on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), Art. 36, Apr.
24, 1963, 21 U. S. T. 77, 100–101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. The
United States has also signed and ratified an optional
protocol, a treaty in which the United States agrees that
“[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation of application
of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdic
tion of the International Court of Justice.” Optional Pro
tocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes
(Optional Protocol), Art. I, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U. S. T. 325,
326, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. Although the United States has
since given notice of withdrawal from the Optional Proto
col, see Letter from Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State,
to Kofi A. Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations
(Mar. 7, 2005), that withdrawal does not alter the binding
status of its prewithdrawal obligations, see U. S. Brief 22,
n. 4.
When officials of the State of Texas arrested Leal,
they failed to inform him of his Vienna Convention rights,
thereby placing the United States in violation of its obliga
tions under that Convention. And so far neither Texas nor
any other judicial authority has implemented what the
International Court of Justice found (in a related case
brought by the Government of Mexico) to be the proper
remedy for that Convention violation, namely a hearing
to determine whether that violation amounted in effect to
harmless error. Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexi­
can Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. 12, 61–64. See
