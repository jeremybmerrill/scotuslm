LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS
BREYER, J., dissenting

requests. In reaching its contrary conclusion, the Court
ignores the appeal of the President in a matter related
to foreign affairs, it substitutes its own views about the
likelihood of congressional action for the views of Execu
tive Branch officials who have consulted with Members of
Congress, and it denies the request by four Members of
the Court to delay the execution until the Court can dis
cuss the matter at Conference in September. In my view,
the Court is wrong in each respect.
I respectfully dissent.
