v.
RICK THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF
CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS
DIVISION
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY AND ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR 

THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[July 7, 2011]


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
The petitioner, Humberto Leal Garcia (Leal), convicted
16 years ago of capital murder, is scheduled to be executed
this evening. He asks this Court to stay his execution
pending resolution of his petitions for writs of certiorari
and habeas corpus. I would grant the applications and
stay the execution.
As the Solicitor General points out, Leal’s execution at
this time “would place the United States in irreparable
breach” of its “obligation[s]” under international law.
