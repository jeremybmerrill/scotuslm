LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS
BREYER, J., dissenting

States into compliance with its treaty obligations and
provide Leal with the hearing that those obligations le

At the same time, the Solicitor General sets forth strong
reasons, related to the conduct of foreign affairs, for grant

“foreign-policy interests of the highest order.” Id., at 11.

abroad to have the benefits of consular assistance in
the event of detention.” Id., at 12.
These statements are supported by the fact that the
Government of Mexico has also filed a brief in which it

with the United States on a number of joint ventures,
including extraditions, mutual judicial assistance, and
our efforts to strengthen our common border.” Brief
for United Mexican States as Amicus Curiae 23 (in
ternal quotation marks omitted).
This Court has described interests of the kind set forth
by the Solicitor General as “plainly compelling.” Medellín,

(observing harms that would flow from noncompliance).
The Court has long recognized the President’s special
constitutionally based authority in matters of foreign
