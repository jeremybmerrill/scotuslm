BREYER, J., dissenting

Avena”). In other words, the international court made
clear that Leal is entitled to a certain procedure, namely
a hearing. That being so, a domestic court’s guesses as
to the results of that procedure are, as far as our treaty
obligations are concerned, irrelevant.
This Court subsequently held that, because Congress
had not embodied our international legal obligations in a
statute, the Court lacked the power to enforce those obliga
tions as a matter of domestic law. Medellín v. Texas, 552
U. S. 491, 525–526 (2008) (“The responsibility for trans
forming an international obligation arising from a non
self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress”).
And the Court later refused to grant a stay of execution in
a similar case in significant part because “the President
. . . has [not] represented to us that there is any likelihood
of congressional . . . action.” Medellín v. Texas, 554 U. S.
759, 759–760 (2008) (per curiam).
But these applications for stay do not suffer from this
last mentioned legal defect. The Solicitor General has
filed an amicus brief in which he states that “after ex

the Department of Justice,” Senator Patrick Leahy, the
chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has
introduced (and expressed an intention to hold speedy
hearings on) a bill that would permit Leal and other simi

national law requires. U. S. Brief 8; see id., at 8–9, 12–13
(describing the Consular Notification Compliance Act of
2011, S. 1194, 112th Cong., 1st Sess.). The amicus brief
indicates that “congressional . . . action” is a reasonable
possibility. Medellín, 554 U. S., at 760. And the Solicitor
General urges this Court to grant a stay, providing Con
gress with adequate time to carry out the legal responsi
bility that this Court has held belongs to the Legislative
Branch, Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 525–526 (2008),
namely the enactment of a law that will bring the United
