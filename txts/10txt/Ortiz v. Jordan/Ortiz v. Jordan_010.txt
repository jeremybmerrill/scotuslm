Opinion of the Court

II
The jurisdiction of a Court of Appeals under 28 U. S. C.
§1291 extends only to “appeals from . . . final decisions of
the district courts.” Ordinarily, orders denying summary
judgment do not qualify as “final decisions” subject to
appeal. Summary judgment must be denied when the
court of first instance determines that a “genuine dispute
as to [a] material fact” precludes immediate entry of
judgment as a matter of law. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a).
Such rulings, we have observed, are “by their terms inter
locutory.” Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737,
744 (1976).
Because a plea of qualified immunity can spare an
official not only from liability but from trial, we have
recognized a limited exception to the categorization of
summary judgment denials as nonappealable orders.
Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 525–526 (1985). When
summary judgment is denied to a defendant who urges
that qualified immunity shelters her from suit, the court’s
order “finally and conclusively [disposes of] the defen
dant’s claim of right not to stand trial.” Id., at 527 (em
phasis deleted). Therefore, Mitchell held, an immediate
appeal may be pursued. Ibid.
We clarified in Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304 (1995),
that immediate appeal from the denial of summary judg
ment on a qualified immunity plea is available when the
appeal presents a “purely legal issue,” illustratively, the
determination of “what law was ‘clearly established’ ” at
the time the defendant acted. Id., at 313. However, in
stant appeal is not available, Johnson held, when the
district court determines that factual issues genuinely in
dispute preclude summary adjudication. Ibid.
Jordan and Bright sought no immediate appeal from the
denial of their motion for summary judgment. In light of
Johnson, that abstinence is unsurprising. Moreover, even
had instant appellate review been open to them, the time
