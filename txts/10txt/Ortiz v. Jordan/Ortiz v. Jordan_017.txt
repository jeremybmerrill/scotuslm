THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

ment, the Court of Appeals considered the pretrial or full
trial record is beside the point.
I also think it unwise to reach the Rule 50 issue and the
questions that follow. Ortiz’s opening brief at the merits
stage focused on the question presented—whether the
Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review an order
denying summary judgment. It was not until Jordan and
Bright’s response brief in this Court, in which they argued
that they had not actually appealed the order denying
summary judgment, that the Rule 50 issues were ad
dressed at any length. This Court normally proceeds
more cautiously. Moreover, the Court of Appeals did not
address these issues at all, and we are ordinarily “a court
of final review and not first view.” Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110 (2001) (per curiam)
(internal quotation marks omitted). This seems a good
rule to follow in a case like this, which raises difficult and
far-reaching questions of civil procedure.
For these reasons, I would resolve only the question on
which we granted certiorari. I concur in the judgment.
