ORTIZ v. JORDAN
Opinion of the Court

manager at Ortiz’s living unit, and Rebecca Bright, a
prison investigator, moved for summary judgment on their
pleas of “qualified immunity,” a defense that shields offi
cials from suit if their conduct “d[id] not violate clearly
established statutory or constitutional rights of which a
reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzger
ald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). Finding that the qualified
immunity defense turned on material facts genuinely in
dispute, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a), the District Judge
denied summary judgment.
Ortiz v. Voinovich, 211
F. Supp. 2d 917, 923–930 (SD Ohio 2002).
The case then proceeded to trial, and the jury returned
verdicts for Ortiz against both Jordan and Bright. The
two officers appealed to the United States Court of Ap
peals for the Sixth Circuit, targeting, inter alia, the denial
of their pretrial motion for summary judgment. “[C]ourts
normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment
motion after a trial on the merits,” the Court of Appeals
recognized. 316 Fed. Appx. 449, 453 (2009). Nevertheless,
the Court continued, “denial of summary judgment based
on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule.” Ibid.
Reversing the judgment entered on the jury’s verdict, the
appeals court held that both defendants were sheltered
from Ortiz’s suit by qualified immunity.
We granted review, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), to decide a
threshold question on which the Circuits are split: May a
party, as the Sixth Circuit believed, appeal an order deny
ing summary judgment after a full trial on the merits?1
Our answer is no. The order retains its interlocutory
——————
1 Compare, e.g., Black v. J. I. Case Co., 22 F. 3d 568, 570–571 (CA5
1994) (declining to review denial of summary judgment after trial);
Price v. Kramer, 200 F. 3d 1237, 1243–1244 (CA9 2000) (no exception
where summary judgment rejected assertion of qualified immunity),
with Goff v. Bise, 173 F. 3d 1068, 1072 (CA8 1999) (denial of summary
judgment based on qualified immunity reviewable after trial on the
merits); 316 Fed. Appx. 449, 453 (CA6 2009) (case below) (same).
