ORTIZ v. JORDAN
Opinion of the Court

ther defendant appealed the District Court’s denial of
summary judgment.
The case proceeded to trial, and a jury returned a ver
dict of $350,000 in compensatory and punitive damages
against Jordan and $275,000 against Bright. Jordan and
Bright sought judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to
Rule 50(a), both at the close of Ortiz’s evidence and at the
close of their own presentation. But they did not contest
the jury’s liability finding by renewing, under Rule 50(b),
their request for judgment as a matter of law. Nor did
they request a new trial under Rule 59(a). The District
Court entered judgment for Ortiz in accordance with the
jury’s verdict.
On appeal, Jordan and Bright urged both that the Dis
trict Court should have granted them summary judgment
on their defense of qualified immunity and that the ver
dict was “against the weight of the evidence.” Brief for
Defendants-Appellants in No. 06–3627 (CA6), pp. 21, 26.
Appraising the parties’ evidence under a de novo standard
of review, the Court of Appeals “reverse[d] the denial of
qualified immunity to both Bright and Jordan.” 316 Fed.
Appx., at 455.5
We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the
Circuits as to whether a party may appeal a denial of
summary judgment after a district court has conducted a
full trial on the merits. See n. 1, supra.

feared a further sexual attack.” 211 F. Supp. 2d, at 925. Concerning
Bright, the Court noted that “[a] jury could reasonably find that
Bright[’s] . . . purported reason for placing Ortiz in security control was
pretextual.” Id., at 928.
5 Judge Daughtrey dissented; in her view, the strength of the evi
dence against Jordan and Bright amply supported the jury’s verdict.
316 Fed. Appx., at 456–457. Quoting Kiphart v. Saturn Corp., 251
F. 3d 573, 581 (CA6 2001), she observed that appellate courts “do not
weigh the evidence, evaluate the credibility of witnesses or substitute
our own judgment for that of the jury.” 316 Fed. Appx., at 457.
