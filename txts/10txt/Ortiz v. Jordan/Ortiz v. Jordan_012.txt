Opinion of the Court

“[Q]uestions going to the sufficiency of the evidence are
not preserved for appellate review by a summary judg
ment motion alone,” Jordan and Bright acknowledge;
rather, challenges of that order “must be renewed post
trial under Rule 50.” Brief for Respondents 11. Jordan
and Bright insist, however, in defense of the Sixth Cir
cuit’s judgment, that sufficiency of the evidence is not
what is at stake in this case. A qualified immunity plea
raising an issue of a “purely legal nature,” they urge, ibid.,
is preserved for appeal by an unsuccessful motion for
summary judgment, and need not be brought up again
under Rule 50(b). Id., at 11–12 (citing as pathmarking
Rekhi v. Wildwood Indus., Inc., 61 F. 3d 1313, 1318 (CA7
1995)). Unlike an “evidence sufficiency” claim that neces
sarily “hinge[s] on the facts adduced at trial,” they main
tain, a purely legal issue can be resolved “with reference
only to undisputed facts.” Brief for Respondents 16 (quot
ing Mitchell, 472 U. S., at 530, n. 10).
We need not address this argument, for the officials’
claims of qualified immunity hardly present “purely legal”
issues capable of resolution “with reference only to undis
puted facts.” Cases fitting that bill typically involve con
tests not about what occurred, or why an action was taken
or omitted, but disputes about the substance and clarity of
pre-existing law. See Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299,
313 (1996); Johnson, 515 U. S, at 317.
Here, however, the pre-existing law was not in contro
versy. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 834, 847
(1994) (prison official may be held liable for “deliberate
indifference” to a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment right to
protection against violence while in custody if the official
“knows that [the] inmat[e] face[s] a substantial risk of
serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take

Ortiz thus responded altogether appropriately to the arguments Jordan

and Bright made.
