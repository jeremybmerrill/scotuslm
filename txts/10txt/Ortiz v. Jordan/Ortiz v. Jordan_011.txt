ORTIZ v. JORDAN
Opinion of the Court

to seek that review expired well in advance of trial. See
Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A) (notice of appeal must
generally be filed “within 30 days after the judgment or
order appealed from”). Nor did they avail themselves of
Rule 50(b), which permits the entry, postverdict, of judg
ment for the verdict loser if the court finds that the evi
dence was legally insufficient to sustain the verdict. See
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a), (b). Absent such a motion, we
have repeatedly held, an appellate court is “powerless” to
review the sufficiency of the evidence after trial.

U. S. 394, 405 (2006); see Cone, 330 U. S., at 218.6

and Bright contend that their failure to file a Rule 50(b)
motion cannot be the basis for overturning the judgment of the Court of
Appeals. Because Ortiz presented no argument about the absence of a
Rule 50(b) motion in her brief to the Sixth Circuit or in her petition for
certiorari, Jordan and Bright argue, she has forfeited the objection.
Jordan and Bright are not well positioned to make this argument.
They did not suggest that Ortiz had forfeited her Rule 50(b) objection,
or argue that such an objection is forfeitable, until their merits brief to
this Court. Ordinarily we do not consider “a nonjurisdictional argu
ment not raised in a respondent’s brief in opposition to a petition.”
Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 34 (2004) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
In any case, we do not see how Ortiz can be held to have forfeited
her Rule 50(b) objection. The arguments Jordan and Bright made in
the Court of Appeals invited no such objection. Jordan and Bright
urged on appeal that the jury’s verdict was “against the weight of the
evidence.” Brief for Defendants-Appellants in No. 06-3627 (CA6), pp.
21–43. A plea that a verdict is “against the weight of the evidence,” of
course, is not equivalent to a plea that the evidence submitted at trial
was insufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury. 11 C.
Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure §2806,
pp. 65–67 (2d ed. 1995 and Supp. 2010). A determination that a verdict
is against the weight of the evidence may gain a new trial for the
verdict loser, but never a final judgment in that party’s favor. Mont
gomery Ward & Co. v. Duncan, 311 U. S. 243, 250–251 (1940). Ortiz
objected, accordingly, that Jordan and Bright had not asked the Dis
trict Court for a new trial and were therefore “bar[red] [from] appeal on
this ground.” Brief for Plaintiff-Appellee in No. 06–3627 (CA6), p. 23.
