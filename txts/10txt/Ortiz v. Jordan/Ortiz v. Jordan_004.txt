MICHELLE ORTIZ, PETITIONER v. PAULA JORDAN 

ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[January 24, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
We address in this case a procedural issue arising in a
civil rights action brought under 42 U. S. C. §1983 by
Michelle Ortiz, a former inmate at the Ohio Reformatory
for Women. Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Ortiz filed a
complaint in federal court stating key facts on which she
based claims for damages against superintending prison
officers. On two consecutive nights during her one-year
incarceration, Ortiz stated, she was sexually assaulted by
a corrections officer. Although she promptly reported the
first incident, she further alleged, prison authorities took
no measures to protect her against the second assault.
After that assault, Ortiz charged, and in retaliation for
accounts she gave of the two episodes, prison officials
placed her, shackled and handcuffed, in solitary confine
ment in a cell without adequate heat, clothing, bedding, or
blankets. The treatment to which she was exposed, Ortiz
claimed, violated her right, safeguarded by the Eighth and
Fourteenth Amendments, to reasonable protection from
violence while in custody.
