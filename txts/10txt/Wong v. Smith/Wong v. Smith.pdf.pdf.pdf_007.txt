ALITO, J., dissenting

panel majority disapproved of the trial judge’s “mandatory
language” directing the jury to “ ‘consider and discuss’ ” the
evidence highlighted by the court. Id., at 1082–1083.
Whatever potential for coercion these comments caused,
the California appellate court’s decision upholding them
“was clearly not unreasonable” under the general Lowen
field standard. See Renico, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
12). I would grant certiorari in this case and correct the
Ninth Circuit’s error.
