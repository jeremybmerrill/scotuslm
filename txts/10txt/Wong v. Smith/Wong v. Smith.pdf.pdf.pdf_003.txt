ALITO, J., dissenting

witnesses. ’ ” Id., at 1078. The jury continued their delib
erations; a short time later, they returned a guilty verdict
against Smith on the oral-copulation count.
Smith argued on appeal that the judge’s comments
coerced the jury’s verdict. A California intermediate
appellate court rejected that claim. The California Su
preme Court denied review. Smith then filed a federal
petition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U. S. C. §2254, which
the District Court granted. A split Ninth Circuit panel
affirmed.
II
Smith’s claim on federal habeas is that the California
appellate court unreasonably applied this Court’s clearly
established law forbidding coercive jury instructions.
§2254(d)(1); see Brief in Opposition 12. “[C]learly estab
lished” law under §2254(d)(1) consists of “the holdings, as
opposed to the dicta, of this Court’s” cases. Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000). An “unreasonable ap
plication” of that law involves not just an erroneous or
incorrect decision, but an objectively unreasonable one.
Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___ (2010).
The clearly established law relevant to this case is
sparse. Just one of this Court’s decisions, Lowenfield v.
Phelps, 484 U. S. 231 (1988), has addressed the constitu
tional rule against coercive jury instructions. And Lowen
field held only that, on the totality of the circumstances
present there, no unconstitutional coercion resulted. Id.,
at 241. The Court has also decided several cases on the
specific practice of judicial comment on the evidence. E.g.,
Quercia v. United States, 289 U. S. 466 (1933). But all of
those cases arose under this Court’s supervisory power
over federal courts; they set no clearly established consti
tutional limits under AEDPA. See Early v. Packer, 537
U. S. 3, 10 (2002) (per curiam). As a result, the clearly
established law in this area provides very little specific
