WONG v. SMITH
ALITO, J., dissenting

guidance. About all that can be said is that coercive in
structions are unconstitutional, coerciveness must be
judged on the totality of the circumstances, and the facts
of Lowenfield (polling a deadlocked jury and reading a
slightly modified Allen charge) were not unconstitutionally
coercive. See 484 U. S., at 237–241.
A general standard such as this gives state courts wide
latitude for reasonable decisionmaking under AEDPA.
Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004) (“The
more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in
reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations”). That
latitude is wider still in this case, as no constitutional
decision of this Court has ever explained how the general
rule against “coercion” applies to the traditional practice of
judicial comment on the evidence. Cf. Carey v. Musladin,
549 U. S. 70, 76 (2006).
For centuries, trial judges have enjoyed authority to
comment on the evidence. At common law, the judge was
empowered to “weig[h] the evidence” and share an “opin
ion” with the jury, even “in matter of fact.” 2 M. Hale,
History of the Common Law of England 147 (5th ed. 1794)
(hereinafter Hale).* The practice is well established in
this Court’s cases as well. The Court has recognized that
a trial judge has “discretion” to “comment upon the evi
dence,” to call the jury’s “attention to parts of it which he
thinks important,” and to “express his opinion upon the
facts.” Vicksburg & Meridian R. Co. v. Putnam, 118 U. S.
545, 553 (1886); Quercia, supra, at 469.

* See J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law
188, n. 2 (1898) (trial by jury “in a form which would withhold from the
jury the assistance of the court in dealing with the facts” is not “trial by
jury in any historic sense of the word”); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2551,
p. 664 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (hereinafter Wigmore) (comment on the
evidence “existed at common law since the beginning of jury trial, and
must be regarded historically as an essential and inseparable part of
jury trial”).
