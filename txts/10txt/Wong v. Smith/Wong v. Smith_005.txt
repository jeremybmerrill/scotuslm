ALITO, J., dissenting

To be sure, the practice has for many years been on the
wane. Comment on the evidence has always been more
popular in Britain than it ever was in this country. See 9
Wigmore §2551, at 666. That said, federal courts and
several States continue to recognize judicial authority to
comment on the evidence, and California expressly pro
tects the practice in its State Constitution. Cal. Const.,
Art. VI, §10.
This long tradition, combined with the complete absence
of constitutional precedent on how to apply Lowenfield’s
anticoercion principle in this context, shows that federal
courts should tread lightly when faced with a claim that
judicial comment on the evidence runs afoul of clearly
established federal law. Outside of extreme cases, most
decisions approving traditional uses of this common-law
practice should fall within the bounds of reasonable deci
sionmaking under AEDPA.

at 1077. The judge then directed the jurors to particular
evidence—the defendants’ initial statements to police—
and highlighted for them certain “ ‘consistencies and in
consistencies’ ” between those statements. Ibid. This
practice of drawing the jury’s “attention to parts” of the
evidence that the judge thinks “ ‘important’ ” lies at the
recognized core of the common-law power to comment on
the evidence. See Vicksburg, supra, at 553; Hale 147 (The
judge “is able, . . . in matters of fact, to give [the jury]
great light and assistance, by . . . observing where the
question and knot of the business lies; and by showing
them his opinion even in matter of fact” (some capitaliza
