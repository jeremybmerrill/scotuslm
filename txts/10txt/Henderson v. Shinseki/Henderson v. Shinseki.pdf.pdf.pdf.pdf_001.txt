HENDERSON, AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF HEN-

DERSON, DECEASED v. SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF 

VETERANS AFFAIRS 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
No. 09–1036. Argued December 6, 2010—Decided March 1, 2011
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a two-step process for
adjudicating veterans’ benefits claims for service-connected disabili
ties: A VA regional office makes an initial decision on the claim; and
a veteran dissatisfied with the decision may then seek de novo review
in the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. Before 1988, a veteran whose
claim was denied by the Board generally could not obtain further re
view, but the Veterans’ Judicial Review Act (VJRA) created the Court
of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), an Article I tribu
nal, to review Board decisions adverse to veterans. A veteran must
file a notice of appeal with that court within 120 days of the date
when the Board’s final decision is properly mailed. 38 U. S. C.
§7266(a).
After the VA denied David Henderson’s claim for supplemental
disability benefits, he filed a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court,
missing the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days. Henderson argued
that his failure to timely file should be excused under equitable toll
ing principles. While his appeal was pending, this Court decided
Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, which held that the statutory limita
tion on the length of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in
an ordinary civil case is “jurisdictional,” so that a party’s failure to
file within that period could not be excused. The Veterans Court con
cluded that Bowles compelled jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day
deadline and dismissed Henderson’s untimely appeal. The Federal
Circuit affirmed.
Held: The deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court
