HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI
Opinion of the Court

rules.” These are rules that seek to promote the orderly
progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take
certain procedural steps at certain specified times. Id., at
___ (slip op., at 14); Eberhart, supra, at 19; Scarborough,
supra, at 413–414; Kontrick, supra, at 455–456. Filing
deadlines, such as the 120-day filing deadline at issue
here, are quintessential claim-processing rules. Accord
ingly, if we were simply to apply the strict definition of
jurisdiction that we have recommended in our recent
cases, we would reverse the decision of the Federal Cir
cuit, and this opinion could end at this point.
Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that
simple because Congress is free to attach the conditions
that go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we
would prefer to call a claim-processing rule. See Bowles,
supra, at 212–213. The question here, therefore, is
whether Congress mandated that the 120-day deadline be
“jurisdictional.” In Arbaugh, we applied a “readily admin
istrable bright line” rule for deciding such questions. 546
U. S., at 515–516. Under Arbaugh, we look to see if there
is any “clear” indication that Congress wanted the rule to
be “jurisdictional.” Ibid. This approach is suited to cap
ture Congress’ likely intent and also provides helpful
guidance for courts and litigants, who will be “duly in
structed” regarding a rule’s nature. See id., at 514–515,
and n. 11.
Congress, of course, need not use magic words in order
to speak clearly on this point. “[C]ontext, including this
Court’s interpretation of similar provisions in many years
past, is relevant.” Reed Elsevier, supra, at ___ (slip op., at
13). When “a long line of this Court’s decisions left undis
turbed by Congress,” Union Pacific, supra, at ___ (slip op.,
at 13), has treated a similar requirement as “jurisdic
tional,” we will presume that Congress intended to follow
that course. See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United
States, 552 U. S. 130, 133–134, 139 (2008).
