Opinion of the Court

III
With these principles in mind, we consider whether
Congress clearly prescribed that the deadline for filing
a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court should be
“jurisdictional.”
A
Contending that the 120-day filing deadline was meant
to be jurisdictional, the Government maintains that
Bowles is controlling. The Government reads Bowles to
mean that all statutory deadlines for taking appeals in
civil cases are jurisdictional. Since §7266(a) establishes a
statutory deadline for taking an appeal in a civil case, the
Government reasons, that deadline is jurisdictional.
We reject the major premise of this syllogism. Bowles
did not hold categorically that every deadline for seeking
judicial review in civil litigation is jurisdictional. Instead,
Bowles concerned an appeal from one court to another
court. The “century’s worth of precedent and practice in
American courts” on which Bowles relied involved appeals
of that type. See 551 U. S., at 209–210, and n. 2.
Contending that Bowles’ reasoning extends to the judi
cial review of administrative decisions, the Government
relies on Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386 (1995). There, with
out elaboration, we described as “ ‘mandatory and jurisdic
tional’ ” the deadline for seeking review in the courts of
appeals of final removal orders of the Board of Immigra
tion Appeals. Id., at 405 (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins, 495
U. S. 33, 45 (1990)). The Government also notes that
lower court decisions have uniformly held that the Hobbs
Act’s 60-day time limit for filing a petition for review of
certain final agency decisions, 28 U. S. C. §2344, is juris
dictional. Brief for United States 18.
Petitioner correctly observes, however, that Veterans
Court review of a VA decision denying benefits differs in
many respects from court of appeals review of an agency
