Opinion of the Court

tional consequences. Section 7266(a) provides:
“In order to obtain review by the Court of Appeals
for Veterans Claims of a final decision of the Board
of Veterans’ Appeals, a person adversely affected by
such decision shall file a notice of appeal with the
Court within 120 days after the date on which notice
of the decision is mailed pursuant to section 7104(e) of
this title.”
This provision “does not speak in jurisdictional terms or
refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans
Court],” Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385,
394 (1982). If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to
be treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provi
sion in language like that in the provision of the VJRA
that governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the
Veterans Court. This latter provision states that Federal
Circuit review must be obtained “within the time and in
the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts
of appeals from United States district courts.” §7292(a).
Because the time for taking an appeal from a district court
to a court of appeals in a civil case has long been under
stood to be jurisdictional, see Bowles, supra, at 209–210,
and n. 2, this language clearly signals an intent to impose
the same restrictions on appeals from the Veterans Court
to the Federal Circuit. But the 120-day limit at issue in
this case is not framed in comparable terms. It is true
that §7266 is cast in mandatory language, but we have
rejected the notion that “all mandatory prescriptions,
however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional.”

Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 510; internal quotation marks
omitted). Thus, the language of §7266 provides no clear
indication that Congress wanted that provision to be
treated as having jurisdictional attributes.
Nor does §7266’s placement within the VJRA provide
