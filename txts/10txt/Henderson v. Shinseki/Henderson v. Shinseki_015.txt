HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI
Opinion of the Court

sharply with this scheme.
We have long applied “the canon that provisions for
benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be con
strued in the beneficiaries’ favor.” King v. St. Vincent’s
Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 220–221, n. 9 (1991); see also
Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp., 447 U. S. 191, 196 (1980);
Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U. S.
275, 285 (1946). Particularly in light this canon, we do not
find any clear indication that the 120-day limit was in
tended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany
the jurisdiction tag.
The Government argues that there is no reason to think
that jurisdictionally time-limited review is inconsistent
with a pro-veteran administrative scheme because, prior
to the enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were
not subject to any further review at all. Brief for United
States 29. The provision at issue here, however, was
enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was
decidedly favorable to veterans. Accordingly, the review
opportunities available to veterans before the VJRA was
enacted are of little help in interpreting 38 U. S. C.
§7266(a).
IV
We hold that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal
with the Veterans Court does not have jurisdictional
attributes. The 120-day limit is nevertheless an impor
tant procedural rule. Whether this case falls within any
exception to the rule is a question to be considered on
remand.4
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
——————
4 The parties have not asked us to address whether the 120-day dead
line in 38 U. S. C. §7266(a) is subject to equitable tolling, nor has the
Government disputed that the deadline is subject to equitable tolling if
it is not jurisdictional. See Brief for Petitioner 18. Accordingly, we
express no view on this question.
