HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI
Opinion of the Court

benefits. Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the
regional office’s decision, the veteran may obtain de novo
review by the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. The Board is a
body within the VA that makes the agency’s final decision
in cases appealed to it. §§7101, 7104(a).
The VA’s adjudicatory “process is designed to function
throughout with a high degree of informality and solici
tude for the claimant.” Walters v. National Assn. of Ra
diation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 311 (1985). A veteran
faces no time limit for filing a claim, and once a claim is
filed, the VA’s process for adjudicating it at the regional
office and the Board is ex parte and nonadversarial, 38
CFR §§3.103(a), 20.700(c) (2010). The VA has a statutory
duty to assist veterans in developing the evidence neces
sary to substantiate their claims. 38 U. S. C. §§5103(a)
(2006 ed., Supp. III), 5103A (2006 ed.). And when evaluat
ing claims, the VA must give veterans the “benefit of
the doubt” whenever positive and negative evidence on
a material issue is roughly equal. §5107(b). If a regional
office denies a claim, the veteran has a generous one-year
time limit to initiate an appeal to the Board. §7105(b)(1);
38 CFR §20.302(a). A veteran may also reopen a previ
ously denied claim at any time by presenting “new and
material evidence,” 38 U. S. C. §5108, and decisions by a
regional office or the Board are subject to challenge at any
time based on “clear and unmistakable error,” §§5109A,
7111.
Before 1988, a veteran whose claim was rejected by the
VA was generally unable to obtain further review. 38
U. S. C. §211(a) (1988 ed.).1 But the Veterans’ Judicial
Review Act (VJRA), 102 Stat. 4105 (codified, as amended,
——————
1 Section 211(a) did not foreclose judicial review of constitutional
challenges to veterans’ benefits legislation, Johnson v. Robison, 415
U. S. 361, 366–374 (1974), or of challenges to VA benefits regulations
based on later-in-time statutes that the VA did not administer exclu
sively, Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U. S. 535, 541–545 (1988).
