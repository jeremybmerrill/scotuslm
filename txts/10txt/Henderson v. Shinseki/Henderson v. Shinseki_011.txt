HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI
Opinion of the Court

decision under the Hobbs Act. Cf. Shinseki v. Sanders,
556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 15) (“Congress has
made clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency”). And
there is force to petitioner’s argument that a more ap
propriate analog is judicial review of an administrative
decision denying Social Security disability benefits. The
Social Security disability benefits program, like the veter
ans benefits program, is “unusually protective” of claim
ants, Heckler v. Day, 467 U. S. 104, 106–107 (1984). See
also Sims v. Apfel, 530 U. S. 103, 110–112 (2000) (plurality
opinion). Indeed, the Government acknowledges that “the
Social Security and veterans-benefit review mechanisms
share significant common attributes.” Brief for United
States 16. And long before Congress enacted the VJRA,
we held that the deadline for obtaining review of Social
Security benefits decisions in district court, 42 U. S. C.
§405(g), is not jurisdictional. Bowen v. City of New York,
476 U. S. 467, 478, and n. 10 (1986); Mathews v. Eldridge,
424 U. S. 319, 328, n. 9 (1976); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422
U. S. 749, 763–764 (1975).
In the end, however, none of the precedents cited by the
parties controls our decision here. All of those cases in
volved review by Article III courts. This case, by contrast,
involves review by an Article I tribunal as part of a unique
administrative scheme. Instead of applying a categorical
rule regarding review of administrative decisions, we
attempt to ascertain Congress’ intent regarding the par
ticular type of review at issue in this case.
B
Several factors convince us that the 120-day deadline for
seeking Veterans Court review was not meant to have
jurisdictional attributes.
The terms of the provision setting that deadline, 38
U. S. C. §7266(a), do not suggest, much less provide clear
evidence, that the provision was meant to carry jurisdic
