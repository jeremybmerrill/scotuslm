HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI
Opinion of the Court

ment. While Henderson’s appeal was pending, however,
we decided Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). In
Bowles, we held that the statutory limitation on the length
of an extension of the time to file a notice of appeal in an
ordinary civil case, 28 U. S. C. §2107(c) (2006 ed., Supp.
III), is “jurisdictional,” and we therefore held that a party’s
failure to file a notice of appeal within that period could
not be excused based on equitable factors, or on the oppos
ing party’s forfeiture or waiver of any objection to the late
filing. Bowles, supra, at 213–214.
After we announced our decision in Bowles, the Veter
ans Court directed the parties to brief that decision’s effect
on prior Federal Circuit precedent that allowed the equi
table tolling of the 120-day deadline for filing a notice of
appeal in the Veterans Court. A divided panel of the
Veterans Court concluded that Bowles compelled jurisdic
tional treatment of the 120-day deadline and dismissed
Henderson’s untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
Henderson v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 217 (2008).
Henderson then appealed to the Federal Circuit, and a
divided en banc court affirmed. 589 F. 3d 1201 (2009).
We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).

In this case, as in others that have come before us in
recent years, we must decide whether a procedural rule is
“jurisdictional.” See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559
U. S. ___ (2010); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engi
neers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central
Region, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); Bowles, supra; Arbaugh v.
Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006); Eberhart v. United
States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per curiam); Scarborough v.
Principi, 541 U. S. 401 (2004); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.
443 (2004). This question is not merely semantic but one
of considerable practical importance for judges and liti
gants. Branding a rule as going to a court’s subject-matter
