Opinion of the Court

in various sections of 38 U. S. C. (2006 ed. and Supp. III)),
created the Veterans Court, an Article I tribunal, and
authorized that court to review Board decisions adverse to
veterans.2 §§7251, 7252(a) (2006 ed.). While proceedings

Review of Veterans Court decisions on certain issues of

the Federal Circuit. §7292. Federal Circuit decisions may
in turn be reviewed by this Court by writ of certiorari.

Later, the court granted Henderson’s motion for reconsid
eration, revoked the dismissal, and set the case for argu

§7261, is similar to that of an Article III court reviewing agency action
under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. §706.
