HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI
Opinion of the Court

such an indication. Congress placed §7266, numbered
§4066 in the enacting legislation, in a subchapter entitled
“Procedure.” See VJRA, §301, 102 Stat. 4113, 4115–4116.
That placement suggests Congress regarded the 120-day
limit as a claim-processing rule. Cf. INS v. National
Center for Immigrants’ Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 189
(1991) (“[T]he title of a statute or section can aid in resolv
ing an ambiguity in the legislation’s text”). Congress
elected not to place the 120-day limit in the VJRA sub
chapter entitled “Organization and Jurisdiction.” See 102
Stat. 4113–4115.
Within that subchapter, a separate provision, captioned
“Jurisdiction; finality of decisions,” prescribes the jurisdic
tion of the Veterans Court. Id., at 4113–4114. Subsection
(a) of that provision, numbered §4052 in the enacting
legislation, grants the Veterans Court “exclusive jurisdic
tion to review decisions of the Board of Veterans’ Appeals”
and the “power to affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of
the Board or to remand the matter, as appropriate.” Id.,
at 4113. It also prohibits the court from hearing appeals
by the VA Secretary. Subsection (b) limits the court’s
review to “the record of proceedings before the [VA],”
specifies the scope of that review, and precludes review of
the VA’s disability ratings schedule. Ibid. Nothing in this
provision or in the “Organization and Jurisdiction” sub
chapter addresses the time for seeking Veterans Court
review.
While the terms and placement of §7266 provide some
indication of Congress’ intent, what is most telling here
are the singular characteristics of the review scheme that
Congress created for the adjudication of veterans’ benefits
claims. “The solicitude of Congress for veterans is of long
standing.” United States v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 647
(1961); see also Sanders, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).
And that solicitude is plainly reflected in the VJRA, as
well as in subsequent laws that “place a thumb on the
