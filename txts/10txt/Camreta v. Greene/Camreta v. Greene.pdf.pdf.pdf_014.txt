Opinion of the Court

of the necessity of deciding them.” Lyng v. Northwest
Indian Cemetery Protective Assn., 485 U. S. 439, 445
(1988); see also Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–347
(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). In this category of quali
fied immunity cases, a court can enter judgment without
ever ruling on the (perhaps difficult) constitutional claim
the plaintiff has raised. Small wonder, then, that a court
might leave that issue for another day.
But we have long recognized that this day may never
come—that our regular policy of avoidance sometimes
does not fit the qualified immunity situation because it
threatens to leave standards of official conduct perma
nently in limbo. County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S.
833, 841, n. 5 (1998). Consider a plausible but unsettled
constitutional claim asserted against a government official
in a suit for money damages. The court does not resolve
the claim because the official has immunity. He thus
persists in the challenged practice; he knows that he can
avoid liability in any future damages action, because the
law has still not been clearly established. Another plain
tiff brings suit, and another court both awards immunity
and bypasses the claim. And again, and again, and again.
So the moment of decision does not arrive.5 Courts fail to
clarify uncertain questions, fail to address novel claims,
fail to give guidance to officials about how to comply with
legal requirements. See, e.g., ibid.; Wilson v. Layne, 526
U. S. 603, 609 (1999). Qualified immunity thus may frus

5 The constitutional issue could arise in a case in which qualified
immunity is unavailable—for example, “in a suit to enjoin future con
duct, in an action against a municipality, or in litigating a suppres
sion motion in a criminal proceeding.” Lewis, 523 U. S., at 841, n. 5. A
decision in such a case would break the repetitive cycle of qualified
immunity defenses described above. But some kinds of constitutional
questions do not often come up in these alternative settings. Pearson v.
Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009); see Lewis, 523 U. S., at 841, n. 5
(noting that “these avenues w[ill] not necessarily be open”).
