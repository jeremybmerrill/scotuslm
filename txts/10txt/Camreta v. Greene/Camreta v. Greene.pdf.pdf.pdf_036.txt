KENNEDY, J., dissenting

III
It is most doubtful that Article III permits appeals by
any officer to whom the reasoning of a judicial decision
might be applied in a later suit. Yet that appears to be
the implication of the Court’s holding. The favorable judg
ment of the Court of Appeals did not in itself cause peti
tioner Camreta to suffer an Article III injury entitling him
to appeal. Cf. supra, at 1–7 (discussing Electrical Fittings
and Deposit Guaranty); ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S.
605, 619 (1989) (finding an Article III controversy where
petitioner challenged “a final judgment altering tangible
legal rights”). On the contrary, Camreta has been injured
by the decision below to no greater extent than have hun
dreds of other government officers who might argue that
they too have been affected by the unnecessary statements
made by the Court of Appeals. The Court notes as a limit
on its authority to entertain appeals from prevailing par
ties certain statutory directives, directives that can be
interpreted or shaped to allow expanded powers of review.
Ante, at 4. But even if Congress were to give explicit
permission for certiorari petitions to be filed by “any per
son” instead of by “any party,” 28 U. S. C. §1254(1), the
constitutional definition of a case or controversy would
still constrain this Court’s jurisdiction.
The Court’s analysis appears to rest on the premise that
the reasoning of the decision below in itself causes Cam
reta injury. Until today, however, precedential reasoning
of general applicability divorced from a particular adverse
judgment was not thought to yield “standing to appeal.”

ion for the Court by Harlan, J.). That is why “[o]nly one
injured by the judgment sought to be reviewed can ap

cause harm, but not the sort of harm that the courts . . .
