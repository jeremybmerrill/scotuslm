CAMRETA v. GREENE
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

rence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003). Nor is qualified
immunity available in constitutional suits against munici
palities—as this very case illustrates. Ante, at 15–16.
Our cases make clear, moreover, that “officials can still be
on notice that their conduct violates established law even
in novel factual circumstances.” Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S.
730, 741 (2002). That rule permits clearly established
violations to be found when extreme though unheard-of
actions violate the Constitution. See, e.g., ibid. Further
more, constitutional plaintiffs may seek declaratory or
injunctive relief pursuant to standard principles of justi
ciability. Those plaintiffs do not need Pearson’s special
rule.
See, e.g., Citizens United v. Federal Election
Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___ (2010); McDonald v. Chicago, 561
U. S. ___ (2010). In any event, some incremental advance
in the law occurs even when clearly established violations
are found. It is an inevitable aspect of judicial decision
making that the resolution of one legal question or factual
dispute casts light on the next.
It would be preferable at least to explore refinements to
our qualified immunity jurisprudence before altering basic
principles of jurisdiction. For instance, the objectives of
qualified immunity might be satisfied if there were no bar
to reaching the merits and issuing judgment when re
quested damages are nominal and substantial attorney’s
fees are waived or not allowed. Cf. Farrar v. Hobby, 506
U. S. 103, 112–115 (1992) (discussing unavailability of
attorney’s fees where nominal damages are only relief);
Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755, 761–763 (1987); Harlow
v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 819, n. 34 (1982); Carey v.
Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 266 (1978) (discussing the propriety
of providing nominal damages as relief).
The desire to resolve more constitutional questions
ought not lead to altering our jurisdictional rules. That is
the precise object that our legal tradition tells us we
should resist. Haste to resolve constitutional issues has
