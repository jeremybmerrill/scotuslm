CAMRETA v. GREENE
Opinion of the Court

liability because the constitutional right at issue was not
clearly established under existing law.
The two officials sought this Court’s review of the Ninth
Circuit’s ruling on the Fourth Amendment. We granted
their petitions to examine two questions. First, may gov
ernment officials who prevail on grounds of qualified im
munity obtain our review of a court of appeals’ decision
that their conduct violated the Constitution? And second,
if we may consider cases in this procedural posture, did
the Ninth Circuit correctly determine that this interview
breached the Fourth Amendment?
We conclude that this Court generally may review a
lower court’s constitutional ruling at the behest of a gov
ernment official granted immunity. But we may not do so
in this case for reasons peculiar to it. The case has become
moot because the child has grown up and moved across
the country, and so will never again be subject to the
Oregon in-school interviewing practices whose constitu
tionality is at issue. We therefore do not reach the Fourth
Amendment question in this case. In line with our normal
practice when mootness frustrates a party’s right to ap
peal, see United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36,
39 (1950), we vacate the part of the Ninth Circuit’s opinion
that decided the Fourth Amendment issue.

assigned petitioner Bob Camreta, a child protective ser
vices caseworker, to assess S. G.’s safety. Several days
later, Camreta, accompanied by petitioner James Alford, a
Deschutes County deputy sheriff, went to S. G.’s elemen
