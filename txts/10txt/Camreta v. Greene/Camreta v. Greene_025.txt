CAMRETA v. GREENE
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513
U. S. 18, 21 (1994) (“[A] federal court [may not] decide the
merits of a legal question not posed in an Article III case
or controversy”).
The majority suggests that we must decide whether
Camreta has a “right to appeal” in order to vacate the
judgment below under United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.,
340 U. S. 36 (1950). See ante, at 17, n. 10; see also ante, at
14, n. 8. But that view does not accord with our past
practice. See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,
520 U. S. 43, 66, 70, 74–75 (1997) (ordering vacatur of
a district court judgment without “resolv[ing]” our “grave
doubts” about the petitioners’ appellate standing or decid
ing whether the state Attorney General had a right to
intervene as a party, and concluding only that he had
statutory authority to “present argument” on appeal). Nor
is it consistent with the principles underlying our moot
ness jurisprudence. See Walling v. James V. Reuter, Inc.,
321 U. S. 671, 677 (1944) (“If a judgment has become
moot, this Court . . . may make such disposition of the
whole case as justice may require”). In accordance with
our normal procedure for disposing of cases that have
become moot through no fault of the party seeking review,
see Bancorp, 513 U. S., at 22–23; Munsingwear, 340 U. S.,
at 39–40, and n. 2, we should simply vacate the portion of
the Ninth Circuit’s opinion Camreta sought to challenge
and remand with instructions to dismiss, see, e.g., Indiana
State Police Pension Trust v. Chrysler LLC, 556 U. S. ___
(2009) (per curiam).
