KENNEDY, J., dissenting

never been thought advisable. We instead have encour
aged the Courts of Appeals to follow “that older, wiser
judicial counsel not to pass on questions of constitutional
ity . . . unless such adjudication is unavoidable.” Scott v.
Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 388 (2007) (BREYER, J., concurring)
(internal quotation marks omitted); see generally Ash

Court), and Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). Yet

in qualified immunity cases. It is sometimes a better
analytic approach and a preferred allocation of judicial

than to dismiss based on qualified immunity. And “[i]t
often may be difficult to decide whether a right is clearly
established without deciding precisely what the existing
constitutional right happens to be.” Pearson, supra, at 236
(internal quotation marks omitted). This Court should not
superintend the judicial decisionmaking process in quali
fied immunity cases under special rules, lest it make the
judicial process more complex for civil rights suits than for
other litigation. It follows, however, that the Court should
provide no special permission to reach the merits. If
qualified immunity cases were treated like other cases
raising constitutional questions, settled principles of con
