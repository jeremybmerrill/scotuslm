CAMRETA v. GREENE
Opinion of the Court

could “provide guidance to those charged with the difficult
task of protecting child welfare within the confines of
the Fourth Amendment.” Id., at 1022. That guidance came
in no uncertain terms: “[G]overnment officials investigat
ing allegations of child abuse,” the court warned, “should
cease operating on the assumption that a ‘special need’
automatically justifies dispensing with traditional Fourth
Amendment protections in this context.” Id., at 1033.
Although the judgment entered was in their favor,
Camreta and Alford petitioned this Court to review the
Ninth Circuit’s ruling that their conduct violated the
Fourth Amendment. S. G. declined to cross-petition for
review of the decision that the officials have immunity.
We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).
II
We first consider our ability to act on a petition brought
by government officials who have won final judgment on
grounds of qualified immunity, but who object to an appel
late court’s ruling that they violated the plaintiff’s consti
tutional rights. Camreta and Alford are, without doubt,
prevailing parties. The Ninth Circuit’s decision shielded
them from monetary liability, and S. G. chose not to con
test that ruling. So whatever else follows, they will not
have to pay S. G. the damages she sought. The question
we confront is whether we may nonetheless review the
Court of Appeals’ holding that the officials violated the
Constitution.
The statute governing this Court’s jurisdiction author
izes us to adjudicate a case in this posture, and S. G. does
not contend otherwise. The relevant provision confers
unqualified power on this Court to grant certiorari “upon
the petition of any party.” 28 U. S. C. §1254(1) (emphasis
added). That language covers petitions brought by liti
gants who have prevailed, as well as those who have
lost, in the court below. See E. Gressman, K. Geller, S.
