KENNEDY, J., dissenting

obtaining a declaratory judgment. See Los Angeles v.
Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 103–105 (1983) (citing Ashcroft v.
Mattis, 431 U. S. 171 (1977) (per curiam); Golden v. Zwick
ler, 394 U. S. 103 (1969)); see also MedImmune, Inc. v.
Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 127 (2007). There was no
likelihood that S. G., the plaintiff’s daughter, would again
be subjected to interrogation while at school, much less
that she would be interrogated by petitioner-defendant
Camreta, so S. G. would seem to have had no greater
stake in obtaining a declaratory judgment than the plain
tiff in Lyons had in obtaining an injunction. See 461 U. S.,
at 104 (noting the “actual controversy that must exist for a
declaratory judgment to be entered”). Our qualified im
munity cases should not permit plaintiffs in constitutional
cases to make an end-run around established principles of
justiciability. In treating dictum as though it were a
declaratory judgment or an injunction, the Court appears
to approve the issuance of such judgments outside the
bounds of Article III jurisdiction.
The Court creates an exception to the prevailing party
rule in order to solve the difficulties created by our quali
fied immunity jurisprudence, but the Court’s solution
creates new problems. Sometimes defendants in qualified
immunity cases have no particular interest in disputing
the constitutional merits. Acknowledging as much, the
Court notes that petitioner Alford no longer works for the
government and so “has lost his interest in the Fourth
Amendment ruling.” Ante, at 14, n. 9. In concluding that
Alford lacks Article III standing, the Court suggests that
it would lack jurisdiction to review and perhaps even to
vacate the merits decision of the Court of Appeals if re
spondent had sued only Alford. Ibid.; cf. Arizonans for
Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 72–73 (1997)
(discussing standing to obtain review in this Court as well
as this Court’s jurisdiction to vacate judgments issued
without jurisdiction). That suggestion is disconcerting.
