CAMRETA v. GREENE
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

stitutional avoidance would apply. So would conventional rules regarding dictum and holding. Judicial obser
vations made in the course of explaining a case might give
important instruction and be relevant when assessing a
later claim of qualified immunity. Cf. Wilkinson v. Rus
sell, 182 F. 3d 89, 112, and n. 3 (CA2 1999) (Calabresi, J.,
concurring). But as dicta those remarks would not estab
lish law and would not qualify as binding precedent. See
Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 67 (1996).

The distance our qualified immunity jurisprudence has
taken us from foundational principles is made all the more
apparent by today’s decision. The Court must construe
two of its precedents in so broad a manner that they are
taken out of their proper and logical confines. To vacate
the reasoning of the decision below, the Court accepts that
obiter dictum is not just binding precedent but a judgment
susceptible to plenary review. I would dismiss this case
and note that our jurisdictional rule against hearing ap
peals by prevailing parties precludes petitioners’ attempt
to obtain review of judicial reasoning disconnected from a
judgment.
