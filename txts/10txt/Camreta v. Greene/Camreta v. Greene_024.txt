v.
SARAH GREENE, PERSONALLY AND AS NEXT FRIEND OF
S. G., A MINOR, AND K. G., A MINOR
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[May 26, 2011]

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court’s conclusion that this case is moot
and that vacatur is the appropriate disposition; unlike the
majority, however, I would go no further. As the exchange
between the majority and JUSTICE KENNEDY demon
strates, the question whether Camreta, as a prevailing
party, can obtain our review of the Ninth Circuit’s consti
tutional ruling is a difficult one. There is no warrant for
reaching this question when there is clearly no longer a
genuine case or controversy between the parties before us.
See Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp.,
549 U. S. 422, 436 (2007) (noting that when a court can
“readily” dispose of a case on one threshold ground, it
should not reach another one that “is difficult to deter
mine”). Indeed, it is improper for us to do so. Cf. U. S.
