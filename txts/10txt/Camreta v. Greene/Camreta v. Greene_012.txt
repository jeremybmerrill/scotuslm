CAMRETA v. GREENE
Opinion of the Court

B
Article III aside, an important question of judicial policy
remains. As a matter of practice and prudence, we have
generally declined to consider cases at the request of a
prevailing party, even when the Constitution allowed us to
do so. See, e.g., Gunn v. University Comm. to End War in
Viet Nam, 399 U. S. 383, 390, n. 5 (1970); New York Tele
phone Co. v. Maltbie, 291 U. S. 645, 646 (1934) (per cu
riam); see also Bunting v. Mellen, 541 U. S. 1019, 1023
(2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari)
(“[O]ur practice reflects a ‘settled refusal’ to entertain an
appeal by a party on an issue as to which he prevailed”
(quoting Stern & Gressman 79 (8th ed. 2002))). Our
resources are not well spent superintending each word
a lower court utters en route to a final judgment in the
petitioning party’s favor. See California v. Rooney, 483
U. S. 307, 311 (1987) (per curiam) (“[T]hat the Court of
Appeal reached its decision through analysis different
than this Court might have used does not make it appro
priate . . . for the prevailing party to request us to review
it”). We therefore have adhered with some rigor to the
principle that “[t]his Court reviews judgments, not state
ments in opinions.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omit
ted). On the few occasions when we have departed from
that principle, we have pointed to a “policy reaso[n] . . . of
sufficient importance to allow an appeal” by the winner
below. Deposit Guaranty, 445 U. S., at 336, n. 7.
We think just such a reason places qualified immunity
cases in a special category when it comes to this Court’s
review of appeals brought by winners. The constitutional
determinations that prevailing parties ask us to consider
in these cases are not mere dicta or “statements in opin
ions.” Rooney, 483 U. S., at 311 (internal quotation marks
omitted); see Bunting, 541 U. S., at 1023 (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting from denial of certiorari) (stating that such a
determination is “not mere dictum in the ordinary sense”).
