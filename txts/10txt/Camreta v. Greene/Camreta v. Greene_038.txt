KENNEDY, J., dissenting

in a suit for prospective relief is the party prepared to
enforce the relevant legal rule against the plaintiff. See
MedImmune, Inc., 549 U. S., at 127 (explaining that de
claratory relief requires a controversy “between parties
having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and
reality” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Babbitt v.
Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298–299 (1979) (“A plaintiff
who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic
danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the
statute’s operation or enforcement”). Without an adverse
judgment from which to appeal, Camreta has in effect filed
a new declaratory judgment action in this Court against
the Court of Appeals. This is no more consistent with
Article III than filing a declaratory judgment action
against this Court for its issuance of an adverse precedent
or against Congress in response to its enactment of an
unconstitutional law.
IV
If today’s decision proves to be more than an isolated
anomaly, the Court might find it necessary to reconsider
its special permission that the Courts of Appeals may
issue unnecessary merits determinations in qualified im
munity cases with binding precedential effect.
Other dynamics permit the law of the Constitution to be
elaborated within the conventional framework of a case or
controversy. “[T]he development of constitutional law is
by no means entirely dependent on cases in which the
defendant may seek qualified immunity.” Pearson, 555
U. S., at 242–243. For example, qualified immunity does
not bar Fourth and Fifth Amendment suppression chal
lenges. See, e.g., Kentucky v. King, ante, p. ___. Nor does
it prevent invocation of the Constitution as a defense
against criminal prosecution, civil suit, or cruel and un
usual punishment. See, e.g., Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S.
___ (2011); Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010); Law
