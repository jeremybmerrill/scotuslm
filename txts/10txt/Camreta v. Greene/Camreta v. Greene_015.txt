Opinion of the Court

trate “the development of constitutional precedent” and
the promotion of law-abiding behavior. Pearson v. Calla
han, 555 U. S. 223, 237 (2009).
For this reason, we have permitted lower courts to avoid
avoidance—that is, to determine whether a right exists
before examining whether it was clearly established. See,
e.g., ibid.; Lewis, 523 U. S., at 841, n. 5. Indeed, for some
time we required courts considering qualified immunity
claims to first address the constitutional question, so as to
promote “the law’s elaboration from case to case.” Saucier
v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). More recently, we have
left this matter to the discretion of lower courts, and in
deed detailed a range of circumstances in which courts
should address only the immunity question. See Pearson,
555 U. S., at 236–242. In general, courts should think
hard, and then think hard again, before turning small
cases into large ones. But it remains true that following
the two-step sequence—defining constitutional rights and
only then conferring immunity—is sometimes beneficial
to clarify the legal standards governing public officials.
Id., at 236; see id., at 236–242 (discussing factors courts
should consider in making this determination).
Here, the Court of Appeals followed exactly this two
step process, for exactly the reasons we have said may in
select circumstances make it “advantageous.” Id., at 242.
The court, as noted earlier, explained that it was “ad
dress[ing] both prongs of the qualified immunity inquiry
. . . to provide guidance to those charged with the difficult
task of protecting child welfare within the confines of the
Fourth Amendment.” 588 F. 3d, at 1022. To that end, the
court adopted constitutional standards to govern all in
school interviews of suspected child abuse victims. See
id., at 1030. And the court specifically instructed govern
ment officials to follow those standards going forward—to
“cease operating on the assumption” that warrantless
interviews are permitted. See id., at 1033. With the law
