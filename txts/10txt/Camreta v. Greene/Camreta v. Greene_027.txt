CAMRETA v. GREENE
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

So, while acknowledging the problem the Court confronts,
my concern with the rule adopted for this case calls for
this respectful dissent.
I
The Court acknowledges our “settled refusal to enter
tain an appeal,” including a petition for certiorari, “by a
party on an issue as to which he prevailed.” Ante, at 8
(internal quotation marks omitted). At the outset, how
ever, it is important to state this rule more fully to show
its foundational character. A party that has already ob
tained the judgment it requested may not seek review to
challenge the reasoning of a judicial decision. As we have
said on many occasions, “This Court reviews judgments,
not statements in opinions.” California v. Rooney, 483
U. S. 307, 311 (1987) (per curiam) (internal quotation
marks omitted); see also Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842, and
n. 8 (1984) (collecting cases). The rule has been noted and
followed since the early years of this Court. “The question
before an appellate Court is, was the judgment correct, not
the ground on which the judgment professes to proceed.”
McClung v. Silliman, 6 Wheat. 598, 603 (1821).
The rule against hearing appeals or accepting petitions
for certiorari by prevailing parties is related to the Article
III prohibition against issuing advisory opinions. This
principle underlies, for example, the settled rule against
hearing cases involving a disputed judgment based on
grounds of state law. As Justice Jackson explained for the
Court: “[O]ur power is to correct wrong judgments, not to
revise opinions. We are not permitted to render an advi
sory opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered
by the state court after we corrected its views of federal
laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an
advisory opinion.” Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125–
126 (1945). This point has been repeated with force and
