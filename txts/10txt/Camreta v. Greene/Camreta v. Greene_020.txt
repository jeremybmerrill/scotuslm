CAMRETA v. GREENE
Opinion of the Court

municipal liability claim against Deschutes County. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; id., at 8. S. G.’s initial complaint
charged that the county has an official policy of unconsti
tutionally subjecting schoolchildren to police interrogation.
See n. 2, supra. Finding no evidence of such a policy (even
assuming that an unlawful seizure had occurred in this
case), the District Court granted summary judgment to
the county, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 09–1454, pp. 66–
67, and S. G. did not appeal that ruling, 588 F. 3d, at
1020, n. 4. And although S. G. recently sought to reinstate
her claim against the county, the District Court denied
that motion. 6:05–cv–06047–AA, Docket Entry No. 139 (D
Ore., Jan. 4, 2011). Whatever interest S. G. might have
were her municipal liability claim still pending (an issue
we need not and do not decide), we do not think S. G.’s
dismissed claim against a different defendant involving a
separate legal theory can save this case from mootness.
See Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Board of
Trade of Chicago, 701 F. 2d 653, 656 (CA7 1983) (Posner,
J.) (“[O]ne can never be certain that findings made in a
decision concluding one lawsuit will not some day . . .
control the outcome of another suit. But if that were
enough to avoid mootness, no case would ever be moot”).
We thus must decide how to dispose of this case. When
a civil suit becomes moot pending appeal, we have the
authority to “direct the entry of such appropriate judg
ment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings
to be had as may be just under the circumstances.” 28
U. S. C. §2106. Our “established” (though not excep
tionless) practice in this situation is to vacate the judg
ment below. See Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 39; Alvarez v.
Smith, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6). “A party
who seeks review of the merits of an adverse ruling, but
is frustrated by the vagaries of circumstance,” we have
emphasized, “ought not in fairness be forced to acquiesce
in” that ruling. U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner
