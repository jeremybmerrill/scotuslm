KENNEDY, J., dissenting

clarity. See, e.g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041–
1042 (1983). The “ ‘judicial Power’ is one to render dis
positive judgments,” not advisory opinions. Plaut v.
Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 219 (1995) (internal
quotation marks omitted).
The rule against hearing appeals by prevailing parties
applies in countless situations, many involving govern
ment parties. Deficient performance may not yield preju
dice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).
A defective warrant may be entitled to good-faith reliance
under United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984). An
unreasonable search may be cured through the inevitable
discovery doctrine of Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431 (1984).
In these and myriad other situations, an error is identi
fied, but that conclusion does not affect the ultimate
judgment entered. In all these contexts, it is established
that the prevailing party may not appeal. This conclusion
holds true even though a statement on the merits can
have adverse consequences for the prevailing party. “The
Court of Appeal’s use of analysis that may have been
adverse to the State’s long-term interests does not allow
the State to claim status as a losing party for purposes of
this Court’s review.” Rooney, supra, at 311.
The Court nonetheless holds that defendants who pre
vail in the Courts of Appeals based on qualified immunity
may still obtain review in this Court. This point is put in
perspective by the fact that the Court today, in an alto
gether unprecedented disposition, says that it vacates not
a judgment but rather “part of the Ninth Circuit’s opin
ion.” Ante, at 2. The Court’s conclusion is unsettling in its
implications. Even on the Court’s reading of our cases, the
almost invariable rule is that prevailing parties are not
permitted to obtain a writ of certiorari. Cf. Kalka v.
Hawk, 215 F. 3d 90, 96, n. 9 (CADC 2000) (concluding that
the Supreme Court “has apparently never granted the
certiorari petition of a party who prevailed in the appel
