Opinion of the Court

Shapiro, T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Prac
tice 87 (9th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Stern & Gressman).
S. G., however, alleges two impediments to our exercise
of statutory authority here, one constitutional and the
other prudential. First, she claims that Article III bars
review because petitions submitted by immunized officials
present no case or controversy. See Brief for Respondent
31–39. Second, she argues that our settled practice of
declining to hear appeals by prevailing parties should
apply with full force when officials have obtained immu
nity. See id., at 24–27. We disagree on both counts.
A
Article III of the Constitution grants this Court author
ity to adjudicate legal disputes only in the context of
“Cases” or “Controversies.” To enforce this limitation,
we demand that litigants demonstrate a “personal stake”
in the suit. Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S.
488, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks
omitted); see also United States Parole Comm’n v. Ger
aghty, 445 U. S. 388, 395–397 (1980). The party invoking
the Court’s authority has such a stake when three condi
tions are satisfied: The petitioner must show that he has
“suffered an injury in fact” that is caused by “the conduct
complained of” and that “will be redressed by a favorable
decision.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555,
560–561 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). And
the opposing party also must have an ongoing interest
in the dispute, so that the case features “that concrete ad
verseness which sharpens the presentation of issues.” Los
Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 101 (1983) (internal quota
tion marks omitted). To ensure a case remains “fit for
federal-court adjudication,” the parties must have the
necessary stake not only at the outset of litigation, but
throughout its course. Arizonans for Official English v.
Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997).
