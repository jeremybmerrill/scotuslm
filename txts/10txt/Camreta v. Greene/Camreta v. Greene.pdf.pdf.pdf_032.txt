KENNEDY, J., dissenting

nity. Id., at 1025. Yet that mandated rule of decision has
now been disapproved, so the dissent’s argument is no
longer applicable. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223
(2009). Indeed, the Court today suggests that it still
would not allow review of the merits even in the case that
provoked the dissent. Unlike petitioner Camreta, the
petitioner in Bunting had left the Government’s employ
before filing a petition for certiorari and so lacked stand
ing to obtain review in this Court. Compare 541 U. S., at
1025, n., with id., at 1021 (Stevens, J., respecting denial of
certiorari), and ante, at 14–15, and n. 9.
The instant case thus appears to be the first in which
the Court’s new exception to the prevailing party rule
might have been applied. And even here that exception is
neither necessary nor sufficient for the merits to be adju
dicated by this Court. The Fourth Amendment question
decided below is bound to arise again in future cases.
Indeed, the reasoning of the decision below implicates a
number of decisions in other Courts of Appeals. Cf. 588
F. 3d 1011, 1026, n. 11 (CA9 2009) (collecting cases). Yet
today’s decision does not supply the Courts of Appeals
with guidance as to these merits issues. The Court in
stead vacates part of the reasoning of the decision below,
thereby leaving other decisions intact and unreviewed.
The Court thus resolves difficult constitutional issues and
provides an unprecedented answer to “an important ques
tion of judicial policy,” all to no end. Ante, at 7.
The Court errs in reading Electrical Fittings and Deposit
Guaranty to permit review and, indeed, the provision of
relief disconnected from any judgment. The result is an
erroneous and unbounded exception to an essential princi
ple of judicial restraint. Parties who have obtained all
requested relief may not seek review here.
