v.
SARAH GREENE, PERSONALLY AND AS NEXT FRIEND OF
S. G., A MINOR, AND K. G., A MINOR
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[May 26, 2011]

JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion, which reasonably applies our
precedents, strange though they may be. The alternative
solution, as JUSTICE KENNEDY suggests, see post, at 13
(dissenting opinion), is to end the extraordinary practice of
ruling upon constitutional questions unnecessarily when
the defendant possesses qualified immunity. See Saucier
v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194 (2001). The parties have not asked
us to adopt that approach, but I would be willing to con
sider it in an appropriate case.
