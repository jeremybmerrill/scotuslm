ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[May 26, 2011]

JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.
Today’s decision results from what is emerging as a
rather troubling consequence from the reasoning of our
recent qualified immunity cases. The Court is correct to
note the problem presented when, on the one hand, its
precedents permit or invite courts to rule on the merits of
a constitutional claim even when qualified immunity
disposes of the matter; and, on the other hand, jurisdic
tional principles prevent us from reviewing those invited
rulings. It does seem that clarification is required. In my
view, however, the correct solution is not to override juris
dictional rules that are basic to the functioning of the
Court and to the necessity of avoiding advisory opinions.
Dictum, though not precedent, may have its utility; but it
ought not to be treated as a judgment standing on its own.
