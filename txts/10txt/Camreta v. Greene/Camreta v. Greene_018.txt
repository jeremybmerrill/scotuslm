CAMRETA v. GREENE
Opinion of the Court

no more than exempt one special category of cases from
our usual rule against considering prevailing parties’
petitions. Going forward, we will consider these petitions
one by one in accord with our usual standards.

Although we reject S. G.’s arguments for dismissing this
case at the threshold, we find that a separate jurisdic
tional problem requires that result: This case, we con
clude, is moot.8
As we explained above, supra, at 6–7, in a dispute of

SOTOMAYOR maintains that, because this case is moot,
“[t]here is no warrant for reaching th[e] question” whether immunized
officials may obtain our consideration of an adverse constitutional

reviewable, notwithstanding that [the Court of Appeals] ruled in [the
officials’] favor on qualified immunity grounds.” Pet. for Cert. in No.
09–1454, p. i. And all the parties, as well as the United States as
amicus curiae, addressed that question in their briefs and oral argu
ments. Compare Brief for Petitioner in No. 09–1454, pp. 41–44, Brief
for Petitioner in No. 09–1478, p. 4, n. 1, Reply Brief for Petitioner in

the parties informed us that Alford no longer works for Deschutes
