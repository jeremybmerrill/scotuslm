FELKNER v. JACKSON
Per Curiam

sented in the State court proceeding.”
28 U. S. C.
§2254(d)(2). After considering the state Court of Appeal
decision and reviewing the record evidence, the District
Court held that the California Court of Appeal’s findings
were not unreasonable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. The
District Court therefore denied Jackson’s petition.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in a
three-paragraph unpublished memorandum opinion. 389
Fed. Appx. 640 (2010). In so doing, the court did not
discuss any specific facts or mention the reasoning of the
other three courts that had rejected Jackson’s claim.
Instead, after setting forth the basic background legal
principles in the first two paragraphs, the Court of Ap
peals offered a one-sentence conclusory explanation for its
decision:
“The prosecutor’s proffered race-neutral bases for
peremptorily striking the two African-American jurors
were not sufficient to counter the evidence of purpose
ful discrimination in light of the fact that two out of
three prospective African-American jurors were
stricken, and the record reflected different treatment
of comparably situated jurors.” Id., at 641.
That decision is as inexplicable as it is unexplained. It is
reversed.
The Batson issue before us turns largely on an “evalua

court’s determination is entitled to “great deference,” ibid.,
and “must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous,”
Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472, 477 (2008).
That is the standard on direct review. On federal ha
beas review, AEDPA “imposes a highly deferential stan
dard for evaluating state-court rulings” and “demands
that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the
doubt.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,
at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here the trial
