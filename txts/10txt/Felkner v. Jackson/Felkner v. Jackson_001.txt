SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
T. FELKNER v. STEVEN FRANK JACKSON
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–797.

Decided March 21, 2011 


PER CURIAM.
A California jury convicted respondent Steven Frank
Jackson of numerous sexual offenses stemming from his
attack on a 72-year-old woman who lived in his apartment
complex. Jackson raised a Batson claim, asserting that
the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to exclude
black prospective jurors on the basis of their race. See
Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986). Two of three
black jurors had been struck; the third served on the jury.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 49–50.
Jackson’s counsel did not object when the prosecutor
struck the first of the black jurors, Juror S. Counsel later
explained that he did not make a “motion at that time”
because he thought the excusal of Juror S “was a close
call.” After the prosecutor sought to dismiss the second
juror, Juror J, Jackson’s counsel made the Batson motion
challenging both strikes. Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB
(ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 7, pp. 76–77 (hereinaf
ter Document 7).
The prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for
striking each juror: Juror S had stated that from the ages
of 16 to 30 years old, he was frequently stopped by Cali
fornia police officers because—in his view—of his race and
age. As the prosecutor put it, “Whether or not he still
harbors any animosity is not something I wanted to roll
the dice with.” Id., at 78; Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB
(ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 10, pp. 57–58, 98–100
(hereinafter Document 10).
The prosecutor stated that he struck Juror J because
