Cert. 49.
The California Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s
denial of the Batson motion and affirmed Jackson’s convic
tions. The appellate court explained that “[t]he trial
court’s ruling on this issue is reviewed for substantial
evidence,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (internal quotation
marks omitted), which the California courts have charac
terized as equivalent to the “clear error” standard em
ployed by federal courts, see, e.g., People v. Alvarez, 14
Cal. 4th 155, 196, 926 P. 2d 365, 389 (1996). With respect
to whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were pretex

The Federal District Court properly recognized that re

and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). That
law provides, in pertinent part, that federal habeas relief
may not be granted unless the state court adjudication
“resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable
determination of the facts in light of the evidence pre
