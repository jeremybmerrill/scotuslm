CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

Opinion of the Court 


not otherwise conflict with federal law, we hold that the
Arizona law is not preempted.
I

A

In 1952, Congress enacted the Immigration and Nation
ality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1101
et seq. That statute established a “comprehensive federal
statutory scheme for regulation of immigration and natu
ralization” and set “the terms and conditions of admission
to the country and the subsequent treatment of aliens
lawfully in the country.” De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351,
353, 359 (1976).
In the years following the enactment of the INA, several
States took action to prohibit the employment of indi
viduals living within state borders who were not lawful
residents of the United States. For example, in 1971 Cali
fornia passed a law providing that “[n]o employer shall
knowingly employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful
residence in the United States if such employment would
have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers.” 1971
Cal. Stats. ch. 1442, §1(a). The California law imposed
fines ranging from $200 to $500 for each violation of this
prohibition. §1(b). At least 11 other States enacted provi
sions during that same time period proscribing the em
ployment of unauthorized aliens.1
We first addressed the interaction of federal immigra
tion law and state laws dealing with the employment of
unauthorized aliens in De Canas, 424 U. S. 351. In that
