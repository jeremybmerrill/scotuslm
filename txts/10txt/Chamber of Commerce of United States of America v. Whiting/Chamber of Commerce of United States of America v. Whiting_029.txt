Opinion R the Court
Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.

2012.11 And in 2003 Congress directed the Secretary of
Homeland Security to make E-Verify available in all 50
States. 117 Stat. 1944; IIRIRA §401(c)(1), 110 Stat. 3009–
656. The Department of Homeland Security has even
used “billboard and radio advertisements . . . to encourage greater participation” in the E-Verify program. 534
F. Supp. 2d, at 1056.
The Chamber contends that “if the 49 other States
followed Arizona’s lead, the state-mandated drain on
federal resources would overwhelm the federal system and
render it completely ineffective, thereby defeating Con
gress’s primary objective in establishing E-Verify.” Brief
for Petitioners 50–51. Whatever the legal significance of
that argument, the United States does not agree with the
factual premise. According to the Department of Home
land Security, “the E-Verify system can accommodate the
increased use that the Arizona statute and existing simi
lar laws would create.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 34. And the United States notes that “[t]he gov
ernment continues to encourage more employers to par
ticipate” in E-Verify. Id., at 31.
The Chamber has reservations about E-Verify’s reliabil
ity, see Brief for Petitioners 49, n. 27, but again the United
States disagrees. The Federal Government reports that
“E-Verify’s successful track record . . . is borne out by
findings documenting the system’s accuracy and partici
pants’ satisfaction.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 31. Indeed, according to the Government, the
program is “the best means available to determine the
employment eligibility of new hires.” U. S. Dept. of Home
land Security, U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,
