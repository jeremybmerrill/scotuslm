Opinion R the Court
Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.

reflects Congress’s careful balancing of several policy
considerations—deterring unauthorized alien employ
ment, avoiding burdens on employers, protecting employee
privacy, and guarding against employment discrimination.
According to the Chamber, the harshness of Arizona’s law
“ ‘exert[s] an extraneous pull on the scheme established by
Congress’ ” that impermissibly upsets that balance. Brief
for Petitioners 45 (quoting Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’
Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 353 (2001)); see Brief for
Petitioners 42–45; Reply Brief for Petitioners 20.
As an initial matter, the cases on which the Chamber
relies in advancing this argument all involve uniquely
federal areas of regulation. See American Ins. Assn. v.
Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 401, 405–406 (2003) (presiden
tial conduct of foreign policy); Crosby v. National Foreign
Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 373–374 (2000) (foreign
affairs power); Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm.,
531 U. S. 341, 352 (2001) (fraud on a federal agency);
United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 97, 99 (2000) (regula
tion of maritime vessels); Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder
Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 143–144 (1989) (patent
law). Regulating in-state businesses through licensing
laws has never been considered such an area of dominant
federal concern.
Furthermore, those cases all concern state actions that
directly interfered with the operation of the federal pro
gram. In Buckman, for example, the Court determined
that allowing a state tort action would cause applicants
before a federal agency “to submit a deluge of information
that the [agency] neither wants nor needs, resulting in
additional burdens on the [agency’s] evaluation of an
application,” and harmful delays in the agency process.
531 U. S., at 351. In Garamendi, a state law imposing
sanctions on insurance companies directly “thwart[ed] the
[Federal] Government’s policy of repose” for insurance
companies that participated in an international program
