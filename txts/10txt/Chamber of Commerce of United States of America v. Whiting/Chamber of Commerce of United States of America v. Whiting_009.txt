Opinion of the Court

migration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
(IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009–655, note following 8 U. S. C.
§1324a. Arizona Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Candelaria,
534 F. Supp. 2d 1036, 1042 (Ariz. 2008); see 8 U. S. C.
§1324a(d).
Only one of those programs—E-Verify—
remains in operation today. Originally known as the
“Basic Pilot Program,” E-Verify “is an internet-based
system that allows an employer to verify an employee’s
work-authorization status.” Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc.
v. Napolitano, 558 F. 3d 856, 862 (CA9 2009). An em
ployer submits a request to the E-Verify system based on
information that the employee provides similar to that

the employer receives either a confirmation or a tentative
nonconfirmation of the employee’s authorization to work.
An employee may challenge a nonconfirmation report. If
the employee does not do so, or if his challenge is unsuc

laws, IIRIRA prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Secu

Federal Government “to participate in” the E-Verify pro
gram, §402(a), (e), 110 Stat. 3009–656 to 3009–658. To
promote use of the program, however, the statute provides
that any employer that utilizes E-Verify “and obtains
confirmation of identity and employment eligibility in
compliance with the terms and conditions of the program
. . . has established a rebuttable presumption” that it has
not violated IRCA’s unauthorized alien employment pro
hibition, §402(b)(1), id., at 3009–656 to 3009–657.

Acting against this statutory and historical background,
several States have recently enacted laws attempting to
