CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA v. WHITING
Opinion R the Court
Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.

United States Code §1324a,” and that the “term shall
be interpreted consistently with 8 United States Code
§1324a and any applicable federal rules and regulations.”
§23–211(8).
The Arizona law provides employers with the same af
firmative defense for good-faith compliance with the I–9
process as does the federal law. Compare 8 U. S. C.
§1324a(a)(3) (“A person or entity that establishes that it
has complied in good faith with the [employment verifica
tion] requirements of [§1324a(b)] with respect to hiring . . .
an alien . . . has established an affirmative defense that
the person or entity has not violated” the law) with Ariz.
Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(J) (“an employer that establishes
that it has complied in good faith with the requirements
of 8 United States Code section 1324a(b) establishes an
affirmative defense that the employer did not knowingly
employ an unauthorized alien”).9 And both the federal
and Arizona law accord employers a rebuttable presump
tion of compliance with the law when they use E-Verify to
validate a finding of employment eligibility. Compare
IIRIRA §402(b), 110 Stat. 3009–656 to 3009–657 with
Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(I).
Apart from the mechanics of the Arizona law, the Cham
ber argues more generally that the law is preempted
because it upsets the balance that Congress sought to
strike when enacting IRCA. In the Chamber’s view, IRCA
——————
9 The

Chamber contends that the Arizona law conflicts with federal
law because IRCA prohibits the use of the I–9 form and “any informa
tion contained in or appended to [it]” from being “used for purposes
other than for enforcement of” IRCA and other specified federal laws. 8
U. S. C. §1324a(b)(5). That argument mistakenly assumes that an
employer would need to use the I–9 form or its supporting documents
themselves to receive the benefit of the affirmative defense in Arizona
court. In fact, “[a]n employer [could] establish good faith compliance
with [the] I–9 process[] . . . through testimony of employees and de
scriptions of office policy.” Brief for Respondents 52; see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 33.
