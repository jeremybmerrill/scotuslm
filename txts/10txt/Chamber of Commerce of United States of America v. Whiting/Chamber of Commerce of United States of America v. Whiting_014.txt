CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

Opinion of the Court 


certificate, approval, registration, charter or similar form
of authorization that is required by law and that is issued
by any agency for the purposes of operating a business in”
the State. §23–211(9)(a). That definition largely parrots
the definition of “license” that Congress codified in the
Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 U. S. C. §551(8)
(“ ‘license’ includes the whole or a part of an agency per
mit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, member
ship, statutory exemption or other form of permission”).
Apart from that general definition, the Arizona law
specifically includes within its definition of “license” docu
ments such as articles of incorporation, certificates of
partnership, and grants of authority to foreign companies
to transact business in the State. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§23–211(9). These examples have clear counterparts in
the APA definition just quoted. See 5 U. S. C. §551(8)
(defining “license” as including a “registration” or “charter”).
A license is “a right or permission granted in accordance
with law . . . to engage in some business or occupation, to
do some act, or to engage in some transaction which but
for such license would be unlawful.” Webster’s Third New
International Dictionary 1304 (2002). Articles of incorpo
ration and certificates of partnership allow the formation
of legal entities and permit them as such to engage in
business and transactions “which but for such” authoriza
tion “would be unlawful.” Ibid.; see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§§10–302, 302(11) (West 2004) (articles of incorporation
allow a corporation “to carry out its business and affairs”
and to “[c]onduct its business”); see also §10–202(A)(3)
(West Supp. 2010). As for state-issued authorizations for
foreign businesses to operate within a State, we have re
peatedly referred to those as “licenses.” See, e.g., Heli
copteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S.
408, 417 (1984); G. D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404,
413, n. 8 (1982); Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Curtis Brown
Co., 260 U. S. 516, 518 (1923). Moreover, even if a law
