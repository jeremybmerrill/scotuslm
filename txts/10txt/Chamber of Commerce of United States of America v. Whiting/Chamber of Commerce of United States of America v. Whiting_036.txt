BREYER, J., dissenting

to verify an employee’s work eligibility through an
Internet-based federal system called E-Verify. If the em
ployer does so, he or she will receive the benefit of a rebut
table presumption of compliance. Illegal Immigration Re
form and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA),
§402(b), 110 Stat. 3009–656 to 3009–657, note following 8
U. S. C. §1324a, p. 331 (Pilot Programs for Employment
Eligibility Confirmation).
Third, the Act creates a central enforcement mecha
nism. The Act directs the Attorney General to establish a
single set of procedures for receiving complaints, investi
gating those complaints that “have a substantial proba
bility of validity,” and prosecuting violations. 8 U. S. C.
§1324a(e)(1).
The relevant immigration officials and
administrative law judges have the power to access neces
sary evidence and witnesses, §1324a(e)(2), and the em
ployer has the right to seek discovery from the Federal
Government, 28 CFR §68.18 (2010). The employer also
has the right to administrative and judicial review of the
administrative law judge’s decision. §§68.54, 68.56.
Fourth, the Act makes it “an unfair immigration-related
employment practice . . . to discriminate against any
individual” in respect to employment “because of such
individual’s national origin.” 8 U. S. C. §1324b(a).
Fifth, the Act sets forth a carefully calibrated sanction
system. The penalties for hiring unauthorized aliens are
graduated to prevent the Act from unduly burdening
employers who are not serious offenders. As adjusted for
inflation, civil penalties for a first violation of the employ
ment restrictions range from $375–$3,200 per worker,
and rise to $3,200–$16,000 per worker for repeat offend
ers. §1324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133 (2008); see also
§1324a(f) (imposing criminal fines of not more than $3,000
per worker and imprisonment for up to six months for
“pattern or practice” violators of employment restrictions).
As importantly, the Act limits or removes any incentive
