SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

(“[L]egislation containing employer sanctions is the most
humane, credible and effective way to respond to the
large-scale influx of undocumented aliens”). As the major­
ity explains, IRCA makes it “unlawful for a person or
other entity to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for
employment in the United States an alien knowing the
alien is an unauthorized alien.” §1324a(a)(1)(A); ante, at
3. IRCA also requires employers to verify that they have
reviewed documents establishing an employee’s eligibility
for employment. See §1324a(b); ante, at 3–4. These two
provisions are the foundation of IRCA’s “comprehensive
scheme prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens in the
United States.” Hoffman, 535 U. S., at 147.
Congress made explicit its intent that IRCA be enforced
uniformly. IRCA declares that “[i]t is the sense of the
Congress that . . . the immigration laws of the United
States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly.”
§115, 100 Stat. 3384 (emphasis added). Congress struc­
tured IRCA’s provisions in a number of ways to accom­
plish this goal of uniform enforcement.
First, and most obviously, Congress expressly displaced
the myriad state laws that imposed civil and criminal
sanctions on employers who hired unauthorized aliens.
See §1324a(h)(2); see also H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58
(“The penalties contained in this legislation are intended
to specifically preempt any state or local laws providing
civil fines and/or criminal sanctions on the hiring, re­
cruitment or referral of undocumented aliens”). Congress
could not have made its intent to pre-empt state and local
laws imposing civil or criminal sanctions any more “ ‘clear
[or] manifest.’ ” Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485
(1996) (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S.
218, 230 (1947)).
Second, Congress centralized in the Federal Govern­
ment enforcement of IRCA’s prohibition on the knowing
employment of unauthorized aliens. IRCA instructs the
