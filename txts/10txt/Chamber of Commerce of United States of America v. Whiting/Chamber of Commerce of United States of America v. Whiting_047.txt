CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


ing exception is about the licensing of agricultural labor
contractors. The House Report on the Act, referring to the
licensing exception, states that the Committee did “not
intend to preempt licensing or ‘fitness to do business laws,’
such as state farm labor contractor laws or forestry laws,
which specifically require such licensee or contractor to
refrain from hiring, recruiting or referring undocumented
aliens.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58 (emphasis added).
The Act’s language, while not requiring this interpreta
tion, is nonetheless consistent with limiting the scope of
the phrase in this way. Context can limit the application
of the term “licensing” to particular types of licensing. The
Act’s subject matter itself limits the term to employment
related licensing. And the Act’s specific reference to those
who “recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthor
ized aliens,” is consistent with employment-related li
censing that focuses primarily upon labor contracting
businesses.
Thus, reading the phrase as limited in scope to laws
licensing businesses that recruit or refer workers for
employment is consistent with the statute’s language,
with the relevant history, and with other statutory provi
sions in the Act. That reading prevents state law from
undermining the Act and from turning the pre-emption
clause on its head. That is why I consider it the better
reading of the statute.
IV
Another section of the Arizona statute requires “every
employer, after hiring an employee,” to “verify the em
ployment eligibility of the employee” through the Federal
Government’s E-Verify program. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§23–214. This state provision makes participation in the
federal E-Verify system mandatory for virtually all Ari
zona employers. The federal law governing the E-Verify
program, however, creates a program that is voluntary.
