CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA v. WHITING
Opinion R the Court
Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.

No. 09–2006 (CA4, Dec. 14, 2009).
Arizona’s use of E-Verify does not conflict with the
federal scheme. The Arizona law requires that “every
employer, after hiring an employee, shall verify the em
ployment eligibility of the employee” through E-Verify.
Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–214(A) (West Supp. 2010). That
requirement is entirely consistent with the federal law.
And the consequences of not using E-Verify under the
Arizona law are the same as the consequences of not using
the system under federal law. In both instances, the only
result is that the employer forfeits the otherwise available
rebuttable presumption that it complied with the law.
Compare IIRIRA §402(b)(1) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§23–212(I).10
B
Congress’s objective in authorizing the development of
E-Verify was to ensure reliability in employment author
ization verification, combat counterfeiting of identity
documents, and protect employee privacy. 8 U. S. C.
§1324a(d)(2). Arizona’s requirement that employers oper
ating within its borders use E-Verify in no way obstructs
achieving those aims.
In fact, the Federal Government has consistently ex
panded and encouraged the use of E-Verify. When EVerify was created in 1996, it was meant to last just four
years and it was made available in only six States.
IIRIRA §401(b) and (c)(1), 110 Stat. 3009–655 to 3009–
656. Congress since has acted to extend the E-Verify
program’s existence on four separate occasions, the most
recent of which ensures the program’s vitality through
——————
10 Arizona has since amended its statute to include other conse
quences, such as the loss of state-allocated economic development
incentives. See 2008 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 152. Because those provi
sions were not part of the statute when this suit was brought, they are
not before us and we do not address their interaction with federal law.
