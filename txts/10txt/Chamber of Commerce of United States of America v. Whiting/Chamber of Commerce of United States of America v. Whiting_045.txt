CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


ing systems for agricultural labor contractors, i.e., firms
that recruited and referred farm (and sometimes forestry)
workers for a fee; some of these laws provided that state
licenses could be revoked if the contractors hired unau
thorized aliens. See, e.g., Cal. Lab. Code §1690(f) (Deering
Supp. 1991); 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§1301.503(4), 1301.505(3)
(1965–1983 Supp. Pamphlet); Ore. Rev. Stat. §§658.405(1),
658.440(2)(d) (1987) (covering forestry workers).
In 1986, Congress (when enacting the Act now before
us) focused directly upon the earlier federal agricultural
labor contractor licensing system. And it changed that
earlier system by including a series of conforming
amendments in the Act. One amendment removes from
the earlier statutes the specific prohibition against hiring
unauthorized aliens. It thereby makes agricultural labor
contractors subject to the Act’s similar general prohibition
against such hiring. IRCA §101(b)(1)(C) (repealing AWPA
§106). Another amendment takes from the Secretary of
Labor most of the Secretary’s enforcement powers in
respect to the hiring of unauthorized aliens. It thereby
leaves agricultural labor contractors subject to the same
single unified enforcement system that the immigration
Act applies to all employers. See 29 U. S. C. §1853. A
third amendment, however, leaves with the Secretary of
Labor the power to withdraw the federal registration
certificate from an agricultural labor contractor that hired
unauthorized aliens. IRCA §101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 29 U. S. C.
§1813(a)(6). Thus, the Act leaves this subset of employers
(i.e., agricultural labor contractors but not other employ
ers) subject to a federal licensing scheme.
So far, the conforming amendments make sense. But
have they not omitted an important matter? Prior to
1986, States as well as the Federal Government could
license agricultural labor contractors. Should the 1986
statute not say whether Congress intended that dual
system to continue? The answer is that the 1986 Act does
