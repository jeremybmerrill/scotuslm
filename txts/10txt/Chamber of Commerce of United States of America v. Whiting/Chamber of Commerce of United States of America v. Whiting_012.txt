CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

Opinion of the Court 


214(A).3 “[P]roof of verifying the employment authoriza

The Chamber of Commerce of the United States and
various business and civil rights organizations (collec

enforcement suit in federal court against those charged
with administering the Arizona law: more than a dozen
Arizona county attorneys, the Governor of Arizona, the
Arizona attorney general, the Arizona registrar of contrac

Code Ann. §41–8–20(B)–(C) (Supp. 2010); Utah Code Ann. §13–47–
201(1) (Lexis Supp. 2010); Va. Code Ann. §40.1–11.2 (Lexis Supp.
2010).
4 No suits had been brought under the Arizona law when the com
plaint in this case was filed. As of the date that Arizona submitted its
merits brief to this Court only three enforcement actions had been
pursued against Arizona employers. See Arizona v. Waterworld Ltd.
Partnership, No. CV2009–038848 (Maricopa Cty. Super. Ct., filed Dec.
21, 2009) (resolved by consent judgment); Arizona v. Danny’s Subway
Inc., No. CV2010–005886 (Maricopa Cty. Super. Ct., filed Mar. 9, 2010)
(resolved by consent decree); Arizona v. Scottsdale Art Factory, LLC,
No. CV2009–036359 (Maricopa Cty. Super. Ct., filed Nov. 18, 2009)
(pending).
