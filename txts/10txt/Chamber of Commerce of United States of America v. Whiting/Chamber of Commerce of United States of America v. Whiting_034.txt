BREYER, J., dissenting 


I

To understand how the majority’s interpretation of the
word “licensing” subverts the Act, one must understand
the basic purposes of the pre-emption provision and of the
Act itself. Ordinarily, an express pre-emption provision

No. 99–132, p. 35 (1985).
Third, the Act seeks to prevent employers from disfavor
ing job applicants who appear foreign. Reiterating long
standing antidiscrimination concerns, the House Commit
tee Report explained:
“Numerous witnesses . . . have expressed their deep
concern that the imposition of employer sanctions will
cause extensive employment discrimination against
Hispanic-Americans and other minority group mem
