CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


stead creates a separate state mechanism for Arizona
state courts to determine whether a person has employed
an unauthorized alien, I would hold that it falls outside
the saving clause and is pre-empted.
I would also hold that federal law pre-empts the provi­
sion of the Arizona Act making mandatory the use of

effectively made a decision for Congress regarding use of a
federal resource, in contravention of the significant policy
objectives motivating Congress’ decision to make partici­
pation in the E-Verify program voluntary.

criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and
similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer
for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.”1 Ibid. The
Arizona Act, all agree, imposes civil sanctions upon those
who employ unauthorized aliens. The Act thus escapes
express pre-emption only if it falls within IRCA’s paren­
thetical saving clause for “licensing and similar laws.”
Ibid.
The saving clause is hardly a paragon of textual clarity.
IRCA does not define “licensing,” nor does it use the word
“licensing” in any other provision. Laws that impose
sanctions by means of licensing exist in many forms.
Some permit authorities to take action with respect to
licenses upon finding that a licensee has engaged in pro­

1 IRCA defines the term “unauthorized alien” to mean, “with respect
to the employment of an alien at a particular time, that the alien is not
at that time either (A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, or (B) authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the
Attorney General.” 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(3).
