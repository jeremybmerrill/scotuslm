CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


a vacuum. It is a fundamental canon of statutory con­
struction that the words of a statute must be read in their
context and with a view to their place in the overall statu­
tory scheme”).2
Before Congress enacted IRCA in 1986, a number of
States had enacted legislation prohibiting employment of
unauthorized aliens. See ante, at 2, and n. 1 (citing 12
such laws). California, for example, prohibited the know­
ing employment of an alien “who is not entitled to lawful
residence in the United States” when “such employment
would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers,”
and made violations punishable by fines of $200 to $500.
1971 Cal. Stats. ch. 1442, §1; see also De Canas v. Bica,
424 U. S. 351, 352, n. 1 (1976). Kansas went even further,
making it a misdemeanor, punishable by a term of con­
finement not to exceed one month, to employ a person
within Kansas knowing “such person to be illegally within
the territory of the United States.” Kan. Stat. Ann. §§21–
4409, 21–4502 (1981).3
Congress enacted IRCA amidst this patchwork of state
laws. IRCA “ ‘forcefully’ made combating the employment
of illegal aliens central to ‘the policy of immigration law.’ ”
Hoffman, 535 U. S., at 147 (quoting INS v. National Cen
ter for Immigrants’ Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 194, and n.
8 (1991); brackets omitted); see also H. R. Rep. No. 99–
682, pt. 1, p. 46 (1986) (hereinafter H. R. Rep. No. 99–682)

2 As

these cases demonstrate, a contextual analysis of a statutory
provision is in no way “untethered” from the statute’s text. Ante, at 15,
n. 6. To the contrary, the majority’s reading of the saving clause—with
its singular focus on the undefined word “licensing” to the exclusion of
all contextual considerations—is “untethered” from the statute as a
whole.
3 None of the pre-IRCA state laws cited by the majority provided for
licensing-related sanctions. The parties have not identified any preIRCA state laws related to licensing that purported to regulate the
employment of unauthorized aliens other than those governing agricul­
tural labor contractors. See ante, at 13–14 (BREYER, J., dissenting).
