CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


the federally designed and federally run E-Verify program
is ready for expansion.
(3) Federal contractors are a special group of employers,
subject to many special requirements, who enter voluntar
ily into a special relation with the Government. For the
Federal Government to mandate that a special group
participate in the E-Verify program tells us little or noth
ing about the effects of a State’s mandating that nearly
every employer within the State participate—as Arizona
has done. And insofar as we have not determined whether
the Executive was authorized by Congress to mandate EVerify for federal contractors, it says nothing about Con
gress’ intent.
(4) There is no reason to imply negatively from language
telling the Secretary not to make the program mandatory,
permission for the States to do so. There is no presump
tion that a State may modify the operation of a uniquely
federal program like E-Verify. Cf. Buckman Co. v. Plain­
tiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 347–348 (2001); Boyle v.
United Technologies Corp., 487 U. S. 500, 504–505 (1988);
see also post, at 15–16 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). The
remaining federal statutory language makes clear the
voluntary nature of the E-Verify program. Arizona’s plan
would undermine that federal objective.
For these reasons I would hold that the federal Act,
including its E-Verify provisions, pre-empts Arizona’s
state law. With respect, I dissent from the majority’s
contrary holdings.
