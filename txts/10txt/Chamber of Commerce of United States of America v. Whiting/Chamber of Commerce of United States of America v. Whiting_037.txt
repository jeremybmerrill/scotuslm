CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


to discriminate on the basis of national origin by setting
antidiscrimination fines at equivalent levels: $375–$3,200
per worker for first-time offenders, and $3,200–$16,000
per worker for repeat offenders. §1324b(g)(2)(B)(iv); 73
Fed. Reg. 10134. The Act then ties its unlawful employ
ment and antidiscrimination provisions together by pro
viding that, should the antihiring provisions terminate,
the antidiscrimination provisions will also terminate,
§1324b(k), “the justification for them having been re
moved,” H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99–1000, p. 87 (1986).

Now, compare and contrast Arizona’s statute. As I have
said, that statute applies to virtually all business-related
licenses, other than professional licenses. Ariz. Rev. Stat.
Ann. §23–211(9). Like the federal Act, the state law for
bids the employment of unauthorized aliens. §§23–212(A),
23–212.01(A). It also provides employers with somewhat
similar defenses. §§23–212(I)–(J), 23–212.01(I)–(J). But
thereafter the state and federal laws part company.
First, the state statute seriously threatens the federal
Act’s antidiscriminatory objectives by radically skewing
the relevant penalties. For example, in the absence of the
Arizona statute, an Arizona employer who intentionally
hires an unauthorized alien for the second time would risk
a maximum penalty of $6,500. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(e)(4)
(A)(ii); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133. But the Arizona statute sub
jects that same employer (in respect to the same two
incidents) to mandatory, permanent loss of the right to do
business in Arizona–a penalty that Arizona’s Governor
has called the “business death penalty.” Ariz. Rev. Stat.
Ann. §23–212.01(F)(2); News Release, Governor Signs
Employer Sanctions Bill (2007), App. 399. At the same
time, the state law leaves the other side of the punishment
balance—the antidiscrimination side—unchanged.
This is no idle concern. Despite the federal Act’s efforts
