BREYER, J., dissenting

would Congress want to write into an express pre-emption
provision—a provision designed to prevent States from
undercutting federal statutory objectives—an exception
that could so easily destabilize its efforts? The answer to
these questions is that Congress would not have wanted to

usually called “licensing” laws) is to permit States to turn
