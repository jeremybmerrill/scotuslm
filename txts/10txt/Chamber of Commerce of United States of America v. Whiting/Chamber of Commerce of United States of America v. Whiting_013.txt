Opinion of the Court

Arizona law because the state law does no more than
impose licensing conditions on businesses operating
within the State. Id., at 1045–1046. With respect to EVerify, the court concluded that although Congress had
made the program voluntary at the national level, it had
expressed no intent to prevent States from mandating
participation. Id., at 1055–1057. The Court of Appeals
affirmed the District Court in all respects, holding that
Arizona’s law was a “ ‘licensing and similar law[]’ ” falling

law’s challenged provisions was “expressly or impliedly
preempted by federal policy.” 558 F. 3d, at 860, 861, 866.
We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).

IRCA expressly preempts States from imposing “civil or
criminal sanctions” on those who employ unauthorized
aliens, “other than through licensing and similar laws.” 8
U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2). The Arizona law, on its face, pur
ports to impose sanctions through licensing laws. The
state law authorizes state courts to suspend or revoke an
employer’s business licenses if that employer knowingly or
intentionally employs an unauthorized alien. Ariz. Rev.
Stat. Ann. §23–212(A) and (F); §23–212.01(A) and (F).
The Arizona law defines “license” as “any agency permit,
