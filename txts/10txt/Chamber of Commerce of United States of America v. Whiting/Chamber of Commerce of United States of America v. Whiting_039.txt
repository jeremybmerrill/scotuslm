CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


Stat. Ann. §23–212(B) (emphasis added), and, upon a
determination that that the “complaint is not false and
frivolous . . . shall notify the appropriate county attorney
to bring an action,” §23–212(C)(3). This mandatory lan
guage, the lower standard (“not frivolous” instead of
“substantial”), and the removal of immigration officials
from the state screening process (substituting numerous,
elected county attorneys) increase the likelihood that
suspicious circumstances will lead to prosecutions and
liability of employers—even where more careful investiga
tion would have revealed that there was no violation.
Again, this matter is far from trivial. Studies of one
important source of Government information—the EVerify system—describe how the federal administrative
process corrected that system’s tentative “unemployable”
indications 18% of the time. This substantial error rate is
not a function of a small sample size. See ante, at 26, n.
12. Rather, data from one fiscal year showed 46,921
workers initially rejected but later “confirmed as work
authorized”—all while E-Verify was used by only a frac
tion of the Nation’s employers. U. S. Citizenship and

May 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).
That is to say nearly one-in-five times that the E-Verify
system suggested that an individual was not lawfully
employable (i.e., returned a tentative nonconfirmation of
work authorization), the system was wrong; and subse
quent review in the federal administrative process deter
mined as much. (And those wrongly identified were likely
to be persons of foreign, rather than domestic, origin, by a
ratio of approximately 20 to 1.) See Westat, Findings of
the E-Verify Program Evaluation xxxi, 210, 246 (Dec.
2009) (assessing data from April to June 2008). E-Verify’s
