Opinion of the Court

§1373(c) in “determining whether an employee is an unau
thorized alien.” §23–212(H). Good-faith compliance with
the federal I–9 process provides employers prosecuted by
the State with an affirmative defense. §23–212(J).
A first instance of “knowingly employ[ing] an unauthor
ized alien” requires that the court order the employer to
terminate the employment of all unauthorized aliens and
file quarterly reports on all new hires for a probationary
period of three years. §23–212(A), (F)(1)(a)–(b). The court
may also “order the appropriate agencies to suspend all
licenses . . . that are held by the employer for [a period]
not to exceed ten business days.” §23–212(F)(1)(d). A
second knowing violation requires that the adjudicating
court “permanently revoke all licenses that are held by the
employer specific to the business location where the unau
thorized alien performed work.” §23–212(F)(2).
For a first intentional violation, the court must order
the employer to terminate the employment of all unau
thorized aliens and file quarterly reports on all new hires
for a probationary period of five years. §23–212.01(A),
(F)(1)(a)–(b).
The court must also suspend all the
employer’s licenses for a minimum of 10 days. §23–
212.01(F)(1)(c). A second intentional violation requires
the permanent revocation of all business licenses. §23–
212.01(F)(2).
With respect to both knowing and intentional violations,
a violation qualifies as a “second violation” only if it oc
curs at the same business location as the first violation,
during the time that the employer is already on probation
for a violation at that location. §23–212(F)(3)(a)–(b); §23–
212.01(F)(3)(a)–(b).
The Arizona law also requires that “every employer,
after hiring an employee, shall verify the employment
eligibility of the employee” by using E-Verify. §23–
