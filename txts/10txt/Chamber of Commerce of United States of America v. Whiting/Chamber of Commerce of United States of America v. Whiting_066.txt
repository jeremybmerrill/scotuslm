SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

state courts must find that an employer has employed an
unauthorized alien before imposing the sanctions enumer­
ated in the Act. §§23–212(F), 23–212.01(F). Because the
Act’s sanctions are not premised on a final federal deter­
mination that an employer has violated IRCA, I would
hold that the Act does not fall within IRCA’s saving clause
and is therefore pre-empted.9

I agree with the conclusion reached by JUSTICE BREYER
in Part IV of his dissenting opinion that federal law impli­
edly pre-empts the provision in the Arizona Act requiring
all Arizona employers to use the federal E-Verify program.
See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–214. I also agree with much
of his reasoning. I write separately to offer a few addi­
tional observations.
As we have recently recognized, that a state law makes
mandatory something that federal law makes voluntary
does not mean, in and of itself, that the state law “stands
as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the
full purposes and objectives of Congress,” Crosby v. Na
tional Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 373 (2000)
(internal quotation marks omitted). See Williamson v.
Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)
(slip op., at 1–2) (concluding that a federal regulation
permitting manufacturers to choose between two seatbelt
options did not pre-empt state tort liability based on a
decision to install one of those options); see also id., at ___
(slip op., at 2) (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring) (“[T]he mere
fact that an agency regulation allows manufacturers a
choice between options is insufficient to justify implied
——————
9 Because I believe that the Arizona Act does not fall within IRCA’s
saving clause for this reason, I have no reason to consider the separate question whether the Act’s definition of “license” sweeps too
broadly. Compare ante, at 9–11, with ante, at 1–2, 11–12 (BREYER, J.,
dissenting).
