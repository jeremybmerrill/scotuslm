CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA v. WHITING
Opinion R the Court
Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.

and the law prohibiting discrimination—and there is no
reason to suppose that Arizona employers will choose not
to do so.
As with any piece of legislation, Congress did indeed
seek to strike a balance among a variety of interests when
it enacted IRCA. Part of that balance, however, involved
allocating authority between the Federal Government and
the States. The principle that Congress adopted in doing
so was not that the Federal Government can impose large
sanctions, and the States only small ones. IRCA instead
preserved state authority over a particular category of
sanctions—those imposed “through licensing and similar
laws.”
Of course Arizona hopes that its law will result in more
effective enforcement of the prohibition on employing
unauthorized aliens. But in preserving to the States the
authority to impose sanctions through licensing laws,
Congress did not intend to preserve only those state laws
that would have no effect. The balancing process that
culminated in IRCA resulted in a ban on hiring unauthor
ized aliens, and the state law here simply seeks to enforce
that ban.
Implied preemption analysis does not justify a “free
wheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in
tension with federal objectives”; such an endeavor “would
undercut the principle that it is Congress rather than the
courts that preempts state law.” Gade v. National Solid
Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 111 (1992)
(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg
ment); see Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238,
256 (1984). Our precedents “establish that a high thresh
old must be met if a state law is to be pre-empted for
conflicting with the purposes of a federal Act.” Gade,
supra, at 110. That threshold is not met here.
