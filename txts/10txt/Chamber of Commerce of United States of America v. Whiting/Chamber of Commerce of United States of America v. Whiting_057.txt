CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


Attorney General to designate a specialized federal agency
unit whose “primary duty” will be to prosecute violations
of IRCA. §1324a(e)(1)(D). IRCA also instructs the Attor­
ney General to establish procedures for receiving com­
plaints, investigating complaints having “a substantial
probability of validity,” and investigating other violations.
§1324a(e)(1); see also 8 CFR §274a.9 (2010). Upon con­
cluding that a person has violated IRCA, the Attorney
General must provide the person with notice and an op­
portunity for a hearing before a federal administrative law
judge (ALJ). 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(e)(3)(A), (B). If the person
does not request a hearing, the Attorney General may
impose a final, nonappealable order requiring payment of
sanctions. §1324a(e)(3)(B). If the person requests a hear­
ing, the ALJ is required to hold a hearing and, upon find­
ing that the person has violated IRCA, must order the
payment of sanctions. §1324a(e)(3)(C). The ALJ’s order is
the final agency order, unless the affected person requests
and obtains further administrative appellate review.
§1324a(e)(7); see also 28 CFR §68.54 (2010). IRCA grants
immigration officers and ALJs “reasonable access to
examine evidence of any person or entity being investi­
gated” and provides them with extensive subpoena powers.
§1324a(e)(2). And the immigration officers investigating
suspected violations obviously have access to the relevant
federal information concerning the work authorization
status of the employee in question.4
Third, Congress provided persons “adversely affected”
by an agency order with a right of review in the federal
courts of appeals. §1324a(e)(8); see also §1324a(e)(9)
(directing the Attorney General in cases of noncompliance
to file suit in federal district court to enforce a final order
——————
4 By regulation, the Attorney General has conferred on parties
charged with violating IRCA the right to obtain discovery from the
Federal Government in a hearing before an ALJ. See 28 CFR §68.18.
