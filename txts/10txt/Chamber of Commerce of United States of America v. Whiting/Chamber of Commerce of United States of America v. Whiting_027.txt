Opinion of the Court 


III 

The Chamber also argues that Arizona’s requirement
that employers use the federal E-Verify system to deter
mine whether an employee is authorized to work is im
pliedly preempted. In the Chamber’s view, “Congress
wanted to develop a reliable and non-burdensome system
of work-authorization verification” that could serve as an
alternative to the I–9 procedures, and the “mandatory use
of E-Verify impedes that purpose.” 558 F. 3d, at 866.
A
We begin again with the relevant text. The provision of
IIRIRA setting up the program that includes E-Verify
contains no language circumscribing state action. It does,
however, constrain federal action: absent a prior violation
of federal law, “the Secretary of Homeland Security may
not require any person or other entity [outside of the
Federal Government] to participate in a pilot program”
such as E-Verify. IIRIRA §402(a), 110 Stat. 3009–656.
That provision limits what the Secretary of Homeland
Security may do—nothing more.
The Federal Government recently argued just that, and
approvingly referenced Arizona’s E-Verify law when doing
so. In 2008, an Executive Order mandated that executive
agencies require federal contractors to use E-Verify as a
condition of receiving a federal contract. See Exec. Order
No. 13465, 73 Fed. Reg. 33286 (2008). When that Order
and its implementing regulation were challenged, the
Government pointed to Arizona’s E-Verify mandate as an
example of a permissible use of that system: “[T]he State
of Arizona has required all public and private employers
in that State to use E-Verify . . . . This is permissible
because the State of Arizona is not the Secretary of Home
land Security.” Defendants’ Reply Memorandum in Sup
