SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

importantly, §1373(c) was enacted in 1996, see §642(c),
110 Stat. 3009–707, and thus says nothing about Con­
gress’ intent when it enacted IRCA’s saving clause a dec­
ade earlier. See Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 238
(1999).
Collectively, these provisions demonstrate Congress’
intent to build a centralized, exclusively federal scheme
for determining whether a person has “employ[ed], or
recruit[ed] or refer[red] for a fee for employment, unau­
thorized aliens.” 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2).

IRCA’s saving clause must be construed against this
backdrop. Focusing primarily on the text of the saving
clause, Arizona and the majority read the clause to permit
States to determine themselves whether a person has
employed an unauthorized alien, so long as they do so in
connection with licensing sanctions. See ante, at 12–13.
This interpretation overlooks the broader statutory con­
text and renders the statutory scheme “[in]coherent and
[in]consistent.” Ali, 552 U. S., at 222.
Under the majority’s reading of the saving clause, state
prosecutors decide whether to commence licensing-related
proceedings against a person suspected of employing an
unauthorized alien. The majority’s holding also permits
state courts and other tribunals to adjudicate the question
whether an employer has employed an unauthorized alien.
The Arizona Act illustrates the problems with reading the
saving clause to permit such state action. The Act directs
prosecutors to verify an employee’s work authorization
with the Federal Government pursuant to §1373(c), e.g.,
Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(B) (West Supp. 2010), and
the state court “shall consider only the federal govern­
ment’s determination pursuant to [§]1373(c)” in “determin­
