hibited conduct. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §4–
210(A)(1) (West 2011) (liquor licenses may be suspended
or revoked if the licensing authority determines after
notice and a hearing that repeated acts of violence have
occurred on the licensed premises). Others, more nar­
rowly, permit authorities to take such action following a
pre-existing determination by another authorized body
that the licensee has violated another provision of law.
See, e.g., §4–202(D) (liquor licenses may not be renewed to
persons who have been convicted of felonies within the
past five years). That both types of laws might be defined
in some contexts as licensing laws does not necessarily
mean that Congress intended the saving clause to encom­
pass both types. See Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S.
481, 486 (2006) (“A word in a statute may or may not
extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities”);
see also FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip
op., at 9) (“[C]onstruing statutory language is not merely
an exercise in ascertaining the outer limits of [a word’s]
definitional possibilities” (internal quotation marks omit­
ted; second alteration in original)). In isolation, the text of
IRCA’s saving clause provides no hint as to which type or
types of licensing laws Congress had in mind.

Because the plain text of the saving clause does not
resolve the question, it is necessary to look to the text
of IRCA as a whole to illuminate Congress’ intent. See
Dolan, 546 U. S., at 486 (“Interpretation of a word or
phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,
considering the purpose and context of the statute”); Ali v.
Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 222 (2008) (con­
struction of a statutory term “must, to the extent possible,
ensure that the statutory scheme is coherent and consis­
tent”); Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803,
