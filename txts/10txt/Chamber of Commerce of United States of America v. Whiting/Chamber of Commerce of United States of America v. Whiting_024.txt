CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA v. WHITING
Opinion R the Court
Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.

negotiated by the President. 539 U. S., at 425. Crosby
involved a state law imposing sanctions on any entity do
ing business with Burma, a law that left the President
with “less to offer and less economic and diplomatic lever
age” in exercising his foreign affairs powers. 530 U. S., at
377. The state law in Bonito Boats extended patent-like
protection “for subject matter for which patent protection
has been denied or has expired,” “thus eroding the general
rule of free competition upon which the attractiveness of
the federal patent bargain depends.” 489 U. S., at 159,
161. And the portions of Locke on which the Chamber
relies involved state efforts “to impose additional unique
substantive regulation on the at-sea conduct of vessels”—
“an area where the federal interest has been manifest
since the beginning of our Republic.” 529 U. S., at 106, 99.
There is no similar interference with the federal program
in this case; that program operates unimpeded by the
state law.
License suspension and revocation are significant sanc
tions. But they are typical attributes of a licensing re
gime. Numerous Arizona laws provide for the suspension
or revocation of licenses for failing to comply with specified
state laws. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§5–108.05(D),
32–852.01(L), 32–1154(B), 32–1451(M), 41–2186 (West
2002). Federal law recognizes that the authority to license
includes the authority to suspend, revoke, annul, or with
draw a license. See 5 U. S. C. §551(9). Indeed, AWPA
itself—on which the Chamber so heavily relies—provides
that AWPA “certificates of registration” can be suspended
or revoked for employing an unauthorized alien. 29
U. S. C. §1813(a)(6). It makes little sense to preserve state
authority to impose sanctions through licensing, but not
allow States to revoke licenses when appropriate as one of
those sanctions.
The Chamber and JUSTICE BREYER assert that employ
ers will err on the side of discrimination rather than risk
