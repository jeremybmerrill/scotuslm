CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting


for[m]” enforcement of “the immigration laws of the
United States,” IRCA §115, 100 Stat. 3384, I cannot be­
lieve that Congress intended for the 50 States and count­
less localities to implement their own distinct enforcement
and adjudication procedures for deciding whether employ­
ers have employed unauthorized aliens. Reading the sav­
ing clause as the majority does subjects employers to a
patchwork of enforcement schemes similar to the one that
Congress sought to displace when it enacted IRCA. Hav­
ing carefully constructed a uniform federal scheme for
determining whether a person has employed an unauthor­
ized alien, Congress could not plausibly have meant to
create such a gaping hole in that scheme through the
undefined, parenthetical phrase “licensing and similar
laws.” See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,
531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001) (“Congress . . . does not, one
might say, hide elephants in mouseholes”).
In sum, the statutory scheme as a whole defeats Ari­
zona’s and the majority’s reading of the saving clause.
Congress would not sensibly have permitted States to
determine for themselves whether a person has employed
an unauthorized alien, while at the same time creating a
specialized federal procedure for making such a determi­
nation, withholding from the States the information nec­
essary to make such a determination, and precluding use
of the I–9 forms in nonfederal proceedings. See United
States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 106 (2000) (“We decline to
give broad effect to saving clauses where doing so would
upset the careful regulatory scheme established by federal
law”).
To render IRCA’s saving clause consistent with the
statutory scheme, I read the saving clause to permit
States to impose licensing sanctions following a final
federal determination that a person has violated
§1324a(a)(1)(A) by knowingly hiring, recruiting, or refer­
