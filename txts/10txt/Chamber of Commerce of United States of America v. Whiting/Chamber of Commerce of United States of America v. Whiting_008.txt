CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

Opinion of the Court 


that the individual is not an unauthorized alien” by re
viewing these documents. §1324a(b)(1)(A). The form I–9
itself “and any information contained in or appended to [it]
. . . may not be used for purposes other than for enforce
ment of” IRCA and other specified provisions of federal
law. §1324a(b)(5).
Employers that violate IRCA’s strictures may be sub
jected to both civil and criminal sanctions. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement, an entity within the Depart
ment of Homeland Security, is authorized to bring charges
against a noncompliant employer under §1324a(e). De
pending on the circumstances of the violation, a civil fine
ranging from $250 to $16,000 per unauthorized worker
may be imposed. See §1324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10136
(2008). Employers that engage in a pattern or practice
of violating IRCA’s requirements can be criminally prose

§1324a(f)(1). The Act also imposes fines for engaging in
“unfair immigration-related employment practice[s]” such
as discriminating on the basis of citizenship or national
origin. §1324b(a)(1); see §1324b(g)(2)(B). Good-faith com

provides an employer with an affirmative defense if
charged with a §1324a violation. §1324a(a)(3).
IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat em
ployment of unauthorized workers. The Act expressly
preempts “any State or local law imposing civil or criminal
sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws)
upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for
employment, unauthorized aliens.” §1324a(h)(2). Under
that provision, state laws imposing civil fines for the
employment of unauthorized workers like the one we
upheld in De Canas are now expressly preempted.
In 1996, in an attempt to improve IRCA’s employment
verification system, Congress created three experimental
complements to the I–9 process as part of the Illegal Im
