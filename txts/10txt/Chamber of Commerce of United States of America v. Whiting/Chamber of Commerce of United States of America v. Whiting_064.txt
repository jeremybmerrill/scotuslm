SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ring for a fee an unauthorized alien.8 This interpretation
both is faithful to the saving clause’s text, see supra, at 2–
3, and best reconciles the saving clause with IRCA’s “care­
ful regulatory scheme,” Locke, 529 U. S., at 106. It also
makes sense as a practical matter. In enacting IRCA’s
pre-emption clause, Congress vested in the Federal Gov­
ernment the authority to impose civil and criminal sanc­
tions on persons who employ unauthorized aliens. Licens­
ing and other types of business-related permissions are
typically a matter of state law, however. See, e.g., Kamen
v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 98 (1991)
(noting that “[c]orporation law” is an area traditionally
“governed by state-law standards”); Chicago Title & Trust

8 This reading of the saving clause finds support in IRCA’s legislative
history. The House Committee on the Judiciary reported that IRCA
was “not intended to preempt or prevent lawful state or local processes
concerning the suspension, revocation or refusal to reissue a license to
any person who has been found to have violated the sanctions pro­
visions in this legislation.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58 (emphasis
added). The Committee’s reference to “this legislation” is, of course, a
reference to IRCA, and only federal officers, ALJs, and courts have
authority under IRCA to find that a person has violated the statute’s
sanctions provisions.
My reading is also consistent with, though not compelled by, the
provisions in IRCA that amended the Migrant and Seasonal Agricul­
tural Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 96 Stat. 2583. As JUSTICE
BREYER discusses in detail, see ante, at 13–15 (dissenting opinion),
AWPA requires entities to secure a certificate of registration from the
Department of Labor before engaging in any “farm labor contracting
activity.” AWPA §101, 96 Stat. 2587, 29 U. S. C. §1811(a). Before 1986,
AWPA prohibited farm labor contractors from hiring unauthorized
aliens, and it permitted the Department of Labor to institute adminis­
trative proceedings to enforce this prohibition. See §§103(a)(3), 103(b),
106(a), 96 Stat. 2588–2590. In IRCA, Congress repealed this pro­
hibition, IRCA §101(b)(1)(C), but authorized the Secretary of Labor to
withdraw a contractor’s federal registration certificate upon a finding of
an IRCA violation, IRCA §101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 100 Stat. 3372, 29 U. S. C.
§1813(a)(6). Thus, IRCA made AWPA’s licensing sanctions turn on a
prior federal adjudication of a violation of IRCA.
