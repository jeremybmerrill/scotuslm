CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF 

AMERICA v. WHITING 

Opinion of the Court 


United States v. Shreveport Grain & Elevator Co., 287
U. S. 77, 83 (1932) (“extrinsic aids to construction” may be
used “to solve, but not to create, an ambiguity” (emphasis
and internal quotation marks omitted)).
The Chamber argues that its textual and structural
arguments are bolstered by IRCA’s legislative history. We
have already concluded that Arizona’s law falls within the
plain text of IRCA’s savings clause. And, as we have said
before, Congress’s “authoritative statement is the statu
tory text, not the legislative history.” Exxon Mobil Corp.
v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005); see
also Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U. S.
137, 149–150, n. 4 (2002). Whatever the usefulness of
relying on legislative history materials in general, the
arguments against doing so are particularly compelling
here. Beyond verbatim recitation of the statutory text, all
of the legislative history documents related to IRCA save
one fail to discuss the savings clause at all. The Senate
Judiciary Committee Report on the Senate version of
the law does not comment on it. See S. Rep. No. 99–132
(1985). Only one of the four House Reports on the law
touches on the licensing exception, see H. R. Rep. No. 99–
682, pt. 1, p. 58 (1986), and we have previously dismissed
that very report as “a rather slender reed” from “one
House of a politically divided Congress.” Hoffman, supra,
at 149–150, n. 4. And the Conference Committee Report
does not discuss the scope of IRCA’s preemption provision
in any way. See H. Conf. Rep. No. 99–1000 (1986).6

6 JUSTICE

BREYER poses several rhetorical questions challenging our
reading of IRCA and then goes on to propose two seemingly alternative
views of the phrase “licensing and similar laws”—that it was meant to
refer to “employment-related licensing systems,” post, at 11 (dissenting
opinion) (emphasis deleted), or, even more narrowly, to “the licensing of
firms in the business of recruiting or referring workers for employment,
such as . . . state agricultural labor contractor licensing schemes,” post,
at 13. If we are asking questions, a more telling one may be why, if
