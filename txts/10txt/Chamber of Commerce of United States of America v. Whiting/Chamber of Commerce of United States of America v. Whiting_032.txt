B. WHITING ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[May 26, 2011]


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,
dissenting.
The federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986 (Act or IRCA) pre-empts “any State or local law
imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through
licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or
recruit, or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized
aliens.” 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2). The state law before us,
the Legal Arizona Workers Act, imposes civil sanctions
upon those who employ unauthorized aliens. See Ariz.
Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211 et seq. (West Supp. 2010). Thus
the state law falls within the federal Act’s general pre
emption rule and is pre-empted—unless it also falls within
that rule’s exception for “licensing and similar laws.”
Unlike the Court, I do not believe the state law falls
within this exception, and I consequently would hold it
pre-empted.
Arizona calls its state statute a “licensing law,” and the
statute uses the word “licensing.” But the statute strays
beyond the bounds of the federal licensing exception, for
it defines “license” to include articles of incorporation and
partnership certificates, indeed virtually every state-law
authorization for any firm, corporation, or partnership to
do business in the State. §23–211(9)(a); cf. §23–211(9)(c)
