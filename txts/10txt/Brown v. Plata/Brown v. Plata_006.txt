BROWN v. PLATA
Syllabus
ments are made with the objective of releasing the fewest possible
prisoners consistent with an efficacious remedy. Pp. 42–44.
(c) The three-judge court did not err in providing a 2-year dead
line for relief, especially in light of the State’s failure to contest the
issue at trial. The State has not asked this Court to extend the dead
line, but the three-judge court has the authority, and responsibility,
to amend its order as warranted by the exercise of sound discretion.
Proper respect for the State and for its governmental processes re
quire that court to exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State consid
erable latitude to find mechanisms and make plans that will
promptly and effectively correct the violations consistent with public
safety. The court may, e.g., grant a motion to extend the deadline if
the State meets appropriate preconditions designed to ensure that
the plan will be implemented without undue delay. Such observa
tions reflect the fact that the existing order, like all ongoing equitable
relief, must remain open to appropriate modification, and are not in
tended to cast doubt on the validity of the order’s basic premise.
Pp. 44–48.
