actually produce physical ‘torture or a lingering death.’ ”
Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 103 (1976) (quoting In re
Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890)); see generally A.
Elsner, Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons
(2004). Just as a prisoner may starve if not fed, he or she
may suffer or die if not provided adequate medical care. A
prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, includ
ing adequate medical care, is incompatible with the con
cept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society.
If government fails to fulfill this obligation, the courts
have a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth
Amendment violation. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678,
687, n. 9 (1978). Courts must be sensitive to the State’s
interest in punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, as

prison administrators faced with the difficult and danger

See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 547–548 (1979). Courts
nevertheless must not shrink from their obligation to “en
force the constitutional rights of all ‘persons,’ including
prisoners.” Cruz v. Beto, 405 U. S. 319, 321 (1972) (per
curiam). Courts may not allow constitutional violations to
continue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion
into the realm of prison administration.
Courts faced with the sensitive task of remedying un
constitutional prison conditions must consider a range of
available options, including appointment of special mas
ters or receivers and the possibility of consent decrees.
When necessary to ensure compliance with a constitu
tional mandate, courts may enter orders placing limits on
a prison’s population. By its terms, the PLRA restricts the
circumstances in which a court may enter an order “that
has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison
population.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(g)(4). The order in this
case does not necessarily require the State to release any
prisoners. The State may comply by raising the design
