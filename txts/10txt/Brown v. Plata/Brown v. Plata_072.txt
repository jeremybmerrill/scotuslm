BROWN v. PLATA
SCALIA, J., dissenting

grasping authority that appellate courts are not supposed
to have, and using it to enact a compromise solution with
no legal basis other than the Court’s say-so. That we are
driven to engage in these extralegal activities should be a
sign that the entire project of permitting district courts to
run prison systems is misbegotten.
But perhaps I am being too unkind. The Court, or at

that the judges of the District Court are likely to call its
bluff, since they know full well it cannot possibly be an
abuse of discretion to refuse to accept the State’s proposed
modifications in an injunction that has just been approved
(affirmed) in its present form. An injunction, after all,
does not have to be perfect; only good enough for govern

the coda is nothing more than a ceremonial washing of the
hands—making it clear for all to see, that if the terrible
things sure to happen as a consequence of this outrageous
order do happen, they will be none of this Court’s respon
sibility. After all, did we not want, and indeed even sug
gest, something better?

In view of the incoherence of the Eighth Amendment
claim at the core of this case, the nonjudicial features of
institutional reform litigation that this case exemplifies,
and the unique concerns associated with mass prisoner
releases, I do not believe this Court can affirm this injunc

may not order a prisoner’s release unless it determines
that the prisoner is suffering from a violation of his consti
tutional rights, and that his release, and no other relief,
will remedy that violation. Thus, if the court determines
that a particular prisoner is being denied constitutionally
required medical treatment, and the release of that pris
oner (and no other remedy) would enable him to obtain
