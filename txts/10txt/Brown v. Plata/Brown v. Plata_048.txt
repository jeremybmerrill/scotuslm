BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 15 (1971)).
Nevertheless, the PLRA requires a court to adopt a
remedy that is “narrowly tailored” to the constitutional
violation and that gives “substantial weight” to public
safety. 18 U. S. C. §3626(a). When a court is imposing a
population limit, this means the court must set the limit
at the highest population consistent with an efficacious
remedy. The court must also order the population reduc
tion achieved in the shortest period of time reasonably
consistent with public safety.
A
The three-judge court concluded that the population of
California’s prisons should be capped at 137.5% of design
capacity. This conclusion is supported by the record.
Indeed, some evidence supported a limit as low as 100% of
design capacity. The chief deputy secretary of Correc
tional Healthcare Services for the California prisons tes
tified that California’s prisons “ ‘were not designed and
made no provision for any expansion of medical care space
beyond the initial 100% of capacity.’ ” Juris. App. 176a.
Other evidence supported a limit as low as 130%. The
head of the State’s Facilities Strike Team recommended
reducing the population to 130% of design capacity as a
long-term goal. Id., at 179a–180a. A former head of cor
rectional systems in Washington State, Maine, and Penn
sylvania testified that a 130% limit would “ ‘give prison
officials and staff the ability to provide the necessary
programs and services for California’s prisoners.’ ” Id., at
180a. A former executive director of the Texas prisons
testified that a limit of 130% was “ ‘realistic and appro
priate’ ” and would “ ‘ensure that [California’s] prisons are
safe and provide legally required services.’ ” Ibid. And a
former acting secretary of the California prisons agreed
with a 130% limit with the caveat that a 130% limit might
prove inadequate in some older facilities. Ibid.
