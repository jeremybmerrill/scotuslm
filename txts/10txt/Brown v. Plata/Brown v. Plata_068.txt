BROWN v. PLATA
SCALIA, J., dissenting

witnesses and decided to split the difference. But the
ability of judges to spit back or even average-out numbers
spoon-fed to them by expert witnesses does not render
them competent decisionmakers in areas in which they
are otherwise unqualified.
The District Court also relied heavily on the views of the
Receiver and Special Master, and those reports play a
starring role in the Court’s opinion today. The Court notes
that “the Receiver and the Special Master filed reports
stating that overcrowding posed a significant barrier to
their efforts” and deems those reports “persuasive evi
dence that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, any rem
edy might prove unattainable and would at the very least
require vast expenditures of resources by the State.” Ante,
at 31–32. The use of these reports is even less consonant
with the traditional judicial role than the District Court’s
reliance on the expert testimony at trial. The latter, even
when, as here, it is largely the expression of policy judg
ments, is at least subject to cross-examination. Relying on
the un-cross-examined findings of an investigator, sent
into the field to prepare a factual report and give sugges
tions on how to improve the prison system, bears no re
semblance to ordinary judicial decisionmaking. It is true
that the PLRA contemplates the appointment of Special
Masters (although not Receivers), but Special Masters are
authorized only to “conduct hearings and prepare pro
posed findings of fact” and “assist in the development of
remedial plans,” 18 U. S. C. §3626(f)(6). This does not
authorize them to make factual findings (unconnected to
hearings) that are given seemingly wholesale deference.
Neither the Receiver nor the Special Master was selected
by California to run its prisons, and the fact that they may
be experts in the field of prison reform does not justify the
judicial imposition of their perspectives on the state.
