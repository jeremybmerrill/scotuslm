BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

through grossly inadequate provision of medical and
mental health care.
This Court now holds that the PLRA does authorize the
relief afforded in this case and that the court-mandated
population limit is necessary to remedy the violation of
prisoners’ constitutional rights. The order of the three
judge court, subject to the right of the State to seek
its modification in appropriate circumstances, must be
affirmed.

A

The degree of overcrowding in California’s prisons is
exceptional. California’s prisons are designed to house a
population just under 80,000, but at the time of the three
judge court’s decision the population was almost double
that. The State’s prisons had operated at around 200% of
design capacity for at least 11 years. Prisoners are
crammed into spaces neither designed nor intended to
house inmates. As many as 200 prisoners may live in a
gymnasium, monitored by as few as two or three correc
tional officers. App. 1337–1338, 1350; see Appendix B,
infra. As many as 54 prisoners may share a single toilet.
App. 1337.
The Corrections Independent Review Panel, a body
appointed by the Governor and composed of correctional
consultants and representatives from state agencies,
concluded that California’s prisons are “ ‘severely over
crowded, imperiling the safety of both correctional em
ployees and inmates.’ ”1 Juris. Statement App., O. T. 2009,

a bipartisan and independent state body, which stated that
“[o]vercrowded conditions inside the prison walls are unsafe for inmates
and staff,” Solving California’s Corrections Crisis: Time is Running Out
17 (Jan. 2007), and that “California’s correctional system is in a tail
spin,” id., at i.
