BROWN v. PLATA
ALITO, J., dissenting

lation controls will solve California’s prison health care
problems . . . are simply wrong.’ ” Juris. App. 282a.
The State proposed several remedies other than a mas
sive release of prisoners, but the three-judge court, seem
ingly intent on attacking the broader problem of general
overcrowding, rejected all of the State’s proposals. In
doing so, the court made three critical errors.
First, the court did not assess those proposals and other
remedies in light of conditions proved to exist at the time
the release order was framed. Had more recent evidence
been taken into account, a less extreme remedy might
have been shown to be sufficient.
Second, the court failed to distinguish between condi
tions that fall below the level that may be desirable as a
matter of public policy and conditions that do not meet the
minimum level mandated by the Constitution. To take
one example, the court criticized the California system
because prison doctors must conduct intake exams in
areas separated by folding screens rather than in separate
rooms, creating conditions that “do not allow for appropri
ate confidentiality.” Id., at 88a. But the legitimate pri
vacy expectations of inmates are greatly diminished, see
Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 525–526 (1984), and this
Court has never suggested that the failure to provide
private consultation rooms in prisons amounts to cruel
and unusual punishment.
Third, the court rejected alternatives that would not
have provided “ ‘immediate’ ” relief. Juris. App. 148a. But
nothing in the PLRA suggests that public safety may be
sacrificed in order to implement an immediate remedy
rather than a less dangerous one that requires a more
extended but reasonable period of time.
If the three-judge court had not made these errors, it is
entirely possible that an adequate but less drastic reme
dial plan could have been crafted. Without up-to-date
information, it is not possible to specify what such a plan
