ALITO, J., dissenting

California prison system had the 13th lowest average
mortality rate of all 50 state systems.6
The majority highlights past instances in which particu
lar prisoners received shockingly deficient medical care.
See ante, at 5, 6–7, 10 (recounting five incidents). But
such anecdotal evidence cannot be given undue weight in
assessing the current state of the California system. The
population of the California prison system (156,000 in
mates at the time of trial) is larger than that of many
medium-sized cities,7 and an examination of the medical
care provided to the residents of many such cities would
likely reveal cases in which grossly deficient treatment
was provided. Instances of past mistreatment in the
California system are relevant, but prospective relief must
be tailored to present and future, not past, conditions.

Under the PLRA, a court may not grant any prospective
relief unless the court finds that the relief is narrowly
drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the
“violation of [a] Federal right, and is the least intrusive
means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal
right.” §3626(a)(1)(A). In addition, the PLRA prohibits
the issuance of a prisoner release order unless the court
