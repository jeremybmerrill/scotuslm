BROWN v. PLATA
ALITO, J., dissenting

of past violations will not do; nor is it sufficient simply
to establish that some violations continue. The scope of
permissible relief depends on the scope of any continuing
violations, and therefore it was essential for the three
judge court to make a reliable determination of the extent
of any violations as of the time its release order was is
sued. Particularly in light of the radical nature of its
chosen remedy, nothing less than an up-to-date assess
ment was tolerable.
The three-judge court, however, relied heavily on out
dated information and findings and refused to permit
California to introduce new evidence. Despite evidence of
improvement,1 the three-judge court relied on old findings
made by the single-judge courts, see Juris. App. 76a–77a,
including a finding made 14 years earlier, see id., at 170a
(citing Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1316, 1319
(ED Cal. 1995)). The three-judge court highlighted death
statistics from 2005, see Juris. App. 9a, while ignoring the
“significant and continuous decline since 2006,” California

of Year 2008 Death Reviews 31 (Dec. 2009) (hereinafter
2008 Death Reviews). And the court dwelled on conditions
at a facility that has since been replaced. See Juris. App.
19a–20a, 24a, 89a–90a, 94a, 107a, 111a.
Prohibiting the State from introducing evidence about
conditions as of the date when the prisoner release order
was under consideration, id., at 76a–78a, and n. 42, the
three-judge court explicitly stated that it would not “evalu

1 Before requesting the appointment of a three-judge court, the Dis
trict Court in Coleman recognized “commendable progress” in the
State’s effort to provide adequate mental health care, Juris. App. 294a,
and the District Court in Plata acknowledged that “the Receiver has
made much progress since his appointment,” id., at 280a. The report of
the Special Master to which the Court refers, ante, at 18–19, identifies
a “generally positive trend.” App. 803.
