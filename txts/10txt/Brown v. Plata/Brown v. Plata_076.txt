BROWN v. PLATA
ALITO, J., dissenting

without finding that the current population level violates
the Constitution.
Two cases were before the three-judge court, and neither
targeted the general problem of overcrowding. Indeed, the
plaintiffs in one of those cases readily acknowledge that
the current population level is not itself unconstitutional.
Brief for Coleman Appellees 56. Both of the cases were
brought not on behalf of all inmates subjected to over
crowding, but rather in the interests of much more limited
classes of prisoners, namely, those needing mental health
treatment and those with other serious medical needs.
But these cases were used as a springboard to implement
a criminal justice program far different from that chosen
by the state legislature. Instead of crafting a remedy to
attack the specific constitutional violations that were
found—which related solely to prisoners in the two plain
tiff classes—the lower court issued a decree that will at
best provide only modest help to those prisoners but that
is very likely to have a major and deleterious effect on
public safety.
The three-judge court ordered the premature release of
approximately 46,000 criminals—the equivalent of three
Army divisions.
The approach taken by the three-judge court flies in the
face of the PLRA. Contrary to the PLRA, the court’s rem
edy is not narrowly tailored to address proven and ongoing
constitutional violations. And the three-judge court vio
lated the PLRA’s critical command that any court con
templating a prisoner release order must give “substantial
weight to any adverse impact on public safety.” 18
U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). The three-judge court would have
us believe that the early release of 46,000 inmates will not
imperil—and will actually improve—public safety. Juris.

(hereinafter Juris. App.). Common sense and experience
counsel greater caution.
