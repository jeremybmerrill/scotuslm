ALITO, J., dissenting

accomplished in a safe manner. I do not believe the
PLRA’s public-safety requirement is so trivial.
The members of the three-judge court and the experts
on whom they relied may disagree with key elements of
the crime-reduction program that the State of California
has pursued for the past few decades, including “the shift
to inflexible determinate sentencing and the passage of
harsh mandatory minimum and three-strikes laws.” Id.,
at 254a. And experts such as the Receiver are entitled to
take the view that the State should “re-thin[k] the place of
incarceration in its criminal justice system,” App. 489. But
those controversial opinions on matters of criminal justice
policy should not be permitted to override the reasonable
policy view that is implicit in the PLRA—that prisoner
release orders present an inherent risk to the safety of the
public.

The prisoner release ordered in this case is unprece
dented, improvident, and contrary to the PLRA. In largely
sustaining the decision below, the majority is gambling
with the safety of the people of California. Before putting
public safety at risk, every reasonable precaution should
be taken. The decision below should be reversed, and the
case should be remanded for this to be done.
I fear that today’s decision, like prior prisoner release
orders, will lead to a grim roster of victims. I hope that
I am wrong.
In a few years, we will see.
