BROWN v. PLATA
SCALIA, J., dissenting

California prisoners four times this Term alone. Cullen
v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___ (2011); Felkner v. Jackson,
562 U. S. ___ (2011) (per curiam); Swarthout v. Cooke, 562
U. S. ___ (2011) (per curiam); Harrington, supra. And yet
here, the Court affirms an order granting the functional
equivalent of 46,000 writs of habeas corpus, based on its
paean to courts’ “substantial flexibility when making these
judgments.” Ante, at 41. It seems that the Court’s respect
for state sovereignty has vanished in the case where it
most matters.
II
The Court’s opinion includes a bizarre coda noting
that “[t]he State may wish to move for modification of the
three-judge court’s order to extend the deadline for the
required reduction to five years.” Ante, at 46–47. The Dis
trict Court, it says, “may grant such a request provided
that the State satisfies necessary and appropriate precon
ditions designed to ensure the measures are taken to
implement the plan without undue delay”; and it gives
vague suggestions of what these preconditions “may in
clude,” such as “interim benchmarks.” Ante, at 47. It also
invites the District Court to “consider whether it is appro
priate to order the State to begin without delay to develop
a system to identify prisoners who are unlikely to reof
fend,” and informs the State that it “should devise systems
to select those prisoners least likely to jeopardize public
safety.” Ibid. (What a good idea!)
The legal effect of this passage is unclear—I suspect
intentionally so. If it is nothing but a polite reminder to
the State and to the District Court that the injunction is
subject to modification, then it is entirely unnecessary. As
both the State and the District Court are undoubtedly
aware, a party is always entitled to move to modify an
equitable decree, and the PLRA contains an express provi
sion authorizing District Courts to modify or terminate
