BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

District Courts. When exercising jurisdiction under 28
U. S. C. §1253, however, this Court “has not hesitated to
exercise jurisdiction ‘to determine the authority of the
court below,’ ” including whether the three-judge court was
properly constituted. Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees
Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90, 95, n. 12 (1974) (quoting Bailey
v. Patterson, 369 U. S. 31, 34 (1962) (per curiam)); see also
Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., 292 U. S. 16, 18 (1934)
(per curiam) (“The case is analogous to those in which this
Court, finding that the court below has acted without
jurisdiction, exercises its appellate jurisdiction to correct
the improper action”). The merits of the decision to con
vene the three-judge court, therefore, are properly before
this Court.

is satisfied if the court has entered one order, and this sin
gle order has “failed to remedy” the constitutional viola
tion. The defendant must also have had “a reasonable
amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.”
§3626(a)(3)(A)(ii). This provision refers to the court’s
“orders.” It requires that the defendant have been given a
reasonable time to comply with all of the court’s orders.
Together, these requirements ensure that the “ ‘last resort
remedy’ ” of a population limit is not imposed “ ‘as a first
step.’ ” Inmates of Occoquan v. Barry, 844 F. 2d 828, 843
(CADC 1988).
The first of these conditions, the previous order re
quirement of §3626(a)(3)(A)(i), was satisfied in Coleman
by appointment of a Special Master in 1995, and it was
