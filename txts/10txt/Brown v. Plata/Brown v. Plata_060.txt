BROWN v. PLATA
SCALIA, J., dissenting

I

A

The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) states that
“[p]rospective relief in any civil action with respect to
prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary
to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular
plaintiff or plaintiffs”; that such relief must be “narrowly
drawn, [and] exten[d] no further than necessary to correct
the violation of the Federal right”; and that it must be “the
least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of
the Federal right.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). In deciding
whether these multiple limitations have been complied
with, it is necessary to identify with precision what is the
“violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or
plaintiffs” that has been alleged. What has been alleged

prison system with inadequate medical facilities. That
may result in the denial of needed medical treatment to “a
particular [prisoner] or [prisoners],” thereby violating (ac
cording to our cases) his or their Eighth Amendment
rights. But the mere existence of the inadequate system
does not subject to cruel and unusual punishment the
entire prison population in need of medical care, including
those who receive it.
The Court acknowledges that the plaintiffs “do not base
their case on deficiencies in care provided on any one
occasion”; rather, “[p]laintiffs rely on systemwide deficien
cies in the provision of medical and mental health care
that, taken as a whole, subject sick and mentally ill pris
oners in California to ‘substantial risk of serious harm’
and cause the delivery of care in the prisons to fall below
the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress
of a maturing society.” Ante, at 7, n. 3. But our judge
