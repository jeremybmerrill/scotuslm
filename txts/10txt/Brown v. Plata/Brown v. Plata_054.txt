BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

urgent than previously believed. Were the State to make
this showing, the three-judge court in the exercise of its
discretion could consider whether it is appropriate to ex
tend or modify this timeline.
Experience with the three-judge court’s order may also
lead the State to suggest other modifications. The three
judge court should give any such requests serious consid
eration. The three-judge court should also formulate its
orders to allow the State and its officials the authority
necessary to address contingencies that may arise during
the remedial process.
These observations reflect the fact that the three-judge
court’s order, like all continuing equitable decrees, must
remain open to appropriate modification. They are not
intended to cast doubt on the validity of the basic premise
of the existing order. The medical and mental health care
provided by California’s prisons falls below the standard of
decency that inheres in the Eighth Amendment. This
extensive and ongoing constitutional violation requires
a remedy, and a remedy will not be achieved without a
reduction in overcrowding. The relief ordered by the
three-judge court is required by the Constitution and was
authorized by Congress in the PLRA. The State shall
implement the order without further delay.
The judgment of the three-judge court is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
