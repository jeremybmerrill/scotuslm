BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

appeal.
The three-judge court heard 14 days of testimony and
issued a 184-page opinion, making extensive findings of
fact. The court ordered California to reduce its prison
population to 137.5% of the prisons’ design capacity within
two years. Assuming the State does not increase capacity
through new construction, the order requires a population
reduction of 38,000 to 46,000 persons. Because it appears

construction to comply fully with the order, the prison
population will have to be reduced to at least some extent.
The court did not order the State to achieve this reduction

State to formulate a plan for compliance and submit its
plan for approval by the court.
The State appealed to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C.
§1253, and the Court postponed consideration of the ques
tion of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. Schwar

opinion)).
To incarcerate, society takes from prisoners the means
to provide for their own needs. Prisoners are dependent
on the State for food, clothing, and necessary medical care.
A prison’s failure to provide sustenance for inmates “may
