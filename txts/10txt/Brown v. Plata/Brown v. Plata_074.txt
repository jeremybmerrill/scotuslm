BROWN v. PLATA
SCALIA, J., dissenting

any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a
criminal justice system caused by the relief” and author
izes them to appoint Special Masters, §3626 (a)(1)(A), (f),
provisions that seem to presuppose the possibility of a
structural remedy. It also sets forth criteria under which
courts may issue orders that have “the purpose or effect of
reducing or limiting the prisoner population,” §3626(g)(4).
I do not believe that objection carries the day. In addi
tion to imposing numerous limitations on the ability of
district courts to order injunctive relief with respect to
prison conditions, the PLRA states that “[n]othing in this
section shall be construed to . . . repeal or detract from
otherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers of
the courts.” §3626(a)(1)(C). The PLRA is therefore best
understood as an attempt to constrain the discretion of
courts issuing structural injunctions—not as a mandate
for their use. For the reasons I have outlined, structural
injunctions, especially prisoner-release orders, raise grave
separation-of-powers concerns and veer significantly from
the historical role and institutional capability of courts. It
is appropriate to construe the PLRA so as to constrain
courts from entering injunctive relief that would exceed
that role and capability.

The District Court’s order that California release 46,000
prisoners extends “further than necessary to correct the
violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or
plaintiffs” who have been denied needed medical care. 18
U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). It is accordingly forbidden by the
PLRA—besides defying all sound conception of the proper
role of judges.
