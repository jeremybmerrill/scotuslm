BROWN v. PLATA
SCALIA, J., dissenting

McClintock, Principles of Equity §15, pp. 32–33 (2d
ed. 1948). Indeed, there was a ‘historical prejudice of
the court of chancery against rendering decrees which
called for more than a single affirmative act.’ Id., §61,
at 160. And where specific performance of contracts
was sought, it was the categorical rule that no decree
would issue that required ongoing supervision. . . .
Compliance with these ‘single act’ mandates could, in
addition to being simple, be quick; and once it was
achieved the contemnor’s relationship with the court
came to an end, at least insofar as the subject of the
order was concerned. Once the document was turned
over or the land conveyed, the litigant’s obligation to
the court, and the court’s coercive power over the liti
gant, ceased. . . . The court did not engage in any on
going supervision of the litigant’s conduct, nor did its
order continue to regulate its behavior.” Mine Work
ers v. Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 841–842 (1994) (SCALIA,
J., concurring).
Structural injunctions depart from that historical prac
tice, turning judges into long-term administrators of
complex social institutions such as schools, prisons, and
police departments. Indeed, they require judges to play a
role essentially indistinguishable from the role ordinarily
played by executive officials. Today’s decision not only
affirms the structural injunction but vastly expands its
use, by holding that an entire system is unconstitutional
because it may produce constitutional violations.
The drawbacks of structural injunctions have been
described at great length elsewhere. See, e.g., Lewis,
supra, at 385–393 (1996) (THOMAS, J., concurring); Mis
souri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 124–133 (1995) (THOMAS,
J., concurring); Horowitz, Decreeing Organizational
