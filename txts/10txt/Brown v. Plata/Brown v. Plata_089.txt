ALITO, J., dissenting

trial court selects between the competing views of experts
on broad empirical questions such as the efficacy of
preventing crime through the incapacitation of convicted
criminals, the trial court’s choice is very different from a
classic finding of fact and is not entitled to the same de
gree of deference on appeal.
The particular three-judge court convened in this case
was “confident” that releasing 46,000 prisoners pursuant
to its plan “would in fact benefit public safety.” Juris.
App. 248a–249a. According to that court, “overwhelming
evidence” supported this purported finding. Id., at 232a.
But a more cautious court, less bent on implementing its
own criminal justice agenda, would have at least acknowl
edged that the consequences of this massive prisoner
release cannot be ascertained in advance with any degree
of certainty and that it is entirely possible that this re
lease will produce results similar to those under prior
court-ordered population caps. After all, the sharp in
crease in the California prison population that the three
judge court lamented, see id., at 254a, has been accompa
nied by an equally sharp decrease in violent crime.11
These California trends mirror similar developments at
the national level,12 and “[t]here is a general consensus
that the decline in crime is, at least in part, due to more
and longer prison sentences.”13 If increased incarceration

larly, in the United States from 1992 to 2009, the violent crime rate per
100,000 residents fell from 757.7 to 429.4—a decrease of 43.3 percent.
