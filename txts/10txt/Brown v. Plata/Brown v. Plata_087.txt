oners in the two plaintiff classes could be considered.
Plaintiffs proposed not only a systemwide population cap,
but also a lower population cap for inmates in specialized
programs. Tr. 2915:12–15 (Feb. 3, 2009). The three-judge
court rejected this proposal, and its response exemplified
what went wrong in this case. One judge complained that
this remedy would be deficient because it would protect
only the members of the plaintiff classes. The judge
stated:
“The only thing is we would be protecting the class
members. And maybe that’s the appropriate thing to
do. I mean, that’s what this case is about, but it
would be . . . difficult for me to say yes, and the hell
with everybody else.” Id., at 2915:23–2916:2.
Overstepping his authority, the judge was not content to
provide relief for the classes of plaintiffs on whose behalf
the suit before him was brought. Nor was he content to
remedy the only constitutional violations that were
proved—which concerned the treatment of the members of
those classes. Instead, the judge saw it as his responsibil
ity to attack the general problem of overcrowding.

provision unmistakably reflects Congress’ view that pris
oner release orders are inherently risky.
In taking this view, Congress was well aware of the
impact of previous prisoner release orders. The prisoner
release program carried out a few years earlier in Phila
delphia is illustrative. In the early 1990’s, federal courts
enforced a cap on the number of inmates in the Philadel
phia prison system, and thousands of inmates were set
