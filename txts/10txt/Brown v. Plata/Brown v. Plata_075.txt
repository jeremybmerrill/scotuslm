PLATA ET AL. 

ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS 

FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT AND THE NORTHERN

DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

[May 23, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,
dissenting.
The decree in this case is a perfect example of what
the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat.
1321–66, was enacted to prevent.
The Constitution does not give federal judges the au
thority to run state penal systems. Decisions regarding
state prisons have profound public safety and financial
implications, and the States are generally free to make
these decisions as they choose. See Turner v. Safley, 482
U. S. 78, 85 (1987).
The Eighth Amendment imposes an important—but
limited—restraint on state authority in this field. The
Eighth Amendment prohibits prison officials from depriving inmates of “the minimal civilized measure of life’s
necessities.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 347
(1981). Federal courts have the responsibility to ensure
that this constitutional standard is met, but undesirable
prison conditions that do not violate the Constitution are
beyond the federal courts’ reach.
In this case, a three-judge court exceeded its authority
under the Constitution and the PLRA. The court ordered
a radical reduction in the California prison population
