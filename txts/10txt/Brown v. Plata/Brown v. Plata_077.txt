ALITO, J., dissenting

I would reverse the decision below for three interrelated
reasons. First, the three-judge court improperly refused
to consider evidence concerning present conditions in the
California prison system. Second, the court erred in hold
ing that no remedy short of a massive prisoner release can
bring the California system into compliance with the
Eighth Amendment. Third, the court gave inadequate
weight to the impact of its decree on public safety.
I
Both the PLRA and general principles concerning in
junctive relief dictate that a prisoner release order cannot
properly be issued unless the relief is necessary to remedy
an ongoing violation. Under the PLRA, a prisoner release
may be decreed only if crowding “is the primary cause” of
an Eighth Amendment violation and only if no other re
lief “will remedy” the violation. §3626(a)(3)(E) (emphasis
added). This language makes it clear that proof of past
violations alone is insufficient to justify a court-ordered
prisoner release.
Similarly, in cases not governed by the PLRA, we have
held that an inmate seeking an injunction to prevent a
violation of the Eighth Amendment must show that prison
officials are “knowingly and unreasonably disregarding an
objectively intolerable risk of harm, and that they will
continue to do so . . . into the future.” Farmer v. Brennan,
511 U. S. 825, 846 (1994). The “deliberate indifference”
needed to establish an Eighth Amendment violation must
be examined “in light of the prison authorities’ current
attitudes and conduct,” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25,
36 (1993), which means “their attitudes and conduct at the
time suit is brought and persisting thereafter,” Farmer,
supra, at 845.
For these reasons, the propriety of the relief ordered
here cannot be assessed without ascertaining the nature
and scope of any ongoing constitutional violations. Proof
