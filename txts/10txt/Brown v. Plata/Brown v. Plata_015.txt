Opinion of the Court

Master in Coleman filed a report stating that, after years
of slow improvement, the state of mental health care
in California’s prisons was deteriorating. App. 489. The
Special Master ascribed this change to increased over
crowding. The rise in population had led to greater
demand for care, and existing programming space and
staffing levels were inadequate to keep pace. Prisons had
retained more mental health staff, but the “growth of the
resource [had] not matched the rise in demand.” Id., at
482. At the very time the need for space was rising, the
need to house the expanding population had also caused a
“reduction of programming space now occupied by inmate
bunks.” Id., at 479. The State was “facing a four to five
year gap in the availability of sufficient beds to meet the
treatment needs of many inmates/patients.” Id., at 481.
“[I]ncreasing numbers of truly psychotic inmate/patients
are trapped in [lower levels of treatment] that cannot meet
their needs.” Ibid. The Special Master concluded that
many early “achievements have succumbed to the inexo
rably rising tide of population, leaving behind growing
frustration and despair.” Id., at 489.

The second action, Plata v. Brown, involves the class of
state prisoners with serious medical conditions. After this
action commenced in 2001, the State conceded that defi
ciencies in prison medical care violated prisoners’ Eighth
Amendment rights. The State stipulated to a remedial
injunction. The State failed to comply with that injunc
tion, and in 2005 the court appointed a Receiver to oversee
remedial efforts. The court found that “the California
prison medical care system is broken beyond repair,”
resulting in an “unconscionable degree of suffering and
death.” App. 917. The court found: “[I]t is an uncontested
fact that, on average, an inmate in one of California’s
prisons needlessly dies every six to seven days due to
