Is it plausible that none of these deficiencies can be
remedied without releasing 46,000 prisoners? Without
taking that radical and dangerous step, exam tables and
counter tops cannot properly be disinfected? None of the
system’s dilapidated facilities can be repaired? Needed
medications and equipment cannot be purchased and
used? Staff vacancies cannot be filled? The qualifica
tions of prison physicians cannot be improved? A better
records management system cannot be developed and
implemented?
I do not dispute that general overcrowding contributes to
many of the California system’s healthcare problems. But
it by no means follows that reducing overcrowding is the
only or the best or even a particularly good way to allevi

oner release ordered by the court below is poorly suited for
this purpose. The release order is not limited to prisoners
needing substantial medical care but instead calls for a
reduction in the system’s overall population. Under the
order issued by the court below, it is not necessary for
a single prisoner in the plaintiff classes to be released.
Although some class members will presumably be among
those who are discharged, the decrease in the number of
prisoners needing mental health treatment or other forms
of extensive medical care will be much smaller than the
total number of prisoners released, and thus the release
will produce at best only a modest improvement in the
burden on the medical care system.
The record bears this out. The Special Master stated
dramatically that even releasing 100,000 inmates (two
thirds of the California system’s entire inmate popula
tion!) would leave the problem of providing mental health
treatment “largely unmitigated.” App. 487. Similarly, the
Receiver proclaimed that “ ‘those . . . who think that popu
