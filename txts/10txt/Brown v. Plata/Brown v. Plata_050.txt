BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

some upward adjustment was warranted in light of “the
caution and restraint required by the PLRA.” Juris. App.
183a, 184a. The three-judge court noted evidence support
ing a higher limit. In particular, the State’s Corrections
Independent Review Panel had found that 145% was the
maximum “operable capacity” of California’s prisons, id.,
at 181a–182a, although the relevance of that determina
tion was undermined by the fact that the panel had not
considered the need to provide constitutionally adequate
medical and mental health care, as the State itself con
cedes. Brief for Coleman Appellees 45. After considering,
but discounting, this evidence, the three-judge court con
cluded that the evidence supported a limit lower than
145%, but higher than 130%. It therefore imposed a limit
of 137.5%.
This weighing of the evidence was not clearly erroneous.
The adversary system afforded the court an opportunity
to weigh and evaluate evidence presented by the parties.
The plaintiffs’ evidentiary showing was intended to justify
a limit of 130%, and the State made no attempt to show
that any other number would allow for a remedy. There
are also no scientific tools available to determine the
precise population reduction necessary to remedy a consti
tutional violation of this sort. The three-judge court made
the most precise determination it could in light of the
record before it. The PLRA’s narrow tailoring require
ment is satisfied so long as these equitable, remedial
judgments are made with the objective of releasing the
fewest possible prisoners consistent with an efficacious
remedy. In light of substantial evidence supporting an
even more drastic remedy, the three-judge court complied
with the requirement of the PLRA in this case.
B
The three-judge court ordered the State to achieve this
reduction within two years. At trial and closing argument
