BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

to require that crowding be the only cause, it would have
said so, assuming in its judgment that definition would be
consistent with constitutional limitations.
As this case illustrates, constitutional violations in
conditions of confinement are rarely susceptible of simple
or straightforward solutions. In addition to overcrowding
the failure of California’s prisons to provide adequate
medical and mental health care may be ascribed to chronic
and worsening budget shortfalls, a lack of political will in
favor of reform, inadequate facilities, and systemic admin
istrative failures. The Plata District Judge, in his order
appointing the Receiver, compared the problem to “ ‘a
spider web, in which the tension of the various strands is
determined by the relationship among all the parts of the
web, so that if one pulls on a single strand, the tension of
the entire web is redistributed in a new and complex
pattern.’ ” App. 966–967 (quoting Fletcher, The Discre
tionary Constitution: Institutional Remedies and Judicial
Legitimacy, 91 Yale L. J. 635, 645 (1982)); see also Hutto,
437 U. S., at 688 (noting “the interdependence of the con
ditions producing the violation,” including overcrowd
ing). Only a multifaceted approach aimed at many causes,
including overcrowding, will yield a solution.
The PLRA should not be interpreted to place undue
restrictions on the authority of federal courts to fashion
practical remedies when confronted with complex and
intractable constitutional violations. Congress limited the
availability of limits on prison populations, but it did not
forbid these measures altogether. See 18 U. S. C. §3626.
The House Report accompanying the PLRA explained:
“While prison caps must be the remedy of last re
sort, a court still retains the power to order this
remedy despite its intrusive nature and harmful con
sequences to the public if, but only if, it is truly
necessary to prevent an actual violation of a prisoner’s
