BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

for a three-judge court and materials sufficient to demon
strate that the requirements of subparagraph (A) have
been met.
“(D) If the requirements under subparagraph (A) have
been met, a Federal judge before whom a civil action with
respect to prison conditions is pending who believes that a
prison release order should be considered may sua sponte
request the convening of a three-judge court to determine
whether a prisoner release order should be entered.
“(E) The three-judge court shall enter a prisoner release
order only if the court finds by clear and convincing evi
dence that—
“(i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a
Federal right; and
“(ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Fed
eral right.
“(F) Any State or local official including a legislator or
unit of government whose jurisdiction or function includes
the appropriation of funds for the construction, operation,
or maintenance of prison facilities, or the prosecution or
custody of persons who may be released from, or not ad
mitted to, a prison as a result of a prisoner release order
shall have standing to oppose the imposition or continua
tion in effect of such relief and to seek termination of such
relief, and shall have the right to intervene in any pro
ceeding relating to such relief.
