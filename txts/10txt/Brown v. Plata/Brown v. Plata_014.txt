BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

ing from severe but not life-threatening conditions, experi
ence prolonged illness and unnecessary pain.
B
These conditions are the subject of two federal cases.
The first to commence, Coleman v. Brown, was filed in
1990. Coleman involves the class of seriously mentally ill
persons in California prisons. Over 15 years ago, in 1995,
after a 39-day trial, the Coleman District Court found
“overwhelming evidence of the systematic failure to de
liver necessary care to mentally ill inmates” in California
prisons. Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1316 (ED
Cal.). The prisons were “seriously and chronically under
staffed,” id., at 1306, and had “no effective method for
ensuring . . . the competence of their staff,” id., at 1308.
The prisons had failed to implement necessary suicide
prevention procedures, “due in large measure to the severe
understaffing.” Id., at 1315. Mentally ill inmates “lan
guished for months, or even years, without access to nec
essary care.” Id., at 1316. “They suffer from severe hallu
cinations, [and] they decompensate into catatonic states.”
Ibid. The court appointed a Special Master to oversee
development and implementation of a remedial plan of
action.
In 2007, 12 years after his appointment, the Special
——————
(hereinafter 2009 Death Reviews).
The three-judge court did not have access to statistics for 2008, but in
that year the number of preventable or possibly preventable deaths
held steady at 66. California Prison Health Care Receivership Corp.,
K. Imai, Analysis of Year 2008 Death Reviews 9 (Dec. 2009). In 2009,
the number of preventable or possibly preventable deaths dropped to
46. 2009 Death Reviews 11, 13. The three-judge court could not have
anticipated this development, and it would be inappropriate for this
Court to evaluate its significance for the first time on appeal. The
three-judge court should, of course, consider this and any other evi
dence of improved conditions when considering future requests by the
State for modification of its order. See infra, at 45–48.
