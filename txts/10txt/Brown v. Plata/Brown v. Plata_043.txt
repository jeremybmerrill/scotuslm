Opinion of the Court

2
In reaching its decision, the three-judge court gave
“substantial weight” to any potential adverse impact on
public safety from its order. The court devoted nearly 10
days of trial to the issue of public safety, and it gave the
question extensive attention in its opinion. Ultimately,
the court concluded that it would be possible to reduce
the prison population “in a manner that preserves public
safety and the operation of the criminal justice system.”
Juris. App. 247a–248a.
The PLRA’s requirement that a court give “substantial
weight” to public safety does not require the court to cer
tify that its order has no possible adverse impact on the
public. A contrary reading would depart from the statute’s
text by replacing the word “substantial” with “conclusive.”
Whenever a court issues an order requiring the State to
adjust its incarceration and criminal justice policy, there
is a risk that the order will have some adverse impact on
public safety in some sectors. This is particularly true
when the order requires release of prisoners before their
sentence has been served. Persons incarcerated for even
one offense may have committed many other crimes prior
to arrest and conviction, and some number can be ex
pected to commit further crimes upon release. Yet the
PLRA contemplates that courts will retain authority to
issue orders necessary to remedy constitutional violations,
including authority to issue population limits when neces
sary. See supra, at 28–29. A court is required to consider
the public safety consequences of its order and to struc
ture, and monitor, its ruling in a way that mitigates those
consequences while still achieving an effective remedy of
the constitutional violation.
This inquiry necessarily involves difficult predictive
judgments regarding the likely effects of court orders.
Although these judgments are normally made by state
officials, they necessarily must be made by courts when
