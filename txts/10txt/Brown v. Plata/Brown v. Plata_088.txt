ALITO, J., dissenting

free. Although efforts were made to release only those
prisoners who were least likely to commit violent crimes,
that attempt was spectacularly unsuccessful. During an
18-month period, the Philadelphia police rearrested thou
sands of these prisoners for committing 9,732 new crimes.
Those defendants were charged with 79 murders, 90
rapes, 1,113 assaults, 959 robberies, 701 burglaries, and
2,748 thefts, not to mention thousands of drug offenses.9
Members of Congress were well aware of this experience.10
Despite the record of past prisoner release orders, the

10 Condemning the inappropriate imposition of prison population
caps, Senator Sarbanes cited “the case of Philadelphia, where a court
ordered prison cap has put thousands of violent criminals back on
the city’s streets, often with disastrous consequences.” 141 Cong. Rec.
26549 (1995). Senator Abraham complained that “American citizens
are put at risk every day by court decrees . . . that cure prison crowding
by declaring that we must free dangerous criminals before they have
served their time.” Id., at 26448. “The most egregious example,” he
added, “is the city of Philadelphia.” Ibid.
