PLATA ET AL. 

ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS 

FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT AND THE NORTHERN

DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

[May 23, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.
Today the Court affirms what is perhaps the most radi
cal injunction issued by a court in our Nation’s history: an
order requiring California to release the staggering num
ber of 46,000 convicted criminals.
There comes before us, now and then, a case whose
proper outcome is so clearly indicated by tradition and
common sense, that its decision ought to shape the law,
rather than vice versa. One would think that, before
allowing the decree of a federal district court to release
46,000 convicted felons, this Court would bend every effort
to read the law in such a way as to avoid that outrageous
result. Today, quite to the contrary, the Court disregards
stringently drawn provisions of the governing statute, and
traditional constitutional limitations upon the power of a
federal judge, in order to uphold the absurd.
The proceedings that led to this result were a judicial
travesty. I dissent because the institutional reform the
District Court has undertaken violates the terms of the gov
erning statute, ignores bedrock limitations on the power
of Article III judges, and takes federal courts wildly
beyond their institutional capacity.
