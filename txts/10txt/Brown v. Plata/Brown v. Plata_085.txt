ALITO, J., dissenting

might provide, and in any event, that is not a task that
should be undertaken in the first instance by this Court.
But possible components of such a plan are not hard to
identify.
Many of the problems noted above plainly could be
addressed without releasing prisoners and without in
curring the costs associated with a large-scale prison
construction program. Sanitary procedures could be im
proved; sufficient supplies of medicine and medical
equipment could be purchased; an adequate system of
records management could be implemented; and the num

means short of a massive prisoner release. Without spe
cific findings backed by hard evidence, this Court should
not accept the counterintuitive proposition that these
problems cannot be ameliorated by increasing salaries,
improving working conditions, and providing better train
ing and monitoring of performance.
While the cost of a large-scale construction program
may well exceed California’s current financial capabilities,
a more targeted program, involving the repair and per

After all, any remedy in this case, including the new pro

prison population. A certain number of prisoners in the
classes on whose behalf the two cases were brought might
be transferred to out-of-state facilities. The three-judge
court rejected the State’s proposal to transfer prisoners to
