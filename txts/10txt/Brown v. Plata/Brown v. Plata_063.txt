SCALIA, J., dissenting

the notion that the plaintiff class can allege an Eighth
Amendment violation based on “systemwide deficiencies”
is assuredly wrong. It follows that the remedy decreed
here is also contrary to law, since the theory of systemic
unconstitutionality is central to the plaintiffs’ case. The
PLRA requires plaintiffs to establish that the systemwide
injunction entered by the District Court was “narrowly
drawn” and “extends no further than necessary” to correct
“the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff
or plaintiffs.” If (as is the case) the only viable constitu
tional claims consist of individual instances of mistreat
ment, then a remedy reforming the system as a whole goes
far beyond what the statute allows.
It is also worth noting the peculiarity that the vast
majority of inmates most generously rewarded by the re
lease order—the 46,000 whose incarceration will be ended—
do not form part of any aggrieved class even under the
Court’s expansive notion of constitutional violation. Most
of them will not be prisoners with medical conditions or
severe mental illness; and many will undoubtedly be fine
physical specimens who have developed intimidating
muscles pumping iron in the prison gym.

Even if I accepted the implausible premise that the
plaintiffs have established a systemwide violation of
the Eighth Amendment, I would dissent from the Court’s
endorsement of a decrowding order. That order is an
example of what has become known as a “structural in
junction.” As I have previously explained, structural
injunctions are radically different from the injunctions
traditionally issued by courts of equity, and presumably
part of “the judicial Power” conferred on federal courts by
Article III:
“The mandatory injunctions issued upon termination
of litigation usually required ‘a single simple act.’ H.
