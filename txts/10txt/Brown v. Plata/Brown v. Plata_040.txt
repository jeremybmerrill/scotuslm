BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

tees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480
(1989). The scope of the remedy must be proportional
to the scope of the violation, and the order must extend
no further than necessary to remedy the violation. This
Court has rejected remedial orders that unnecessarily
reach out to improve prison conditions other than those
that violate the Constitution. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S.
343, 357 (1996). But the precedents do not suggest that a
narrow and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional
violation is invalid simply because it will have collateral
effects.
Nor does anything in the text of the PLRA require that
result. The PLRA states that a remedy shall extend no
further than necessary to remedy the violation of the
rights of a “particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.” 18 U. S. C.
§3626(a)(1)(A). This means only that the scope of the
order must be determined with reference to the consti
tutional violations established by the specific plaintiffs
before the court.
This case is unlike cases where courts have impermis
sibly reached out to control the treatment of persons or
institutions beyond the scope of the violation. See Dayton
Bd. of Ed. v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 420 (1977). Even
prisoners with no present physical or mental illness may
become afflicted, and all prisoners in California are at risk
so long as the State continues to provide inadequate care.
Prisoners in the general population will become sick, and
will become members of the plaintiff classes, with routine frequency; and overcrowding may prevent the timely
diagnosis and care necessary to provide effective treat
ment and to prevent further spread of disease. Relief
targeted only at present members of the plaintiff classes
may therefore fail to adequately protect future class mem
bers who will develop serious physical or mental illness.
Prisoners who are not sick or mentally ill do not yet have a
claim that they have been subjected to care that violates
