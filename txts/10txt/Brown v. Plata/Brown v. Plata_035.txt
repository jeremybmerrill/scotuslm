Opinion of the Court

federal rights.” H. R. Rep. No. 104–21, p. 25 (1995).
Courts should presume that Congress was sensitive to the
real-world problems faced by those who would remedy
constitutional violations in the prisons and that Congress
did not leave prisoners without a remedy for violations of
their constitutional rights. A reading of the PLRA that
would render population limits unavailable in practice
would raise serious constitutional concerns. See, e.g.,
Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476
U. S. 667, 681, n. 12 (1986). A finding that overcrowding
is the “primary cause” of a violation is therefore permissi
ble, despite the fact that additional steps will be required
to remedy the violation.

The three-judge court was also required to find by clear
and convincing evidence that “no other relief will remedy
the violation of the Federal right.” §3626(a)(3)(E)(ii).
The State argues that the violation could have been
remedied through a combination of new construction,
transfers of prisoners out of State, hiring of medical per
sonnel, and continued efforts by the Plata Receiver and
Coleman Special Master. The order in fact permits the
State to comply with the population limit by transferring
prisoners to county facilities or facilities in other States, or
by constructing new facilities to raise the prisons’ design
capacity. And the three-judge court’s order does not bar
the State from undertaking any other remedial efforts. If
the State does find an adequate remedy other than a
population limit, it may seek modification or termination
of the three-judge court’s order on that basis. The evi
dence at trial, however, supports the three-judge court’s
conclusion that an order limited to other remedies would
not provide effective relief.
The State’s argument that out-of-state transfers provide
a less restrictive alternative to a population limit must fail
