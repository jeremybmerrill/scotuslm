Opinion of the Court

prison officials. The court was not required to second
guess the exercise of that discretion. Courts should pre
sume that state officials are in a better position to gauge
how best to preserve public safety and balance competing
correctional and law enforcement concerns. The decision
to leave details of implementation to the State’s discretion
protected public safety by leaving sensitive policy deci
sions to responsible and competent state officials.
During the pendency of this appeal, the State in fact
began to implement measures to reduce the prison popula
tion. See Supp. Brief for Appellants 1. These measures
will shift “thousands” of prisoners from the state prisons
to the county jails by “mak[ing] certain felonies punishable
by imprisonment in county jail” and “requir[ing] that
individuals returned to custody for violating their condi
tions of parole ‘serve any custody term in county jail.’ ”
Ibid. These developments support the three-judge court’s
conclusion that the prison population can be reduced in
a manner calculated to avoid an undue negative effect on
public safety.
III
Establishing the population at which the State could
begin to provide constitutionally adequate medical and
mental health care, and the appropriate time frame within
which to achieve the necessary reduction, requires a de
gree of judgment. The inquiry involves uncertain predic
tions regarding the effects of population reductions, as
well as difficult determinations regarding the capacity of
prison officials to provide adequate care at various popu
lation levels. Courts have substantial flexibility when
making these judgments. “ ‘Once invoked, “the scope of a
district court’s equitable powers . . . is broad, for breadth
and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.” ’ ”
