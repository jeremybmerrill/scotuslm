Opinion of the Court

recent observations of prison conditions; the court ad
mitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Plata
Receiver and Coleman Special Master; and both parties
presented testimony related to current conditions, includ
ing understaffing, inadequate facilities, and unsanitary
and unsafe living conditions. See supra, at 4–8, 19–24.
Dr. Craig Haney, for example, based his expert report on
tours of eight California prisons. App. 539. These tours
occurred as late as August 2008, two weeks before Dr.
Haney submitted his report and less than four months
before the first day of trial. Id., at 585; see also id., at 563,
565, 580 (July tours). Other experts submitted reports
based on similar observations. See, e.g., Doc. 3231–13,
at 6 (Dr. Shansky); App. 646 (Dr. Stewart); id., at 1245
(Austin); id., at 1312 (Lehman).
The three-judge court’s opinion cited and relied on this
evidence of current conditions. The court relied exten
sively on the expert witness reports. See generally Juris.
App. 85a–143a. The court cited the most current data
available on suicides and preventable deaths in the Cali
fornia prisons. Id., at 123a, 125a. The court relied on
statistics on staff vacancies that dated to three months
before trial, id., at 105a, 108a, and statistics on shortages
of treatment beds for the same period, id., at 97a. These
are just examples of the extensive evidence of current
conditions that informed every aspect of the judgment of
the three-judge court. The three-judge court did not abuse
its discretion when it also cited findings made in earlier
decisions of the Plata and Coleman District Courts. Those
findings remained relevant to establish the nature of these
longstanding, continuing constitutional violations.
It is true that the three-judge court established a cutoff
date for discovery a few months before trial. The order
stated that site inspections of prisons would be allowed
until that date, and that evidence of “changed prison
conditions” after that date would not be admitted. App.
