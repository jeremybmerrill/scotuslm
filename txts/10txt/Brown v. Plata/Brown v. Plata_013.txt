Opinion of the Court

pain died after an 8-hour delay in evaluation by a doctor;
and a prisoner died of testicular cancer after a “failure of
MDs to work up for cancer in a young man with 17 months
of testicular pain.”3 California Prison Health Care Receiv
ership Corp., K. Imai, Analysis of CDCR Death Reviews
2006, pp. 6–7 (Aug. 2007). Doctor Ronald Shansky, former
medical director of the Illinois state prison system, sur
veyed death reviews for California prisoners. He con
cluded that extreme departures from the standard of
care were “widespread,” Tr. 430, and that the proportion
of “possibly preventable or preventable” deaths was “ex
tremely high.” Id., at 429.4 Many more prisoners, suffer

3 Because

plaintiffs do not base their case on deficiencies in care
provided on any one occasion, this Court has no occasion to consider
whether these instances of delay—or any other particular deficiency in
medical care complained of by the plaintiffs—would violate the Consti
tution under Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 104–105 (1976), if consid
ered in isolation. Plaintiffs rely on systemwide deficiencies in the
provision of medical and mental health care that, taken as a whole,
subject sick and mentally ill prisoners in California to “substantial risk
of serious harm” and cause the delivery of care in the prisons to fall
below the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a
maturing society. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 834 (1994).
4 In 2007, the last year for which the three-judge court had available
statistics, an analysis of deaths in California’s prisons found 68 pre
ventable or possibly preventable deaths. California Prison Health Care
Receivership Corp., K. Imai, Analysis of Year 2007 Death Reviews 18
(Nov. 2008). This was essentially unchanged from 2006, when an
analysis found 66 preventable or possibly preventable deaths. Ibid.
These statistics mean that, during 2006 and 2007, a preventable or
possibly preventable death occurred once every five to six days.
Both preventable and possibly preventable deaths involve major
lapses in medical care and are a serious cause for concern. In one
typical case classified as a possibly preventable death, an analysis
revealed the following lapses: “16 month delay in evaluating abnormal
liver mass; 8 month delay in receiving regular chemotherapy . . . ;
multiple providers fail to respond to jaundice and abnormal liver
function tests causing 17 month delay in diagnosis.” California Prison
Health Care Receivership Corp., K. Imai, Analysis of Year 2009 Inmate
Death Reviews—California Prison Health Care System 12 (Sept. 2010)
