BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

1190. The court also excluded evidence not pertinent to
the issue whether a population limit is appropriate under
the PLRA, including evidence relevant solely to the exis
tence of an ongoing constitutional violation. The court
reasoned that its decision was limited to the issue of rem
edy and that the merits of the constitutional violation had
already been determined. The three-judge court made
clear that all such evidence would be considered “[t]o the
extent that it illuminates questions that are properly
before the court.” App. 2339.
Both rulings were within the sound discretion of the
three-judge court. Orderly trial management may require
discovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litiga
tion of the merits and the remedy. The State in fact
represented to the three-judge court that it would be “ap
propriate” to cut off discovery before trial because “like
plaintiffs, we, too, are really gearing up and going into a
pretrial mode.” Id., at 1683. And if the State truly be
lieved there was no longer a violation, it could have argued
to the Coleman and Plata District Courts that a three
judge court should not be convened because the District
Courts’ prior orders had not “failed to remedy the dep
rivation” of prisoners’ constitutional rights. 18 U. S. C.
§3626(a)(3)(A)(i); see also supra, at 16–17. Once the three
judge court was convened, that court was not required to
reconsider the merits. Its role was solely to consider the
propriety and necessity of a population limit.
The State does not point to any significant evidence that
it was unable to present and that would have changed the
outcome of the proceedings. To the contrary, the record
and opinion make clear that the decision of the three
judge court was based on current evidence pertaining to
ongoing constitutional violations.
