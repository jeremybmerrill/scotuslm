SCALIA, J., dissenting

medical treatment, then the court can order his release;
but a court may not order the release of prisoners who
have suffered no violations of their constitutional rights,
merely to make it less likely that that will happen to them
in the future.
This view follows from the PLRA’s text that I discussed
at the outset, 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). “[N]arrowly
drawn” means that the relief applies only to the “particu
lar [prisoner] or [prisoners]” whose constitutional rights
are violated; “extends no further than necessary” means
that prisoners whose rights are not violated will not obtain
relief; and “least intrusive means necessary to correct the
violation of the Federal right” means that no other relief is
available.*
I acknowledge that this reading of the PLRA would se
verely limit the circumstances under which a court could
issue structural injunctions to remedy allegedly unconsti
tutional prison conditions, although it would not eliminate
them entirely. If, for instance, a class representing all
prisoners in a particular institution alleged that the tem
perature in their cells was so cold as to violate the Eighth
Amendment, or that they were deprived of all exercise
time, a court could enter a prisonwide injunction ordering
that the temperature be raised or exercise time be pro
vided. Still, my approach may invite the objection that the
PLRA appears to contemplate structural injunctions in
general and mass prisoner-release orders in particular.
The statute requires courts to “give substantial weight to

* Any doubt on this last score, at least as far as prisoner-release or
ders are concerned, is eliminated by §3626(a)(3)(E) of the statute, which
provides that to enter a prisoner-release order the court must find
“by clear and convincing evidence that—
(i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right;
and
(ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.”
