BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

Other inmates awaiting care may be held for months in
administrative segregation, where they endure harsh and
isolated conditions and receive only limited mental health
services. Wait times for mental health care range as high
as 12 months. Id., at 704. In 2006, the suicide rate
in California’s prisons was nearly 80% higher than the
national average for prison populations; and a court
appointed Special Master found that 72.1% of suicides
involved “some measure of inadequate assessment, treat
ment, or intervention, and were therefore most probably
foreseeable and/or preventable.”2 Id., at 1781.
Prisoners suffering from physical illness also receive
severely deficient care. California’s prisons were designed
to meet the medical needs of a population at 100% of
design capacity and so have only half the clinical space
needed to treat the current population. Id., at 1024. A
correctional officer testified that, in one prison, up to 50
sick inmates may be held together in a 12- by 20-foot cage
for up to five hours awaiting treatment. Tr. 597–599. The
number of staff is inadequate, and prisoners face signifi
cant delays in access to care. A prisoner with severe
abdominal pain died after a 5-week delay in referral to a
specialist; a prisoner with “constant and extreme” chest

the time of the three-judge court’s decision, 2006 was the most
recent year for which the Special Master had conducted a detailed
study of suicides in the California prisons. The Special Master later
issued an analysis for the year 2007. This report concluded that the
2007 suicide rate was “a continuation of the CDCR’s pattern of exceed
ing the national prison suicide rate.” Record in No. 2:90–CV–00520–
LKK–JFM (ED/ND Cal.), Doc. 3677, p. 1. The report found that the
rate of suicides involving inadequate assessment, treatment, or inter
vention had risen to 82% and concluded that “[t]hese numbers clearly
indicate no improvement in this area during the past several years, and
possibly signal a trend of ongoing deterioration.” Id., at 12. No de
tailed study has been filed since then, but in September 2010 the
Special Master filed a report stating that “the data for 2010 so far is not
showing improvement in suicide prevention.” App. 868.
