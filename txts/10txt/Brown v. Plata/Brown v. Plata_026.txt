BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

‘fact’ side.” Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U. S. 116, 148 (1999)
(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment). Because the
“district court is ‘better positioned’ . . . to decide the issue,”
our review of the three-judge court’s primary cause deter
mination is deferential. Salve Regina College v. Russell,
499 U. S. 225, 233 (1991).
The record documents the severe impact of burgeoning
demand on the provision of care. At the time of trial,
vacancy rates for medical and mental health staff ranged
as high as 20% for surgeons, 25% for physicians, 39% for
nurse practitioners, and 54.1% for psychiatrists. Juris.
App. 105a, 108a. These percentages are based on the
number of positions budgeted by the State. Dr. Ronald
Shansky, former medical director of the Illinois prison
system, concluded that these numbers understate the se
verity of the crisis because the State has not budgeted
sufficient staff to meet demand.5
According to Dr.
Shansky, “even if the prisons were able to fill all of their
vacant health care positions, which they have not been
able to do to date, . . . the prisons would still be unable to
handle the level of need given the current overcrowding.”
Record in No. 2:90–CV–00520–LKK–JFM (ED Cal.), Doc.
3231–13, p. 16 (hereinafter Doc. 3231–13). Dr. Craig
Haney, a professor of psychology, reported that mental
health staff are “managing far larger caseloads than is
appropriate or effective.” App. 596. A prison psychiatrist
told Dr. Haney that “ ‘we are doing about 50% of what we
should be doing.’ ” Ibid. In the context of physical care Dr.
Shansky agreed that “demand for care, particularly for the
high priority cases, continues to overwhelm the resources
——————
5 Dr. Craig Haney likewise testified that the State had “significantly
underestimated the staffing needed to implement critical portions of the
Coleman Program Guide requirements,” that “key tasks were omitted
when determining staffing workloads,” and that estimates were based
on “key assumptions” that caused the State to underestimate demand
for mental health care. App. 596–597.
