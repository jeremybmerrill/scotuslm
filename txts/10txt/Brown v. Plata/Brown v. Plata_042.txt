BROWN v. PLATA
Opinion of the Court

so the system as a whole remains in compliance with the
order. This will allow prison officials to shift prisoners
to facilities that are better able to accommodate over
crowding, or out of facilities where retaining sufficient
medical staff has been difficult. The alternative—a series
of institution-specific population limits—would require
federal judges to make these choices. Leaving this discre
tion to state officials does not make the order overbroad.
Nor is the order overbroad because it limits the State’s
authority to run its prisons, as the State urges in its brief.
While the order does in some respects shape or control the
State’s authority in the realm of prison administration, it
does so in a manner that leaves much to the State’s discre
tion. The State may choose how to allocate prisoners
between institutions; it may choose whether to increase
the prisons’ capacity through construction or reduce the
population; and, if it does reduce the population, it may
decide what steps to take to achieve the necessary reduc
tion. The order’s limited scope is necessary to remedy a
constitutional violation.
As the State implements the order of the three-judge
court, time and experience may reveal targeted and effec
tive remedies that will end the constitutional violations
even without a significant decrease in the general prison
population. The State will be free to move the three-judge
court for modification of its order on that basis, and these
motions would be entitled to serious consideration. See
infra, at 45–48. At this time, the State has not proposed
any realistic alternative to the order. The State’s desire to
avoid a population limit, justified as according respect to
state authority, creates a certain and unacceptable risk of
continuing violations of the rights of sick and mentally ill
prisoners, with the result that many more will die or
needlessly suffer. The Constitution does not permit this
wrong.
