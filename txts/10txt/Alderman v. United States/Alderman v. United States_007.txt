THOMAS, J., dissenting

J., concurring) (“[W]e always have rejected readings of the
Commerce Clause and the scope of federal power that
would permit Congress to exercise a police power . . .”
(emphasis in original)). Before Congress enacted §931, the
majority of States already had employed their police pow
ers to address body armor and its use or possession by
criminals. The States’ different regimes range from laws
requiring sales of body armor to be face-to-face, to laws
increasing sentences for criminals who commit certain
crimes with weapons and body armor, to no regulation at
all.3 Cf. Lopez, supra, at 581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring)
(noting that more than 40 States had already outlawed
gun possession at or near schools, and observing that “the
reserved powers of the States are sufficient to enact those
measures”).

Fifteen years ago in Lopez, we took a significant step
toward reaffirming this Court’s commitment to proper
constitutional limits on Congress’ commerce power. If the

least 31 States have some form of body armor regulation. For
instance, Maryland makes it a crime to wear body armor while commit
ting certain crimes, Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–106 (Lexis Supp.
2010), and also prohibits individuals who have been convicted of crimes
of violence or drug crimes from possessing, owning, or using body
armor, although individuals may be exempted through a permit sys
tem. §4–107 (Lexis 2002). Virginia makes it a Class 4 felony to wear
body armor while possessing a knife or firearm and committing a drug
or violence offense. Va. Code Ann. §18.2–287.2 (Lexis 2009). North
Carolina, by comparison, enhances all felony offenses by one class level
if the offender wears or possesses body armor during the commission of
the felony. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §15A–1340.16C (Lexis 2009). The
States also define “body armor” in many different ways. See M.
Puckett, Body Armor: A Survey of State & Federal Law (2d ed. 2004).
Montana, Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Nebraska, and Rhode Island, among
others, have elected not to regulate body armor at all. See United
States v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 631, n. 7 (CA10 2006) (categorizing the
various state schemes).
