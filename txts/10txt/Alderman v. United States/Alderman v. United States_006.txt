ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., dissenting

categories, it is supported by the pre-Lopez precedent of
Scarborough.” Patton, supra, at 634.
Recognizing the conflict between Lopez and their inter
pretation of Scarborough, the lower courts have cried out
for guidance from this Court. See 565 F. 3d, at 643
(“[A]bsent the Supreme Court or our en banc court telling
us otherwise . . . the felon-in-possession of body armor
statute passes muster”); Patton, supra, at 636 (“We sus
pect the Supreme Court will revisit this issue in an appro
priate case—maybe even this one”). This Court has a duty
to defend the integrity of its precedents, and we should
grant certiorari to affirm that Lopez provides the proper
framework for a Commerce Clause analysis of this type.2
Further, the lower courts’ reading of Scarborough, by
trumping the Lopez framework, could very well remove
any limit on the commerce power. The Ninth Circuit’s
interpretation of Scarborough seems to permit Congress to
regulate or ban possession of any item that has ever been
offered for sale or crossed state lines. Congress arguably
could outlaw “the theft of a Hershey kiss from a corner
store in Youngstown, Ohio, by a neighborhood juvenile on
the basis that the candy once traveled . . . to the store from
Hershey, Pennsylvania.” United States v. Bishop, 66 F. 3d
569, 596 (CA3 1995) (Becker, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part). The Government actually conceded at
oral argument in the Ninth Circuit that Congress could
ban possession of french fries that have been offered for
sale in interstate commerce.
Such an expansion of federal authority would trespass
on traditional state police powers. See Morrison, 529
U. S., at 618; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566; id., at 584 (THOMAS,

2 I adhere to my previously stated views on the proper scope of the
Commerce Clause. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 585
(1995) (concurring opinion); United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,

opinion).
