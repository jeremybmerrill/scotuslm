ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Alderman under §931. Seattle police had stopped Alder
man on suspicion of selling cocaine. The officers found no
cocaine but discovered that Alderman was wearing a
bulletproof vest. Although possession of the vest was legal
under Washington state law, the elements of §931 were
satisfied. Alderman had been convicted of robbery in
1999, and the vest had been sold in interstate commerce
three years earlier when the California manufacturer sold
it to a distributor in Washington State. 565 F. 3d, at 644.
There were no allegations that Alderman had purchased
the body armor from another State or ever carried it
across state lines.
Alderman entered a conditional guilty plea and was
sentenced to 18 months in prison. He then appealed,
arguing that §931 exceeded Congress’ power under the
Commerce Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Over a
dissent, a panel of the Ninth Circuit found §931 constitu
tional. 565 F. 3d, at 648; ibid. (Paez, J., dissenting). The
Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with four judges
dissenting. 593 F. 3d 1141 (2010) (O’Scannlain, J., dis
senting from denial of rehearing en banc).

This Court has consistently recognized that the Consti
tution imposes real limits on federal power. See Gregory
v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991); Marbury v. Madi
son, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (opinion for the Court by
Marshall, C. J.) (“The powers of the legislature are de
fined, and limited; and that those limits may not be mis
taken, or forgotten, the constitution is written”). It follows
from the enumeration of specific powers that there are
boundaries to what the Federal Government may do. See,
e.g., Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824) (“The enu
meration presupposes something not enumerated . . .”).
The Constitution “withhold[s] from Congress a plenary
police power that would authorize enactment of every type
