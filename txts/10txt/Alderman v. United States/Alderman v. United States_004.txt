ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., dissenting

but held that it was guided “first and foremost” by Scar
borough, supra. 565 F. 3d, at 643, 645. In Scarborough,
this Court construed 18 U. S. C. App. §1202(a) (1970 ed.),
which made it a crime for a felon to “receiv[e], posses[s], or
transpor[t] in commerce or affecting commerce” any fire
arm. 431 U. S., at 564. The question in that case was
whether the “statutorily required nexus between the
possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and commerce”
could be satisfied by evidence that the gun had once trav
eled in interstate commerce. Ibid. The Court held that
such evidence was sufficient, noting that the legislative
history suggested that Congress wished to assert “ ‘its full
Commerce Clause power.’ ” Id., at 571. No party alleged
that the statute exceeded Congress’ authority, and the
Court did not hold that the statute was constitutional.
The Ninth Circuit concluded that Scarborough had “im
plicitly assumed the constitutionality of” §1202(a). 565
F. 3d, at 645.
The Ninth Circuit discussed how it might apply Lopez
and Morrison “when traveling in uncharted waters” but
ultimately concluded that it was “bound by Scarborough,”
in which this Court had “blessed” a “nearly identical juris
dictional hook.” 565 F. 3d, at 648. Although it would
“generally analyze cases in the framework of th[e] three
[Lopez] categories,” the Ninth Circuit determined that
Scarborough had “carved out” a separate constitutional
niche for statutes like §931(a) and §1202(a). 565 F. 3d, at
646–647. The Ninth Circuit thus upheld the statute with
out “engag[ing] in the careful parsing of post-Lopez case
law that would otherwise be required.” Id., at 648. The
court recognized a tension between Scarborough and
Lopez but declined to “deviate from binding precedent.”
565 F. 3d, at 646.
The dissent argued that the court had “effectively ren
der[ed] the Supreme Court’s three-part Commerce Clause
analysis superfluous.” Id., at 648 (opinion of Paez, J.).
