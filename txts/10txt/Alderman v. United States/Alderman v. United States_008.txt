ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Lopez framework is to have any ongoing vitality, it is up to
this Court to prevent it from being undermined by a 1977
precedent that does not squarely address the constitu
tional issue. Lower courts have recognized this problem
and asked us to grant certiorari. I would do so.
