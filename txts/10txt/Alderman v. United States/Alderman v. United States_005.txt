THOMAS, J., dissenting

Scarborough, the dissent explained, “decided only a ques
tion of statutory interpretation.” 565 F. 3d, at 656. Sec
tion 931 was, in the dissent’s view, unconstitutional be
cause applying Lopez, “felon-possession of body armor does
not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.” 565
F. 3d, at 648.
The Ninth Circuit is not alone in its confusion about
Scarborough and Lopez. The Tenth Circuit, also uphold
ing §931 under Scarborough, has observed that “[l]ike our
sister circuits, we see considerable tension between Scar
borough and the three-category approach adopted by the
Supreme Court in its recent Commerce Clause cases.”
United States v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 636 (2006).1 These
Circuits have determined that “[a]ny doctrinal inconsis
tency between Scarborough and the Supreme Court’s more
recent decisions is not for [us] to remedy,” ibid., and have
stated their intent to follow Scarborough “until the Su
preme Court tells us otherwise.” 565 F. 3d, at 648 (inter
nal quotation marks and brackets omitted).

It is difficult to imagine a better case for certiorari.
Scarborough, as the lower courts have read it, cannot be
reconciled with Lopez because it reduces the constitutional
analysis to the mere identification of a jurisdictional
hook like the one in §1202(a). See 593 F. 3d, at 1142
(O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en
banc) (“The majority’s opinion makes Lopez superfluous”).
In fact, the Tenth Circuit has concluded that “[a]lthough
the body armor statute does not fit within any of the Lopez

1 Other Courts of Appeals, considering the constitutionality of differ
ent possession statutes, have applied Scarborough similarly, although
the issue has divided some panels. See, e.g., United States v. Bishop, 66
F. 3d 569 (CA3 1995); id., at 595–596 (Becker, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part); United States v. Vasquez, 611 F. 3d 325 (CA7
2010); id., at 337 (Manion, J., dissenting).
