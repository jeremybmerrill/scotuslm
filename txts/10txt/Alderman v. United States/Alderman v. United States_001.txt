THOMAS, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
CEDRICK B. ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 09–1555. Decided January 10, 2011


The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.

“carve[s] out” a separate constitutional place for statutes
like the one in this case and pre-empts a “careful parsing
of post-Lopez case law.” 565 F. 3d 641, 645, 647, 648
(2009) (citing Scarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563
(1977)). That logic threatens the proper limits on Con
gress’ commerce power and may allow Congress to exer
cise police powers that our Constitution reserves to the
States. I would grant certiorari.
