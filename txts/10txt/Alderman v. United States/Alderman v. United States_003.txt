THOMAS, J., dissenting

of legislation.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 566
(1995).
Recently we have endeavored to more sharply define
and enforce limits on Congress’ enumerated “[p]ower . . .
[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.”
U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Lopez marked the first time
in half a century that this Court held that an Act of Con
gress exceeded its commerce power. We identified three
categories of activity that Congress’ commerce power
authorizes it to regulate: (1) the use of the channels of
interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of inter
state commerce; and (3) “activities having a substantial
relation to interstate commerce . . . i.e., those activities
that substantially affect interstate commerce.” 514 U. S.,
at 558–559. Emphasizing that we were unwilling to “con
vert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause
to a general police power,” id., at 567, we struck down a
ban on the possession of firearms within a 1,000-foot
radius of schools because the statute did not regulate an
activity that “substantially affect[ed]” interstate com
merce, id., at 561.
Five years after Lopez, we reaffirmed the “substantial
effects” test in United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598
(2000). We rejected Congress’ attempt to “regulate none
conomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that
conduct’s aggregate effect on interstate commerce,” and
held unconstitutional the civil remedy portion of the Vio
lence Against Women Act of 1994. Id., at 617, 619. We
could think of “no better example of the police power,
which the Founders denied the National Government and
reposed in the States.” Id., at 618.

In upholding §931(a), the Ninth Circuit recognized that
Lopez and Morrison had “significantly altered the land
scape of congressional power under the Commerce Clause”
