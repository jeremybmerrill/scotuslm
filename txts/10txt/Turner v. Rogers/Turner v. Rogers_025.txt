Moreover, contrary to Turner’s assertions, the holdings
in this Court’s due process decisions regarding the right to
counsel are actually quite narrow. The Court has never
found in the Due Process Clause a categorical right to
appointed counsel outside of criminal prosecutions or
proceedings “functionally akin to a criminal trial.” Gag
non v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, 789, n. 12 (1973) (dis
cussing In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1 (1967)). This is consistent
with the conclusion that the Due Process Clause does not
expand the right to counsel beyond the boundaries set by
the Sixth Amendment.
After countless factors weighed, mores evaluated, and
practices surveyed, the Court has not determined that due
process principles of fundamental fairness categorically
require counsel in any context outside criminal proceed
ings. See, e.g., Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs. of
Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18, 31–32 (1981); Wolff v. McDon
nell, 418 U. S. 539, 569–570 (1974); see also Walters v.
National Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 307–
308, 320–326 (1985); Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565, 583
(1975). Even when the defendant’s liberty is at stake, the
Court has not concluded that fundamental fairness re
quires that counsel always be appointed if the proceeding
is not criminal.2 See, e.g., Scarpelli, supra, at 790 (proba
