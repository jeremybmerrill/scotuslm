TURNER v. ROGERS
THOMAS, J., dissenting

tion revocation); Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U. S. 25, 48
(1976) (summary court-martial); Parham v. J. R., 442
U. S. 584, 599–600, 606–607, 610, n. 18 (1979) (commit
ment of minor to mental hospital); Vitek v. Jones, 445
U. S. 480, 497–500 (1980) (Powell, J., controlling opinion
concurring in part) (transfer of prisoner to mental hospi
tal). Indeed, the only circumstance in which the Court has
found that due process categorically requires appointed
counsel is juvenile delinquency proceedings, which the
Court has described as “functionally akin to a criminal
trial.” Scarpelli, supra, at 789, n. 12 (discussing In re
Gault, supra); see ante, at 9.
Despite language in its opinions that suggests it could
find otherwise, the Court’s consistent judgment has been
that fundamental fairness does not categorically require
appointed counsel in any context outside of criminal
proceedings. The majority is correct, therefore, that the
Court’s precedent does not require appointed counsel in
the absence of a deprivation of liberty. Id., at 9–10. But a
more complete description of this Court’s cases is that
even when liberty is at stake, the Court has required
appointed counsel in a category of cases only where it
would have found the Sixth Amendment required it—in
criminal prosecutions.
II
The majority agrees that the Constitution does not
entitle Turner to appointed counsel. But at the invitation
of the Federal Government as amicus curiae, the majority
holds that his contempt hearing violated the Due Process
Clause for an entirely different reason, which the parties
——————
criminal contemners are entitled to “the protections that the Consti
tution requires of such criminal proceedings,” including the right to
counsel. Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 826 (1994) (citing
Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517, 537 (1925); internal quotation
marks omitted).
