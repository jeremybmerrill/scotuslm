involving incarceration, not that a right to counsel exists
in all such cases (a position that would have been difficult
to reconcile with Gagnon).

Civil contempt proceedings in child support cases constitute one part of a highly complex system designed to
assure a noncustodial parent’s regular payment of funds
typically necessary for the support of his children. Often
the family receives welfare support from a state
administered federal program, and the State then seeks
reimbursement from the noncustodial parent. See 42
U. S. C. §§608(a)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. III), 656(a)(1) (2006
ed.); S. C. Code Ann. §§43–5–65(a)(1), (2) (2010 Cum.
Supp.). Other times the custodial parent (often the
mother, but sometimes the father, a grandparent, or an
other person with custody) does not receive government
benefits and is entitled to receive the support payments
herself.
The Federal Government has created an elaborate
procedural mechanism designed to help both the govern
ment and custodial parents to secure the payments to
which they are entitled. See generally Blessing v. Free

ing set of cooperative federal-state welfare programs” as
they relate to child support enforcement); 45 CFR pt. 303
(2010) (prescribing standards for state child support agen
cies). These systems often rely upon wage withholding,
expedited procedures for modifying and enforcing child
support orders, and automated data processing.

U. S. C. §§666(a), (b), 654(24). But sometimes States will
use contempt orders to ensure that the custodial parent
receives support payments or the government receives
reimbursement. Although some experts have criticized
this last-mentioned procedure, and the Federal Govern
ment believes that “the routine use of contempt for non
