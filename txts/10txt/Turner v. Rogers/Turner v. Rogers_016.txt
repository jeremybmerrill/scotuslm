TURNER v. ROGERS
Opinion of the Court

Given the importance of the interest at stake, it is ob
viously important to assure accurate decisionmaking in
respect to the key “ability to pay” question. Moreover, the
fact that ability to comply marks a dividing line between
civil and criminal contempt, Hicks, 485 U. S., at 635, n. 7,
reinforces the need for accuracy. That is because an incor
rect decision (wrongly classifying the contempt proceeding
as civil) can increase the risk of wrongful incarceration by
depriving the defendant of the procedural protections
(including counsel) that the Constitution would demand in
a criminal proceeding. See, e.g., Dixon, 509 U. S., at 696
(proof beyond a reasonable doubt, protection from double
jeopardy); Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U. S. 506, 512–
513, 517 (1974) (jury trial where the result is more than
six months’ imprisonment). And since 70% of child sup
port arrears nationwide are owed by parents with either
no reported income or income of $10,000 per year or less,
the issue of ability to pay may arise fairly often. See

Support Arrears in Nine Large States and the Nation

http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/07/assessing-CS-debt/report.pdf (as
visited June 16, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file); id., at 23 (“research suggests that many obligors
who do not have reported quarterly wages have relatively
limited resources”); Patterson, Civil Contempt and the
Indigent Child Support Obligor: The Silent Return of
Debtor’s Prison, 18 Cornell J. L. & Pub. Pol’y 95, 117
(2008). See also, e.g., McBride v. McBride, 334 N. C. 124,
131, n. 4, 431 S. E. 2d 14, 19, n. 4 (1993) (surveying North
Carolina contempt orders and finding that the “failure of
trial courts to make a determination of a contemnor’s
ability to comply is not altogether infrequent”).
On the other hand, the Due Process Clause does not
always require the provision of counsel in civil proceedings
where incarceration is threatened. See Gagnon, 411 U. S.
