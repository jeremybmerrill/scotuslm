TURNER v. ROGERS
Opinion of the Court

orders in part through civil contempt proceedings. Each
month the family court clerk reviews outstanding child
support orders, identifies those in which the supporting
parent has fallen more than five days behind, and sends
that parent an order to “show cause” why he should not be
held in contempt. S. C. Rule Family Ct. 24 (2011). The
“show cause” order and attached affidavit refer to the
relevant child support order, identify the amount of
the arrearage, and set a date for a court hearing. At the
hearing that parent may demonstrate that he is not in
contempt, say, by showing that he is not able to make the
required payments. See Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S. C. 348,
351, 306 S. E. 2d 624, 626 (1983) (“When the parent is
unable to make the required payments, he is not in con
tempt”). If he fails to make the required showing, the
court may hold him in civil contempt. And it may require
that he be imprisoned unless and until he purges himself
of contempt by making the required child support pay
ments (but not for more than one year regardless). See
S. C. Code Ann. §63–3–620 (Supp. 2010) (imprisonment
for up to one year of “adult who wilfully violates” a court
order); Price v. Turner, 387 S. C. 142, 145, 691 S. E. 2d
470, 472 (2010) (civil contempt order must permit purging
of contempt through compliance).

In June 2003 a South Carolina family court entered an
order, which (as amended) required petitioner, Michael
Turner, to pay $51.73 per week to respondent, Rebecca
Rogers, to help support their child. (Rogers’ father, Larry
Price, currently has custody of the child and is also a
respondent before this Court.) Over the next three years,
Turner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was
held in contempt on five occasions. The first four times he
was sentenced to 90 days’ imprisonment, but he ultimately
paid the amount due (twice without being jailed, twice
