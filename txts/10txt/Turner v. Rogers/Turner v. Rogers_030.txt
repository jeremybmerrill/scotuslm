TURNER v. ROGERS
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Mathews v. Eldridge balancing test here. 424 U. S. 319
(1976). That test weighs an individual’s interest against
that of the Government. Id., at 335 (identifying the oppos
ing interest as “the Government’s interest”); Lassiter, 452
U. S., at 27 (same). It does not account for the interests of
the child and custodial parent, who is usually the child’s
mother. But their interests are the very reason for the
child support obligation and the civil contempt proceed
ings that enforce it.
When fathers fail in their duty to pay child support,
children suffer. See Cancian, Meyer, & Han, Child Sup
port: Responsible Fatherhood and the Quid Pro Quo, 635
Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc. Sci. 140, 153 (2011) (finding
that child support plays an important role in reducing
child poverty in single-parent homes); cf. Sorensen &
Zibman, Getting to Know Poor Fathers Who Do Not Pay
Child Support, 75 Soc. Serv. Rev. 420, 423 (2001) (finding
that children whose fathers reside apart from them are 54
percent more likely to live in poverty than their fathers).
Nonpayment or inadequate payment can press children
and mothers into poverty. M. Garrison, The Goals and
Limits of Child Support Policy, in Child Support: The Next
Frontier 16 (J. Oldham & M. Melli eds. 2000); see also
Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, T. Grall, Custodial
Mothers and Fathers and Their Child Support: 2007, pp.
4–5 (2009) (hereinafter Custodial Mothers and Fathers)
(reporting that 27 percent of custodial mothers lived in
poverty in 2007).
The interests of children and mothers who depend on
child support are notoriously difficult to protect. See, e.g.,
Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U. S. 624, 644 (1988) (O’Connor, J.,
dissenting) (“The failure of enforcement efforts in this area
has become a national scandal” (internal quotation marks
omitted)). Less than half of all custodial parents receive
the full amount of child support ordered; 24 percent
of those owed support receive nothing at all. Custodial
