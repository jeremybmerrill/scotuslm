Opinion of the Court

payment of child support is likely to be an ineffective
strategy,” the Government also tells us that “coercive
enforcement remedies, such as contempt, have a role to
play.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21–22,
and n. 8 (citing Dept. of Health and Human Services,
National Child Support Enforcement, Strategic Plan: FY
2005–2009, pp. 2, 10). South Carolina, which relies heav
ily on contempt proceedings, agrees that they are an im
portant tool.
We here consider an indigent’s right to paid counsel at
such a contempt proceeding. It is a civil proceeding. And
we consequently determine the “specific dictates of due
process” by examining the “distinct factors” that this
Court has previously found useful in deciding what spe
cific safeguards the Constitution’s Due Process Clause re
quires in order to make a civil proceeding fundamentally
fair. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976) (con
sidering fairness of an administrative proceeding). As
relevant here those factors include (1) the nature of “the
private interest that will be affected,” (2) the comparative
“risk” of an “erroneous deprivation” of that interest with
and without “additional or substitute procedural safe
guards,” and (3) the nature and magnitude of any counter
vailing interest in not providing “additional or substitute
procedural requirement[s].” Ibid. See also Lassiter, 452
U. S., at 27–31 (applying the Mathews framework).
The “private interest that will be affected” argues
strongly for the right to counsel that Turner advocates.
That interest consists of an indigent defendant’s loss of
personal liberty through imprisonment. The interest in
securing that freedom, the freedom “from bodily restraint,”
lies “at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process
Clause.” Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992).
And we have made clear that its threatened loss through
legal proceedings demands “due process protection.”
Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 425 (1979).
