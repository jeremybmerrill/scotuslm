TURNER v. ROGERS
Opinion of the Court

The judge added that Turner would not receive good-time
or work credits, but “[i]f you’ve got a job, I’ll make you
eligible for work release.” Ibid. When Turner asked why
he could not receive good-time or work credits, the judge
said, “[b]ecause that’s my ruling.” Ibid.
The court made no express finding concerning Turner’s
ability to pay his arrearage (though Turner’s wife had
voluntarily submitted a copy of Turner’s application for
disability benefits, cf. post, at 7, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., dissent

tempt hearing. The South Carolina Supreme Court de
cided Turner’s appeal after he had completed his sentence.
And it rejected his “right to counsel” claim. The court
pointed out that civil contempt differs significantly from
criminal contempt. The former does not require all the
“constitutional safeguards” applicable in criminal proceed
ings. 387 S. C., at 145, 691 S. E. 2d, at 472. And the right
to government-paid counsel, the Supreme Court held, was
one of the “safeguards” not required. Ibid.
Turner sought certiorari. In light of differences among
state courts (and some federal courts) on the applicability
