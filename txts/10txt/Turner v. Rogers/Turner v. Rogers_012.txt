TURNER v. ROGERS
Opinion of the Court

provide no definitive answer to that question. This Court
has long held that the Sixth Amendment grants an indi
gent defendant the right to state-appointed counsel in
a criminal case. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335
(1963). And we have held that this same rule applies to
criminal contempt proceedings (other than summary
proceedings). United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696
(1993); Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517, 537 (1925).
But the Sixth Amendment does not govern civil cases.
Civil contempt differs from criminal contempt in that it
seeks only to “coerc[e] the defendant to do” what a court
had previously ordered him to do. Gompers v. Bucks Stove
& Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 442 (1911). A court may not
impose punishment “in a civil contempt proceeding when
it is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is
unable to comply with the terms of the order.” Hicks v.
Feiock, 485 U. S. 624, 638, n. 9 (1988). And once a civil
contemnor complies with the underlying order, he is
purged of the contempt and is free. Id., at 633 (he
“carr[ies] the keys of [his] prison in [his] own pockets”
(internal quotation marks omitted)).
Consequently, the Court has made clear (in a case not
involving the right to counsel) that, where civil contempt
is at issue, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process
Clause allows a State to provide fewer procedural protec
tions than in a criminal case. Id., at 637–641 (State may
place the burden of proving inability to pay on the defen
dant).
This Court has decided only a handful of cases that
more directly concern a right to counsel in civil matters.
And the application of those decisions to the present case
is not clear. On the one hand, the Court has held that the
Fourteenth Amendment requires the State to pay for
representation by counsel in a civil “juvenile delinquency”
proceeding (which could lead to incarceration). In re
Gault, 387 U. S. 1, 35–42 (1967). Moreover, in Vitek v.
