after spending two or three days in custody). The fifth
time he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence.
After his release in 2006 Turner remained in arrears.
On March 27, 2006, the clerk issued a new “show cause”
order. And after an initial postponement due to Turner’s
failure to appear, Turner’s civil contempt hearing took
place on January 3, 2008. Turner and Rogers were pre
sent, each without representation by counsel.
The hearing was brief. The court clerk said that Turner
was $5,728.76 behind in his payments. The judge asked
Turner if there was “anything you want to say.” Turner
replied,
“Well, when I first got out, I got back on dope. I done
meth, smoked pot and everything else, and I paid a
little bit here and there. And, when I finally did get to
working, I broke my back, back in September. I filed
for disability and SSI. And, I didn’t get straightened
out off the dope until I broke my back and laid up for
two months. And, now I’m off the dope and every
thing. I just hope that you give me a chance. I don’t
know what else to say. I mean, I know I done wrong,
and I should have been paying and helping her, and
I’m sorry. I mean, dope had a hold to me.” App. to
Pet. for Cert. 17a.
The judge then said, “[o]kay,” and asked Rogers if she had
anything to say. Ibid. After a brief discussion of federal
benefits, the judge stated,
“If there’s nothing else, this will be the Order of
the Court. I find the Defendant in willful contempt.
I’m [going to] sentence him to twelve months in the
Oconee County Detention Center. He may purge him
self of the contempt and avoid the sentence by having
a zero balance on or before his release. I’ve also
placed a lien on any SSI or other benefits.” Id., at
18a.
