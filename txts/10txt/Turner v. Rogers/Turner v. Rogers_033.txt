THOMAS, J., dissenting

carceration is a policy judgment for state and federal
lawmakers, as is the entire question of government in
volvement in the area of child support. See Elrod & Dale,
Paradigm Shifts and Pendulum Swings in Child Custody,
42 Fam. L. Q. 381, 382 (2008) (observing the “federaliza
tion of many areas of family law” (internal quotation
marks omitted)). This and other repercussions of the shift
away from the nuclear family are ultimately the business
of the policymaking branches. See, e.g., D. Popenoe, Fam
ily in Decline in America, reprinted in War Over the Fam
ily 3, 4 (2005) (discussing “four major social trends” that
emerged in the 1960’s “to signal a widespread ‘flight’ ”
from the “nuclear family”); Krause, Child Support Reas
sessed, 24 Fam. L. Q. 1, 16 (1990) (“Easy-come, easy-go
marriage and casual cohabitation and procreation are on a
collision course with the economic and social needs of
children”); M. Boumil & J. Friedman, Deadbeat Dads 23–
24 (1996) (“Many [children of deadbeat dads] are born out
of wedlock . . . . Others have lost a parent to divorce at
such a young age that they have little conscious memory of
it”).

I would affirm the judgment of the South Carolina
Supreme Court because the Due Process Clause does not
provide a right to appointed counsel in civil contempt
hearings that may lead to incarceration. As that is the
only issue properly before the Court, I respectfully dissent.
