THOMAS, J., dissenting

any evidence that courts appointed counsel in those pro
ceedings. See Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 831
(1994) (describing courts’ traditional assumption of “in
herent contempt authority”); see also 4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 280–285 (1769)
(describing the “summary proceedings” used to adjudicate
contempt). Indeed, Turner concedes that contempt pro
ceedings without appointed counsel have the blessing of
history. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15–16 (admitting that there
is no historical support for Turner’s rule); see also Brief for
Respondents 47–48.

Even under the Court’s modern interpretation of the
Constitution, the Due Process Clause does not provide a
right to appointed counsel for all indigent defendants
facing incarceration in civil contempt proceedings. Such
a reading would render the Sixth Amendment right to
counsel—as it is currently understood—superfluous.
Moreover, it appears that even cases applying the Court’s
modern interpretation of due process have not understood
it to categorically require appointed counsel in circum
stances outside those otherwise covered by the Sixth
Amendment.

Under the Court’s current jurisprudence, the Sixth
Amendment entitles indigent defendants to appointed counsel in felony cases and other criminal cases resulting
in a sentence of imprisonment. See Gideon v. Wainwright,
372 U. S. 335, 344–345 (1963); Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407
U. S. 25, 37 (1972); Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367, 373–374
(1979); Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U. S. 654, 662 (2002).
Turner concedes that, even under these cases, the Sixth
Amendment does not entitle him to appointed counsel.
