Opinion of the Court

cases that are not moot because the underlying dispute
is “capable of repetition, yet evading review.” See, e.g.,
Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 546–547
(1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Moreover, the underlying facts make this case unlike
DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per curiam),
and St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41 (1943) (per
curiam), two cases that respondents believe require us to
find this case moot regardless. DeFunis was moot, but
that is because the plaintiff himself was unlikely to again
suffer the conduct of which he complained (and others
likely to suffer from that conduct could bring their own
lawsuits). Here petitioner himself is likely to suffer future
imprisonment.
St. Pierre was moot because the petitioner (a witness
held in contempt and sentenced to five months’ imprison
ment) had failed to “apply to this Court for a stay” of the
federal-court order imposing imprisonment. 319 U. S., at
42–43. And, like the witness in St. Pierre, Turner did not
seek a stay of the contempt order requiring his imprison
ment. But this case, unlike St. Pierre, arises out of a
state-court proceeding. And respondents give us no reason
to believe that we would have (or that we could have)
granted a timely request for a stay had one been made.
Cf. 28 U. S. C. §1257 (granting this Court jurisdiction to
review final state-court judgments). In Sibron, we re
jected a similar “mootness” argument for just that reason.
392 U. S., at 53, n. 13. And we find this case similar in
this respect to Sibron, not to St. Pierre.

We must decide whether the Due Process Clause grants
an indigent defendant, such as Turner, a right to state
appointed counsel at a civil contempt proceeding, which
may lead to his incarceration. This Court’s precedents
