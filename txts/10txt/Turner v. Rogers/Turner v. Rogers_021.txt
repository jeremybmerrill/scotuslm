MICHAEL D. TURNER, PETITIONER v. REBECCA L. 

ROGERS ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

SOUTH CAROLINA

[June 20, 2011]


JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, and
with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO join as
to Parts I–B and II, dissenting.
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
does not provide a right to appointed counsel for indi
gent defendants facing incarceration in civil contempt pro
ceedings. Therefore, I would affirm. Although the Court
agrees that appointed counsel was not required in this
case, it nevertheless vacates the judgment of the South
Carolina Supreme Court on a different ground, which the
parties have never raised. Solely at the invitation of
the United States as amicus curiae, the majority decides
that Turner’s contempt proceeding violated due process because it did not include “alternative procedural safe
guards.” Ante, at 15. Consistent with this Court’s long
standing practice, I would not reach that question.1
I
The only question raised in this case is whether the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment creates a
right to appointed counsel for all indigent defendants facing
incarceration in civil contempt proceedings. It does not.
——————
1 I agree with the Court that this case is not moot because the chal
lenged action is likely to recur yet is so brief that it otherwise evades
our review. Ante, at 5–7.
