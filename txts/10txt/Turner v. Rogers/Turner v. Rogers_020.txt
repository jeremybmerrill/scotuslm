TURNER v. ROGERS
Opinion of the Court

the professional legal skill to protect himself when brought
before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty,
wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and
learned counsel” (emphasis added)). And this kind of
proceeding is not before us. Neither do we address what
due process requires in an unusually complex case where
a defendant “can fairly be represented only by a trained
advocate.” Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 788; see also Reply Brief
for Petitioner 18–20 (not claiming that Turner’s case is
especially complex).
IV
The record indicates that Turner received neither coun
sel nor the benefit of alternative procedures like those we
have described. He did not receive clear notice that his
ability to pay would constitute the critical question in his
civil contempt proceeding. No one provided him with a
form (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information
about his financial circumstances. The court did not find
that Turner was able to pay his arrearage, but instead left
the relevant “finding” section of the contempt order blank.
The court nonetheless found Turner in contempt and
ordered him incarcerated. Under these circumstances
Turner’s incarceration violated the Due Process Clause.
We vacate the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme
Court and remand the case for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
