MICHAEL D. TURNER, PETITIONER v. REBECCA L. 

ROGERS ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF

SOUTH CAROLINA

[June 20, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
South Carolina’s Family Court enforces its child support
orders by threatening with incarceration for civil contempt
those who are (1) subject to a child support order, (2) able
to comply with that order, but (3) fail to do so. We must
decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process
Clause requires the State to provide counsel (at a civil
contempt hearing) to an indigent person potentially faced
with such incarceration. We conclude that where as here
the custodial parent (entitled to receive the support) is
unrepresented by counsel, the State need not provide
counsel to the noncustodial parent (required to provide the
support). But we attach an important caveat, namely,
that the State must nonetheless have in place alternative
procedures that assure a fundamentally fair determina
tion of the critical incarceration-related question, whether
the supporting parent is able to comply with the support
order.
