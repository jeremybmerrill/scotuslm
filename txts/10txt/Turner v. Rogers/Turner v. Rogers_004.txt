TURNER v. ROGERS
Syllabus
about his financial status; and (4) an express finding by the court
that the defendant has the ability to pay.
This decision does not address civil contempt proceedings where
the underlying support payment is owed to the State, e.g., for reim
bursement of welfare funds paid to the custodial parent, or the ques
tion what due process requires in an unusually complex case where a
defendant “can fairly be represented only by a trained advocate,”
Gagnon, supra, at 788. Pp. 10–16.
3. Under the circumstances, Turner’s incarceration violated due
process because he received neither counsel nor the benefit of alter
native procedures like those the Court describes. He did not have
clear notice that his ability to pay would constitute the critical ques
tion in his civil contempt proceeding. No one provided him with a
form (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information about his fi
nancial circumstances. And the trial court did not find that he was
able to pay his arrearage, but nonetheless found him in civil con
tempt and ordered him incarcerated. P. 16.

387 S. C. 142, 691 S. E. 2d 470, vacated and remanded.
BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,
GINSBURG, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined. THOMAS, J., filed a dis
senting opinion, in which SCALIA, J., joined, and in which ROBERTS,
C. J., and ALITO, JJ., joined as to Parts I–B and II.
