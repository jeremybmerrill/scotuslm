TURNER v. ROGERS
Opinion of the Court

are presumed to continue), with Spencer v. Kemna, 523
U. S. 1, 14 (1998) (declining to extend the presumption to
parole revocation).
The short, conclusive answer to respondents’ mootness
claim, however, is that this case is not moot because it
falls within a special category of disputes that are “capable
of repetition” while “evading review.” Southern Pacific
Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911). A dispute
falls into that category, and a case based on that dispute
remains live, if “(1) the challenged action [is] in its dura
tion too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or
expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that
the same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same
action again.” Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 149
(1975) (per curiam).
Our precedent makes clear that the “challenged action,”
Turner’s imprisonment for up to 12 months, is “in its
duration too short to be fully litigated” through the state
courts (and arrive here) prior to its “expiration.” See, e.g.,
First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,
774 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted) (18-month
period too short); Southern Pacific Terminal Co., supra, at
514–516 (2-year period too short). At the same time, there
is a more than “reasonable” likelihood that Turner will
again be “subjected to the same action.” As we have
pointed out, supra, at 2–3, Turner has frequently failed to
make his child support payments. He has been the subject
of several civil contempt proceedings. He has been im
prisoned on several of those occasions. Within months of
his release from the imprisonment here at issue he was
again the subject of civil contempt proceedings. And he
was again imprisoned, this time for six months. As of
December 9, 2010, Turner was $13,814.72 in arrears, and
another contempt hearing was scheduled for May 4, 2011.

bring this case squarely within the special category of
