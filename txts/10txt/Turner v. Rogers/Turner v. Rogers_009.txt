Opinion of the Court

of a “right to counsel” in civil contempt proceedings enforc
ing child support orders, we granted the writ. Compare,
e.g., Pasqua v. Council, 186 N. J. 127, 141–146, 892 A. 2d
663, 671–674 (2006); Black v. Division of Child Support
Enforcement, 686 A. 2d 164, 167–168 (Del. 1996); Mead v.
Batchlor, 435 Mich. 480, 488–505, 460 N. W. 2d 493, 496–
504 (1990); Ridgway v. Baker, 720 F. 2d 1409, 1413–1415
(CA5 1983) (all finding a federal constitutional right to
counsel for indigents facing imprisonment in a child sup
port civil contempt proceeding), with Rodriguez v. Eighth
Judicial Dist. Ct., County of Clark, 120 Nev. 798, 808–813,
102 P. 3d 41, 48–51 (2004) (no right to counsel in civil
contempt hearing for nonsupport, except in “rarest of
cases”); Andrews v. Walton, 428 So. 2d 663, 666 (Fla. 1983)
(“no circumstances in which a parent is entitled to court
appointed counsel in a civil contempt proceeding for fail
ure to pay child support”). Compare also In re Grand Jury
Proceedings, 468 F. 2d 1368, 1369 (CA9 1972) (per curiam)
(general right to counsel in civil contempt proceedings),
with Duval v. Duval, 114 N. H. 422, 425–427, 322 A. 2d 1,
3–4 (1974) (no general right, but counsel may be required
on case-by-case basis).

Respondents argue that this case is moot. See Massa
chusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 480 (1923) (Article III
judicial power extends only to actual “cases” and “contro
versies”); Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U. S. __, __ (2009) (slip op.,
at 4) (“An actual controversy must be extant at all stages
of review” (internal quotation marks omitted)). They point
out that Turner completed his 12-month prison sentence
in 2009. And they add that there are no “collateral conse
quences” of that particular contempt determination that
might keep the dispute alive. Compare Sibron v. New
York, 392 U. S. 40, 55–56 (1968) (release from prison does
not moot a criminal case because “collateral consequences”
