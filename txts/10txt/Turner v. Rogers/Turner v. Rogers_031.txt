THOMAS, J., dissenting

Mothers and Fathers 7; see also Dept. of Health and
Human Services, Office of Child Support Enforcement, FY
2008 Annual Report to Congress, App. III, Table 71 (show
ing national child support arrears of $105.5 billion in
2008). In South Carolina alone, more than 139,000 non
custodial parents defaulted on their child support obliga
tions during 2008, and at year end parents owed $1.17
billion in total arrears. Id., App. III, Tables 73 and 71.
That some fathers subject to a child support agreement
report little or no income “does not mean they do not have
the ability to pay any child support.” Dept. of Health and
Human Services, H. Sorensen, L. Sousa, & S. Schaner,
Assessing Child Support Arrears in Nine Large States and
the Nation 22 (2007) (prepared by The Urban Institute)
(hereinafter Assessing Arrears). Rather, many “deadbeat
dads”5 “opt to work in the underground economy” to
“shield their earnings from child support enforcement
efforts.” Mich. Sup. Ct., Task Force Report: The Under
ground Economy 10 (2010) (hereinafter Underground
Economy). To avoid attempts to garnish their wages or
otherwise enforce the support obligation, “deadbeats” quit
their jobs, jump from job to job, become self-employed,
work under the table, or engage in illegal activity.6 See

6 In this case, Turner switched between eight different jobs in three
years, which made wage withholding difficult. App. 12a, 18a, 24a, 47a,
53a, 136a–139a. Most recently, Turner sold drugs in 2009 and 2010
but paid not a penny in child support during those years. Id., at 105a–
111a; App. to Brief for Respondents 16a, 21a–24a, 29a–32a, 37a–54a.
