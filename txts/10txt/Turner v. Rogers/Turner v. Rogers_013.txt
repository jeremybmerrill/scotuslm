Opinion of the Court

Jones, 445 U. S. 480, 496–497 (1980), a plurality of four
Members of this Court would have held that the Four
teenth Amendment requires representation by counsel in
a proceeding to transfer a prison inmate to a state hospital
for the mentally ill. Further, in Lassiter v. Department of
Social Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18 (1981), a case
that focused upon civil proceedings leading to loss of pa
rental rights, the Court wrote that the
“pre-eminent generalization that emerges from this
Court’s precedents on an indigent’s right to appointed
counsel is that such a right has been recognized to ex
ist only where the litigant may lose his physical lib
erty if he loses the litigation.” Id., at 25.
And the Court then drew from these precedents “the pre
sumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed
counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his
physical liberty.” Id., at 26–27.
On the other hand, the Court has held that a criminal
offender facing revocation of probation and imprisonment
does not ordinarily have a right to counsel at a probation
revocation hearing. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778
(1973); see also Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U. S. 25 (1976)
(no due process right to counsel in summary court-martial
proceedings). And, at the same time, Gault, Vitek, and
Lassiter are readily distinguishable. The civil juvenile
delinquency proceeding at issue in Gault was “little differ
ent” from, and “comparable in seriousness” to, a criminal
prosecution. 387 U. S., at 28, 36. In Vitek, the controlling
opinion found no right to counsel. 445 U. S., at 499–500
(Powell, J., concurring in part) (assistance of mental
health professionals sufficient). And the Court’s state
ments in Lassiter constitute part of its rationale for deny
ing a right to counsel in that case. We believe those
statements are best read as pointing out that the Court
previously had found a right to counsel “only” in cases
