TURNER v. ROGERS
THOMAS, J., dissenting

A
Under an original understanding of the Constitution,
there is no basis for concluding that the guarantee of due
process secures a right to appointed counsel in civil con
tempt proceedings. It certainly does not do so to the ex
tent that the Due Process Clause requires “ ‘that our
Government must proceed according to the “law of the
land”—that is, according to written constitutional and statu
tory provisions.’” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 589
(2004) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting In re Winship,
397 U. S. 358, 382 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting)). No one
contends that South Carolina law entitles Turner to ap
pointed counsel. Nor does any federal statute or constitu
tional provision so provide. Although the Sixth Amend
ment secures a right to “the Assistance of Counsel,” it does
not apply here because civil contempt proceedings are not
“criminal prosecutions.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; see ante, at
8. Moreover, as originally understood, the Sixth Amend
ment guaranteed only the “right to employ counsel, or to
use volunteered services of counsel”; it did not require the
court to appoint counsel in any circumstance. Padilla v.
Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)
(slip op., at 2); see also United States v. Van Duzee, 140
U. S. 169, 173 (1891); W. Beaney, The Right to Counsel in
American Courts 21–22, 28–29 (1955); F. Heller, The
Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
110 (1951).
Appointed counsel is also not required in civil contempt
proceedings under a somewhat broader reading of the Due
Process Clause, which takes it to approve “ ‘[a] process of
law, which is not otherwise forbidden, . . . [that] can show
the sanction of settled usage.’ ” Weiss v. United States, 510
U. S. 163, 197 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (quoting Hurtado v. California,
110 U. S. 516, 528 (1884)). Despite a long history of courts
exercising contempt authority, Turner has not identified
