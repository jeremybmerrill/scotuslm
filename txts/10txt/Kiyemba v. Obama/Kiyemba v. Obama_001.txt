Statement of BREYER, J.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
JAMAL KIYEMBA, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.

BARACK H. OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF 

THE UNITED STATES, ET AL. 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF 

COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

No. 10–775.

Decided April 18, 2011 


The motion of petitioners for leave to file a supplemental
brief under seal is granted. The petition for a writ of
certiorari is denied. JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the
consideration or decision of this motion and this petition.
Statement of JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE
KENNEDY, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR
join, respecting the denial of the petition for writ of
certiorari.
Petitioners have been held for several years in custody
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba—a detention that the Govern
ment agrees was without lawful cause. Brief in Opposi
tion 2. They seek a judicial order that would require their
release from custody into the United States. The District
Court concluded that the law entitled petitioners to such
an order. In re Guantanamo Bay Detainee Litigation, 581
F. Supp. 2d 33 (DC 2008). The Court of Appeals held to
the contrary. Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F. 3d 1022 (CADC
2009). And this Court initially granted certiorari to re
solve the important question whether a district court
may order the release of an unlawfully held prisoner into
the United States where no other remedy is available.
Kiyemba v. Obama, 558 U. S. ___ (2009).
The Court subsequently learned that each of the re
maining petitioners had received and rejected at least two
offers of resettlement. In light of these changed circum
stances, the Court vacated the Court of Appeals’ decision
