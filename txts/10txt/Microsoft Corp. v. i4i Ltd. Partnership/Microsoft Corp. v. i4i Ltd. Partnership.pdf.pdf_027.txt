MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 9–
10) (Congress’ use of a word that is similar to a term of art
does not codify the term of art). Therefore, I would not
conclude that Congress’ use of that phrase codified a stan
dard of proof.
Nevertheless, I reach the same outcome as the Court.
Because §282 is silent as to the standard of proof, it did
not alter the common-law rule. See ante, at 6 (“[§282]
includes no express articulation of the standard of proof”).
For that reason, I agree with the Court that the height
ened standard of proof set forth in Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1
(1934)—which has never been overruled by this Court or
modified by Congress—applies.
