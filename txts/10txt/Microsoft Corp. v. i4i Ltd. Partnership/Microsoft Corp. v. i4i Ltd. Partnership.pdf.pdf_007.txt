MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP
Opinion of the Court

240–241 (CA Fed. 1990); Ultra-Tex Surfaces, Inc. v. Hill
Bros. Chemical Co., 204 F. 3d 1360, 1367 (CA Fed. 2000);

935, 940 (CA Fed. 2010).
B
Respondents i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastruc
tures for Information Inc. (collectively, i4i) hold the patent
at issue in this suit. The i4i patent claims an improved
method for editing computer documents, which stores a
document’s content separately from the metacodes asso
ciated with the document’s structure. In 2007, i4i sued
petitioner Microsoft Corporation for willful infringement,
claiming that Microsoft’s manufacture and sale of certain
Microsoft Word products infringed i4i’s patent. In addi
tion to denying infringement, Microsoft counterclaimed
and sought a declaration that i4i’s patent was invalid and
unenforceable.
Specifically and as relevant here, Microsoft claimed that
the on-sale bar of §102(b) rendered the patent invalid,
pointing to i4i’s prior sale of a software program known as
S4. The parties agreed that, more than one year prior to
the filing of the i4i patent application, i4i had sold S4
in the United States. They presented opposing arguments
to the jury, however, as to whether that software embod
ied the invention claimed in i4i’s patent. Because the
software’s source code had been destroyed years before the
commencement of this litigation, the factual dispute
turned largely on trial testimony by S4’s two inventors—
also the named inventors on the i4i patent—both of whom
testified that S4 did not practice the key invention dis
closed in the patent.
Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was
never presented to the PTO examiner, Microsoft objected
to i4i’s proposed instruction that it was required to prove
its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.
