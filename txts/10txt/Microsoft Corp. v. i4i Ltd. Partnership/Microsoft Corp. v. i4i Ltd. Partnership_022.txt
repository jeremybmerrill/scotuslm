Opinion of the Court

reviewing invalidity claims raised in infringement actions.
For their part, i4i and its amici, including the United
States, contend that the heightened standard of proof
properly limits the circumstances in which a lay jury
overturns the considered judgment of an expert agency.
They claim that the heightened standard of proof is an
essential component of the patent “bargain,” see Bonito
Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141,
150–151 (1989), and the incentives for inventors to dis
close their innovations to the public in exchange for patent
protection. They disagree with the notion that the patent
issuance rate is above the optimal level. They explain that
limits on the reexamination process reflect a judgment by
Congress as to the appropriate degree of interference with
patentees’ reliance interests. Finally, they maintain that
juries that are properly instructed as to the application of
the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard can, and often
do, find an invalidity defense established.
We find ourselves in no position to judge the compara
tive force of these policy arguments. For nearly 30 years,
the Federal Circuit has interpreted §282 as we do today.
During this period, Congress has often amended §282, see,
e.g., Pub. L. 104–141, §2, 109 Stat. 352; Pub. L. 98–417,
§203, 98 Stat. 1603; not once, so far as we (and Microsoft)
are aware, has it even considered a proposal to lower the
standard of proof, see Tr. Oral Arg. 10. Moreover, Con
gress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns
about “bad” patents, including by expanding the reexami
nation process to provide for inter partes proceedings. See
Optional Inter Partes Reexamination Procedure Act of
1999, 113 Stat. 1501A–567, codified at 35 U. S. C. §311 et
seq. Through it all, the evidentiary standard adopted in
§282 has gone untouched. Indeed, Congress has left the
Federal Circuit’s interpretation of §282 in place despite
ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Govern
