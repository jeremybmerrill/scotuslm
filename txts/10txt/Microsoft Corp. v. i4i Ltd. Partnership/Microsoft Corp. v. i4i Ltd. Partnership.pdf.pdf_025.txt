MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP
BREYER, J., concurring

303 F. 3d 1294, 1301 (CA Fed. 2002); Transocean Offshore
Deepwater Drilling, Inc. v. Maersk Contractors USA, Inc.,
617 F. 3d 1296, 1305 (CA Fed. 2010); cf. Markman v.
Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370 (1996).
Courts can help to keep the application of today’s “clear
and convincing” standard within its proper legal bounds
by separating factual and legal aspects of an invalidity
claim, say, by using instructions based on case-specific
circumstances that help the jury make the distinction or
by using interrogatories and special verdicts to make clear
which specific factual findings underlie the jury’s conclu
sions. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 49 and 51. By isolating
the facts (determined with help of the “clear and convinc
ing” standard), courts can thereby assure the proper in
terpretation or application of the correct legal standard
(without use of the “clear and convincing” standard). By
preventing the “clear and convincing” standard from roam
ing outside its fact-related reservation, courts can increase
the likelihood that discoveries or inventions will not re
ceive legal protection where none is due.
