MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP
Opinion of the Court

ated by the PTO, the jury may be instructed to consider
that question. In either case, the jury may be instructed
to evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially
new, and if so, to consider that fact when determining
whether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear
and convincing evidence. Cf., e.g., Mendenhall v. Cedarap
ids, Inc., 5 F. 3d 1557, 1563–1564 (CA Fed. 1993); see
also Brief for International Business Machines Corp. as
Amicus Curiae 31–37. Although Microsoft emphasized in
its argument to the jury that S4 was never considered by
the PTO, it failed to request an instruction along these
lines from the District Court. Now, in its reply brief in
this Court, Microsoft insists that an instruction of this
kind was warranted. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22–23.
That argument, however, comes far too late, and we there
fore refuse to consider it. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.
Jackson, 561 U. S. ___ , ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12); cf. Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 51(d)(1)(B).

The parties and their amici have presented opposing
views as to the wisdom of the clear-and-convincing
evidence standard that Congress adopted. Microsoft and
its amici contend that the heightened standard of proof
dampens innovation by unduly insulating “bad” patents
from invalidity challenges. They point to the high invali
dation rate as evidence that the PTO grants patent protec
tion to too many undeserving “inventions.” They claim
that inter partes reexamination proceedings before the
PTO cannot fix the problem, as some grounds for invalida
tion (like the on-sale bar at issue here) cannot be raised in
such proceedings. They question the deference that the
PTO’s expert determinations warrant, in light of the
agency’s resources and procedures, which they deem in
adequate. And, they insist that the heightened standard
of proof essentially causes juries to abdicate their role in
