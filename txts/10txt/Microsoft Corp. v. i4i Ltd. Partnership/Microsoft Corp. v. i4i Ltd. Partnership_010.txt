Opinion of the Court

Our statutory inquiry, however, cannot simply end
there. We begin, of course, with “the assumption that the
ordinary meaning of the language” chosen by Congress
“accurately expresses the legislative purpose.” Engine
Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.,
541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (internal quotation marks omit
ted). But where Congress uses a common-law term in a
statute, we assume the “term . . . comes with a common
law meaning, absent anything pointing another way.”
Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58 (2007)
(citing Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S. 494, 500–501 (2000)).
Here, by stating that a patent is “presumed valid,” §282,
Congress used a term with a settled meaning in the com
mon law.
Our decision in RCA, 293 U. S. 1, is authoritative.
There, tracing nearly a century of case law from this Court
and others, Justice Cardozo wrote for a unanimous Court
that “there is a presumption of validity, a presumption not
to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.”
Id., at 2. Although the “force” of the presumption found
“varying expression” in this Court and elsewhere, id., at 7,
Justice Cardozo explained, one “common core of thought
and truth” unified the decisions:
“[O]ne otherwise an infringer who assails the validity
of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of
persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more
than a dubious preponderance. If that is true where

sion to find in favor of the party bearing the burden of persuasion. See 

Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423 (1979). In other words, the term

“standard of proof” specifies how difficult it will be for the party bearing 

the burden of persuasion to convince the jury of the facts in its favor. 

Various standards of proof are familiar—beyond a reasonable doubt, by

clear and convincing evidence, and by a preponderance of the evidence.

dure §5122, pp. 405–411 (2d ed. 2005) (hereinafter Fed. Practice)

(describing these and other standards of proof).
