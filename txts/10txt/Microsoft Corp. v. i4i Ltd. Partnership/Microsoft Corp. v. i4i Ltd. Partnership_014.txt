tion of patent validity. RCA simply said, without qualifi
cation, “that one otherwise an infringer who assails the
validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden
of persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than
a dubious preponderance.” 293 U. S., at 8; see also id., at
7 (“A patent regularly issued, and even more obviously
a patent issued after a hearing of all the rival claimants,
is presumed to be valid until the presumption has been
overcome by convincing evidence of error” (emphasis
added)). Nor do they appear in any of our cases as express
limitations on the application of the heightened standard
of proof. Cf., e.g., Smith v. Hall, 301 U. S. 216, 233 (1937)
(citing RCA for the proposition that a “heavy burden of
persuasion . . . rests upon one who seeks to negative nov
elty in a patent by showing prior use”); Mumm v. Jacob E.
Decker & Sons, 301 U. S. 168, 171 (1937) (“Not only is the
burden to make good this defense upon the party setting it
up, but his burden is a heavy one, as it has been held that
every reasonable doubt should be resolved against him”
(internal quotation marks omitted)). In fact, Microsoft
itself admits that our cases “could be read as announcing a
heightened standard applicable to all invalidity asser
tions.” Brief for Petitioner 30 (emphasis deleted).
Furthermore, we cannot agree that Microsoft’s proposed
limitations are inherent—even if unexpressed—in our
pre-1952 cases. As early as 1874 we explained that the
burden of proving prior inventorship “rests upon [the de
fendant], and every reasonable doubt should be resolved
against him,” without tying that rule to the vagaries and
manipulability of oral testimony. Coffin v. Ogden, 18
Wall. 120, 124 (1874). And, more than 60 years later, we
applied that rule where the evidence in support of a prior
use defense included documentary proof—not just oral
testimony—in a case presenting no priority issues at all.
See Smith, 301 U. S., at 221, 233. Thus, even if Congress
searched for some unstated limitations on the heightened
