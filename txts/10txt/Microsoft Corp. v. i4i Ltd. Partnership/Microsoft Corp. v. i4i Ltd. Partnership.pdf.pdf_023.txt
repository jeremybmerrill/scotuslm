MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP
Opinion of the Court

ment and without.11
Congress specified the applicable standard of proof
in 1952 when it codified the common-law presumption of
patent validity. Since then, it has allowed the Federal
Circuit’s correct interpretation of §282 to stand. Any re
calibration of the standard of proof remains in its hands.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit is
Affirmed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
