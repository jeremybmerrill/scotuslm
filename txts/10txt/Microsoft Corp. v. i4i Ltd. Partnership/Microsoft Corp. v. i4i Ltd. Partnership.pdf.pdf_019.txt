MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP
Opinion of the Court

depart from that understanding to enact a standard of
proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each
case. Indeed, had Congress intended to drop the heightened
standard of proof where the evidence before the jury var
ied from that before the PTO—and thus to take the un
usual and impractical step of enacting a variable standard
of proof that must itself be adjudicated in each case, cf.
Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 757 (1982)10—we as
sume it would have said so expressly.
To be sure, numerous courts of appeals in the years
preceding the 1952 Act observed that the presumption of
validity is “weakened” or “dissipated” in the circumstance
that the evidence in an infringement action was never
considered by the PTO. See Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. v. Berkeley
Pump Co., 191 F. 2d 632, 634 (CA9 1951) (“largely dissi
pated”); H. Schindler & Co. v. C. Saladino & Sons, 81
F. 2d 649, 651 (CA1 1936) (“weakened”); Gillette Safety
Razor Co. v. Cliff Weil Cigar Co., 107 F. 2d 105, 107 (CA4
1939) (“greatly weakened”); Butler Mfg. Co. v. Enterprise
Cleaning Co., 81 F. 2d 711, 716 (CA8 1936) (“weakened”).
But we cannot read these cases to hold or even to suggest
that a preponderance standard would apply in such cir
——————
10 Not the least of the impracticalities of such an approach arises from
the fact that whether a PTO examiner considered a particular reference
will often be a question without a clear answer. In granting a patent,
an examiner is under no duty to cite every reference he considers. 1

§904.03, p. 900–51 (8th rev. ed. 2010) (“The examiner is not called upon
to cite all references that may be available, but only the ‘best.’ Multiply
ing references, any one of which is as good as, but no better than, the
others, adds to the burden and cost of prosecution and should therefore
be avoided” (emphasis deleted)); Manual of Patent Examining Proce

Brief for Respondents 45–46 (describing additional impracticalities).
We see no indication in §282 that Congress meant to require collateral
litigation on such an inherently uncertain question.
