Opinion of the Court

cumstances, and we decline to impute such a reading to
Congress. Instead, we understand these cases to reflect
the same commonsense principle that the Federal Circuit
has recognized throughout its existence—namely, that
new evidence supporting an invalidity defense may “carry
more weight” in an infringement action than evidence
previously considered by the PTO, American Hoist, 725
F. 2d, at 1360. 	As Judge Rich explained:
“When new evidence touching validity of the patent
not considered by the PTO is relied on, the tribunal
considering it is not faced with having to disagree

with taking its expertise into account. The evidence
may, therefore, carry more weight and go further to
ward sustaining the attacker’s unchanging burden.”

Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 407 F. 3d 1297, 1306 (CA

Simply put, if the PTO did not have all material facts
before it, its considered judgment may lose significant
force. Cf. KSR, 550 U. S., at 427. And, concomitantly, the
challenger’s burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity
defense by clear and convincing evidence may be easier to
sustain. In this respect, although we have no occasion to
endorse any particular formulation, we note that a jury
instruction on the effect of new evidence can, and when
requested, most often should be given. When warranted,
the jury may be instructed to consider that it has heard
evidence that the PTO had no opportunity to evaluate
before granting the patent. When it is disputed whether
the evidence presented to the jury differs from that evalu
