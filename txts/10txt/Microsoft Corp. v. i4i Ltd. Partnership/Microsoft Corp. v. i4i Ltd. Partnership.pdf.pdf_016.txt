Opinion of the Court

(2001) (quoting United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528,
538–539 (1955)); see Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S.
___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). Here, no interpretation of
§282—including the two alternatives advanced by Micro
soft—avoids excess language. That is, if the presumption
only “allocates the burden of production,” Brief for Peti
tioner 21, or if it instead “shift[s] both the burden of pro
duction and the burden of persuasion,” id., at 22 (empha
sis deleted), then it would be unnecessary in light of §282’s
statement that the challenger bears the “burden of estab
lishing invalidity.” See 21B Fed. Practice §5122, at 401
(“[T]he same party who has the burden of persuasion also
starts out with the burden of producing evidence”). “There
are times when Congress enacts provisions that are super
fluous,” Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3), and the kind of
excess language that Microsoft identifies in §282 is hardly
unusual in comparison to other statutes that set forth a
presumption, a burden of persuasion, and a standard of
proof. Cf., e.g., 28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(1).8

8 For

those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history of §282
provides additional evidence that Congress meant to codify the judge
made presumption of validity, not to set forth a new presumption of
its own making. The accompanying House and Senate Reports both
explain that §282 “introduces a declaration of the presumption of va
lidity of a patent, which is now a statement made by courts in deci
sions, but has had no expression in the statute.” H. R. Rep. No. 1923,
82d Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1952) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.); S. Rep. No.
1979, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1952) (hereinafter S. Rep.). To the same
effect, the Reviser’s Note indicates that §282’s “first paragraph declares
the existing presumption of validity of patents.” Note following 35
U. S. C. §282 (1952 ed.).
Prior to 1952, the existing patent laws already incorporated the sum
and substance of the presumption as Microsoft would define it—that is,
they “assign[ed] the burden of proving invalidity to the accused in
fringer,” Brief for Petitioner 14 (emphasis deleted). See 35 U. S. C. §69
(1946 ed.) (providing that a defendant in an infringement action “may
plead” and “prove on trial” the invalidity of the patent as a defense); see
