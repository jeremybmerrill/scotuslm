MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP
Opinion of the Court

standard of proof in our cases, it would have found none.7
Microsoft also argues that the Federal Circuit’s inter
pretation of §282’s statement that “[a] patent shall be pre
sumed valid” must fail because it renders superfluous
the statute’s additional statement that “[t]he burden of
establishing invalidity of a patent . . . shall rest on the
party asserting such invalidity.” We agree that if the
presumption imposes a heightened standard of proof on
the patent challenger, then it alone suffices to establish
that the defendant bears the burden of persuasion. Cf.
Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs v.
Greenwich Collieries, 512 U. S. 267, 278 (1994) (“A stan
dard of proof . . . can apply only to a burden of persua
sion”). Indeed, the Federal Circuit essentially recognized
as much in American Hoist. See 725 F. 3d, at 1359.
But the canon against superfluity assists only where a
competing interpretation gives effect “ ‘to every clause and
word of a statute.’ ” Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174

7 In a similar vein, Microsoft insists that there simply was no settled
presumption of validity for Congress to codify in 1952. Microsoft points
to a handful of district court decisions, which “question[ed] whether any
presumption of validity was warranted,” or which “required the pat
entee to prove the validity of his patent by a preponderance of the
evidence.” Brief for Petitioner 24 (emphasis deleted; brackets and
internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Ginsberg v. Railway
Express Agency, Inc., 72 F. Supp. 43, 44 (SDNY 1947) (stating, in dicta,
that “[i]t may now well be said that no presumption whatever arises
from the grant of patent”); see also post, at 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring in
judgment). RCA makes clear, however, that the presumption of patent
validity had an established meaning traceable to the mid-19th century,
293 U. S. 1, 7–8 (1934); that some lower courts doubted its wisdom or
even pretended it did not exist is of no moment. Microsoft may be
correct that Congress enacted §282 to correct lower courts that required
the patentee to prove the validity of a patent. See American Hoist &
Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350, 1359 (CA Fed. 1984).
But the language Congress selected reveals its intent not only to specify
that the defendant bears the burden of proving invalidity but also that
the evidence in support of the defense must be clear and convincing.
