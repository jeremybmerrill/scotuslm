MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP 

Opinion of the Court 


B

Reprising the more limited argument that it pressed
below, Microsoft argues in the alternative that a prepon
derance standard must at least apply where the evidence
before the factfinder was not before the PTO during the
examination process. In particular, it relies on KSR
Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U. S. 398 (2007), where we ob
served that, in these circumstances, “the rationale under
lying the presumption—that the PTO, in its expertise, has
approved the claim—seems much diminished.” Id., at 426.
That statement is true enough, although other ration
ales may animate the presumption in such circumstances.
See The Barbed Wire Patent, 143 U. S. 275, 292 (1892)
(explaining that because the patentee “first published this
device; put it upon record; made use of it for a practical
purpose; and gave it to the public . . . . doubts . . . concern
ing the actual inventor . . . should be resolved in favor
of the patentee”); cf. Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 33 (arguing that even when the administrative cor
rectness rationale has no relevance, the heightened stan
dard of proof “serves to protect the patent holder’s reliance
interests” in disclosing an invention to the public in
exchange for patent protection). The question remains,
however, whether Congress has specified the applicable
——————
also Patent Act of 1870, ch. 230, §61, 16 Stat. 208 (same); Patent Act of
1836, ch. 357, §15, 5 Stat. 123 (similar); Patent Act of 1793, ch. II, §6, 1
Stat. 322 (similar); Coffin, 18 Wall., at 124 (explaining that the Patent
Act of 1836 “allowed a party sued for infringement to prove, among
other defences, that the patentee was not the original and first inventor
of the thing patented, or of a substantial and material part thereof
claimed to be new” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The House and
Senate Reports state, however, that §282 established a principle that
previously “had no expression in the statute.” H. R. Rep., at 10; S. Rep.,
at 9. Thus, because the only thing missing from §282’s predecessor was
the heightened standard of proof itself, Congress must have understood
the presumption of patent validity to include the heightened standard
of proof attached to it.
