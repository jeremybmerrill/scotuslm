MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP
Opinion of the Court

nonobvious, §103. Most relevant here, the on-sale bar of
§102(b) precludes patent protection for any “invention”
that was “on sale in this country” more than one year prior
to the filing of a patent application. See generally Pfaff v.
Wells Electronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 67–68 (1998). In
evaluating whether these and other statutory conditions
have been met, PTO examiners must make various factual
determinations—for instance, the state of the prior art in
the field and the nature of the advancement embodied in
the invention. See Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 153
(1999).
Once issued, a patent grants certain exclusive rights to
its holder, including the exclusive right to use the inven
tion during the patent’s duration. To enforce that right, a
patentee can bring a civil action for infringement if an
other person “without authority makes, uses, offers to sell,
or sells any patented invention, within the United States.”
§271(a); see also §281.
Among other defenses under §282 of the Patent Act of
1952 (1952 Act), an alleged infringer may assert the inva
lidity of the patent—that is, he may attempt to prove that
the patent never should have issued in the first place. See
§§282(2), (3). A defendant may argue, for instance, that
the claimed invention was obvious at the time and thus
that one of the conditions of patentability was lacking.
See §282(2); see also §103. “While the ultimate question of
patent validity is one of law,” Graham v. John Deere Co.
of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 17 (1966) (citing Great Atlantic
& Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340
U. S. 147, 155 (1950) (Douglas, J., concurring)); see post,
at 1 (BREYER, J., concurring), the same factual questions
underlying the PTO’s original examination of a patent ap
plication will also bear on an invalidity defense in an in
fringement action. See, e.g., 383 U. S., at 17 (describing
the “basic factual inquiries” that form the “background”
for evaluating obviousness); Pfaff, 525 U. S., at 67–69
