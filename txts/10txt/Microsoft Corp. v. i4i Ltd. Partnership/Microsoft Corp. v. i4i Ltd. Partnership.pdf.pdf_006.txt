Opinion of the Court

(same, as to the on-sale bar).
In asserting an invalidity defense, an alleged infringer
must contend with the first paragraph of §282, which
provides that “[a] patent shall be presumed valid” and
“[t]he burden of establishing invalidity . . . rest[s] on the
party asserting such invalidity.”1 Under the Federal
Circuit’s reading of §282, a defendant seeking to overcome
this presumption must persuade the factfinder of its in
validity defense by clear and convincing evidence. Judge
Rich, a principal drafter of the 1952 Act, articulated this
view for the court in American Hoist & Derrick Co. v.
Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350 (CA Fed. 1984). There,
the Federal Circuit held that §282 codified “the existing
presumption of validity of patents,” id., at 1359 (internal
quotation marks omitted)—what, until that point, had
been a common-law presumption based on “the basic
proposition that a government agency such as the [PTO]
was presumed to do its job,” ibid. Relying on this Court’s
pre-1952 precedent as to the “force of the presumption,”
ibid. (citing Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering
Laboratories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (1934) (RCA)), Judge Rich
concluded:
“[Section] 282 creates a presumption that a patent is
valid and imposes the burden of proving invalidity on
the attacker. That burden is constant and never
changes and is to convince the court of invalidity by
clear evidence.” 725 F. 2d, at 1360.
In the nearly 30 years since American Hoist, the Federal
Circuit has never wavered in this interpretation of §282.
See, e.g., Greenwood v. Hattori Seiko Co., 900 F. 2d 238,
——————
1 As originally enacted in 1952, the first paragraph of §282 read: “A
patent shall be presumed valid. The burden of establishing invalidity
of a patent shall rest on a party asserting it.” 66 Stat. 812. Congress
has since amended §282, inserting two sentences not relevant here and
modifying the language of the second sentence to that in the text.
