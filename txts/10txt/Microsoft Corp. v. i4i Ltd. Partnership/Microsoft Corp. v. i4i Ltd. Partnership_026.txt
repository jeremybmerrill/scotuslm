MICROSOFT CORPORATION, PETITIONER v. i4i 

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[June 9, 2011]


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
I am not persuaded that Congress codified a standard of
proof when it stated in the Patent Act of 1952 that “[a]
patent shall be presumed valid.” 35 U. S. C. §282; see
ante, at 7. “[W]here Congress borrows terms of art,” this
Court presumes that Congress “knows and adopts the
cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word
. . . and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial
mind.” Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263
(1952). But I do not think that the words “[a] patent shall
be presumed valid” so clearly conveyed a particular stan
dard of proof to the judicial mind in 1952 as to constitute
a term of art. See, e.g., ante, at 12, n. 7 (“[S]ome lower
courts doubted [the presumption’s] wisdom or even pre
tended it did not exist”); Philip A. Hunt Co. v. Mallinck
rodt Chemical Works, 72 F. Supp. 865, 869 (EDNY 1947)
(“[T]he impact upon the presumption of many late deci
sions seems to have rendered it as attenuated . . . as the
shadow of a wraith”); Myers v. Beall Pipe & Tank Corp., 90
F. Supp. 265, 268 (D Ore. 1948) (“[T]he presumption of
[patent] validity . . . is treated by the appellate courts as
evanescent as a cloud”); American Hoist & Derrick Co. v.
Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350, 1359 (CA Fed. 1984)
(“[I]n 1952, the case law was far from consistent—even
contradictory—about the presumption”); cf. Bruesewitz v.
