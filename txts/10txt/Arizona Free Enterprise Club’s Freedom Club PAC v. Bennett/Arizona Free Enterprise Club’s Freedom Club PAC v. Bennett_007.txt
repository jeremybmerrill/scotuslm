ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[June 27, 2011]

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Under Arizona law, candidates for state office who ac
cept public financing can receive additional money from
the State in direct response to the campaign activities of
privately financed candidates and independent expendi
ture groups. Once a set spending limit is exceeded, a
publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for
every dollar spent by an opposing privately financed can
didate. The publicly financed candidate also receives
roughly one dollar for every dollar spent by independent
expenditure groups to support the privately financed
candidate, or to oppose the publicly financed candidate.
