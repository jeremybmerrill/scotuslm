KAGAN, J., dissenting

Except in this Court, where the inescapable logic of the
State’s position is . . . virtually ignored. The Court, to be
sure, repeatedly asserts that the State’s interest in pre
venting corruption does not “sufficiently justif[y]” the
mechanism it has chosen to disburse public moneys. Ante,
at 28; see ante, at 27. Only one thing is missing from the
Court’s response: any reasoning to support this conclusion.
Nowhere does the majority dispute the State’s view that
the success of its public financing system depends on the
matching funds mechanism; and nowhere does the major
ity contest that, if this mechanism indeed spells the differ
ence between success and failure, the State’s interest in
preventing corruption justifies its use. And so the major
ity dismisses, but does not actually answer the State’s
contention—even though that contention is the linchpin of
the entire case. Assuming (against reason and precedent)
that the matching funds provision substantially burdens
speech, the question becomes whether the State has of
fered a sufficient justification for imposing that burden.
Arizona has made a forceful argument on this score,
based on the need to establish an effective public fi
nancing system. The majority does not even engage that
reasoning.

The majority instead devotes most of its energy to trying
to show that “level[ing] the playing field,” not fighting
corruption, was the State’s real goal. Ante, at 22–23 (in
ternal quotation marks omitted); see ante, at 22–24. But
the majority’s distaste for “leveling” provides no excuse for
striking down Arizona’s law.

For starters, the Court has no basis to question the
sincerity of the State’s interest in rooting out political
corruption. As I have just explained, that is the interest
