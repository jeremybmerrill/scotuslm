difference. In case after case, year upon year, we have
distinguished between speech restrictions and speech
subsidies. “ ‘There is a basic difference,’ ” we have held,
“ ‘between direct state interference with [First Amend
ment] protected activity and state encouragement’ ” of
other expression. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 193
(1991) (quoting Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 475 (1977));
see also, e.g., Federal Election Comm’n v. Massachusetts

Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S.
540, 550 (1983); National Endowment for Arts v. Finley,
524 U. S. 569, 587–588 (1998); id., at 599 (SCALIA, J.,

Finley, 524 U. S., at 587–588. That is because subsidies,
by definition and contra the majority, do not restrict any
speech.
No one can claim that Arizona’s law discriminates
against particular ideas, and so violates the First Amend
ment’s sole limitation on speech subsidies. The State
throws open the doors of its public financing program to
all candidates who meet minimal eligibility requirements
and agree not to raise private funds. Republicans and
Democrats, conservatives and liberals may participate; so
too, the law applies equally to independent expenditure
groups across the political spectrum. Arizona disburses
funds based not on a candidate’s (or supporter’s) ideas, but
on the candidate’s decision to sign up for public funding.
So under our precedent, Arizona’s subsidy statute should
