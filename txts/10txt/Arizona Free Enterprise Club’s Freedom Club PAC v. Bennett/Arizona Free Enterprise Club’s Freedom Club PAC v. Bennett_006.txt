ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM 

CLUB PAC v. BENNETT

Syllabus 

candidates five dollars for every dollar spent by a privately financed
candidate, or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to
pay a $10,000 fine, in order to encourage participation in the public
funding regime. Such measures might well promote such participa
tion, but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political
speech. How the State chooses to encourage participation in its pub
lic funding system matters, and the Court has never held that a State
may burden political speech—to the extent the matching funds provi
sion does—to ensure adequate participation in a public funding sys
tem. Pp. 25–28.
(c) Evaluating the wisdom of public financing as a means of fund
ing political candidacy is not the Court’s business. But determining
whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amend
ment is. The government “may engage in public financing of election
campaigns,” and doing so can further “significant governmental in
terest[s].” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 92–93, 96. But the goal of
creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a
manner consistent with the First Amendment. Arizona’s program
gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech
of an opposing candidate or an independent group. It does this when
the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and
has engaged in political speech above a level set by the State. This
goes too far; Arizona’s matching funds provision substantially bur
dens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent
expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.
Pp. 28–30.
