KAGAN, J., dissenting

opponent. Ante, at 18. That is indeed the factual distinc
tion: A matching fund provision, we can all agree, is not a
disclosure rule. But the majority does not tell us why this
difference matters. Nor could it. The majority strikes
down the matching funds provision because of its ostensi
ble effect—most notably, that it may deter a person from
spending money in an election. But this Court has ac
knowledged time and again that disclosure obligations
have the selfsame effect. If that consequence does not
trigger the most stringent judicial review in the one case,
it should not do so in the other.
Number three: Any burden that the Arizona law im
poses does not exceed the burden associated with contri
bution limits, which we have also repeatedly upheld. Con
tribution limits, we have stated, “impose direct quantity
restrictions on political communication and association,”
Buckley, 424 U. S., at 18 (emphasis added), thus “ ‘signifi
cant[ly] interfer[ing]’ ” with First Amendment interests,
Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,
387 (2000) (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 25). Rather
than potentially deterring or “ ‘diminish[ing] the effective
ness’ ” of expressive activity, ante, at 10 (quoting Davis,
554 U. S., at 736), these limits stop it cold. Yet we have
never subjected these restrictions to the most stringent
review. See Buckley, 424 U. S., at 29–38. I doubt I have
to reiterate that the Arizona statute imposes no restraints
on any expressive activity. So the majority once again has
no reason here to reach a different result.
In this way, our campaign finance cases join our speech
subsidy cases in supporting the constitutionality of Ari
zona’s law. Both sets of precedents are in accord that a
statute funding electoral speech in the way Arizona’s does
imposes no First Amendment injury.

The majority thinks it has one case on its side—Davis v.
