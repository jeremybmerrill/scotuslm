Opinion of the Court

intrusion by the government into the debate over who
should govern goes to the heart of First Amendment
values.
“Leveling the playing field” can sound like a good thing.
But in a democracy, campaigning for office is not a game.
It is a critically important form of speech. The First
Amendment embodies our choice as a Nation that, when it

personal funds reduces the threat of corruption” and that
“discouraging [the] use of personal funds[ ] disserves the
anticorruption interest.” Davis, supra, at 740–741. That
is because “the use of personal funds reduces the candi
date’s dependence on outside contributions and thereby
counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of
abuse” of money in politics. Buckley, supra, at 53. The
matching funds provision counts a candidate’s expendi
