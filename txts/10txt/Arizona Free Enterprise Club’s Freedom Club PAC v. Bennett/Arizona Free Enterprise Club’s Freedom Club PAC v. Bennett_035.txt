We have said that governments “may engage in public
financing of election campaigns” and that doing so can

state interest in preventing corruption. Buckley, 424
U. S., at 57, n. 65, 92–93, 96. But the goal of creating
a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a
manner consistent with the First Amendment. The dis
