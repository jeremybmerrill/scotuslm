ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM 

CLUB PAC v. BENNETT

KAGAN, J., dissenting 


We said all this in Buckley, when we upheld the presi
dential public financing system—a ruling this Court has
never since questioned. The principal challenge to that
system came from minor-party candidates not eligible for
benefits—surely more compelling plaintiffs than petition
ers, who could have received funding but refused it. Yet
we rejected that attack in part because we understood the
federal program as supporting, rather than interfering
with, expression. See 424 U. S., at 90–108; see also
Regan, 461 U. S., at 549 (relying on Buckley to hold that
selective subsidies of expression comport with the First
Amendment if they are viewpoint neutral). Buckley re
jected any idea, along the lines the majority proposes, that
a subsidy of electoral speech was in truth a restraint. And
more: Buckley recognized that public financing of elections
fosters First Amendment principles. “[T]he central pur
pose of the Speech and Press Clauses,” we explained, “was
to assure a society in which ‘uninhibited, robust, and wide
open’ public debate concerning matters of public interest
would thrive, for only in such a society can a healthy
representative democracy flourish.” 424 U. S., at 93,
n. 127 (quoting New York Times, 376 U. S., at 270). And we
continued: “[L]aws providing financial assistance to the
exercise of free speech”—including the campaign finance
statute at issue—“enhance these First Amendment val
ues.” 424 U. S., at 93, n. 127. We should be saying the
same today.
B
The majority has one, and only one, way of separating
this case from Buckley and our other, many precedents
——————
expenditure caps. Other candidates accept public financing because
they believe it will enhance their communication with voters. So the
system continually pushes toward more speech. That is exactly what
has happened in Arizona, see n. 2, supra, and the majority offers no
counter-examples.
