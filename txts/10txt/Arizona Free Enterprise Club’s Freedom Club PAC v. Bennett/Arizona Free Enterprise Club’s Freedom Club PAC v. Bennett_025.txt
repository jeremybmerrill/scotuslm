Opinion of the Court

Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s (AFEC) Freedom Club
PAC et al. 12; see also id., at 11–17 (listing additional
sources of evidence detailing the burdens imposed by the
matching funds provision); Brief for Petitioner AFEC’s
Freedom Club PAC et al. 14–21 (AFEC Brief) (same); Brief
for Petitioner McComish et al. 30–37 (same).
The State contends that if the matching funds provision
truly burdened the speech of privately financed candidates
and independent expenditure groups, spending on behalf
of privately financed candidates would cluster just below
the triggering level, but no such phenomenon has been
observed. Brief for State Respondents 39; Brief for Re
spondent Clean Elections Institute 18–19. That should
come as no surprise. The hypothesis presupposes a pri
vately funded candidate who would spend his own money
just up to the matching funds threshold, when he could
have simply taken matching funds in the first place.
Furthermore, the Arizona law takes into account all
manner of uncoordinated political activity in awarding
matching funds. If a privately funded candidate wanted
to hover just below the triggering level, he would have to
make guesses about how much he will receive in the form
of contributions and supportive independent expenditures.
He might well guess wrong.
In addition, some candidates may be willing to bear the
burden of spending above the cap. That a candidate is
willing to do so does not make the law any less burden
some. See Davis, 554 U. S., at 739 (that candidates may
choose to make “personal expenditures to support their
campaigns” despite the burdens imposed by the Million
aire’s Amendment does not change the fact that “they
must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden
if they make that choice”). If the State made privately
funded candidates pay a $500 fine to run as such, the fact
that candidates might choose to pay it does not make the
fine any less burdensome.
