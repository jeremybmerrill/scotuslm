whole of the State’s financial backing of a publicly funded
candidate. But when certain conditions are met, publicly
funded candidates are granted additional “equalizing” or
matching funds. §§16–952(A), (B), and (C)(4)–(5) (provid
ing for “[e]qual funding of candidates”).
Matching funds are available in both primary and gen
eral elections. In a primary, matching funds are triggered
when a privately financed candidate’s expenditures, com
bined with the expenditures of independent groups made
in support of the privately financed candidate or in opposi

election allotment of state funds to the publicly financed
candidate. §§16–952(A), (C). During the general election,
matching funds are triggered when the amount of money
a privately financed candidate receives in contributions,
combined with the expenditures of independent groups
made in support of the privately financed candidate or in
opposition to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the
general election allotment of state funds to the publicly fi

didate’s expenditures of his personal funds are counted
as contributions for purposes of calculating matching
funds during a general election. See ibid.; Citizens Clean
Elections Commission, Ariz. Admin. Rule R2–20–
113(B)(1)(f) (Sept. 2009).
Once matching funds are triggered, each additional dol
lar that a privately financed candidate spends during
the primary results in one dollar in additional state fund
ing to his publicly financed opponent (less a 6% reduction
meant to account for fundraising expenses). §16–952(A).
During a general election, every dollar that a candidate
receives in contributions—which includes any money of
his own that a candidate spends on his campaign—results
in roughly one dollar in additional state funding to his
