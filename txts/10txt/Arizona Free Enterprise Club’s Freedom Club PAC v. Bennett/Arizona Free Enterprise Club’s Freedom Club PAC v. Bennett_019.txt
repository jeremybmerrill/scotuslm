Opinion of the Court

funded candidate receives from the State. And just as
with the privately financed candidate, the effect of a dollar
spent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout
to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes. More
over, spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars
to multiple candidates the group disapproves of, dollars
directly controlled by the publicly funded candidate or
candidates.
In some ways, the burden the Arizona law imposes on
independent expenditure groups is worse than the burden
it imposes on privately financed candidates, and thus
substantially worse than the burden we found constitu
tionally impermissible in Davis. If a candidate contem
plating an electoral run in Arizona surveys the campaign
landscape and decides that the burdens imposed by the
matching funds regime make a privately funded campaign
unattractive, he at least has the option of taking public
financing. Independent expenditure groups, of course, do
not.
Once the spending cap is reached, an independent ex
penditure group that wants to support a particular candi
date—because of that candidate’s stand on an issue of con
cern to the group—can only avoid triggering matching
funds in one of two ways. The group can either opt to
change its message from one addressing the merits of the
candidates to one addressing the merits of an issue, or
refrain from speaking altogether. Presenting independent
expenditure groups with such a choice makes the match
ing funds provision particularly burdensome to those
groups. And forcing that choice—trigger matching funds,
change your message, or do not speak—certainly contra
venes “the fundamental rule of protection under the First
Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose
the content of his own message.” Hurley v. Irish-American
