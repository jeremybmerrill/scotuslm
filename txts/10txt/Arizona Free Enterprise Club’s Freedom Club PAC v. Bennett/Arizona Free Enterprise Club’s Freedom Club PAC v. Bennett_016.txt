ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM

Opinion of the Court 


the original contribution cap. Davis argued that this
scheme “burden[ed] his exercise of his First Amendment
right to make unlimited expenditures of his personal
funds because” doing so had “the effect of enabling his
opponent to raise more money and to use that money to
finance speech that counteract[ed] and thus diminishe[d]

In addressing the constitutionality of the Millionaire’s
Amendment, we acknowledged that the provision did not

candidate who chose to spend more than $350,000 of his
own money was forced to “shoulder a special and poten

determined that this constituted an “unprecedented pen

of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for
campaign speech,” and concluded that the Government
had failed to advance any compelling interest that would
justify such a burden. Id., at 739–740.

sion, “the vigorous exercise of the right to use personal
funds to finance campaign speech” leads to “advantages
