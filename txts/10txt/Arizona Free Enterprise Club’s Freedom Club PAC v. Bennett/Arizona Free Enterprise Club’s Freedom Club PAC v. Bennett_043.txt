many factors—including the resources of the privately

from one election to the next. See App. 714–716 (record
evidence chronicling the history of variation in campaign

public financing programs, because inaccurate estimates

participating or waste taxpayer money. And so States
have made adjustments to the lump-sum scheme that we
approved in Buckley, in attempts to more effectively re

as “AzScam,” nearly 10% of the State’s legislators were
caught accepting campaign contributions or bribes in ex

that incident, the voters of Arizona decided that further
reform was necessary. Acting once again by referendum,
they adopted the public funding system at issue here.
The hallmark of Arizona’s program is its inventive
