KAGAN, J., dissenting

upper limit—because it knows that in each campaign it
will only have to disburse what is necessary to keep a par

At every turn, the majority tries to convey the im

piece with laws prohibiting electoral speech. The majority
invokes the language of “limits,” “bar[s],” and “restraints.”
