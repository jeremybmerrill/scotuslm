ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM 

CLUB PAC v. BENNETT

Opinion of the Court 


While there is evidence to support the contention of
the candidates and independent expenditure groups that
the matching funds provision burdens their speech, “it is
never easy to prove a negative”—here, that candidates and
groups did not speak or limited their speech because of the
Arizona law. Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 218
(1960). In any event, the burden imposed by the matching
funds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that
confronts privately financed candidates and independent
expenditure groups. Cf. Davis, 554 U. S., at 738–740.
Indeed even candidates who sign up for public funding
recognize the burden matching funds impose on private
speech, stating that they participate in the program be
cause “matching funds . . . discourage[ ] opponents, special
interest groups, and lobbyists from campaigning against”
them. GAO, Campaign Finance Reform: Experiences of
Two States that Offered Full Public Funding for Political
Candidates 27 (GAO–10–390, 2010). As in Davis, we do
not need empirical evidence to determine that the law at
issue is burdensome. See 554 U. S., at 738–740 (requiring
no evidence of a burden whatsoever).
It is clear not only to us but to every other court to have
considered the question after Davis that a candidate or
independent group might not spend money if the direct
result of that spending is additional funding to political
adversaries. See, e.g., Green Party of Conn., 616 F. 3d, at
242 (matching funds impose “a substantial burden on the
exercise of First Amendment rights” (internal quotation
marks omitted)); McComish v. Bennett, 611 F. 3d, at 524
(matching funds create “potential chilling effects” and
“impose some First Amendment burden”); Scott v. Roberts,
612 F. 3d 1279, 1290 (CA11 2010) (“we think it is obvious
that the [matching funds] subsidy imposes a burden on
[privately financed] candidates”); id., at 1291 (“we know of
no court that doubts that a [matching funds] subsidy like
the one at issue here burdens” the speech of privately
