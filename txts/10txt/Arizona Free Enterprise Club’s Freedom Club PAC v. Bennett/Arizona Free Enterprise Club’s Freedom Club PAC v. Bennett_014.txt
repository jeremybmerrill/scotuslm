ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM 

CLUB PAC v. BENNETT

Opinion of the Court 


We stayed the Court of Appeals’ decision, vacated the
stay of the District Court’s injunction, see 560 U. S. ___
(2010), and later granted certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2010).
II
“Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifica
tions of candidates are integral to the operation” of our
system of government. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 14
(1976) (per curiam). As a result, the First Amendment
“ ‘has its fullest and most urgent application’ to speech ut
tered during a campaign for political office.” Eu v. San
Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S.
214, 223 (1989) (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401
U. S. 265, 272 (1971)). “Laws that burden political speech
are” accordingly “subject to strict scrutiny, which requires
the Government to prove that the restriction furthers
a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve
that interest.”
Citizens United v. Federal Election
Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 23) (internal
quotation marks omitted); see Federal Election Comm’n v.
Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 256
(1986).
Applying these principles, we have invalidated govern
ment-imposed restrictions on campaign expenditures,
Buckley, supra, at 52–54, restraints on independent ex
penditures applied to express advocacy groups, Massachu
setts Citizens for Life, supra, at 256–265, limits on uncoor
dinated political party expenditures, Colorado Republican
Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm’n,
518 U. S. 604, 608 (1996) (opinion of BREYER, J.) (Colorado
I), and regulations barring unions, nonprofit and other
associations, and corporations from making independent
expenditures for electioneering communication, Citizens
