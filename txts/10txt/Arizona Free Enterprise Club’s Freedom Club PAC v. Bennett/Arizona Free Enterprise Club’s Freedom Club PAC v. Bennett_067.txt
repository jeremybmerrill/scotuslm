KAGAN, J., dissenting

U. S. 622, 652 (1994); Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,
475 U. S. 41, 47–48 (1986). When a law is otherwise
constitutional—when it either does not restrict speech or
rests on an interest sufficient to justify any such restric
tion—that is the end of the story.
That proposition disposes of this case, even if Arizona
had an adjunct interest here in equalizing electoral oppor
tunities. No special rule of automatic invalidation applies
to statutes having some connection to equality; like any
other laws, they pass muster when supported by an im
portant enough government interest. Here, Arizona has
demonstrated in detail how the matching funds provision
is necessary to serve a compelling interest in combating
corruption. So the hunt for evidence of “leveling” is a
waste of time; Arizona’s law survives constitutional scru
tiny no matter what that search would uncover.
IV
This case arose because Arizonans wanted their gov
ernment to work on behalf of all the State’s people. On
the heels of a political scandal involving the near-routine
purchase of legislators’ votes, Arizonans passed a law de
signed to sever political candidates’ dependence on large
contributors. They wished, as many of their fellow Ameri
cans wish, to stop corrupt dealing—to ensure that their
representatives serve the public, and not just the wealthy
donors who helped put them in office. The legislation that
Arizona’s voters enacted was the product of deep thought
and care. It put into effect a public financing system
that attracted large numbers of candidates at a sustain
able cost to the State’s taxpayers. The system discrimi
nated against no ideas and prevented no speech. Indeed,
by increasing electoral competition and enabling a wide
range of candidates to express their views, the system
“further[ed] . . . First Amendment values.” Buckley, 424
U. S., at 93 (citing New York Times, 376 U. S., at 270).
