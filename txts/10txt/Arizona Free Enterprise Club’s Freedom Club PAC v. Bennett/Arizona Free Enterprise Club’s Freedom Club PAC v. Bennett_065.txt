goal of combating corruption.
Finally, the Court remarks in a footnote that the Clean
Elections Commission’s website once stated that the “ ‘Act
was passed by the people of Arizona . . . to level the play
ing field.’ ” Ante, at 24, n. 10. I can understand why
the majority does not place much emphasis on this point.
Some members of the majority have ridiculed the practice
of relying on subsequent statements by legislators to
demonstrate an earlier Congress’s intent in enacting a
statute. See, e.g., Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617,
631–632 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part); United
States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 434–435 (2009) (ROBERTS,
C. J., dissenting). Yet here the majority makes a much
stranger claim: that a statement appearing on a govern
ment website in 2011 (written by who-knows-whom?)
reveals what hundreds of thousands of Arizona’s voters
sought to do in 1998 when they enacted the Clean Elec
tions Act by referendum. Just to state that proposition is
to know it is wrong.
So the majority has no evidence—zero, none—that the
objective of the Act is anything other than the interest
that the State asserts, the Act proclaims, and the history
of public financing supports: fighting corruption.

But suppose the majority had come up with some evi
dence showing that Arizona had sought to “equalize elec
toral opportunities.” Ante, at 24. Would that discovery
matter? Our precedent says no, so long as Arizona had a
compelling interest in eliminating political corruption
(which it clearly did). In these circumstances, any interest
of the State in “leveling” should be irrelevant. That inter
est could not support Arizona’s law (assuming the law
burdened speech), but neither would the interest invali
date the legislation.
To see the point, consider how the matter might arise.
