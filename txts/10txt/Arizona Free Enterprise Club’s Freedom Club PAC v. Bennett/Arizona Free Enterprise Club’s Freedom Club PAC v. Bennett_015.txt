Opinion of the Court

United, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 57).
At the same time, we have subjected strictures on
campaign-related speech that we have found less onerous to a
lower level of scrutiny and upheld those restrictions. For
example, after finding that the restriction at issue was
“closely drawn” to serve a “sufficiently important interest,”
see, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S.
93, 136 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); Nixon
v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 387–
388 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), we have
upheld government-imposed limits on contributions to can
didates, Buckley, supra, at 23–35, caps on coordinated
party expenditures, Federal Election Comm’n v. Colorado
Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 437
(2001) (Colorado II), and requirements that political fund

Although the speech of the candidates and independent
expenditure groups that brought this suit is not directly
capped by Arizona’s matching funds provision, those par

burdened by the state law in the same way that speech
was burdened by the law we recently found invalid in

In Davis, we considered a First Amendment challenge to
the so-called “Millionaire’s Amendment” of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, 2 U. S. C. §441a–1(a).
Under that Amendment, if a candidate for the
United States House of Representatives spent more than
$350,000 of his personal funds, “a new, asymmetrical
regulatory scheme [came] into play.” 554 U. S., at 729.
The opponent of the candidate who exceeded that limit
was permitted to collect individual contributions up to
$6,900 per contributor—three times the normal contribu
tion limit of $2,300. See ibid. The candidate who spent
more than the personal funds limit remained subject to
