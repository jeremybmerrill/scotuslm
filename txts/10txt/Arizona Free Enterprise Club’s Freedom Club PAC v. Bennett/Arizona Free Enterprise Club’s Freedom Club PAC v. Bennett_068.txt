ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM 

CLUB PAC v. BENNETT

KAGAN, J., dissenting 


Less corruption, more speech. Robust campaigns leading
to the election of representatives not beholden to the few,
but accountable to the many. The people of Arizona might
have expected a decent respect for those objectives.
Today, they do not get it. The Court invalidates Arizo
nans’ efforts to ensure that in their State, “ ‘[t]he people
. . . possess the absolute sovereignty.’ ” Id., at 274 (quoting
James Madison in 4 Elliot’s Debates on the Federal Con
stitution 569–570 (1876)). No precedent compels the
Court to take this step; to the contrary, today’s decision is
in tension with broad swaths of our First Amendment
doctrine. No fundamental principle of our Constitution
backs the Court’s ruling; to the contrary, it is the law
struck down today that fostered both the vigorous compe
tition of ideas and its ultimate object—a government
responsive to the will of the people. Arizonans deserve
better. Like citizens across this country, Arizonans de
serve a government that represents and serves them all.
And no less, Arizonans deserve the chance to reform their
electoral system so as to attain that most American of
goals.
Truly, democracy is not a game. See ante, at 25. I
respectfully dissent.
