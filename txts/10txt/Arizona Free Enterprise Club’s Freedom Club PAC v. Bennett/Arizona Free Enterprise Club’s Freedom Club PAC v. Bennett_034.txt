ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM 

CLUB PAC v. BENNETT

Opinion of the Court 


necessary to allow it to “find[ ] the sweet-spot” and “fine
tun[e]” its public funding system, post, at 26 (KAGAN, J.,
dissenting), to achieve its desired level of participation
without an undue drain on public resources, is not a suffi
cient justification for the burden.
The flaw in the State’s argument is apparent in what its
reasoning would allow. By the State’s logic it could grant
a publicly funded candidate five dollars in matching funds
for every dollar his privately financed opponent spent, or
force candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a
$10,000 fine in order to encourage participation in the
public funding regime. Such measures might well pro
mote participation in public financing, but would clearly
suppress or unacceptably alter political speech. How the
State chooses to encourage participation in its public
funding system matters, and we have never held that
a State may burden political speech—to the extent the
matching funds provision does—to ensure adequate par
ticipation in a public funding system. Here the State’s
chosen method is unduly burdensome and not sufficiently
justified to survive First Amendment scrutiny.
III
We do not today call into question the wisdom of public
financing as a means of funding political candidacy. That
is not our business. But determining whether laws gov
erning campaign finance violate the First Amendment is
very much our business. In carrying out that responsibil
ity over the past 35 years, we have upheld some restric
tions on speech and struck down others. See, e.g., Buckley,
supra, at 35–38, 51–54 (upholding contribution limits and
striking down expenditure limits); Colorado I, 518 U. S.,
at 608 (opinion of BREYER, J.) (invalidating ban on inde
pendent expenditures for electioneering communication);
Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 437 (upholding caps on coordi
nated party expenditures); Davis, 554 U. S., at 736 (in
