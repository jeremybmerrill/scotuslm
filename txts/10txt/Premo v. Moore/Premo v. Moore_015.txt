PREMO v. MOORE
Opinion of the Court

incorporated into the Strickland performance inquiry.
A state-court adjudication of the performance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment cannot be “contrary to”
Fulminante, for Fulminante—which involved the admis­
sion of an involuntary confession in violation of the Fifth
Amendment—says nothing about the Strickland standard
of effectiveness. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 694
(2002) (“A federal habeas court may issue the writ under
the ‘contrary to’ clause if the state court applies a rule
different from the governing law set forth in our cases, or
if it decides a case differently than we have done on a set
of materially indistinguishable facts”). The Fulminante
prejudice inquiry presumes a constitutional violation,
whereas Strickland seeks to define one. The state court
accepted counsel’s view that seeking to suppress Moore’s
second confession would have been “fruitless.” It would
not have been unreasonable to conclude that counsel could
incorporate that view into his assessment of a plea offer, a
subject with which Fulminante is in no way concerned.
A finding of constitutionally adequate performance
under Strickland cannot be contrary to Fulminante. The
state court likely reached the correct result under Strick
land. And under §2254(d), that it reached a reasonable
one is sufficient. See Richter, ante, at 19.

The Court of Appeals further concluded that it would
have been unreasonable for the state postconviction court
to have found no prejudice in counsel’s failure to suppress
Moore’s confession to police. To prevail on prejudice before
the state court Moore had to demonstrate “a reasonable
probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not
have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to
trial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59 (1985).
Deference to the state court’s prejudice determination is
all the more significant in light of the uncertainty inherent
