PREMO v. MOORE
Opinion of the Court

serve. Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689–690. Even under
de novo review, the standard for judging counsel’s
representation is a most deferential one. Unlike a
later reviewing court, the attorney observed the rele­
vant proceedings, knew of materials outside the re­
cord, and interacted with the client, with opposing
counsel, and with the judge. It is ‘all too tempting’ to
‘second-guess counsel’s assistance after conviction or
adverse sentence.’ Id., at 689; see also Bell v. Cone,
535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506
U. S. 364, 372 (1993). The question is whether an at­
torney’s representation amounted to incompetence
under ‘prevailing professional norms,’ not whether it
deviated from best practices or most common custom.
Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690.
“Establishing that a state court’s application of
Strickland was unreasonable under §2254(d) is all the
more difficult. The standards created by Strickland
and §2254(d) are both ‘highly deferential,’ id., at 689;
Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and
when the two apply in tandem, review is ‘doubly’ so,
Knowles, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Strick
land standard is a general one, so the range of rea­
sonable applications is substantial. 556 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 11). Federal habeas courts must guard
against the danger of equating unreasonableness un­
der Strickland with unreasonableness under §2254(d).
When §2254(d) applies, the question is not whether
counsel’s actions were reasonable. The question is
whether there is any reasonable argument that coun­
sel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.”

The question becomes whether Moore’s counsel provided
ineffective assistance by failing to seek suppression of
Moore’s confession to police before advising Moore regard­
