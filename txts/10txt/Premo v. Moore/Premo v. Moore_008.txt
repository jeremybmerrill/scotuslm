Opinion of the Court

ante, at 11. The applicable federal law consists of the
rules for determining when a criminal defendant has
received inadequate representation as defined in Strick
land.
To establish ineffective assistance of counsel “a defen­
dant must show both deficient performance by counsel and
prejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 10). In addressing this standard and its

at 14–16, gives the following explanation:
“To establish deficient performance, a person chal­

pretrial proceedings], and so the Strickland standard
must be applied with scrupulous care, lest ‘intrusive
post-trial inquiry’ threaten the integrity of the very
adversary process the right to counsel is meant to
