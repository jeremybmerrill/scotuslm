PREMO v. MOORE
Opinion of the Court

forecloses relief under AEDPA.
IV
There are certain differences between inadequate assis­
tance of counsel claims in cases where there was a full
trial on the merits and those, like this one, where a plea
was entered even before the prosecution decided upon all
of the charges. A trial provides the full written record and
factual background that serve to limit and clarify some of
the choices counsel made. Still, hindsight cannot suffice
for relief when counsel’s choices were reasonable and
legitimate based on predictions of how the trial would
proceed. See Richter, ante, at 18.
Hindsight and second guesses are also inappropriate,
and often more so, where a plea has been entered without
a full trial or, as in this case, even before the prosecution
decided on the charges. The added uncertainty that re­
sults when there is no extended, formal record and no
actual history to show how the charges have played out at
trial works against the party alleging inadequate assis­
tance. Counsel, too, faced that uncertainty. There is a
most substantial burden on the claimant to show ineffec­
tive assistance. The plea process brings to the criminal
justice system a stability and a certainty that must not be
undermined by the prospect of collateral challenges in
cases not only where witnesses and evidence have disap­
peared, but also in cases where witnesses and evidence
were not presented in the first place. The substantial
burden to show ineffective assistance of counsel, the bur­
den the claimant must meet to avoid the plea, has not
been met in this case.
The state postconviction court’s decision involved no
unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.
Because the Court of Appeals erred in finding otherwise,
its judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
