PREMO v. MOORE
Opinion of the Court

for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Moore v. Czerniak, 574
F. 3d 1092 (2009). In its view the state court’s conclusion
that counsel’s action did not constitute ineffective assis­
tance was an unreasonable application of clearly estab­
lished law in light of Strickland and was contrary to
Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991). Six judges
dissented from denial of rehearing en banc. 574 F. 3d, at
1162.
We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).

The statutory authority of federal courts to issue habeas
corpus relief for persons in state custody is defined by 28
U. S. C. §2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The text of
§2254(d) states:
“An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf
of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a
State court shall not be granted with respect to any
claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State
court proceedings unless the adjudication of the
claim—
“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab­
lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States; or
“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un­
reasonable determination of the facts in light of the
evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”
AEDPA prohibits federal habeas relief for any claim
adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless one of the
exceptions listed in §2254(d) obtains. Relevant here is
§2254(d)(1)’s exception “permitting relitigation where the
earlier state decision resulted from an ‘unreasonable
application of’ clearly established federal law.” Richter,
