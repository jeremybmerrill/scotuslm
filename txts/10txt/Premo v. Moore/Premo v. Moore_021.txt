PENITENTIARY, PETITIONER v. RANDY 

JOSEPH MOORE 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 19, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in the judgment.
To prevail under the prejudice requirement of Strick
land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984), a petitioner
for federal habeas corpus relief must demonstrate “a
reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he
would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on
going to trial,” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59 (1985).
As Moore’s counsel confirmed at oral argument, see Tr. of
Oral Arg. 32, Moore never declared that, better informed,
he would have resisted the plea bargain and opted for
trial. For that reason, I concur in the Court’s judgment.
