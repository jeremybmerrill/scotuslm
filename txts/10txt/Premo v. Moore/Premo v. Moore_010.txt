Opinion of the Court

ing the plea. Finding that any “motion to suppress would
have been fruitless,” the state postconviction court con­
cluded that Moore had not received ineffective assistance
of counsel. App. 140. The state court did not specify
whether this was because there was no deficient perform­
ance under Strickland or because Moore suffered no
Strickland prejudice, or both. To overcome the limitation
imposed by § 2254(d), the Court of Appeals had to con­
clude that both findings would have involved an unrea­

Richter, ante, at 19–20. In finding that this standard was
met, the Court of Appeals erred, for the state-court deci­
sion was not an unreasonable application of either part of

The Court of Appeals was wrong to accord scant defer­
ence to counsel’s judgment, and doubly wrong to conclude
it would have been unreasonable to find that the defense
attorney qualified as counsel for Sixth Amendment pur­

466 U. S., at 687. Counsel gave this explanation for his
decision to discuss the plea bargain without first challeng­
ing Moore’s confession to the police: that suppression
would serve little purpose in light of Moore’s other full and
admissible confession, to which both his brother and his
accomplice’s girlfriend could testify. The state court would
not have been unreasonable to accept this explanation.
Counsel also justified his decision by asserting that any
motion to suppress was likely to fail. Reviewing the rea­
sonableness of that justification is complicated by the
possibility that petitioner forfeited one argument that
would have supported its position: The Court of Appeals
assumed that a motion would have succeeded because the
warden did not argue otherwise. Of course that is not the
same as a concession that no competent attorney would
