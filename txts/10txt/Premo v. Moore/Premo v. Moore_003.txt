Syllabus
formance under the Sixth Amendment cannot be “contrary to” Ful
minante, for Fulminante—which involved the admission of an invol
untary confession in violation of the Fifth Amendment—says nothing
about Strickland’s effectiveness standard. Pp. 6–12.
(2) The state court also reasonably could have concluded that
Moore was not prejudiced by counsel’s actions. To prevail in state
court, he had to demonstrate “a reasonable probability that, but for
counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have in
sisted on going to trial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59. Deference
to the state court’s prejudice determination is significant, given the
uncertainty inherent in plea negotiations. That court reasonably
could have determined that Moore would have accepted the plea
agreement even if his second confession had been ruled inadmissible.
The State’s case was already formidable with two witnesses to an
admissible confession, and it could have become stronger had the in
vestigation continued. Moore also faced the possibility of grave pun
ishments. Counsel’s bargain for the minimum sentence for the crime
of conviction was thus favorable, and forgoing a challenge to the con
fession may have been essential to securing that agreement. Again,
the state court’s finding could not be contrary to Fulminante, which
does not speak to Strickland’s prejudice standard or contemplate
prejudice in the plea bargain context. To the extent Fulminante’s
harmless-error analysis sheds any light on this case, it suggests that
the state court’s prejudice determination was reasonable. Pp. 12–16.
