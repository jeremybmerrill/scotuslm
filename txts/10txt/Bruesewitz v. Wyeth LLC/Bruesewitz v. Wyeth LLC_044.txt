SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

“unavoidable” for purposes of §22(b)(1) only where there is
no feasible alternative design that would eliminate the
side effect of the vaccine without compromising its cost
and utility. See supra, at 7. The majority’s premise—that
side effects stemming from a vaccine’s design are always
avoidable—is thus belied by the statutory text and legisla
tive history of §22(b)(1). And because its starting premise
is invalid, its conclusion—that the design of a vaccine is
not subject to challenge in a tort action—is also necessar
ily invalid.
The majority’s reading suffers from an even more fun
damental defect. If Congress intended to exempt vaccine
manufacturers categorically from all design defect liabil
ity, it more logically would have provided: “No vaccine
manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages
arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated
with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988,
if the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied
by proper directions and warnings.” There would have
been no need for Congress to include the additional 13
words “the injury or death resulted from side effects that
were unavoidable even though.” See TRW Inc. v. An
drews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) (noting “cardinal principle
of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the
whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no
clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or
insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
In Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005),
this Court considered an analogous situation where an
express pre-emption provision stated that certain States
“ ‘shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements
for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from
those required under this subchapter.’ ” Id., at 436 (quot
ing 7 U. S. C. §136v(b) (2000 ed.)). The Bates Court
