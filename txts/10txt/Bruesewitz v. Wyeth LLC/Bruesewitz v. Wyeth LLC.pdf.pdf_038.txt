SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

comment k had long required manufacturers invoking
the defense to demonstrate that their products were not
only “unavoidably unsafe” but also properly manufactured
and labeled.7 By requiring “prope[r] prepar[ation]” and
“proper directions and warnings” in §22(b)(1), Congress
plainly intended to incorporate these additional comment
k requirements.
The 1986 Report thus confirms petitioners’ interpreta
tion of §22(b)(1). The Report makes clear that “side effects
that were unavoidable” in §22(b)(1) refers to side effects
stemming from a vaccine’s design that were “unavoidable.”
By explaining what Congress meant by the term “un
avoidable,” moreover, the Report also confirms that
whether a side effect is “unavoidable” for purposes of
§22(b)(1) involves a specific inquiry in each case as to
whether the vaccine “in the present state of human skill
and knowledge cannot be made safe,” 1986 Report 26—i.e.,
whether a feasible alternative design existed that would
have eliminated the adverse side effects of the vaccine
without compromising its cost and utility. See Brief for
Kenneth W. Starr et al. as Amici Curiae 14–15 (“If a par
ticular plaintiff could show that her injury at issue was
avoidable . . . through the use of a feasible alternative
design for a specific vaccine, then she would satisfy the
plain language of the statute, because she would have
demonstrated that the side effects were not unavoidable”).
Finally, the Report confirms that the “even though” clause
is properly read to establish two additional prerequisites—
proper manufacturing and proper labeling—to qualify for
——————
sion that “unavoidable” is a term of art.
