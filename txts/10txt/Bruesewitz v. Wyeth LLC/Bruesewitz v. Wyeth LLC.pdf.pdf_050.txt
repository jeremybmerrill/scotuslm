longstanding, traditional category of state tort law, but
rather, that Congress intended to leave the status quo
alone (except, of course, with respect to those aspects of

Report 691 (“It is not the Committee’s intention to pre

and the Vaccine Act “provides other means for achieving

the majority’s position elides a significant difference be
tween state tort law and the federal regulatory scheme.
Although the Vaccine Act charges the Secretary of Health
and Human Services with the obligation to “promote the
development of childhood vaccines” and “make or assure
improvements in . . . vaccines, and research on vaccines,”
§300aa–27(a), neither the Act nor any other provision of
federal law places a legal duty on vaccine manufacturers
to improve the design of their vaccines to account for
scientific and technological advances. Indeed, the FDA
does not condition approval of a vaccine on it being the
most optimally designed among reasonably available
alternatives, nor does it (or any other federal entity) en
sure that licensed vaccines keep pace with technological
and scientific advances.19 Rather, the function of ensuring
