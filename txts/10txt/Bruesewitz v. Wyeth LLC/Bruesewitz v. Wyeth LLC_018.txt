Opinion of the Court

cacy testing.59 The Act requires vaccine manufacturers
and health-care providers to report adverse side effects,60
and provides for monitoring of vaccine safety through a
collaboration with eight managed-care organizations.61
And of course whenever the FDA concludes that a vaccine
is unsafe, it may revoke the license.62
These provisions for federal agency improvement of
vaccine design, and for federally prescribed compensation,
once again suggest that §300aa–22(b)(1)’s silence regard
ing design-defect liability was not inadvertent. It instead
reflects a sensible choice to leave complex epidemiological
judgments about vaccine design to the FDA and the Na

the same conclusion: The vaccine manufacturers fund

63 The dissent quotes just part of this sentence, to make it appear that
we believe complex epidemiological judgments ought to be assigned in
that fashion. See post, at 26. We do not state our preference, but
merely note that it is Congress’s expressed preference—and in order to
preclude the argument that it is absurd to think Congress enacted such
a thing, we assert that the choice is reasonable and express some of the
reasons why. Leaving it to the jury may (or may not) be reasonable as
well; we express no view.

3784. The dissent’s unsupported speculation that demand in the
vaccine market is inelastic, see post, at 24, n. 22, sheds no light on
whether Congress regarded the tax as a quid pro quo, most Members of
Congress being neither professional economists nor law-and-economics
scholars.
