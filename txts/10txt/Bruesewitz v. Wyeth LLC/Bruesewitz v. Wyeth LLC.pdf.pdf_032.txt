SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

§22(b)(1) applies only where neither kind of defect is pre
sent. Because §22(b)(1) is invoked by vaccine manufactur
ers as a defense to tort liability, it follows that the “even
though” clause requires a vaccine manufacturer in each
civil action to demonstrate that its vaccine is free from
manufacturing and labeling defects to fall within the
liability exemption of §22(b)(1).2
Given that the “even though” clause requires the ab
sence of manufacturing and labeling defects, the “if ”
clause’s reference to “side effects that were unavoidable”
must refer to side effects caused by something other than
manufacturing and labeling defects. The only remaining
kind of product defect recognized under traditional prod
ucts liability law is a design defect. Thus, “side effects
that were unavoidable” must refer to side effects caused by
a vaccine’s design that were “unavoidable.” Because
§22(b)(1) uses the conditional term “if,” moreover, the text
plainly implies that some side effects stemming from a
vaccine’s design are “unavoidable,” while others are avoid
able. See Webster’s Third New International Dictionary
1124 (2002) (“if ” means “in the event that,” “so long as,” or
“on condition that”). Accordingly, because the “if ” clause
(like the “even though” clause) sets forth a condition to
invoke §22(b)(1)’s defense to tort liability, Congress must
also have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate
in each civil action that the particular side effects of a
vaccine’s design were “unavoidable.”
Congress’ use of conditional “if” clauses in two other
provisions of the Vaccine Act supports the conclusion that
§22(b)(1) requires an inquiry in each case in which a
manufacturer seeks to invoke the provision’s exception to
