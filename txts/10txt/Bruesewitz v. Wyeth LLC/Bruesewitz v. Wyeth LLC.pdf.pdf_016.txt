Opinion of the Court

III
The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in
general reinforces what the text of §300aa–22(b)(1) sug
gests. A vaccine’s license spells out the manufacturing
method that must be followed and the directions and
warnings that must accompany the product.50 Manufac
turers ordinarily must obtain the Food and Drug Admini
stration’s (FDA) approval before modifying either.51 De
viations from the license thus provide objective evidence of
manufacturing defects or inadequate warnings. Further
objective evidence comes from the FDA’s regulations—
more than 90 of them52—that pervasively regulate the
manufacturing process, down to the requirements for
plumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing
facility.53 Material noncompliance with any one of them,
or with any other FDA regulation, could cost the manufac
turer its regulatory-compliance defense.54
Design defects, in contrast, do not merit a single men
tion in the NCVIA or the FDA’s regulations. Indeed, the
FDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria
it uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for
its intended use.55 And the decision is surely not an easy
one. Drug manufacturers often could trade a little less
efficacy for a little more safety, but the safest design is not
always the best one. Striking the right balance between
safety and efficacy is especially difficult with respect to
vaccines, which affect public as well as individual health.
Yet the Act, which in every other respect micromanages
manufacturers, is silent on how to evaluate competing
designs. Are manufacturers liable only for failing to em
