Opinion of the Court

syllogism ignores unhelpful statements in the Report and
relies upon a term of art that did not exist in 1986.
Immediately after the language quoted by the dissent,
the 1986 Report notes the difficulty a jury would have in
faithfully assessing whether a feasible alternative design
exists when an innocent “young child, often badly injured
or killed” is the plaintiff.69 Eliminating that concern is
why the Report’s authors “strongly believ[e] that Com
ment k is appropriate and necessary as the policy for civil
actions seeking damages in tort.”70 The dissent’s interpre
tation of §300aa–22(b)(1) and its version of “the principle
in Comment K” adopted by the 1986 Report leave that
concern unaddressed.
The dissent buries another unfavorable piece of legisla
tive history. Because the Report believes that §300aa–
22(b)(1) should incorporate “the principle in Comment K”
and because the Act provides a generous no-fault compen
sation scheme, the Report counsels injured parties who
cannot prove a manufacturing or labeling defect to “pursue
recompense in the compensation system, not the tort
system.”71 That counsel echoes our interpretation of
§300aa–22(b)(1).
Not to worry, the dissent retorts, a Committee Report by
a later Congress “authoritative[ly]” vindicates its interpre
tation.72 Post-enactment legislative history (a contradic
tion in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpre
tation. See Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 238

Report, at 26; see ibid. (“[E]ven if the defendant manufacturer
may have made as safe a vaccine as anyone reasonably could expect, a
court or jury undoubtedly will find it difficult to rule in favor of the
‘innocent’ manufacturer if the equally ‘innocent’ child has to bear the
risk of loss with no other possibility of recompense”).

72 Post, at 12. This is a courageous adverb since we have previously
held that the only authoritative source of statutory meaning is the text
that has passed through the Article I process. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v.
Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005).
