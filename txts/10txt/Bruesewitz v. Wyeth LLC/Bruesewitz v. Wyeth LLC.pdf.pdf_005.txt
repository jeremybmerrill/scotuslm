BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
Opinion of the Court

cines became, one might say, victims of their own success.
They had been so effective in preventing infectious dis
eases that the public became much less alarmed at the
threat of those diseases,4 and much more concerned with
the risk of injury from the vaccines themselves.5
Much of the concern centered around vaccines against
diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), which were
blamed for children’s disabilities and developmental de
lays. This led to a massive increase in vaccine-related tort
litigation. Whereas between 1978 and 1981 only nine
product-liability suits were filed against DTP manufactur
ers, by the mid-1980’s the suits numbered more than 200
each year.6 This destabilized the DTP vaccine market,
causing two of the three domestic manufacturers to with
draw; and the remaining manufacturer, Lederle Laborato
ries, estimated that its potential tort liability exceeded its
annual sales by a factor of 200.7 Vaccine shortages arose
when Lederle had production problems in 1984.8
Despite the large number of suits, there were many
complaints that obtaining compensation for legitimate
vaccine-inflicted injuries was too costly and difficult.9 A
