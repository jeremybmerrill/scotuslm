BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

gress’ expressed intent to codify the “principle in Comment
K,” 1986 Report 26, the term “unavoidable” in §22(b)(1) is
best understood as a term of art, which incorporates the
commonly understood meaning of “unavoidably unsafe”
products under comment k at the time of the Act’s enact
ment in 1986. See McDermott Int’l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498
U. S. 337, 342 (1991) (“[W]e assume that when a statute
uses . . . a term [of art], Congress intended it to have its
established meaning”); Morissette v. United States, 342
U. S. 246, 263 (1952) (same).6 Similarly, courts applying

122 (Colo. 1983) (“[A]pplicability of comment k . . . depends upon the co
existence of several factors,” including that “the product’s benefits must
not be achievable in another manner; and the risk must be unavoidable
under the present state of knowledge”); see also 1 L. Frumer & M.
Friedman, Products Liability §§8.07[1]–[2], pp. 8–277 to 8–278 (2010)
(comment k applies “only to defects in design,” and there “must be no
feasible alternative design which on balance accomplishes the subject
product’s purpose with a lesser risk” (internal quotation marks omit
ted)). To be sure, a number of courts at the time of the Vaccine Act’s
enactment had interpreted comment k to preclude design defect claims
categorically for certain kinds of products, see Hill v. Searle Labs., 884
F. 2d 1064, 1068 (CA8 1989) (collecting cases), but as indicated by the
sources cited above, the courts that had construed comment k to apply
on a case-specific basis generally agreed on the basic elements of what
constituted an “unavoidably unsafe” product. See also n. 8, infra. The
majority’s suggestion that “judges who must rule on motions to dismiss,
motions for summary judgment, and motions for judgment as a matter
of law” are incapable of adjudicating claims alleging “unavoidable” side
effects, ante, at 7–8, n. 35, is thus belied by the experience of the many
courts that had adjudicated such claims for years by the time of the
Vaccine Act’s enactment.
6 The majority refuses to recognize that “unavoidable” is a term of art
derived from comment k, suggesting that “ ‘[u]navoidable’ is hardly a
rarely used word.” Ante, at 10. In fact, however, “unavoidable” is an
extremely rare word in the relevant context. It appears exactly once
(i.e., in §300aa–22(b)(1)) in the entirety of Title 42 of the U. S. Code
(“Public Health and Welfare”), which governs, inter alia, Social Secu
rity, see 42 U. S. C. §301 et seq., Medicare, see §1395 et seq., and several
other of the Federal Government’s largest entitlement programs. The
singular rarity in which Congress used the term supports the conclu
