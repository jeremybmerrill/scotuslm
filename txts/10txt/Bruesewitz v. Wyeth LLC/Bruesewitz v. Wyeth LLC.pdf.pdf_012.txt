Opinion of the Court

others are avoidable.”38 That is not so. The “if ” clause
makes total sense whether the design to which “unavoid
able” refers is (as the dissent believes) any feasible design
(making the side effects of the design used for the vaccine
at issue avoidable), or (as we believe) the particular design
used for the vaccine at issue (making its side effects un

properly labeled and manufactured; and under the former,
that it have been properly designed, labeled, and manufac

Which of the two variants must be preferred is addressed
by our textual analysis, and is in no way determined by
the “if ” clause.
Petitioners’ and the dissent’s textual argument also
rests upon the proposition that the word “unavoidable” in
§300aa–22(b)(1) is a term of art that incorporates com
ment k to Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A (1963–
1964).39 The Restatement generally holds a manufacturer
strictly liable for harm to person or property caused by
“any product in a defective condition unreasonably dan
gerous to the user.”40 Comment k exempts from this
strict-liability rule “unavoidably unsafe products.” An
unavoidably unsafe product is defined by a hodge-podge of
criteria and a few examples, such as the Pasteur rabies
vaccine and experimental pharmaceuticals. Despite this
lack of clarity, petitioners seize upon one phrase in the
comment k analysis, and assert that by 1986 a majority of
courts had made this a sine qua non requirement for an
“unavoidably unsafe product”: a case-specific showing that
the product was “quite incapable of being made safer for
