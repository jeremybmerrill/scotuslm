ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[February 22, 2011] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
joins, dissenting.
Vaccine manufacturers have long been subject to a legal
duty, rooted in basic principles of products liability law, to
improve the designs of their vaccines in light of advances
in science and technology. Until today, that duty was
enforceable through a traditional state-law tort action for
defective design. In holding that §22(b)(1) of the National
Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Vaccine Act or Act),
42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1), pre-empts all design defect
claims for injuries stemming from vaccines covered under
the Act, the Court imposes its own bare policy preference
over the considered judgment of Congress. In doing so,
the Court excises 13 words from the statutory text, mis
construes the Act’s legislative history, and disturbs the
careful balance Congress struck between compensating
vaccine-injured children and stabilizing the childhood
vaccine market. Its decision leaves a regulatory vacuum
in which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers ade
quately take account of scientific and technological ad
vancements when designing or distributing their products.
Because nothing in the text, structure, or legislative his
tory of the Vaccine Act remotely suggests that Congress
intended such a result, I respectfully dissent.
