SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

The majority also suggests that if Congress wished to
preserve design defect claims, it could have simply pro
vided that manufacturers would be liable for “defective
manufacture, defective directions or warning, and defec
tive design.” Ante, at 8 (internal quotation marks omit
ted). Putting aside the fact that §22(a) already preserves
design defect claims (to the extent §22(b)(1) does not ap
ply), the majority’s proposed solution would not have fully
effectuated Congress’ intent. As the legislative history
makes clear, Congress used the term “unavoidable” to
effectuate its intent that the “principle in Comment K
regarding ‘unavoidably unsafe’ products . . . apply to the
vaccines covered in the bill.” 1986 Report 26; see also
1987 Report 691. At the time of the Vaccine Act’s enact
ment in 1986, at least one State had expressly rejected
comment k,16 while many others had not addressed the
applicability of comment k specifically to vaccines or ap
plied comment k to civil actions proceeding on a theory
other than strict liability (e.g., negligence17). A statute

an express saving clause in the same statutory section, see 42 U. S. C.
§300aa–22(a), and its use of the conditional “if” clause in defining the
pre-emptive scope of the provision. See Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC,
544 U. S. 431, 449 (2005) (“In areas of traditional state regulation, we
assume that a federal statute has not supplanted state law unless
Congress has made such an intention clear and manifest” (internal
quotation marks omitted)).
16 See Collins v. Eli Lilly Co., 116 Wis. 2d 166, 197, 342 N. W. 2d 37,
52 (1984) (“We conclude that the rule embodied in comment k is too
restrictive and, therefore, not commensurate with strict products
liability law in Wisconsin”). Collins did, however, “recognize that in
some exigent circumstances it may be necessary to place a drug on the
market before adequate testing can be done.” Ibid. It thus adopted a
narrower defense (based on “exigent circumstances”) than that recog
nized in other jurisdictions that had expressly adopted comment k.

exempts the product from a strict liability design defect analysis; a
plaintiff remains free to pursue his design defect theory on the basis of
