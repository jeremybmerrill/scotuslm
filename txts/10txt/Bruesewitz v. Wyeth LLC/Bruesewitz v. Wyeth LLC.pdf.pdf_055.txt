BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

because they provide injured persons with significant
procedural tools—including, most importantly, civil dis
covery—that are not available in administrative proceed
ings under the compensation program. See §§300aa–
12(d)(2)(E), (d)(3). Congress thus clearly believed there
was still an important function to be played by state tort
law.
Instead of eliminating design defect liability entirely,
Congress enacted numerous measures to reduce manufac
turers’ liability exposure, including a limited regulatory
compliance presumption of adequate warnings, see
§300aa–22(b)(2), elimination of claims based on failure
to provide direct warnings to patients, §300aa–22(c), a
heightened standard for punitive damages, §300aa–
23(d)(2), and, of course, immunity from damages for “un
avoidable” side effects, §300aa–22(b)(1). Considered in
light of the Vaccine Act as a whole, §22(b)(1)’s exemption
from liability for unavoidably unsafe vaccines is just one
part of a broader statutory scheme that reflects Congress’
careful balance between providing adequate compensation
for vaccine-injured children and conferring substantial
benefits on vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable and
predictable childhood vaccine supply.
The majority’s decision today disturbs that careful
balance based on a bare policy preference that it is better
“to leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine
design to the FDA and the National Vaccine Program
rather than juries.” Ante, at 15.24 To be sure, reasonable
minds can disagree about the wisdom of having juries
weigh the relative costs and benefits of a particular vac
cine design. But whatever the merits of the majority’s
——————
JUSTICE BREYER’s separate concurrence is even more explicitly
policy driven, reflecting his own preference for the “more expert judg
ment” of federal agencies over the “less expert” judgment of juries.
Ante, at 5.
