Opinion of the Court

When “all (or nearly all) of the” relevant judicial decisions
have given a term or concept a consistent judicial gloss, we
presume Congress intended the term or concept to have
that meaning when it incorporated it into a later-enacted
statute. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)
(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg
ment) (slip op., at 5). The consistent gloss represents
the public understanding of the term. We cannot make the
same assumption when widespread disagreement exists
among the lower courts. We must make do with giving the
term its most plausible meaning using the traditional
tools of statutory interpretation. That is what we have
done today.

For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the National
Childhood Vaccine Injury Act preempts all design-defect
claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plain
tiffs who seek compensation for injury or death caused by
vaccine side effects. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
