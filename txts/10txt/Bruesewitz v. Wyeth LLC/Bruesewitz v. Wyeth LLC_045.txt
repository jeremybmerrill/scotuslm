BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

“Conspicuously absent from the submissions by [re
spondent] and the United States is any plausible al
ternative interpretation of ‘in addition to or different
from’ that would give that phrase meaning. Instead,
they appear to favor reading those words out of the
statute, which would leave the following: ‘Such State
shall not impose or continue in effect any require
ments for labeling or packaging.’ This amputated
version of [the statute] would no doubt have clearly
and succinctly commanded the pre-emption of all
state requirements concerning labeling. That Con
gress added the remainder of the provision is evidence
of its intent to draw a distinction between state label
ing requirements that are pre-empted and those that
are not.” 544 U. S., at 448–449.
As with the statutory interpretation rejected by this Court
in Bates, the majority’s interpretation of §22(b)(1) func

key term “unavoidable.” See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S.
167, 174 (2001) (“We are especially unwilling” to treat a
statutory term as surplusage “when the term occupies so
pivotal a place in the statutory scheme”). Although the
resulting “amputated version” of the statutory provision
“would no doubt have clearly and succinctly commanded
the pre-emption of all state” design defect claims, the fact
“[t]hat Congress added the remainder of the provision” is
strong evidence of its intent not to pre-empt design defect
claims categorically. Bates, 544 U. S., at 449; see also
American Home Prods. Corp. v. Ferrari, 284 Ga. 384, 393,
668 S. E. 2d 236, 242 (2008) (“ ‘If Congress had intended to
deprive injured parties of a long available form of compen
sation, it surely would have expressed that intent more
clearly’ ” (quoting Bates, 544 U. S., at 449)), cert. pending,
No. 08–1120.
Strikingly, the majority concedes that its interpretation
