BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
Opinion of the Court

ploy an alternative design that the FDA has approved for
distribution (an approval it takes years to obtain56)? Or
does it suffice that a vaccine design has been approved in
other countries? Or could there be liability for failure to
use a design that exists only in a lab? Neither the Act nor
the FDA regulations provide an answer, leaving the uni
verse of alternative designs to be limited only by an ex
pert’s imagination.
Jurors, of course, often decide similar questions with
little guidance, and we do not suggest that the absence
of guidance alone suggests preemption. But the lack of
guidance for design defects combined with the extensive guidance for the two grounds of liability specifically
mentioned in the Act strongly suggests that design defects
were not mentioned because they are not a basis for
liability.
The mandates contained in the Act lead to the same
conclusion. Design-defect torts, broadly speaking, have
two beneficial effects: (1) prompting the development of
improved designs, and (2) providing compensation for
inflicted injuries. The NCVIA provides other means for
achieving both effects. We have already discussed the
Act’s generous compensation scheme. And the Act pro
vides many means of improving vaccine design. It directs
the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote
“the development of childhood vaccines that result in
fewer and less serious adverse reactions.”57 It establishes
a National Vaccine Program, whose Director is “to achieve
optimal prevention of human infectious diseases . . . and to
achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions.”58
The Program is to set priorities for federal vaccine re
search, and to coordinate federal vaccine safety and effi
