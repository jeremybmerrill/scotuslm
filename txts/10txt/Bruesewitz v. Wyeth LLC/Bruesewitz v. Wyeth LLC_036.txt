SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

“[s]ince the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadful
death, both the marketing and the use of the vaccine are
fully justified, notwithstanding the unavoidable high
degree of risk which they involve.” Id., at 353. Comment
k thus provides that “seller[s]” of “[u]navoidably unsafe”
products are “not to be held to strict liability” provided
that such products “are properly prepared and marketed,

As the 1986 Report explains, Congress intended that the
“principle in Comment K regarding ‘unavoidably unsafe’
products” apply to the vaccines covered in the bill. 1986
Report 26. That intent, in turn, is manifested in the plain
text of §22(b)(1)—in particular, Congress’ use of the word

and “accompanied by proper directions and warnings,”
