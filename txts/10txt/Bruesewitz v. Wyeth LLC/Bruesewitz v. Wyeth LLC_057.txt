BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

pre-empt all design defect claims against vaccine manu
facturers for covered vaccines, the majority’s decision
leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one—neither the
FDA nor any other federal agency, nor state and federal
juries—ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately
take account of scientific and technological advancements.
This concern is especially acute with respect to vaccines
that have already been released and marketed to the
public. Manufacturers, given the lack of robust competi
tion in the vaccine market, will often have little or no
incentive to improve the designs of vaccines that are al
ready generating significant profit margins. Nothing in
the text, structure, or legislative history remotely suggests
that Congress intended that result.
I respectfully dissent.
