BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
Opinion of the Court

(1999); United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 281–
282 (1947). Real (pre-enactment) legislative history is
persuasive to some because it is thought to shed light on
what legislators understood an ambiguous statutory text
to mean when they voted to enact it into law. See Exxon
Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568
(2005). But post-enactment legislative history by defini
tion “could have had no effect on the congressional vote,”
District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 605 (2008).
It does not matter that §300aa–22(b)(1) did not take
effect until the later Congress passed the excise tax that
funds the compensation scheme,73 and that the supposedly
dispositive Committee Report is attached to that funding
legislation.74 Those who voted on the relevant statutory
language were not necessarily the same persons who
crafted the statements in the later Committee Report; or if
they were did not necessarily have the same views at that
earlier time; and no one voting at that earlier time could
possibly have been informed by those later statements.
Permitting the legislative history of subsequent funding
legislation to alter the meaning of a statute would set a
dangerous precedent. Many provisions of federal law
depend on appropriations or include sunset provisions;75
they cannot be made the device for unenacted statutory
revision.
That brings us to the second flaw in the dissent’s syllo
gism: Comment k did not have a “commonly understood
meaning”76 in the mid-1980’s. Some courts thought it
required a case-specific showing that a product was “un
avoidably unsafe”; many others thought it categorically
exempted certain types of products from strict liability.77
