BREYER, J., concurring

in this country,” i.e., by “threaten[ing] a resurgence of the
very problems which . . . caused Congress to intervene” by
enacting this statute. AAP Brief 24 (internal quotation

I would give significant weight to the views of HHS.
The law charges HHS with responsibility for overseeing
vaccine production and safety. It is “likely to have a thor
ough understanding” of the complicated and technical
subject matter of immunization policy, and it is compara
tively more “qualified to comprehend the likely impact of
state requirements.” Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.,
Inc., 529 U. S. 861, 883 (2000) (internal quotation marks
omitted); see Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 506
(1996) (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) (the agency is in the best position to determine
“whether (or the extent to which) state requirements may
interfere with federal objectives”). HHS’s position is par
ticularly persuasive here because expert public health
organizations support its views and the matter concerns a
medical and scientific question of great importance: how
best to save the lives of children. See Skidmore v. Swift &
Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944).
In sum, congressional reports and history, the statute’s
basic purpose as revealed by that history, and the views of
the expert agency along with those of relevant medical and
scientific associations, all support the Court’s conclusions.
I consequently agree with the Court.
