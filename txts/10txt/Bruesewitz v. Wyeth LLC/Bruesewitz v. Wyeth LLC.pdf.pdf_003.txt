Syllabus
the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically men
tioned in the Act, strongly suggests that design defects were not men
tioned because they are not a basis for liability. The Act’s mandates
lead to the same conclusion. It provides for federal agency improve
ment of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation,
which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of de
sign-defect torts—prompting the development of improved designs,
and providing compensation for inflicted injuries. The Act’s struc
tural quid pro quo also leads to the same conclusion. The vaccine
manufacturers fund an informal, efficient compensation program for
vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the
occasional disproportionate jury verdict. Taxing their product to fund
the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design de
fect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax them back into the mar
ket. Pp. 13–16.
