BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

state tort liability. In §22(b)(2), Congress created a pre
sumption that, for purposes of §22(b)(1), “a vaccine shall
be presumed to be accompanied by proper directions and
warnings if the vaccine manufacturer shows that it com
plied in all material respects with” federal labeling re
quirements. 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(2). Similarly, in
§23(d)(2), Congress created an exemption from punitive
damages “[i]f . . . the manufacturer shows that it complied,
in all material respects,” with applicable federal laws,
unless it engages in “fraud,” “intentional and wrongful
withholding of information” from federal regulators, or
“other criminal or illegal activity.” §300aa–23(d)(2). It
would be highly anomalous for Congress to use a condi
tional “if ” clause in §§22(b)(2) and 23(d)(2) to require a
specific inquiry in each case while using the same condi
tional “if ” clause in §22(b)(1) to denote a categorical ex
emption from liability. Cf. Erlenbaugh v. United States,
409 U. S. 239, 243 (1972) (“[A] legislative body generally
uses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a
given context”).
Indeed, when Congress intends to pre-empt design
defect claims categorically, it does so using categorical
(e.g., “all”) and/or declarative language (e.g., “shall”),
rather than a conditional term (“if ”). For example, in
a related context, Congress has authorized the Secretary
of Health and Human Services to designate a vaccine
designed to prevent a pandemic or epidemic as a “covered
countermeasure.”
42 U. S. C. §§247d–6d(b), (i)(1),
(i)(7)(A)(i). With respect to such “covered countermea
sure[s],” Congress provided that subject to certain excep
tions, “a covered person shall be immune from suit and
liability under Federal and State law with respect to all
claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or
resulting from the administration to or the use by an
individual of a covered countermeasure,” §247d–6d(a)(1)
(emphasis added), including specifically claims relating to
