BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
Opinion of the Court

litigate. Taxing vaccine manufacturers’ product to fund
the compensation program, while leaving their liability for
design defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax
manufacturers back into the market.
The dissent believes the Act’s mandates are irrelevant
because they do not spur innovation in precisely the same
way as state-law tort systems.66 That is a novel sugges
tion. Although we previously have expressed doubt that
Congress would quietly preempt product-liability claims
without providing a federal substitute, see Medtronic, Inc.
v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 486–488 (1996) (plurality opinion),
we have never suggested we would be skeptical of preemp
tion unless the congressional substitute operated like the
tort system. We decline to adopt that stance today. The
dissent’s belief that the FDA and the National Vaccine
Program cannot alone spur adequate vaccine innovation is
probably questionable, but surely beside the point.

Since our interpretation of §300aa–22(b)(1) is the only
interpretation supported by the text and structure of the
NCVIA, even those of us who believe legislative history is
a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation have no need
to resort to it. In any case, the dissent’s contention that it
would contradict our conclusion is mistaken.
The dissent’s legislative history relies on the following
syllogism: A 1986 House Committee Report states that
§300aa–22(b)(1) “sets forth the principle contained in
Comment k of Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts
(Second);”67 in 1986 comment k was “commonly under
stood” to require a case-specific showing that “no feasible
alternative design” existed; Congress therefore must have
intended §300aa–22(b)(1) to require that showing.68 The
