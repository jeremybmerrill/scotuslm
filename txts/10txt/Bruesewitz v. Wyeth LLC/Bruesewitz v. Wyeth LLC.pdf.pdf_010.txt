Opinion of the Court

II 

A

We set forth again the statutory text at issue:
“No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac
tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury
or death associated with the administration of a vac
cine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death re
sulted from side effects that were unavoidable even
though the vaccine was properly prepared and was ac
companied by proper directions and warnings.”34
The “even though” clause clarifies the word that precedes
it. It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine
manufacturer must have taken for a side-effect to be con
sidered “unavoidable” under the statute. Provided that
there was proper manufacture and warning, any remain
ing side effects, including those resulting from design
defects, are deemed to have been unavoidable. State-law
design-defect claims are therefore preempted.
If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a
different design, the word “unavoidable” would do no
work. A side effect of a vaccine could always have been
avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not
containing the harmful element. The language of the
provision thus suggests that the design of the vaccine is a
given, not subject to question in the tort action. What the
statute establishes as a complete defense must be un
avoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) with
respect to the particular design. Which plainly implies
that the design itself is not open to question.35

U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1).
dissent advocates for another possibility: “[A] side effect is
‘unavoidable’ . . . where there is no feasible alternative design that
would eliminate the side effect of the vaccine without compromising its
cost and utility.” Post, at 15 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). The dissent
makes no effort to ground that position in the text of §300aa–22(b)(1).
