BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

I

A

Section 22 of the Vaccine Act provides “[s]tandards of
responsibility” to govern civil actions against vaccine
manufacturers. 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22. Section 22(a) sets
forth the “[g]eneral rule” that “State law shall apply to a
civil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related
injury or death.” §300aa–22(a). This baseline rule that
state law applies is subject to three narrow exceptions, one
of which, §22(b)(1), is at issue in this case. Section 22(b)(1)
provides:
“No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac
tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury
or death associated with the administration of a vac
cine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death re
sulted from side effects that were unavoidable even
though the vaccine was properly prepared and was
accompanied by proper directions and warnings.”
§300aa–22(b)(1).
The provision contains two key clauses: “if the injury or
death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable”
(the “if ” clause), and “even though the vaccine was prop
erly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions
and warnings” (the “even though” clause).
Blackletter products liability law generally recognizes
three different types of product defects: design defects,
manufacturing defects, and labeling defects (e.g., failure to
warn).1 The reference in the “even though” clause to a
“properly prepared” vaccine “accompanied by proper direc
tions and warnings” is an obvious reference to two such
defects—manufacturing and labeling defects. The plain
terms of the “even though” clause thus indicate that
