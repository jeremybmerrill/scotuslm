compensation system, not the tort system.” H. R. Rep.
No. 99–908, pt. 1, p. 24 (1986) (hereinafter H. R.
Rep.).
The Report lists two specific kinds of tort suits that the
clause does not pre-empt (suits based on improper manu
facturing and improper labeling), while going on to state
that compensation for other tort claims, e.g., design-defect
claims, lies in “the [NCVIA’s no-fault] compensation sys
tem, not the tort system.” Ibid.
The strongest contrary argument rests upon the Re
port’s earlier description of the statute as “set[ting] forth
the principle contained in Comment k” (of the Restate
ment Second of Torts’ strict liability section, 402A) that “a
vaccine manufacturer should not be liable for injuries or
deaths resulting from unavoidable side effects.” Id., at 23
(emphasis added). But the appearance of the word “un
avoidable” in this last-mentioned sentence cannot provide
petitioners with much help. That is because nothing in
the Report suggests that the statute means the word
“unavoidable” to summon up an otherwise unmentioned
third exception encompassing suits based on design de
fects. Nor can the Report’s reference to comment k fill the
gap. The Report itself refers, not to comment k’s details,
but only to its “principle,” namely, that vaccine manufac
turers should not be held liable for unavoidable injuries.
It says nothing at all about who—judge, jury, or federal
safety agency—should decide whether a safer vaccine
could have been designed. Indeed, at the time Congress
wrote this Report, different state courts had come to very
different conclusions about that matter. See Cupp, Re
thinking Conscious Design Liability for Prescription

gence Approach, 63 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 76, 79 (1994–1995)
