inafter Childhood Immunizations).
But these gains are fragile; “[t]he causative agents for
these preventable childhood illnesses are ever present in
the environment, waiting for the opportunity to attack
the unprotected individual.” Hearing on S. 827 before the
Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 99th
Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, pp. 20–21 (1985) (hereinafter Hear

and other vaccine manufacturers, “fac[ing] great difficulty
in obtaining [product liability] insurance,” told Congress
that they were considering “a similar course of action.”
H. R. Rep., at 4; Childhood Immunizations 68–70. The
Committee Report explains that, since there were only one
or two manufacturers of many childhood vaccines, “[t]he
