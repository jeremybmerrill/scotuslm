for the compensation.” 1987 Report 690. In 1987, Con
gress passed legislation to fund the compensation pro
gram. The House Energy and Commerce Committee
Report9 accompanying that legislation specifically stated
that “the codification of Comment (k) of The Restatement
(Second) of Torts was not intended to decide as a matter of
law the circumstances in which a vaccine should be
deemed unavoidably unsafe.” Id., at 691. The Committee
noted that “[a]n amendment to establish . . . that a manu
facturer’s failure to develop [a] safer vaccine was not
grounds for liability was rejected by the Committee during
its original consideration of the Act.” Ibid. In light of that
rejection, the Committee emphasized that “there should be
no misunderstanding that the Act undertook to decide as a
matter of law whether vaccines were unavoidably unsafe
or not,” and that “[t]his question is left to the courts to
determine in accordance with applicable law.” Ibid.

given little or no weight, the 1987 Report reflects the
intent of the Congress that enacted the funding legislation

whether the 1987 Report was authored by the House Budget Commit
tee or the House Energy and Commerce Committee. See 561 F. 3d 233,
250 (2009). As petitioners explain, although the Budget Committee
compiled and issued the Report, the Energy and Commerce Committee
wrote and approved the relevant language. Title IV of the Report,
entitled “Committee on Energy and Commerce,” comprises “two Com
mittee Prints approved by the Committee on Energy and Commerce for
inclusion in the forthcoming reconciliation bill.” 1987 Report 377, 380.
