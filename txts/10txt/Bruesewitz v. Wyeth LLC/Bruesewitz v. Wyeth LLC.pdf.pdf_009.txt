BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
Opinion of the Court

seizures.28 She suffered over 100 seizures during the next
month, and her doctors eventually diagnosed her with
“residual seizure disorder” and “developmental delay.”29
Hannah, now a teenager, is still diagnosed with both
conditions.
In April 1995, Hannah’s parents, Russell and Robalee
Bruesewitz, filed a vaccine injury petition in the United
States Court of Federal Claims, alleging that Hannah
suffered from on-Table residual seizure disorder and
encephalopathy injuries.30 A Special Master denied their
claims on various grounds, though they were awarded
$126,800 in attorney’s fees and costs. The Bruesewitzes
elected to reject the unfavorable judgment, and in October
2005 filed this lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court. Their
complaint alleged (as relevant here) that defective design
of Lederle’s DTP vaccine caused Hannah’s disabilities, and
that Lederle was subject to strict liability, and liability for
negligent design, under Pennsylvania common law.31
Wyeth removed the suit to the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which
granted Wyeth summary judgment on the strict-liability
and negligence design-defect claims, holding that the
Pennsylvania law providing those causes of action was
preempted by 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1).32 The United
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.33
We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).
