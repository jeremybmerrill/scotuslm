BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

§22(b)(1)’s liability exemption.8
In addition to the 1986 Report, one other piece of the
Act’s legislative history provides further confirmation of
the petitioners’ textual reading of §22(b)(1). When Con
gress enacted the Vaccine Act in 1986, it did not initially
include a source of payment for the no-fault compensation
program the Act established. The Act thus “made the
compensation program and accompanying tort reforms
contingent on the enactment of a tax to provide funding
——————
8 Respondent suggests an alternative reading of the 1986 Report.
According to respondent, “the principle in Comment K” is simply that of
nonliability for “unavoidably unsafe” products, and thus Congress’
stated intent in the 1986 Report to apply the “principle in Comment K”
to “the vaccines covered in the bill” means that Congress viewed the
covered vaccines as a class to be “ ‘unavoidably unsafe.’ ” 1986 Report
25–26; Brief for Respondent 42. The concurrence makes a similar
argument. Ante, at 1–2 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This interpretation
finds some support in the 1986 Report, which states that “if [injured
individuals] cannot demonstrate under applicable law either that a
vaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by im
proper directions or inadequate warnings [they] should pursue recom
pense in the compensation system, not the tort system.” 1986 Report
26. It also finds some support in the pre-Vaccine Act case law, which
reflected considerable disagreement in the courts over “whether com
ment k applies to pharmaceutical products across the board or only on
a case-by-case basis.” Ausness, Unavoidably Unsafe Products and
Strict Products Liability: What Liability Rule Should be Applied to the
Sellers of Pharmaceutical Products? 78 Ky. L. J. 705, 708, and n. 11
(1989–1990) (collecting cases). This interpretation, however, is under
mined by the fact that Congress has never directed the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) or any other federal agency to review vaccines
for optimal vaccine design, see infra, at 20–22, and n. 19, and thus it
seems highly unlikely that Congress intended to eliminate the tradi
tional mechanism for such review (i.e., design defect liability), particu
larly given its express retention of state tort law in the Vaccine Act, see
42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(a). In any event, to the extent there is ambiguity
as to how precisely Congress intended the “principle in Comment K” to
apply to the covered vaccines, that ambiguity is explicitly resolved in
petitioners’ favor by the 1987 House Energy and Commerce Committee
Report, H. R. Rep. No. 100–391, pt. 1, pp. 690–691 (hereinafter 1987
Report). See infra this page and 11–12.
