pertinent judgment or claim.” §2244(d)(2). The question
in this case is whether a motion for reduction of sentence
under Rhode Island’s Rule 35 is an “application for State
post-conviction or other collateral review.”
The parties agree that the answer to this question turns
on the meaning of the phrase “collateral review,” see Brief
for Petitioner 19; Brief for Respondent 12–13, but they
disagree about the definition of that term. Rhode Island
argues that “collateral review” includes only “legal” chal
lenges to a conviction or sentence and thus excludes mo
tions seeking a discretionary sentence reduction. Respon
dent, on the other hand, maintains that “collateral review”
is “review other than review of a judgment in the direct
appeal process” and thus includes motions to reduce sen
tence. Brief for Respondent 17. We agree with respon
dent’s understanding of “collateral review.”

“Collateral review” is not defined in AEDPA, and we
have never provided a comprehensive definition of that
term. See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 175–178
(2001). We therefore begin by considering the ordinary
understanding of the phrase “collateral review.” See
Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000) (“We give the
words of a statute their ordinary, contemporary, common
meaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to
bear some different import” (internal quotation marks
omitted)); see also Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 219
(2002) (considering the ordinary meaning of the word
“pending” in §2244(d)(2)).
The term “collateral,” in its “customary and preferred
sense,” Williams, supra, at 431, means “[l]ying aside from
the main subject, line of action, issue, purpose, etc.; . . .
subordinate, indirect,” 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473
