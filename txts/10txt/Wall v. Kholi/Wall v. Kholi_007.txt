WALL v. KHOLI
Opinion of the Court

the Magistrate Judge concluded that the Rule 35 motion
was not a “ ‘properly filed application for post-conviction or
other collateral review’ ” under §2244(d)(2) because it was
“a ‘plea of leniency,’ and not a motion challenging the legal
sufficiency of his sentence.” No. CA 07–346S, 2008 WL
60194, *4 (R. I., Jan. 3, 2008). The District Court adopted
the Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation and
therefore dismissed the federal habeas petition as un
timely. See id., at *1. On appeal, the First Circuit re
versed. 582 F. 3d 147.
The Courts of Appeals are divided over the question
whether a motion to reduce sentence tolls the period of
limitation under §2244(d)(2).2 We granted certiorari to
answer this question with respect to a motion to reduce
sentence under Rhode Island law. 560 U. S. ___ (2010).

the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct
review or the expiration of the time for seeking such re
view.” §2244(d)(1)(A); see also Jimenez, supra, at ___ (slip
op., at 6) (explaining when “the conclusion of direct review
occurs”). The limitation period is tolled, however, during
the pendency of “a properly filed application for State post
conviction or other collateral review with respect to the
