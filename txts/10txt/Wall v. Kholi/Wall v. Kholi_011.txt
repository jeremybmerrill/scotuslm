WALL v. KHOLI
Opinion of the Court

law.
A
Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Rules of Criminal Procedure
is much like the version of Federal Rule of Criminal Pro
cedure 35 that was in force prior to the enactment of the
federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the promulga
tion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See State v.
Byrnes, 456 A. 2d 742, 744 (R. I. 1983) (per curiam); Re
porter’s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc.
35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., p. 620 (Lexis 2010). Under the
Rhode Island Rules, a Rule 35 motion permits a court to
provide relief from a sentence in three ways: A court “may”
“correct an illegal sentence,” “correct a sentence imposed
in an illegal manner,” and “reduce any sentence.” R. I.
Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a); see n. 1, supra. In this
case, respondent filed a motion to reduce his sentence,
which permits a trial justice to decide “ ‘ “on reflection or
on the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence
originally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.” ’ ”
State v. Ruffner, 5 A. 3d 864, 867 (R. I. 2010) (quoting
State v. Mendoza, 958 A. 2d 1159, 1161 (R. I. 2008)); see
also Reporter’s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim.
Proc. 35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., at 620–621. Rhode Island
courts have, at times, referred to such a motion as a “ ‘plea
for leniency.’ ” Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Mendoza,
supra, at 1161).
A Rule 35 motion is made in the Superior Court, and it
is generally heard by the same trial justice who sentenced
the defendant. Byrnes, supra, at 745. The Rhode Island
Supreme Court has explained that a motion to reduce
sentence is “ ‘addressed to the sound discretion of the trial
justice’ ” and that appellate review of the trial justice’s
decision is limited. Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Men
doza, supra, at 1161). An appellate court may neverthe
less disturb the trial justice’s decision “when the trial
