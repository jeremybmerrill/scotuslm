Opinion of the Court

Moreover, the methods of filing for postconviction or
collateral review vary among the States. In the District of
Columbia and fourteen States, the principal postconviction
remedy is part of the original case; in other States, it is
not. 1 Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief
Handbook §1:3, at 6–7. Given the States’ “different forms
of collateral review,” Duncan, 533 U. S., at 177, the ap
plication of AEDPA’s tolling provision should not turn
on such formalities. See ibid. (“Congress may have re
frained from exclusive reliance on the term ‘post-conviction’
so as to leave no doubt that the tolling provision applies
to all types of state collateral review available after a
conviction”).
We thus define “collateral review” according to its ordi
nary meaning: It refers to judicial review that occurs in a
proceeding outside of the direct review process.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
