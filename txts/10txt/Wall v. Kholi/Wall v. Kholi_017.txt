WALL v. KHOLI
Opinion of the Court

interpretation would demand.
We also reject the argument that the meaning of the
phrase “collateral review” should turn on whether the
motion or application that triggers that review is cap
tioned as a part of the criminal case or as a separate pro
ceeding. See Walkowiak v. Haines, 272 F. 3d 234, 237
(CA4 2001). This interpretation of §2244(d)(2) would
produce confusion and inconsistency.
For one thing, some “collateral” proceedings are often
regarded as part of the criminal case. We have said, for
example, that a writ of coram nobis “is a step in the crimi
nal case and not . . . a separate case and record, the begin
ning of a separate civil proceeding.” Morgan, 346 U. S., at
505, n. 4; see also United States v. Denedo, 556 U. S. ___,
___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (“[A]n application for the writ is
properly viewed as a belated extension of the original
proceeding during which the error allegedly transpired”).
But we have nonetheless suggested that coram nobis is a
means of “collateral attack.” Morgan, supra, at 510–511
(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Robinson, 361
U. S., at 230, n. 14. Similarly, a motion under 28 U. S. C.
§2255 (2006 ed., Supp. III) is entered on the docket of the
original criminal case and is typically referred to the judge
who originally presided over the challenged proceedings,
see §2255 Rules 3(b), 4(a), but there is no dispute that
§2255 proceedings are “collateral,” see, e.g., Massaro v.
United States, 538 U. S. 500, 504 (2003) (describing §2255
proceedings as “collateral”); Daniels v. United States, 532
U. S. 374, 379 (2001) (same).7

7 In other contexts not relevant here, there has been some confusion
over whether §2255 proceedings are civil or criminal in nature. See,
e.g., Postconviction Remedies §3:5, p. 251 (2010) (“[T]here is a dispute
over whether the [§2255] motion initiates an independent civil action
or, instead, is merely a further step in the criminal prosecution”); 3 C.
Wright & S. Welling, Federal Practice and Procedure §622 (4th ed.
2011). We express no opinion on this question.
