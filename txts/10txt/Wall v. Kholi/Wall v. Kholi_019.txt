TIONER v. KHALIL KHOLI 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[March 7, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part. 

The Court holds that the term “collateral review” in 28

U. S. C. §2244(d)(2) means review that is not direct, ante,
at 5, and that a motion under Rhode Island’s Rule 35
seeks collateral review, ante, at 9. Because I agree with
those conclusions, I cannot join footnote 3 of the Court’s
opinion, ante, at 9, n. 3, which declines to decide whether a
Rule 35 motion seeks direct review.
