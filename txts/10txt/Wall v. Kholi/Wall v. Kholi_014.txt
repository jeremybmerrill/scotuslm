Opinion of the Court

“review” of a sentence within the meaning of §2244(d)(2).
We thus hold that a motion to reduce sentence under
Rhode Island law is an application for “collateral review”
that triggers AEDPA’s tolling provision.
IV
In resisting this interpretation, Rhode Island advances
several arguments that we find unpersuasive.
The first of these arguments begins by observing that,
whenever our opinions have used the precise phrase “col
lateral review,” the proceeding in question was one chal
lenging the “lawfulness” of a prior judgment, Brief for
Petitioner 21–22, such as a §2254 or §2255 action, see id.,
at 25. Rhode Island argues that Congress, in enacting
AEDPA, must be presumed to have been aware of this
usage and must have intended the phrase to carry this
narrow meaning.
This argument reads far too much into these prior refer
ences to “collateral review.” While our opinions have used
the phrase “collateral review” to refer to proceedings that
challenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, we have
never suggested that the phrase may properly be used to
describe only proceedings of this type. In addition, Rhode
Island overlooks opinions describing a motion to reduce
sentence as “collateral.” E.g., Robinson, 361 U. S., at 230,
n. 14; Fernandez, supra, at 1492; see also 1 D. Wilkes,

aware of these factors and applied them correctly”).
