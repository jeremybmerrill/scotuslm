Opinion of the Court

Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In
United States v. Robinson, 361 U. S. 220 (1960), we distin
guished between the process of direct appeal and “a num
ber of collateral remedies,” including Federal Rule 35
motions, §2255 motions, and coram nobis. Id., at 230,
n. 14. Similarly, in Bartone v. United States, 375 U. S. 52
(1963) (per curiam), we drew a distinction between a
“[d]irect attack” on a criminal judgment and “collateral
proceedings,” such as Rule 35, habeas corpus, and §2255
proceedings. Id., at 53–54.
All of the proceedings identified in these prior opinions
as “collateral” are separate from the direct review process,
and thus our prior usage of the term “collateral” but
tresses the conclusion that “collateral review” means a
form of review that is not direct.

Of course, to trigger the tolling provision, a “collateral”
proceeding must also involve a form of “review,” but the
meaning of that term seems clear. “Review” is best under
stood as an “act of inspecting or examining” or a “judicial
reexamination.” Webster’s 1944; see also Black’s, supra,
at 1434 (“[c]onsideration, inspection, or reexamination of a
subject or thing”); 13 OED 831 (“[t]o submit (a decree, act,
etc.) to examination or revision”). We thus agree with the
First Circuit that “ ‘review’ commonly denotes ‘a looking
over or examination with a view to amendment or im
provement.’ ” 582 F. 3d, at 153 (quoting Webster’s 1944
(2002)). Viewed as a whole, then, “collateral review” of a
judgment or claim means a judicial reexamination of
a judgment or claim in a proceeding outside of the direct
review process.

We now apply this definition of “collateral review” to a
Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island
