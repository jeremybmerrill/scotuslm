TIONER v. KHALIL KHOLI 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[March 7, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 (AEDPA), “a properly filed application for
State post-conviction or other collateral review with re
spect to the pertinent judgment or claim” tolls the 1-year
limitation period for filing a federal habeas petition. 28
U. S. C. §2244(d)(2). The question in this case is whether
a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law tolls
the limitation period, thereby rendering respondent Khalil
Kholi’s federal habeas petition timely. We hold that the
phrase “collateral review” in §2244(d)(2) means judicial
review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of
direct review. Because the parties agree that a motion to
reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is not part of the
direct review process, we hold that respondent’s motion
tolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal
habeas petition was therefore timely.
