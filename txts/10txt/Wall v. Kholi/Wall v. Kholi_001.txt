SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus

WALL, DIRECTOR, RHODE ISLAND DEPARTMENT OF
CORRECTIONS v. KHOLI
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIRST CIRCUIT
No. 09–868.

Argued November 29, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011

Respondent was convicted in Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts
of first-degree sexual assault and sentenced to consecutive life terms.
His conviction became final on direct review on May 29, 1996. In ad
dition to his direct appeal, he filed two relevant state motions. One, a
May 16, 1996, motion to reduce his sentence under Rhode Island Su
perior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, was denied. The State
Supreme Court affirmed on January 16, 1998. The second, a state
postconviction relief motion, was also denied. That decision was af
firmed on December 14, 2006. When respondent filed his federal ha
beas petition, his conviction had been final for over 11 years. The
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) gen
erally requires a federal petition to be filed within one year of the
date on which a judgment became final, 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A),
but “a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other col
lateral review” tolls that period, §2244(d)(2). Respondent’s postcon
viction relief motion tolled the period for over nine years, but his Rule
35 motion must also trigger the tolling provision for his habeas peti
tion to be timely. The District Court dismissed the petition as un
timely, adopting the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that the Rule 35
motion was not “a properly filed application for . . . collateral review”
under §2244(d)(2). The First Circuit reversed.
Held:
1. The phrase “collateral review” in §2244(d)(2) means judicial re
view of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.
Pp. 4–8.
(a) The parties agree that the answer to the question whether a
motion to reduce sentence is an “application for State post-conviction
