Opinion of the Court

propriate,” the hearing justice denied the Rule 35 motion.
Ibid. On January 16, 1998, the State Supreme Court
affirmed and observed that the facts clearly justified the
sentence. Id., at 1326–1327.
On May 23, 1997, while the Rule 35 motion was pend
ing, respondent also filed an application for state postcon
viction relief, see R. I. Gen. Laws 10–9.1–1 et seq. (Lexis
1997) (titled “Post Conviction Remedy”), which challenged
his conviction. The trial court denied this motion as well,
and the State Supreme Court affirmed that decision on
December 14, 2006. See Kholi v. Wall, 911 A. 2d 262, 263–

Respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the Dis

that time, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.
AEDPA generally requires a federal habeas petition to be
filed within one year of the date on which the judgment
became final by the conclusion of direct review. 28
U. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A). But the 1-year limitation period is
tolled during the pendency of “a properly filed application
for State post-conviction or other collateral review with

There is no dispute that respondent’s application for
postconviction relief tolled the limitation period for over
nine years—from May 23, 1997, through December 14,
2006. 582 F. 3d, at 151. Even after subtracting that
stretch of time from the 11-year period, however, the
period between the conclusion of direct review and the
filing of the federal habeas petition still exceeds one year.
Thus, in order for respondent’s petition to be timely, the
Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence must also trigger the
tolling provision.
Respondent’s federal habeas petition was referred to a
Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation, and
