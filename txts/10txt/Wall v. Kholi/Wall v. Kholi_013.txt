WALL v. KHOLI
Opinion of the Court

Not only is a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode
Island law “collateral,” but it also undoubtedly calls for
“review” of the sentence. The decision to reduce a sen
tence, while largely within the discretion of the trial jus
tice, involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to
determine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.4
When ruling on such a motion, a trial justice is guided by
several factors, including “(1) the severity of the crime, (2)
the defendant’s personal, educational, and employment
background, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the
element of societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness
of the punishment.” State v. Mollicone, 746 A. 2d 135, 138
(R. I. 2000) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omit
ted); see also Ruffner, supra, at 867; Coleman, supra, at
655. On appeal from a trial justice’s decision on a motion
to reduce sentence, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island
evaluates the trial justice’s justifications in light of the
relevant sentencing factors to determine whether a sen
tence is “without justification” and “grossly disparate from
other sentences.” Ruffner, supra, at 867 (internal quota
tion marks omitted).5 This process surely qualifies as

State v. McManus, 990 A. 2d 1229, 1238 (R. I. 2010) (refusing to con
sider Eighth Amendment challenge on direct review because “[t]o
challenge a criminal sentence, the defendant must first file a motion to
reduce in accordance with Rule 35”); see also Jimenez v. Quarterman,
555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6–7). That issue has not been
briefed or argued by the parties, however, and we express no opinion as
to the merit of such an argument. Even if we were to assume that a
Rhode Island Rule 35 motion is part of direct review, our disposition of
this case would not change: Respondent’s habeas petition still would be
timely, because the limitation period would not have begun to run until
after the Rule 35 proceedings concluded.
4 A motion to reduce sentence is unlike a motion for postconviction
discovery or a motion for appointment of counsel, which generally are
not direct requests for judicial review of a judgment and do not provide
a state court with authority to order relief from a judgment.
