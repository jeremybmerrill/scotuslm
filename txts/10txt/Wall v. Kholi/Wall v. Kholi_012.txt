Opinion of the Court

justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification
and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally
imposed for similar offenses.” Ruffner, supra, at 867
(quoting State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 654 (R. I. 2009);
internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ruffner, su
pra, at 867 (asking whether trial justice “abuse[d] his
discretion”).

With these principles in mind, we consider whether
Rhode Island’s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is an
application for “collateral review.”
The first—and the critical—question is whether a Rhode
Island Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is “collat
eral.” Respondent and Rhode Island agree that such a
motion is not part of the direct review process. Moreover,
we have previously referred to a motion to reduce sentence
under old Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce
dure as invoking a “collateral” remedy, see Robinson,
supra, at 230, n. 14, and Rhode Island’s Rule 35 motion to
reduce sentence is “substantially similar” to former Fed
eral Rule 35, Byrnes, supra, at 744. Lower courts have
also referred to Federal Rule 35 sentence reduction mo
tions as “collateral.” See, e.g., Fernandez v. United States,
941 F. 2d 1488, 1492 (CA11 1991) (“Fernandez initiated a
collateral attack on his sentence with a Rule 35(b) motion
to reduce his sentence” under the old Federal Rule). We
thus have little difficulty concluding that a Rhode Island
sentence reduction proceeding is “collateral.”3

can imagine an argument that a Rhode Island Rule 35 proceed
ing is in fact part of direct review under §2244(d)(1) because, according
to the parties, defendants in Rhode Island cannot raise any challenge to
their sentences on direct appeal; instead, they must bring a Rule 35
motion. See, e.g., State v. Day, 925 A. 2d 962, 985 (R. I. 2007) (“It is
well settled in this jurisdiction that a challenge to a criminal sentence
must begin with the filing of a [Rule 35] motion . . . . [W]e will not
consider the validity or legality of a sentence on direct appeal unless
