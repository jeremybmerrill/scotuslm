WALL v. KHOLI
Opinion of the Court

Webster’s) (“accompanying as . . . secondary,” “indirect,” or
“ancillary”). By definition, something that is “collateral”
is “indirect,” not direct. 3 OED 473. This suggests that
“collateral” review is review that is “[l]ying aside from the
main” review, i.e., that is not part of direct review. See
ibid.
The definition of the related phrase “collateral attack”
points in the same direction. A “collateral attack” is “[a]n
attack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct
appeal.” Black’s Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed. 2009) (em
phasis added); cf. Wash. Rev. Code §10.73.090(2) (2008)
(defining “collateral attack” as “any form of postconviction
relief other than a direct appeal”). This usage buttresses
the conclusion that “collateral review” means a form of
review that is not part of the direct appeal process.
C
Our prior usage of the term “collateral” also supports
this understanding. We have previously described a vari
ety of proceedings as “collateral,” and all of these proceed
ings share the characteristic that we have identified, i.e.,
they stand apart from the process of direct review.
For example, our cases make it clear that habeas corpus
is a form of collateral review. We have used the terms
habeas corpus and “collateral review” interchangeably,
see, e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 482–483 (1986),
and it is well accepted that state petitions for habeas
corpus toll the limitation period, e.g., Rhines v. Weber, 544
U. S. 269, 272 (2005) (“[T]he 1-year statute of limitations
. . . was tolled while Rhines’ state habeas corpus petition
was pending”).
We have also described coram nobis as a means of “col
lateral attack,” see, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 346
U. S. 502, 510–511 (1954) (internal quotation marks omit
ted), and we have used the term “collateral” to describe
proceedings under 28 U. S. C. §2255 and a prior version of
