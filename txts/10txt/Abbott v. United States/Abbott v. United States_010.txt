ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

and if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle, short
barreled shotgun, or semiautomatic assault weapon,
to imprisonment for ten years, and if the firearm is a
machinegun, or a destructive device, or is equipped
with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, to impris

scribing “use” of a firearm, Bailey held, §924(c)(1) did not
reach “mere possession” of the weapon. Id., at 144. Con
gress legislated a different result; in the 1998 revision,
“colloquially known as the Bailey Fix Act,” the Legislature
brought possession within the statute’s compass. United
States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14)

In addition to the change prompted by Bailey, Congress
increased the severity of §924(c) sentences in two other
