ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Abbott’s alternative construction, which homes in on
other firearm offenses, gives rise to similar oddities. On
this reading, Abbott’s 15-year ACCA sentence for being a
felon-in-possession would preempt his five-year §924(c)
sentence, and his minimum term would be 15 years,
rather than 20.5 But if ACCA were not at issue, Abbott’s
minimum term would be the same 15 years: his fiveyear §924(c) sentence on top of his ten-year drug sen
tence. Qualification as a career criminal would carry no
consequence.
Nor does Abbott’s second construction necessarily pro
mote more equitable outcomes. Suppose, for example, that
a career criminal sold drugs together with a first-time
offender, and both brandished firearms in the process.
The first-time offender, lacking a felon-in-possession
conviction, would serve a seven-year §924(c) sentence on
top of a ten-year drug sentence, for a total of 17 years. But
the career criminal’s ACCA sentence would preempt the
§924(c) sentence; he would serve only 15 years.
Abbott and Gould respond that sentencing judges may
take account of such anomalies and order appropriate
adjustments. We observe first that no correction or avoid
ance appears possible for the anomaly that, while §924(c)
“defines a standalone crime,” a §924(c) sentence would be
wiped out by a wholly separate and independent convic
tion. United States v. Easter, 553 F. 3d 519, 526 (CA7
2009) (per curiam) (“A determination of guilt that yields
no sentence is not a judgment of conviction at all.”). We
do, however, agree that a judge exercising discretion un
der 18 U. S. C. §3553(a) “would [not] be required to sen
tence” a more culpable defendant to a lesser term; the
judge could increase that defendant’s sentence for a predi
cate crime to make up for §924(c)’s failure to effect any
enlargement of the time served. United States v. Whitley,

sentences may run concurrently with drug sentences.
