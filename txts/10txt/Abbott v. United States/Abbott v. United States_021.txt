Opinion of the Court

Our interpretation, Abbott and Gould protest, renders
the second part of the “except” clause effectively meaning
less. Section 3559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of
§924(c) itself, the Government places within the “except”
clause. Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–35, 42–44.8 But §3559(c)
already imposes a life sentence. A defendant would find
little comfort in knowing that no §924(c) sentence, say five
years or seven, will be tacked on to his §3559(c) life term.
As Courts of Appeals have observed, however, the “any
other provision of law” portion of the “except” clause in
stalls a “safety valve.” United States v. Studifin, 240 F. 3d
415, 423 (CA4 2001). It “allow[s] for additional §924(c)
sentences,” akin to the sentence prescribed in §3559(c),
that Congress may codify outside §924(c) “in the future.”
See Abbott, 574 F. 3d, at 208. We do not regard this al
lowance as “implausible.” See Abbott Brief 22; Gould Brief
21. As the Government points out, “there is nothing un
usual about Congress prescribing mandatory minimum
penalties for substantive offenses codified in other provi
sions.” Brief for United States 22. See, e.g., §3559(c)
(prescribing penalties for violations of, inter alia, 49
U. S. C. §46502 and 18 U. S. C. §§1111, 2111, 2113, and
2118); §3559(d) (prescribing penalties for violations of,
inter alia, 18 U. S. C. §§2422, 2423, and 2251); 18 U. S. C.
§924(e) (prescribing penalty for violation of §922(g)). See
also 18 U. S. C. §924(j)(1) (prescribing a nonmandatory
penalty of death for individuals who commit murder with
a firearm in the course of a §924(c) offense).
Our decisions in Gonzales and Republic of Iraq v. Beaty,
556 U. S. ___ (2009), do not warrant a different conclusion.
We observed in Gonzales that “the word ‘any’ [ordinarily]
——————
8 We

agree with the Government that a qualifying statute need not
“explicit[ly] reference” §924(c), Tr. of Oral Arg. 27; a statute will fit the
bill if it provides a greater mandatory minimum for an offense that
embodies all the elements of a §924(c) offense.
