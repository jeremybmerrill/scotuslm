ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

by the [statute’s] plain language,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 24,
Abbott asserts that it advances §924(c)’s goal—to discour
age bearing arms in furtherance of crime—while avoiding
the imposition of “two consecutive mandatory minimum
sentences for the single use of a single firearm,” Abbott
Brief 47 (emphasis omitted).
The three interpretations just described share a com
mon premise. In adding the “except” clause in 1998, all
three posit, Congress adopted a less aggressive mode of
applying §924(c), one that significantly reduced the sever
ity of the provision’s impact on defendants. Like the
courts below, we regard this premise as implausible. As
earlier observed, see supra, at 5–6, the pre-1998 version of
§924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence—punishment to be
imposed regardless of the sentence received for the predi
cate crime or any separate firearm conviction. Abbott and
Gould think the “except” clause installed, instead, a mod
est scheme designed simply to ensure that all §924(c)
offenders “serve at least 5 years in prison.” Gould Brief 5;
see Abbott Brief 10. We doubt that Congress meant a
prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed “An Act [t]o throt
tle criminal use of guns,” to effect a departure so great
from §924(c)’s longstanding thrust, i.e., its insistence that
sentencing judges impose additional punishment for
§924(c) violations.
Were we to accept any of the readings proposed by
Abbott or Gould, it bears emphasis, we would undercut
that same bill’s primary objective: to expand §924(c)’s
coverage to reach firearm possession. In 1999, more than
half of those who violated §924(c) in connection with a
drug-trafficking offense received a mandatory minimum of
ten years or more for that trafficking offense. Letter from

Gould’s sentence would stand under Abbott’s alternative construction.
