ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

crimes. The “grammatical and logical scope” of a proviso,
we have held, “is confined to the subject-matter of the
principal clause” to which it is attached. United States v.
Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534–535 (1925). As a proviso
attached to §924(c), the “except” clause is most naturally
read to refer to the conduct §924(c) proscribes. Accord
United States v. Villa, 589 F. 3d 1334, 1343 (CA10 2009).
There is strong contextual support for our view that
Congress intended the “except” clause to serve simply as a
clarification of §924(c), not as a major restraint on the
statute’s operation. At the same time Congress added the
“except” clause, it made the rest of §924(c) more complex.
The 1998 revision divided the statute’s existing sentencing
prescriptions into four paragraphs in lieu of one, and
added new penalties for brandishing and discharging a
firearm. §924(c)(1)(A)–(D). We know that Congress
thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing
judges: Warding off confusion, all agree, was the Legisla
ture’s sole objective in adding the initial part of the “ex
cept” clause, which covers greater minimums provided “by
this subsection.” That portion of the clause instructs
judges to pick the single highest sentence stipulated for a
§924(c) violation within §924(c) itself, and not to stack ten
years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing
the same weapon, whenever a defendant does both.
In referencing greater minimums provided by “any other
provision of law,” we think, the second portion of the
“except” clause simply furnishes the same no-stacking
instruction for cases in which §924(c) and a different
statute both punish conduct offending §924(c). Congress
likely anticipated such cases when the “except” clause was
framed in 1998, for the bill that reformulated the text of
§924(c) did just one thing more: It amended 18 U. S. C.
§3559(c) to command a life sentence when certain repeat
felons are convicted of “firearms possession (as described
in §924(c)).” Pub. L. 105–386, §1(b), 112 Stat. 3470.
