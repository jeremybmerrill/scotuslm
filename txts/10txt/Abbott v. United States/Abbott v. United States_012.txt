ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

ing the penalties for highly destructive weapons un
changed, the revision raised the base punishment for
“second or subsequent” offenses from 20 years to 25. Ibid.
The reformulation also transferred the bar on concurrent
sentences to §924(c)(1)(D)(ii):
“[N]o term of imprisonment imposed on a person
under this subsection shall run concurrently with any
other term of imprisonment imposed on the person,
including any term of imprisonment imposed for the
crime of violence or drug trafficking crime during
which the firearm was used, carried, or possessed.”
B
The leading portion of the “except” clause, which now
prefaces §924(c)(1)(A), refers to a “greater minimum sen
tence . . . otherwise provided by this subsection,” i.e., by
§924(c) itself; the second segment of the clause refers to a
greater minimum provided outside §924(c) “by any other
provision of law.” Beyond debate, the latter instruction
does not relieve a §924(c) offender of additional punish
ment “simply because a higher mandatory minimum
sentence exists in the United States Code.” Brief for
——————

ment of not less than 10 years; or
“(ii) is a machinegun or a destructive device, or is equipped with a
firearm silencer or firearm muffler, the person shall be sentenced to a
term of imprisonment of not less than 30 years.

subsection, the person shall—
