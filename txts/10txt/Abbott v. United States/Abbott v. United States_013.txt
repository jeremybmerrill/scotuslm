Opinion of the Court

Petitioner in No. 09–479, p. 19 (hereinafter Abbott Brief).
Were it otherwise, the statute’s ascending series of mini
mums, set out in §924(c)(1)(A)–(C), would have no work to
do; the only possible §924(c) sentence would be the Code’s
highest—life. The “except” clause, it is therefore undis
puted, “has to have some understood referent to be intelli
gible.” United States v. Parker, 549 F. 3d 5, 11 (CA1
2008). What should that referent be? As we comprehend
the clause, to determine whether a greater minimum
sentence is “otherwise provided . . . by any other provision
of law,” the key question one must ask is: otherwise pro
vided for what? As earlier noted, see supra, at 3, most
courts, in line with the courts below and the Government,
have answered: for the conduct §924(c) proscribes, i.e.,
possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.
Abbott and Gould disagree and offer diverse readings.
Gould principally would apply the “except” clause to pre
clude a §924(c) sentence whenever “any of a defendant’s
counts of convictio[n] at sentencing” require a greater
minimum sentence. Brief for Petitioner in No. 09–7073,
p. 14 (hereinafter Gould Brief).
In lieu of Gould’s position that any greater minimum
sentence on a different count of conviction will do, Abbott
advances a somewhat narrower “transactional approach.”
Any sentence imposed on the defendant fits the bill, he
urges, so long as the sentence was imposed “because of the
criminal transaction that triggered §924(c) in the first
place.” Abbott Brief 10. Accord United States v. Williams,
558 F. 3d 166, 171 (CA2 2009).
Abbott also tenders an alternative construction: The
minimum sentence “otherwise provided” must be for a
firearm offense—for example, Abbott’s felon-in-possession
charge—involving the same firearm that triggered
§924(c).4 Conceding that this reading is “not commanded

Gould’s only firearm-related offense is his §924(c) offense,
