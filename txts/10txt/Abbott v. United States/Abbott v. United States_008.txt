ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

dated by ACCA, and to an additional five years for the
§924(c) violation, yielding a total prison term of 20 years.1
Gould’s indictment listed seven separate drug and fire
arm charges. In return for Gould’s agreement to plead
guilty, the Government dropped all but two: one §924(c)
offense and one predicate drug-trafficking crime. The
latter, for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute
cocaine base, carried a ten-year mandatory minimum
under §841(b)(1)(A). Firearm involvement was not an
element of that offense. The United States District Court
for the Northern District of Texas imposed a sentence of
11 years and 5 months for the trafficking offense and an
additional five years for the §924(c) violation, for a total of
16 years and 5 months.
On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged the five-year
consecutive sentence each received under §924(c). Abbott
urged that ACCA’s 15-year mandatory minimum triggered
§924(c)’s “except” clause, because ACCA qualified as
“[an]other provision of law” that “provided” a “greater
minimum sentence.” Gould said the same of the ten years
commanded by his predicate trafficking crime.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Cir
cuit affirmed Abbott’s sentence, concluding that the “ex
cept” clause “refers only to other minimum sentences that
may be imposed for violations of §924(c).” United States v.
Abbott, 574 F. 3d 203, 208 (2009). Gould fared no better
before the Fifth Circuit. United States v. Gould, 329 Fed.
Appx. 569, 570 (2009) (per curiam). That court’s precedent
already confined the exception to conduct offending
§924(c). United States v. London, 568 F. 3d 553, 564
(2009). To resolve the division among the Circuits on the
——————
1 Abbott received ten years on each drug-trafficking count.
Those
sentences, imposed concurrently, did not alter his total term of impris
onment and do not figure in this case.
