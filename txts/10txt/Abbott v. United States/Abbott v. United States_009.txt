Control Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 1213. The “except” clause,
which did not appear in §924(c) as originally composed,
was introduced by statutory amendment in 1998. See An
Act [t]o throttle criminal use of guns, 112 Stat. 3469. We

carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment
provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking
crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,
