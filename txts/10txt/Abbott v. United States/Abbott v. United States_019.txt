Opinion of the Court

§924(c) violation “[e]xcept to the extent that a greater
minimum sentence is otherwise provided . . . by any other
provision of law,” Congress meant:
“[I]f another provision of the United States Code
mandates a punishment for using, carrying, or pos
sessing a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking
crime or crime of violence, and that minimum sen
tence is longer than the punishment applicable under
§924(c), then the longer sentence applies.” Brief for
United States 17.
This reading gives effect to the statutory language
commanding that all §924(c) offenders shall receive addi
tional punishment for their violation of that provision, a
command reiterated three times. First, the statute states
that the punishment specified in §924(c)(1) “shall” be
imposed “in addition to” the penalty for the predicate
offense. §924(c)(1)(A). Second, after Busic, §924(c) de
mands a discrete punishment even if the predicate crime
itself “provides for an enhanced punishment if committed
by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device.”
Ibid. Third, §924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibility that
a §924(c) sentence might “run concurrently with any other
term of imprisonment.” We doubt that Congress, having
retained this thrice-repeated instruction, would simulta
neously provide an exception severely limiting application
of the instruction.
Cf. Greenlaw v. United States,
554 U. S. 237, 251 (2008) (“We resist attributing to Con
gress an intention to render a statute so internally
inconsistent.”).
Interpreting the “except” clause to train on conduct
offending §924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.
The “except” clause is not a standalone enactment, or even
a standalone sentence. Rather, it precedes and qualifies
§924(c)(1)(A)’s principal clause, which punishes the pos
session of a firearm in connection with specified predicate
