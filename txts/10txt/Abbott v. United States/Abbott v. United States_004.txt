ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus
§924(c) proscribes. See United States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534–
535. There is strong contextual support for the view that the “except”
clause was intended simply to clarify §924(c). At the same time Con
gress added the clause, it made the rest of §924(c) more complex, di
viding its existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs, and
adding new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.
Congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges:
It added the “except” clause’s initial part, which covers greater mini
mums provided “by this subsection,” to instruct judges not to stack
ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the
same weapon. In referencing greater minimums provided by “any
other provision of law,” the second portion of the clause simply fur
nishes the same no-stacking instruction for cases in which §924(c)
and a different statute both punish conduct offending §924(c). Con
gress likely anticipated such cases when framing the “except” clause,
for the bill that reformulated §924(c)’s text also amended 18 U. S. C.
§3559(c) to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons con
victed of “firearms possession (as described in §924(c)).” This inter
pretation does not render the “except” clause’s second part effectively
meaningless. Though §3559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of
§924(c) itself, that the Government places within the “except” clause,
the “any other provision of law” portion installs a safety valve for ad
ditional sentences that Congress may codify outside §924(c) in the fu
ture. Neither United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, nor Republic of
Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, warrants a different conclusion. Pp. 14–
18.

No. 09–479, 574 F. 3d 203; No. 09–7073, 329 Fed. Appx. 569, affirmed.
GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other
Members joined, except KAGAN, J., who took no part in the considera
tion or decision of the cases.
