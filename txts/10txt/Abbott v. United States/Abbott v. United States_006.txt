ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

and firearm offenses; charges on which they were con
victed included violation of §924(c). Each objected to the
imposition of any additional prison time for his §924(c)
conviction. Their objections rested on the “except” clause
now prefacing §924(c)(1)(A). Under that clause, a mini
mum term of five years shall be imposed as a consecutive
sentence “[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum
sentence is otherwise provided by [§924(c) itself] or by any
other provision of law.”
Abbott and Gould read §924(c)’s “except” clause to se
cure them against prison time for their §924(c) convic
tions. They claim exemption from punishment under
§924(c) because they were sentenced to greater mandatory
minimum prison terms for convictions on other counts
charging different offenses. The “except” clause, they
urge, ensures that §924(c) offenders will serve at least five
years in prison. If conviction on a different count yields a
mandatory sentence exceeding five years, they maintain,
the statutory requirement is satisfied and the penalty
specified for the §924(c) violation becomes inoperative.
The courts below, agreeing with the Government’s
construction of the statute, read §924(c)(1) as independ
ently requiring a sentence of at least five years, tacked
onto any other sentence the defendant receives. The
“except” clause refers to “a greater minimum sentence . . .
otherwise provided.” “[O]therwise provided” for what, the
courts below asked; their answer, for conduct offending
§924(c), i.e., possessing a firearm in connection with a
crime of violence or drug-trafficking crime.
A defendant is not spared from a separate, consecutive
sentence for a §924(c) conviction, the lower courts deter
mined, whenever he faces a higher mandatory minimum
for a different count of conviction. Instead, according to
the courts below and the Government here, the “except”
clause applies only when another provision—whether
contained within or placed outside §924(c)—commands a
