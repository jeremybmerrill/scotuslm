SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus

ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 09–479.

Argued October 4, 2010—Decided November 15, 2010*

Petitioners Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions,
were charged with drug and firearm offenses, including violation of
18 U. S. C. §924(c), which prohibits using, carrying, or possessing a
deadly weapon in connection with “any crime of violence or drug traf
ficking crime,” §924(c)(1). The minimum prison term for a §924(c) of
fense is five years, §924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to “any other term of
imprisonment imposed on the [offender],” §924(c)(1)(D)(ii). Abbott
was convicted on the §924(c) count, on two predicate drug-trafficking
counts, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He received a
15-year mandatory minimum sentence for his felon-in-possession con
viction and an additional five years for his §924(c) violation. Gould’s
predicate drug-trafficking crime carried a ten-year mandatory mini
mum sentence; he received an additional five years for his §924(c)
violation. On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged their §924(c) sen
tences, resting their objections on the “except” clause prefacing
§924(c)(1)(A). That clause provides for imposition of a minimum five
year term as a consecutive sentence “[e]xcept to the extent that a
greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [§924(c) itself] or
by any other provision of law.” Abbott urged that the “except” clause
was triggered by his 15-year felon-in-possession sentence; Gould said
the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking
crime. The Third Circuit affirmed Abbott’s sentence, concluding that
the “except” clause “refers only to other minimum sentences that may
be imposed” for §924(c) violations. Gould fared no better before the
Fifth Circuit.
