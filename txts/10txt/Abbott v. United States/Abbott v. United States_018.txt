ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

or increased the severity of §924(c) on four occasions,
never suggesting that a Guidelines firearm enhancement
might suffice to accomplish §924(c)’s objective.6 Nor is
there the slightest indication that Congress was contem
plating the Guidelines’ relationship to §924(c) when it
added the “except” clause in the 1998 amendments.7
The “except” clause, we note, would have been a most
haphazard way to achieve a Guidelines-driven rollback of
§924(c). If Congress wanted to ensure that §924(c) offend
ers “receive at least five years in prison,” and to rely on
the Guidelines for the rest, Abbott Brief 10, there was an
obvious solution: Congress could have excised all prescrip
tions ordering that §924(c) sentences shall run consecu
tively to other sentences. Without such a requirement, all
defendants would benefit from a minimum-plusGuidelines regime—not just the most culpable offenders.
Congress did not adopt that obvious solution, we think,
because it did not want the Guidelines to supplant §924(c).

The Government’s reading of the “except” clause, we are
convinced, makes far more sense than the interpretations
urged by Abbott and Gould. In imposing a sentence for a

Stat. 456–457 (increasing sentences for certain firearms and adding
drug trafficking as a predicate felony); Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988,
Pub. L. 100–690, §6460, 102 Stat. 4373–4374 (increasing sentences);
Crime Control Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101–647, §1101, 104 Stat. 4829
(same); Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act,
1994, Pub. L. 103–322, §110102(c), 108 Stat. 1998 (same).
7 For those who take legislative history into account, it is as silent as
is the statute’s text. The sole reference to the “except” clause appears
in the statement of one witness at a Senate hearing. See Hearing on S.
191 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 1st
Sess., 38 (1997) (statement of Thomas G. Hungar) (“[B]y adding an
introductory clause authorizing imposition of stiffer minimum sen
tences if required under other provisions of law, S. 191 eliminates any
potential inconsistency with other statutes.”).
