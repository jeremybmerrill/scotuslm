Opinion of the Court

respects: The 1998 revision “changed what were once
mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sen
tences,” O’Brien, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); and it
elevated the sentences for brandishing and discharging a
firearm and for repeat offenses. Congress also restruc
tured the provision, “divid[ing] what was once a lengthy
principal sentence into separate subparagraphs.” Id., at
___ (slip op., at 7). And it added the prefatory “except”
clause at issue in the cases now before us. As amended,
§924(c)(1)(A) prescribes:
“Except to the extent that a greater minimum sen
tence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by
any other provision of law, any person who, during
and in relation to any crime of violence or drug traf
ficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug
trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced pun
ishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dan
gerous weapon or device) for which the person may be
prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or
carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such
crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the
punishment provided for such crime of violence or
drug trafficking crime—
“(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not
less than 5 years;
“(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a
term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and
“(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to
a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.”
The 1998 reformulation, furthermore, removed to sepa
rate paragraphs the provisions commanding higher penal
ties for especially destructive weapons and “second or
subsequent” offenses. See §924(c)(1)(B), (C).3 While leav
