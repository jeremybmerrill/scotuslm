Opinion of the Court

529 F. 3d 150, 155 (CA2 2008). But we doubt Congress
had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before we
held, in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), that
district courts have discretion to depart from the Sentenc
ing Guidelines on the basis of §3553(a).
Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress
could have anticipated that the then-mandatory Guide
lines would resolve disparities. See Abbott Brief 32–35;
Gould Brief 30–32. On this view, the “except” clause
ensures that a §924(c) offender incurs a minimum sen
tence of considerable length; the Guidelines would then
control, elevating that sentence based on firearm posses
sion or use. See United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual §§2D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov. 1998)
(increasing offense level for defendants who use or possess
firearms in course of violent crime or drug trafficking);
§§2D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(6) (Nov. 2009) (same).
We do not gainsay that Abbott and Gould project a
rational, less harsh, mode of sentencing. But we do not
think it was the mode Congress ordered. Congress ex
pressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it
amended §924(c) in the same law that created the Sen
tencing Commission and the Guidelines. Pub. L. 98–473,
98 Stat. 1987, 2138. Four years earlier, in Busic v. United
States, 446 U. S. 398, 404 (1980), we had read §924(c) to
impose no penalty when the predicate crime itself pre
scribed a firearm enhancement; similarly, Abbott and
Gould now read §924(c) to impose no penalty when the
Guidelines prescribe a firearm enhancement to the predi
cate sentence. The 1984 legislation “repudiated” Busic,
clarifying that §924(c) applied even when the predicate
crime already “provides for an enhanced punishment if
committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or
device.” United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 10 (1997)

Between 1984 and 1998, Congress expanded the reach
