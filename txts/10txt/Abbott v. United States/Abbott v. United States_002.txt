ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus

Held: A defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum speci
fied for his conduct in §924(c), unless another provision of law di
rected to conduct proscribed by §924(c) imposes an even greater
mandatory minimum. Pp. 5–18.
(a) Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of
1968, but the “except” clause was not added until 1998. Under the
pre-1998 text, it is undisputed, separate counts of conviction did not
preempt §924(c) sentences, and Abbott and Gould would have been
correctly sentenced under §924(c). The question here is whether
Congress’ 1998 reformulation of §924(c) rendered their sentences ex
cessive. The 1998 alteration responded primarily to Bailey v. United
States, 516 U. S. 137, which held that §924(c)(1)’s ban on “use” of a
firearm did not reach “mere possession” of a weapon, id., at 144. In
addition to bringing possession within the statute’s compass, Con
gress increased the severity of §924(c) sentences by changing “once
mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences,” United
States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___, and by elevating the sentences
for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.
Congress also restructured the provision, “divid[ing] what was once a
lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs,” id., at ___,
and it added the “except” clause at issue. Pp. 5–8.
(b) The leading portion of the “except” clause now prefacing
§924(c)(1)(A) refers to a “greater minimum sentence . . . otherwise
provided by [§924(c) itself]”; the second segment of the clause refers
to a greater minimum provided outside §924(c) “by any other provi
sion of law.” To determine whether a greater minimum sentence is
“otherwise provided . . . by any other provision of law,” the key ques
tion is: otherwise provided for what? Most courts have answered: for
the conduct §924(c) proscribes, i.e., possessing a firearm in connection
with a predicate crime.
Abbott and Gould disagree. Gould would apply the “except” clause
whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater
minimum sentence. Abbott argues that the minimum sentence “oth
erwise provided” must be one imposed for the criminal transaction
that triggered §924(c) or, in the alternative, for a firearm offense in
volving the same firearm that triggered §924(c). These three inter
pretations share a common, but implausible, premise: that Congress
in 1998 adopted a less aggressive mode of applying §924(c), one that
significantly reduced the severity of the provision’s impact on defen
dants. The pre-1998 version of §924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence
to be imposed on top of the sentence received for the predicate crime
or any separate firearm conviction. It is unlikely that Congress
meant a prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed “An Act [t]o throttle
criminal use of guns,” to effect a departure so great from §924(c)’s
