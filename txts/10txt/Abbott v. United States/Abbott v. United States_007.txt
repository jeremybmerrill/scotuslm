Opinion of the Court

longer term for conduct violating §924(c). For example,
the mandatory minimum sentence for a §924(c) offense is
five years, but if the firearm is brandished, the minimum
rises to seven years, and if the firearm is discharged, to
ten years. §924(c)(1)(A)(i), (ii), (iii). A defendant who
possessed, brandished, and discharged a firearm in viola
tion of §924(c) would thus face a mandatory minimum
term of ten years.
We hold, in accord with the courts below, and in line
with the majority of the Courts of Appeals, that a defen
dant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a
§924(c) conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by
virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a
different count of conviction. Under the “except” clause as
we comprehend it, a §924(c) offender is not subject to
stacked sentences for violating §924(c). If he possessed,
brandished, and discharged a gun, the mandatory penalty
would be 10 years, not 22. He is, however, subject to the
highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in
§924(c), unless another provision of law directed to con
duct proscribed by §924(c) imposes an even greater man
datory minimum.
I
Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions,
were each charged with violating §924(c)(1)(A)(i) by pos
sessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking
crime. Abbott’s case was tried to a jury in the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, which convicted him on the
§924(c) count and three others: two predicate trafficking
counts, 21 U. S. C. §§841, 846, and being a felon in posses
sion of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. §922(g). Given Abbott’s
extensive criminal history, his felon-in-possession convic
tion triggered a 15-year mandatory minimum under the
Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e).
The District Court sentenced Abbott to the 15 years man
