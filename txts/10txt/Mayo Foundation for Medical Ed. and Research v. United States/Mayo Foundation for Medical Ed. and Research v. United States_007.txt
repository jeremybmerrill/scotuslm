MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.
UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

568 F. 3d 675, 677 (CA8 2009).
Facing that flood of claims, the Treasury Department
“determined that it [wa]s necessary to provide additional
clarification of the ter[m]” “student” as used in
§3121(b)(10), particularly with respect to individuals who
perform “services that are in the nature of on the job
training.” 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (2004). The Department
proposed an amended rule for comment and held a public
hearing on it. See id., at 76405.
On December 21, 2004, the Department adopted an
amended rule prescribing that an employee’s service is
“incident” to his studies only when “[t]he educational
aspect of the relationship between the employer and the
employee, as compared to the service aspect of the rela
tionship, [is] predominant.” Id., at 76408; Treas. Reg.
§31.3121(b)(10)–2(d)(3)(i), 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–
2(d)(3)(i) (2005). The rule categorically provides that
“[t]he services of a full-time employee”—as defined by the
employer’s policies, but in any event including any em
ployee normally scheduled to work 40 hours or more per
week—“are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing
a course of study.” 69 Fed. Reg. 76408; Treas. Reg.
§31.3121(b)(10)–2(d)(3)(iii), 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–
2(d)(3)(iii) (the full-time employee rule). The amended
provision clarifies that the Department’s analysis “is not
affected by the fact that the services performed . . . may
have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.”
Ibid. The rule also includes as an example the case of
“Employee E,” who is employed by “University V” as a
medical resident.
69 Fed. Reg. 76409; Treas. Reg.
§31.3121(b)(10)–2(e), 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–2(e) (Exam
ple 4). Because Employee E’s “normal work schedule calls
for [him] to perform services 40 or more hours per week,”
the rule provides that his service is “not incident to and for
the purpose of pursuing a course of study,” and he accord
ingly is not an exempt “student” under §3121(b)(10). 69
