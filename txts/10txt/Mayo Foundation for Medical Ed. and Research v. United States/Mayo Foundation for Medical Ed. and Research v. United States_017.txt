14 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.
UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 302 (1967).
As the Treasury Department has explained, moreover,
the full-time employee rule has more to recommend it
than administrative convenience. The Department rea
sonably determined that taxing residents under FICA
would further the purpose of the Social Security Act and
comport with this Court’s precedent. As the Treasury
Department appreciated, this Court has understood the
terms of the Social Security Act to “ ‘import a breadth of
coverage,’ ” 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (quoting Social Security Bd.
v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 365 (1946)), and we have in
structed that “exemptions from taxation are to be con
strued narrowly,” Bingler v. Johnson, 394 U. S. 741, 752
(1969). Although Mayo contends that medical residents
have not yet begun their “working lives” because they are
not “fully trained,” Reply Brief for Petitioners 13 (internal
quotation marks omitted), the Department certainly did
not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors—“who
work long hours, serve as highly skilled professionals, and
typically share some or all of the terms of employment of
career employees”—are the kind of workers that Congress
intended to both contribute to and benefit from the Social
Security system. 69 Fed. Reg. 8608.
The Department’s rule takes into account the SSA’s
concern that exempting residents from FICA would de
prive residents and their families of vital disability and
survivorship benefits that Social Security provides. Id., at
8605. Mayo wonders whether the full-time employee rule
will result in residents being taxed under FICA but denied
coverage by the SSA. The Government informs us, how
ever, that the SSA continues to adhere to its longstanding
position that medical residents are not students and thus
remain eligible for coverage. Brief for United States 29–
30; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33–34.
