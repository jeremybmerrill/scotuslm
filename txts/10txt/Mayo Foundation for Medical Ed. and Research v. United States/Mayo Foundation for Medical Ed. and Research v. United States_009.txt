MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.
UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

(2010).
II 

A

We begin our analysis with the first step of the two-part
framework announced in Chevron, supra, at 842–843, and
ask whether Congress has “directly addressed the precise
question at issue.” We agree with the Court of Appeals
that Congress has not done so. The statute does not de
fine the term “student,” and does not otherwise attend to
the precise question whether medical residents are subject
to FICA. See 26 U. S. C. §3121(b)(10).
Mayo nonetheless contends that the Treasury Depart
ment’s full-time employee rule must be rejected under
Chevron step one. Mayo argues that the dictionary defini

the mind ‘to the acquisition of learning, whether by means
of books, observation, or experiment’ ”—plainly encom

Universal Dictionary 2049–2050 (3d ed. 1955)). And,
Mayo adds, residents are not excluded from that category
by the only limitation on students Congress has imposed
under the statute—that they “be ‘enrolled and regularly
attending classes at [a] school.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 22
(quoting 26 U. S. C. §3121(b)(10)).
Mayo’s reading does not eliminate the statute’s ambigu
ity as applied to working professionals. In its reply brief,
Mayo acknowledges that a full-time professor taking
evening classes—a person who presumably would satisfy
the statute’s class-enrollment requirement and apply his
mind to learning—could be excluded from the exemption
and taxed because he is not “ ‘predominant[ly]’ ” a student.
Reply Brief for Petitioners 7. Medical residents might
likewise be excluded on the same basis; the statute itself
does not resolve the ambiguity.
The District Court interpreted §3121(b)(10) as unambig
