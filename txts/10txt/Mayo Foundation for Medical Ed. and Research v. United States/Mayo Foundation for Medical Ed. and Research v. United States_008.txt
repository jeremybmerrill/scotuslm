Opinion of the Court

Fed. Reg. 76409, 76410; Treas. Reg. §31.3121(b)(10)–2(e),
26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–2(e) (Example 4).
C
After the Department promulgated the full-time em
ployee rule, Mayo filed suit seeking a refund of the money
it had withheld and paid on its residents’ stipends during
the second quarter of 2005. 503 F. Supp. 2d 1164, 1166–
1167 (Minn. 2007); Regents of Univ. of Minn. v. United
States, No. 06–5084 (D Minn., Apr. 1, 2008), App. to Pet.
for Cert. C–47a. Mayo asserted that its residents were
exempt under §3121(b)(10) and that the Treasury De
partment’s full-time employee rule was invalid.
The District Court granted Mayo’s motion for summary
judgment. The court held that the full-time employee rule
is inconsistent with the unambiguous text of §3121, which
the court understood to dictate that “an employee is a
‘student’ so long as the educational aspect of his service
predominates over the service aspect of the relationship
with his employer.” 503 F. Supp. 2d, at 1175. The court
also determined that the factors governing this Court’s
analysis of regulations set forth in National Muffler Deal
ers Assn., Inc. v. United States, 440 U. S. 472 (1979), “indi
cate that the full-time employee exception is invalid.” 503
F. Supp. 2d, at 1176; see App. to Pet. for Cert. C–54a.
The Government appealed, and the Court of Appeals
reversed. 568 F. 3d 675. Applying our opinion in Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837 (1984), the Court of Appeals concluded that
“the statute is silent or ambiguous on the question
whether a medical resident working for the school full
time is a ‘student’ ” for purposes of §3121(b)(10), and that
the Department’s amended regulation “is a permissible
interpretation of the statut[e].” 568 F. 3d, at 679–680,
683.
We granted Mayo’s petition for certiorari. 560 U. S. ___
