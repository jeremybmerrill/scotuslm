Opinion of the Court

formed in the employ of . . . a school, college, or university
. . . if such service is performed by a student who is en
rolled and regularly attending classes at such school,
college, or university.” §3121(b)(10) (2006 ed.). The Social
Security Act, which governs workers’ eligibility for bene
fits, contains a corresponding student exception materially
identical to §3121(b)(10). 42 U. S. C. §410(a)(10).
Since 1951, the Treasury Department has applied the
student exception to exempt from taxation students who
work for their schools “as an incident to and for the pur
pose of pursuing a course of study” there. 16 Fed. Reg.
12474 (adopting Treas. Regs. 127, §408.219(c)); see Treas.
Reg. §31.3121(b)(10)–2(d), 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–2(d)
(2010). Until 2005, the Department determined whether
an individual’s work was “incident to” his studies by per
forming a case-by-case analysis. The primary considera
tions in that analysis were the number of hours worked
and the course load taken. See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 78–17,
1978–1 Cum. Bull. 307 (services of individual “employed
on a full-time basis” with a part-time course load are “not
incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of
study”).
For its part, the Social Security Administration (SSA)
also articulated in its regulations a case-by-case approach
to the corresponding student exception in the Social Secu
rity Act. See 20 CFR §404.1028(c) (1998). The SSA has,
however, “always held that resident physicians are not
students.” SSR 78–3, 1978 Cum. Bull. 55–56. In 1998,
the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the
SSA could not categorically exclude residents from student
status, given that its regulations provided for a case-by
case approach. See Minnesota v. Apfel, 151 F. 3d 742,
747–748. Following that decision, the Internal Revenue
Service received more than 7,000 claims seeking FICA tax
refunds on the ground that medical residents qualified as
students under §3121(b)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code.
