Opinion of the Court 


*
*
* 

We do not doubt that Mayo’s residents are engaged in a
valuable educational pursuit or that they are students of
their craft. The question whether they are “students” for
purposes of §3121, however, is a different matter. Because
it is one to which Congress has not directly spoken, and
because the Treasury Department’s rule is a reasonable
construction of what Congress has said, the judgment of
the Court of Appeals must be affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
