Opinion of the Court

the way in which the regulation evolved. 440 U. S., at
477. The District Court in this case cited each of these
factors in rejecting the Treasury Department’s rule, noting
in particular that the regulation had been promulgated
after an adverse judicial decision. See 503 F. Supp. 2d, at
1176; see also Brief for Petitioners 41–44 (relying on the
same considerations).
Under Chevron, in contrast, deference to an agency’s
interpretation of an ambiguous statute does not turn on
such considerations.
We have repeatedly held that
“[a]gency inconsistency is not a basis for declining to
analyze the agency’s interpretation under the Chevron
framework.” National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.
v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 981 (2005);
accord, Eurodif S. A., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10). We
have instructed that “neither antiquity nor contempora
neity with [a] statute is a condition of [a regulation’s]
validity.” Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517
U. S. 735, 740 (1996). And we have found it immaterial to
our analysis that a “regulation was prompted by litiga
tion.” Id., at 741. Indeed, in United Dominion Industries,
Inc. v. United States, 532 U. S. 822, 838 (2001), we ex
pressly invited the Treasury Department to “amend its
regulations” if troubled by the consequences of our resolu
tion of the case.
Aside from our past citation of National Muffler, Mayo
has not advanced any justification for applying a less
deferential standard of review to Treasury Department
regulations than we apply to the rules of any other agency.
In the absence of such justification, we are not inclined
to carve out an approach to administrative review good
for tax law only. To the contrary, we have expressly
“[r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of maintaining a uniform
approach to judicial review of administrative action.”
Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 154 (1999). See, e.g.,
Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U. S. 212, 222–
