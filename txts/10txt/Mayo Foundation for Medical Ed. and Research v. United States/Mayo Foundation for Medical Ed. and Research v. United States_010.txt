Opinion of the Court

uously foreclosing the Department’s rule by mandating
that an employee be deemed “a ‘student’ so long as the
educational aspect of his service predominates over the
service aspect of the relationship with his employer.” 503
F. Supp. 2d, at 1175. We do not think it possible to glean
so much from the little that §3121 provides. In any event,
the statutory text still would offer no insight into how
Congress intended predominance to be determined or
whether Congress thought that medical residents would
satisfy the requirement.
To the extent Congress has specifically addressed medi
cal residents in §3121, moreover, it has expressly excluded
these doctors from exemptions they might otherwise in
voke. See 26 U. S. C. §§3121(b)(6)(B), (7)(C)(ii) (excluding
medical residents from exemptions available to employees
of the District of Columbia and the United States). That
choice casts doubt on any claim that Congress specifically
intended to insulate medical residents from FICA’s reach
in the first place.
In sum, neither the plain text of the statute nor the
District Court’s interpretation of the exemption “speak[s]
with the precision necessary to say definitively whether
[the statute] applies to” medical residents. United States

In the typical case, such an ambiguity would lead us
inexorably to Chevron step two, under which we may not
disturb an agency rule unless it is “ ‘arbitrary or capricious
in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.’ ”

agree over the proper framework for evaluating an am
biguous provision of the Internal Revenue Code.
