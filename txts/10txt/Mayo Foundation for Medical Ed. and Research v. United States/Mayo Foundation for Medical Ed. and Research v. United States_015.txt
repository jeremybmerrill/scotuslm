12 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.
UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

regulations for the enforcement” of the Internal Revenue
Code. 26 U. S. C. §7805(a). We have found such “express
congressional authorizations to engage in the process of
rulemaking” to be “a very good indicator of delegation
meriting Chevron treatment.” Mead, supra, at 229. The
Department issued the full-time employee rule only after
notice-and-comment procedures, 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, again
a consideration identified in our precedents as a “signifi
cant” sign that a rule merits Chevron deference. Mead,
supra, at 230–231; see, e.g., Long Island Care at Home,
Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 173–174 (2007).
We have explained that “the ultimate question is
whether Congress would have intended, and expected,
courts to treat [the regulation] as within, or outside, its
delegation to the agency of ‘gap-filling’ authority.” Id., at
173 (emphasis deleted). In the Long Island Care case, we
found that Chevron provided the appropriate standard of
review “[w]here an agency rule sets forth important indi
vidual rights and duties, where the agency focuses fully
and directly upon the issue, where the agency uses full
notice-and-comment procedures to promulgate a rule,
[and] where the resulting rule falls within the statutory
grant of authority.” 551 U. S., at 173. These same consid
erations point to the same result here. This case falls
squarely within the bounds of, and is properly analyzed
under, Chevron and Mead.
C
The full-time employee rule easily satisfies the second
step of Chevron, which asks whether the Department’s
rule is a “reasonable interpretation” of the enacted text.
467 U. S., at 844. To begin, Mayo accepts that “the ‘educa
tional aspect of the relationship between the employer and
the employee, as compared to the service aspect of the
relationship, [must] be predominant’ ” in order for an
individual to qualify for the exemption. Reply Brief for
