MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION 

AND RESEARCH ET AL. v. UNITED STATES

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
No. 09–837.

Argued November 8, 2010—Decided January 11, 2011

Petitioners (hereinafter Mayo) offer residency programs to doctors who
have graduated from medical school and seek additional instruction
in a chosen specialty. Those programs train doctors primarily
through hands-on experience. Although residents are required to
take part in formal educational activities, these doctors generally
spend the bulk of their time—typically 50 to 80 hours a week—caring
for patients. Mayo pays its residents annual “stipends” of over
$40,000 and also provides them with health insurance, malpractice
insurance, and paid vacation time.
The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) requires employ
ees and employers to pay taxes on all “wages” employees receive, 26
U. S. C. §§3101(a), 3111(a), and defines “wages” to include “all remu

“any service . . . performed . . . by an employee for the person employ
ing him,” §3121(b), but excludes from taxation any “service performed
in the employ of . . . a school, college, or university . . . if such service
is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending
classes at [the school],” §3121(b)(10). Since 1951, the Treasury De
partment has construed the student exception to exempt from taxa
tion students who work for their schools “as an incident to and for the
purpose of pursuing a course of study.” 16 Fed. Reg. 12474. In 2004,
the Department issued regulations providing that “[t]he services of a
full-time employee”—which includes an employee normally scheduled
to work 40 hours or more per week—“are not incident to and for the
purpose of pursuing a course of study.” 26 CFR §31.3121(b)(10)–
2(d)(3)(iii). The Department explained that this analysis “is not af
