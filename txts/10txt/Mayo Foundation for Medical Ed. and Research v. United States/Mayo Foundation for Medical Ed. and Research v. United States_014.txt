Opinion of the Court

in a rule adopted under that “general authority” than
when it is “issued under a specific grant of authority to
define a statutory term or prescribe a method of executing
a statutory provision.” Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452
U. S. 247, 253 (1981); United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co.,
455 U. S. 16, 24 (1982) (quoting Rowan).
Since Rowan and Vogel were decided, however, the
administrative landscape has changed significantly. We
have held that Chevron deference is appropriate “when it
appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency
generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that
the agency interpretation claiming deference was promul
gated in the exercise of that authority.” Mead, 533 U. S.,
at 226–227. Our inquiry in that regard does not turn on
whether Congress’s delegation of authority was general or
specific. For example, in National Cable & Telecommuni
cations Assn., supra, we held that the Federal Communi
cations Commission was delegated “the authority to prom
ulgate binding legal rules” entitled to Chevron deference
under statutes that gave the Commission “the authority to
‘execute and enforce,’ ” and “to ‘prescribe such rules and
regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to
carry out the provisions’ of,” the Communications Act of
1934. 545 U. S., at 980–981 (quoting 47 U. S. C. §§151,
201(b)). See also Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U. S. 83, 87,
88–89 (1990) (applying Chevron deference to rule promul
gated pursuant to delegation of “general authority to
‘make rules and regulations and to establish procedures,
not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter,
which are necessary or appropriate to carry out such
provisions’ ” (quoting 42 U. S. C. §405(a) (1982 ed.))).
We believe Chevron and Mead, rather than National
Muffler and Rowan, provide the appropriate framework
for evaluating the full-time employee rule. The Depart
ment issued the full-time employee rule pursuant to the
explicit authorization to “prescribe all needful rules and
