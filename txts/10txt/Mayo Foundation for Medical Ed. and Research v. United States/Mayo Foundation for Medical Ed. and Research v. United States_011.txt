MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.
UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

to review a tax regulation in National Muffler, 440 U. S.
472. 	There we explained:
“A regulation may have particular force if it is a sub
stantially contemporaneous construction of the stat
ute by those presumed to have been aware of congres
sional intent. If the regulation dates from a later
period, the manner in which it evolved merits inquiry.
Other relevant considerations are the length of time
the regulation has been in effect, the reliance placed
on it, the consistency of the Commissioner’s interpre
tation, and the degree of scrutiny Congress has
devoted to the regulation during subsequent re
enactments of the statute.” Id., at 477.
The Government, on the other hand, contends that the
National Muffler standard has been superseded by Chev
ron. The sole question for the Court at step two under the
Chevron analysis is “whether the agency’s answer is based
on a permissible construction of the statute.” 467 U. S., at
843.
Since deciding Chevron, we have cited both National
Muffler and Chevron in our review of Treasury Depart
ment regulations. See, e.g., United States v. Cleveland
Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 219 (2001) (citing
National Muffler); Cottage Savings Assn. v. Commissioner,
499 U. S. 554, 560–561 (1991) (same); United States v.
Boyle, 469 U. S. 241, 246, n. 4 (1985) (citing Chevron); see
also Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 523 U. S. 382,
387, 389 (1998) (citing Chevron and Cottage Savings).
Although we have not thus far distinguished between
National Muffler and Chevron, they call for different
analyses of an ambiguous statute. Under National Muf
fler, for example, a court might view an agency’s interpre
tation of a statute with heightened skepticism when it has
not been consistent over time, when it was promulgated
years after the relevant statute was enacted, or because of
