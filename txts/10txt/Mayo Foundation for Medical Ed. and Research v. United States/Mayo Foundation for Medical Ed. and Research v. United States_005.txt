UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

spend between 50 and 80 hours a week caring for patients,
typically examining and diagnosing them, prescribing
medication, recommending plans of care, and performing
certain procedures. Residents are generally supervised in
this work by more senior residents and by faculty mem

and $56,000 and provided them with health insurance,
malpractice insurance, and paid vacation time.

employee for the person employing him.” §3121(b).
Congress has, however, exempted certain categories of
service and individuals from FICA’s demands. As relevant
here, Congress has excluded from taxation “service per
