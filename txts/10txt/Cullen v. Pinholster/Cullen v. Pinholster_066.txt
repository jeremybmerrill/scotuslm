SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

389 (2005), for an attorney to rely on the possibility that
the court might preclude aggravating evidence pursuant
to a “legal technicality” without any backup plan in place
in case the court denied the motion, ante, at 19. No rea
sonable attorney would pursue such a risky strategy. I do
not understand the majority to suggest otherwise.
Instead, I understand the majority’s conclusion that
counsel’s actions were reasonable to rest on its belief that
they did have a backup plan: a family-sympathy defense.
In reaching this conclusion, the majority commits the
same Strickland error that we corrected, applying
§2254(d)(1), in Wiggins: It holds a purportedly “tactical
judgment” to be reasonable without assessing “the ade
quacy of the investigatio[n] supporting [that] judgmen[t],”
539 U. S., at 521. As we stated in Strickland:
“[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation
of law and facts relevant to plausible options are vir
tually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made af
ter less than complete investigation are reasonable
precisely to the extent that reasonable professional
judgments support the limitations on investigation.
In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable
investigations or to make a reasonable decision that
makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any
ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to inves
tigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in
all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of
deference to counsel’s judgments.” 466 U. S., at 690–
691.
We have repeatedly applied this principle since Strick
land. See Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per
curiam) (slip op., at 9); Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. ___,
___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 10); Wiggins, 539 U. S.,
