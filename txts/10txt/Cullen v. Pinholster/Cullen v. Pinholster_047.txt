CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

enacting AEDPA, Congress generally barred evidentiary
hearings for petitioners who did not “exercise diligence in
pursuing their claims” in state court. Michael Williams,
529 U. S., at 436; see also §2254(e)(2). Importantly, it did
not impose any express limit on evidentiary hearings for
petitioners who had been diligent in state court. See id.,
at 436 (“[T]he statute does not equate prisoners who exer
cise diligence in pursuing their claims with those who do
not”). For those petitioners, Congress left the decision to
hold a hearing “to the sound discretion of district courts.”
Landrigan, 550 U. S., at 473.
Faced with situations in which a diligent petitioner
offers additional evidence in federal court, the courts of
appeals have taken two approaches to applying
§2254(d)(1). Some courts have held that when a federal
court admits new evidence supporting a claim adjudicated
on the merits in state court, §2254(d)(1) does not apply at
all and the federal court may review the claim de novo.
See ante, at 12; Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649, 653
(2004) (per curiam); see, e.g., Winston v. Kelly, 592 F. 3d
535, 555–556 (CA4 2010). I agree with the majority’s
rejection of this approach. See ante, at 12. It would un
dermine the comity principles motivating AEDPA to de
cline to defer to a state-court adjudication of a claim
because the state court, through no fault of its own,
lacked all the relevant evidence.5

course, §2254(d)(1) only applies when a state court has adjudi
cated a claim on the merits. There may be situations in which new
evidence supporting a claim adjudicated on the merits gives rise to an
altogether different claim. See, e.g., Reply Brief for Petitioner 10–11
(evidence withheld by the prosecutor relating to one claim may give rise
to a separate claim under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)). The
majority opinion does not foreclose this possibility.
I assume that the majority does not intend to suggest that review is
limited to the state-court record when a petitioner’s inability to develop
the facts supporting his claim was the fault of the state court itself. See
generally Tr. of Oral Arg. in Bell v. Kelly, O. T. 2008, No. 07–1223.
