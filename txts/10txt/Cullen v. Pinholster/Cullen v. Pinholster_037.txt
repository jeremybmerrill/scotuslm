CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of ALITO, J.

would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying
offense.” §2254(e)(2)(B).
Even when the petitioner does satisfy the diligence
standard adopted in Williams v. Taylor, supra, a hearing
should not be held in federal court unless the new evi
dence that the petitioner seeks to introduce was not and
could not have been offered in the state-court proceeding.
Section 2254(e)(2) bars a hearing in certain situations, but
it does not mean that a hearing is allowed in all other
situations. See Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473–
474 (2007). The whole thrust of AEDPA is essentially to
reserve federal habeas relief for those cases in which the
state courts acted unreasonably. See §§2254(d)(1), (2),
(e)(1). Permitting a petitioner to obtain federal habeas
relief on the basis of evidence that could have been but
was not offered in state court would upset this scheme.
In this case, for essentially the reasons set out in the
dissent from the Court of Appeals’ en banc decision, see
Pinholster v. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 688–691 (CA9 2009)
(opinion of Kozinski, J.), I would hold that the federal
court hearing should not have been held because respon
dent did not diligently present his new evidence to the
California courts. And I join all but Part II of the opinion
of the Court, as I agree that the decision of the state court
represented a reasonable application of clearly established
Supreme Court precedent in light of the state-court record.
