CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Syllabus
(a) As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen
alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), §2254 sets several limits on a federal
court’s power to grant habeas relief to a state prisoner. As relevant
here, a claim that has been “adjudicated on the merits in State court
proceedings,” “shall not be granted . . . unless the adjudication” “(1)
resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreason
able application of, clearly established Federal law,” or “(2) resulted
in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the
facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”
§2254(d). This “difficult to meet,” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.
___, ___, and “ ‘highly deferential standard’ . . . demands that state
court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,” Woodford v. Vis
ciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24. Section 2254(d)(1)’s backward-looking lan
guage—“resulted in” and “involved”—requires an examination of the
state-court decision at the time it was made. It follows that the re
cord under review is also limited to the record in existence at that
same time—i.e., the state-court record. This understanding is com
pelled by “the broader context of the statute as a whole,” which dem
onstrates Congress’ intent to channel prisoners’ claims first to state
courts. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341. It is also con
sistent with this Court’s precedents, which emphasize that
§2254(d)(1) review focuses on what a state court knew and did. See,
e.g., Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71–72. Moreover, it is consis
tent with Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474, which explained
that a federal habeas court is “not required to hold an evidentiary
hearing” when the state-court record “precludes habeas relief” under
§2254(d)’s limitations. The Ninth Circuit wrongly interpreted Wil
liams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, and Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649,
as supporting the contrary view. Pp. 8–12.
(b) This holding does not render superfluous §2254(e)(2)—which
limits the federal habeas courts’ discretion to take new evidence in an
evidentiary hearing. At a minimum, §2254(e)(2) still restricts their
discretion in claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state
court. Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence
in federal court, AEDPA’s statutory scheme is designed to strongly
discourage them from doing so. Pp. 13–14.
(c) Remand for a properly limited review is inappropriate here,
because the Ninth Circuit ruled, in the alternative, that Pinholster
merited habeas relief on the state-court record alone. P. 14.
2. On the record before the state court, Pinholster was not entitled
to federal habeas relief. Pp. 14‘–31.
(a) To satisfy §2254(d)(1)’s “unreasonable application” prong, he
must show that “there was no reasonable basis” for the State Su
preme Court’s summary decision. Richter, supra, at ___. Pp. 15–16.
