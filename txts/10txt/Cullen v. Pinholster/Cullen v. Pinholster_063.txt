CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

familial history of “severe psychiatric disorders,” “a history
of seizure disorders of unknown etiology,” “repeated head
traumas,” “an abnormal EEG,” and “evidence of mental
disturbance during Mr. Pinholster’s childhood and some
degree of brain damage.” Id., at ER–493. He also opined
that “there [was] voluminous mitigating evidence which
includes a childhood of physical abuse, emotional neglect,
and a family history of mental illness and criminal behav
ior.” Id., at ER–494.
The District Court stayed the federal proceedings while
Pinholster sought state-court review of claims the District
Court deemed unexhausted. Pinholster’s second habeas
submission to the California Supreme Court included
Stalberg’s declaration. That court summarily denied
Pinholster’s petition on the merits.
Pinholster returned to Federal District Court and filed
an amended petition. After an evidentiary hearing, the
District Court concluded that Pinholster had demon
strated deficient performance and prejudice under Strick
land.19 The Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed. 590
F. 3d 651.

As the majority notes, Pinholster’s claim arises under
Strickland v. Washington. “The benchmark for judging
any claim of ineffectiveness [under Strickland] must be
whether counsel’s conduct so undermined the proper
functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot
be relied on as having produced a just result.” 466 U. S.,

19 The District Court based its decision on the evidence adduced at an
evidentiary hearing. The District Court did not apply 28 U. S. C.
§2254(d) because it thought, erroneously, that the California Supreme
Court had not adjudicated Pinholster’s claim on the merits. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 257. For the reasons I discuss, however, the District
Court could have concluded that Pinholster had satisfied §2254(d)(1) on
the basis of the state-court record alone.
