CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of the Court

is “[r]are” that constitutionally competent representation
will require “any one technique or approach.” Richter, 562
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). The Court of Appeals erred
in attributing strict rules to this Court’s recent case law.17
Nor did the Court of Appeals properly apply the strong
presumption of competence that Strickland mandates.
The court dismissed the dissent’s application of the pre­
sumption as “fabricat[ing] an excuse that the attorneys
themselves could not conjure up.” 590 F. 3d, at 673. But
Strickland specifically commands that a court “must
indulge [the] strong presumption” that counsel “made all
significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable profes­
sional judgment.” 466 U. S., at 689–690. The Court of
Appeals was required not simply to “give [the] attorneys
the benefit of the doubt,” 590 F. 3d, at 673, but to affirma­
tively entertain the range of possible “reasons Pinholster’s
counsel may have had for proceeding as they did,” id., at
692 (Kozinski, C. J., dissenting). See also Richter, supra,
at ___ (slip op., at 20) (“Strickland . . . calls for an inquiry
into the objective reasonableness of counsel’s performance,
not counsel’s subjective state of mind”).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR questions whether it would have
been a reasonable professional judgment for Pinholster’s
trial counsel to adopt a family-sympathy mitigation de­
fense. Post, at 27. She cites no evidence, however, that
such an approach would have been inconsistent with the
standard of professional competence in capital cases that
prevailed in Los Angeles in 1984. Indeed, she does not
contest that, at the time, the defense bar in California had
been using that strategy. See supra, at 19; post, at 28,
n. 21. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR relies heavily on Wiggins, but
——————
17 The Court of Appeals was not necessarily wrong in looking to other
precedents of this Court for guidance, but “the Strickland test ‘of
necessity requires a case-by-case examination of the evidence.’ ” Terry
Williams, 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000) (quoting Wright v. West, 505 U. S.
277, 308 (1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment)).
