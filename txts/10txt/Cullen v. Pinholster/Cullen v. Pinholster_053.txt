CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

between §§2254(d)(1) and 2254(e)(2). As noted above, we
admonished district courts to consider whether a peti
tioner’s allegations, if proved true, would satisfy §2254(d)
in determining whether to grant a hearing. After high
lighting the deference owed to state courts under
§§2254(d) and 2254(e)(1), we stated:
“In deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing,
a federal court must consider whether such a hearing
could enable an applicant to prove the petition’s fac
tual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the
applicant to federal habeas relief. Because the defer
ential standards prescribed by §2254 control whether
to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into
account those standards in deciding whether an evi
dentiary hearing is appropriate.” 550 U. S., at 474 (ci
tation omitted).
By instructing district courts to consider the §2254(d)
standards in deciding whether to grant a hearing, we must
have understood that the evidence admitted at a hearing
could be considered in the §2254(d)(1) analysis. See Brief
for American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 9
(“The whole point of Landrigan’s admonition that the
court must decide whether to hold a hearing with an eye
on §2254(d)(1) is that some proffers of evidence will not
justify federal fact-finding in view of §2254(d)(1), but that
other proffers of proof will”).11
In Michael Williams, the warden argued that
§2254(e)(2) bars an evidentiary hearing whenever a peti
tioner was unable to develop the factual record in state
court, “whether or not through his own fault or neglect.”
——————
11 The majority overlooks this aspect of Landrigan. It quotes Landri
gan’s observation that “if the record refutes the applicant’s factual
allegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not
required to hold an evidentiary hearing,” 550 U. S., at 474, but that
statement has no bearing on the question decided by the Court today.
