VINCENT CULLEN, ACTING WARDEN, PETITIONER
v. SCOTT LYNN PINHOLSTER
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 4, 2011]


JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
I join Parts I and II of the Court’s opinion. I do not join
Part III, for I would send this case back to the Court of
Appeals so that it can apply the legal standards that Part
II announces to the complex facts of this case. Compare
ante, at 14–31 (majority opinion), with post, at 17–42
(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).
Like the Court, I believe that its understanding of
28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) does not leave AEDPA’s hearing
section, §2254(e), without work to do. An offender who
believes he is entitled to habeas relief must first present a
claim (including his evidence) to the state courts. If the
state courts reject the claim, then a federal habeas court
may review that rejection on the basis of the materials
considered by the state court. If the federal habeas court
finds that the state-court decision fails (d)’s test (or if (d)
does not apply), then an (e) hearing may be needed.
For example, if the state-court rejection assumed the
habeas petitioner’s facts (deciding that, even if those facts
were true, federal law was not violated), then (after find
ing the state court wrong on a (d) ground) an (e) hearing
might be needed to determine whether the facts alleged
were indeed true. Or if the state-court rejection rested on
a state ground, which a federal habeas court found inade
