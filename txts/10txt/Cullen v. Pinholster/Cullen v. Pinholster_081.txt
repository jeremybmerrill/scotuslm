CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

State’s own expert, Dr. Stalberg, testified to the “volumi
nous” mitigation evidence in Pinholster’s case. Record ER–
926.
In sum, the evidence confirmed what was already ap
parent from the state-court record: Pinholster’s counsel
failed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation,
and there was a reasonable probability that at least one
juror confronted with the “voluminous” mitigating evi
dence counsel should have discovered would have voted to
spare Pinholster’s life. Ibid. Accordingly, whether on the
basis of the state- or federal-court record, the courts below
correctly concluded that Pinholster had shown that the
California Supreme Court’s decision reflected an unrea
sonable application of Strickland.30

I cannot agree with either aspect of the Court’s ruling. I
fear the consequences of the Court’s novel interpretation
of §2254(d)(1) for diligent state habeas petitioners with
compelling evidence supporting their claims who were
unable, through no fault of their own, to present that
evidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims.
And the Court’s conclusion that the California Supreme
Court reasonably denied Pinholster’s ineffective
assistance-of-counsel claim overlooks counsel’s failure to
investigate obvious avenues of mitigation and the contrast
between the woefully inadequate mitigation case they
presented and the evidence they should and would have
discovered. I respectfully dissent.
——————
30 The State’s challenge in this Court is limited to the questions
whether the Federal District Court was entitled to consider the addi
tional evidence in the §2254(d)(1) analysis and whether Pinholster
satisfied §2254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court record. It has not
challenged the District Court’s ultimate conclusion that Pinholster had
proved that he was “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws
or treaties of the United States.” §2254(a).
