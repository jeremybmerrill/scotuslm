CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

tive-assistance-of-counsel claim was an unreasonable
application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668
(1984). There is no reason for the majority to decide
whether the §2254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state
court record because Pinholster satisfied §2254(d)(1) on
either the state- or federal-court record.

state-court decision is an unreasonable application of
Supreme Court precedent under §2254(d)(1), “review . . . is

provision’s text, the structure of the statute, and our
precedents.

To understand the significance of the majority’s holding,
it is important to view the issue in context. AEDPA’s
entire structure—which gives state courts the opportunity
to decide factual and legal questions in the first instance—
ensures that evidentiary hearings in federal habeas pro
ceedings are very rare. See N. King, F. Cheesman, & B.
Ostrom, Final Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in
U. S. District Courts 35–36 (2007) (evidentiary hearings
under AEDPA occur in 0.4 percent of noncapital cases and
9.5 percent of capital cases). Even absent the new restric
tion created by today’s holding, AEDPA erects multiple
hurdles to a state prisoner’s ability to introduce new evi
dence in a federal habeas proceeding.
First, “[u]nder the exhaustion requirement, a habeas
petitioner challenging a state conviction must first at
