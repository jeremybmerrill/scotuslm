CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

whether a state-court adjudication on the merits “resulted
in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unrea
sonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as
determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.”
Because this provision uses “backward-looking lan
guage”—i.e., past-tense verbs—the majority believes that
it limits review to the state-court record. Ante, at 9. But
both §§2254(d)(1) and 2254(d)(2) use “backward-looking
language,” and §2254(d)(2)—unlike §2254(d)(1)—expressly
directs district courts to base their review on “the evidence
presented in the State court proceeding.” If use of the past
tense were sufficient to indicate Congress’ intent to re
strict analysis to the state-court record, the phrase “in
light of the evidence presented in the State court proceed
ing” in §2254(d)(2) would be superfluous. The majority’s
construction of §2254(d)(1) fails to give meaning to Con
gress’ decision to include language referring to the evi
dence presented to the state court in §2254(d)(2). Cf.
Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29–30 (1997) (“Where
Congress includes particular language in one section of a
statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it
is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally
and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion”
(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).
Ignoring our usual “reluctan[ce] to treat statutory terms
as surplusage in any setting,” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534
U. S. 19, 31 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), the
majority characterizes the phrase appearing in §2254(d)(2)
as mere “clarifying language,” ante, at 12, n. 7. It specu
lates that “[t]he omission of clarifying language from
§2254(d)(1) just as likely reflects Congress’ belief that such
language was unnecessary as it does anything else.” Ante,
at 12–13, n. 7. The argument that this phrase is merely
“clarifying” might have more force, however, had Congress
included this phrase in §2254(d)(1) but not in §2254(d)(2).
As between the two provisions, §2254(d)(2)—which re
