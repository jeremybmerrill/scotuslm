SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

evidentiary hearing for a nondiligent petitioner unless the
petitioner can satisfy both §§2254(e)(2)(A) and (B), which
few petitioners can. Section 2254(e)(2) in this way incen
tivizes state petitioners to develop the factual basis of
their claims in state court.
To the limited extent that federal evidentiary hearings
are available under AEDPA, they ensure that petitioners
who diligently developed the factual basis of their claims
in state court, discovered new evidence after the state
court proceeding, and cannot return to state court retain
the ability to access the Great Writ. See ante, at 2 (ALITO,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). “When
Congress codified new rules governing this previously
judicially managed area of law, it did so without losing
sight of the fact that the ‘writ of habeas corpus plays a
vital role in protecting constitutional rights.’ ” Holland v.
Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16) (quoting
Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000)). Allowing a
petitioner to introduce new evidence at a hearing in the
limited circumstance permitted by §2254(e)(2) does not
upset the balance that Congress struck in AEDPA be

By construing
§2254(d)(1) to do the work of other provisions in AEDPA,
the majority has subverted Congress’ careful balance of
responsibilities. It has also created unnecessarily a brand
new set of procedural complexities that lower courts will
have to confront.3

The majority’s interpretation of §2254(d)(1) finds no
support in the provision’s text or the statute’s structure as
a whole.
