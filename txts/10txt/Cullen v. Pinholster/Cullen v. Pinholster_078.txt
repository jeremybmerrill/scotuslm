eral proceeding. See Decl. of Michael D. Abzug in Support
of Stipulated Ex Parte Application to Continue Eviden
tiary Hearing and Discovery Cut-Off and to Substitute
Counsel in Pinholster v. Calderon, No. CV 95–6240–GLT
(CD Cal.), p. 2. Relying in part on Pinholster’s abnormal
EEG, Dr. Olson opined that Pinholster’s childhood acci
dents “likely result[ed] in brain injury” and that these
injuries “conferred a risk of epilepsy.” Record ER–699 to
ER–700. He concluded that it was reasonably probable
that Pinholster had suffered from partial epilepsy since at

The State presented two experts: Dr. Stalberg, the
