CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Documentary evidence showed, directly contrary to
Brashear’s trial testimony, that Pinholster’s siblings had
very troubled pasts. Pinholster’s elder brother was ar
rested for armed burglary, robbery, and forcible rape of a
14-year-old with a deadly weapon. While in custody, he
was diagnosed as “catatonic-like” and “acutely psychotic,
probably suffering some type of schizophrenia.” Id., at
ER–219, ER–224. He later committed suicide.17 Pinhol
ster’s half sister, a recovering alcoholic, had been made a
ward of the juvenile court for prostitution and forcible
sexual battery on a 14-year-old.
Pinholster’s petition and exhibits described a long his
tory of emotional disturbance and neurological problems.
A former schoolteacher stated that, as a child, Pinholster
“seemed incapable of relating either to his peers or to
adults,” that “[i]t was even hard to maintain eye contact
with him,” and that “[h]is hyperactivity was so extreme
that [she] formed the opinion it probably had an organic
base.” Id., at ER–231. School records revealed that he
“talk[ed] to self continuously,” had “many grimaces,”
fought in his sleep, and could “control self for only 1 hour
per day.” Id., at ER–230, ER–233. He “show[ed] progres
sive deterioration each semester since Kindergarten.” Id.,
at ER–230. School officials recommended placement in a
school for emotionally handicapped students and referral
to a neurologist. At age nine, he had an abnormal EEG,
revealing “an organic basis for his behavior.” Id., at ER–
157, ER–234. Just months before the homicides, a doctor
recommended placement in the Hope Psychiatric Insti
tute, but this did not occur.
This and other evidence attached to the petition was

17 According

to Pinholster’s half sister, “The death of our brother Al
vin was a severe emotional blow to me and to Scott. I believed Scott’s
substance abuse (heroin) arose following and as a result of Alvin’s
death.” Record ER–314.
