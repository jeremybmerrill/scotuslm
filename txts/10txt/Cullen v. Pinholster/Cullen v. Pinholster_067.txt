CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

at 527; Terry Williams, 529 U. S., at 396.21
As these cases make clear, the prevailing professional
norms at the time of Pinholster’s trial required his attor
neys to “conduct a thorough investigation of the defen
dant’s background,” ibid. (citing 1 ABA Standards for
Criminal Justice 4–4.1, commentary, p. 4–55 (2d ed. 1980)
(hereinafter ABA Standards)), or “to make a reasonable
decision that makes particular investigations unneces
sary,” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 691.22 “In judging the
defense’s investigation, as in applying Strickland gener
ally, hindsight is discounted by pegging adequacy to ‘coun
sel’s perspective at the time’ investigative decisions are
made, and by giving a ‘heavy measure of deference to
counsel’s judgments.’ ” Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 381 (quot
ing Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689, 691; citation omitted). In
some cases, “reasonably diligent counsel may draw a line
when they have good reason to think further investigation
would be a waste.” Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 383; see, e.g.,
Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam)
(slip op., at 8); Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 794–795
(1987). In other cases, however, Strickland requires fur
ther investigation.
——————
21 I do not doubt that a decision to present a family-sympathy mitiga
tion defense might be consistent “with the standard of professional
competence in capital cases that prevailed in Los Angeles in 1984” in
some cases. Ante, at 24. My point is that even if counsel made a
strategic decision to proceed with such a defense, that decision was
unreasonable because it was based on an unreasonably incomplete
investigation.
22 See also 1 ABA Standards 4–4.1, commentary, at 4–55 (“Informa
tion concerning the defendant’s background, education, employment
record, mental and emotional stability, family relationships, and the
like, will be relevant, as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the
commission of the offense itself”). As we recognized in Strickland, the
ABA Standards, though not dispositive, “are guides to determining
what is reasonable.” 466 U. S., at 688; see also Wiggins v. Smith, 539
U. S. 510, 524 (2003).
