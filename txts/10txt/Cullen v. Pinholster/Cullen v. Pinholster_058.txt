SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ship with his stepfather, although his stepfather “some
times would lose his temper” with Pinholster, who “had a
mind of his own.” Id., at 7392–7393; see also id., at 7293
(stating that his stepfather was “at times” “abusive or

Brashear provided brief testimony regarding Pinhol
ster’s childhood. She described two car accidents—one
when she ran over him in the driveway and one when he
went through the windshield. Id., at 7389–7391. She

In closing argument, the prosecutor ridiculed Brashear’s

disciplined him. So what? I am sure you have all disci
plined your children. I was disciplined myself”); ibid. (“He
was run over by a car when he was three years old. That’s
very unfortunate. There is no evidence of any brain dam
