CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of the Court

___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14)). The Strickland standard
must be applied with “scrupulous care.” Richter, supra, at
___ (slip op., at 15). The Court of Appeals did not do so
here.

Even if his trial counsel had performed deficiently,
Pinholster also has failed to show that the California
Supreme Court must have unreasonably concluded that
Pinholster was not prejudiced. “[T]he question is whether
there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors,

supra, at 695 (“[A] court hearing an ineffectiveness claim
must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge
or jury”). Here, the same jury heard both the guilt and
penalty phases and was instructed to consider all the
evidence presented. Cf. Visciotti, 537 U. S., at 25 (noting
that the state habeas court had correctly considered miti­
gating evidence introduced during the guilt phase).
The State presented extensive aggravating evidence. As
we have already discussed, the jury watched Pinholster
revel in his extensive criminal history. Supra, at 21.
Then, during the penalty phase, the State presented evi­
dence that Pinholster had threatened to kill the State’s
lead witness, assaulted a man with a straight razor, and
kidnaped another person with a knife. The State showed
that Pinholster had a history of violent outbursts, includ­
ing striking and threatening a bailiff after a court proceed­
