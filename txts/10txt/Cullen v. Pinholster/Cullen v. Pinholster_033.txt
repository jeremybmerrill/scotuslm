Opinion of the Court

trial court found that the jury’s determination was “sup­
ported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence” and
added that “the factors in aggravation beyond all reason­
able doubt outweigh those in mitigation.” Clerk’s Tr.

There is no reasonable probability that the additional
evidence Pinholster presented in his state habeas proceed­
ings would have changed the jury’s verdict. The “new”
evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence at
trial. School and medical records basically substantiate
the testimony of Pinholster’s mother and brother. Decla­
rations from Pinholster’s siblings support his mother’s
testimony that his stepfather was abusive and explain
that Pinholster was beaten with fists, belts, and even
wooden boards.
To the extent the state habeas record includes new
factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of question­
able mitigating value. If Pinholster had called Dr. Woods
to testify consistently with his psychiatric report, Pinhol­
ster would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state
expert. See, e.g., Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 10–12) (taking into account
that certain mitigating evidence would have exposed the
petitioner to further aggravating evidence). The new
evidence relating to Pinholster’s family⎯their more seri­
ous substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal prob­
lems, see post, at 22⎯is also by no means clearly mitigat­
ing, as the jury might have concluded that Pinholster was
simply beyond rehabilitation. Cf. Atkins v. Virginia, 536
U. S. 304, 321 (2002) (recognizing that mitigating evidence
can be a “two-edged sword” that juries might find to show
future dangerousness).
The remaining new material in the state habeas record
is sparse. We learn that Pinholster’s brother Alvin died of
