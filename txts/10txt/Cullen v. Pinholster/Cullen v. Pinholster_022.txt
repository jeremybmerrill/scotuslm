CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of the Court

“highly deferential” look at counsel’s performance, Strick
land, supra, at 689, through the “deferential lens of
§2254(d),” Mirzayance, supra, at ___, n. 2 (slip op., at 9,
n. 2). Pinholster must demonstrate that it was necessarily
unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to con­
clude: (1) that he had not overcome the strong presump­
tion of competence; and (2) that he had failed to under­

Pinholster has not shown that the California Supreme
Court’s decision that he could not demonstrate deficient
performance by his trial counsel necessarily involved an

their criminal, mental, and substance abuse problems; his
schooling; and his medical and mental health history,
including his epileptic disorder. To support his allegation
that his trial counsel had “no reasonable tactical basis” for
the approach they took, Pinholster relied on statements

with Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3, Dettmar, one of Pinhol­
ster’s counsel, contended that because the State did not
provide notice, he “[was] not presently prepared to offer
anything by way of mitigation,” 52 Tr. 7250. In response
to the trial court’s inquiry as to whether a continuance
might be helpful, Dettmar noted that the only mitigation
witness he could think of was Pinholster’s mother. Addi­
tional time, Dettmar stated, would not “make a great deal
of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258.
We begin with the premise that “under the circum­
