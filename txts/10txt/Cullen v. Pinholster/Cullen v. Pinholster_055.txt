CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

None of the other cases cited by the majority supports
its result. In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000)
(Terry Williams), we interpreted §2254(d)(1) to ask
whether the state-court decision “identifies the correct
governing legal principle from this Court’s decisions but
unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the
prisoner’s case.” Id., at 413. However, we had no reason
to decide whether the §2254(d)(1) inquiry was limited to
the state-court record, as the District Court did not hold
an evidentiary hearing in that case. See id., at 372.
In Holland v. Jackson, we stated that “we have made
clear that whether a state court’s decision was unreason
able must be assessed in light of the record the court had
before it.” 542 U. S., at 652. In the next sentence, how
ever, we observed that the evidence at issue “could have
been the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the District
Court, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to
develop that evidence in state court.” Id., at 652–653. We
proceeded to find that the evidence was not properly ad
mitted under §2254(e)(2) before concluding that the Court
of Appeals had erred in its §2254(d)(1) analysis. Id., at
653; see also Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U. S. 74, 79 (2005)
(per curiam).
In sum, our cases reflect our recognition that it is some
times appropriate to consider new evidence in deciding
whether a petitioner can satisfy §2254(d)(1). In reading
our precedent to require the opposite conclusion, the ma
jority disregards the concerns that motivated our decision
in Michael Williams: Some petitioners, even if diligent,
——————
under §2254(d)(1), so it is unnecessary to reach the question whether
§2254(e)(2) would permit a hearing on the claim.” 529 U. S., at 444.
That statement merely reflects the fact that the Court of Appeals had
rejected that claim under §2254(d)(1) without considering whether the
petitioner was entitled to a hearing because the petitioner had not
requested a hearing on that claim. See Williams v. Taylor, 189 F. 3d
421, 425, 428–429 (CA4 1999).
