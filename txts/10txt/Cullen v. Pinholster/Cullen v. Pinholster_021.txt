Opinion of the Court

ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial.” 466
U. S., at 689. Thus, “[t]he benchmark for judging any
claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct
so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial
process that the trial cannot be relied on as having pro­
duced a just result.” Id., at 686 (emphasis added). The
Court acknowledged that “[t]here are countless ways to
provide effective assistance in any given case,” and that
“[e]ven the best criminal defense attorneys would not
defend a particular client in the same way.” Id., at 689.
Recognizing the “tempt[ation] for a defendant to second­
guess counsel’s assistance after conviction or adverse
sentence,” ibid., the Court established that counsel should
be “strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assis­
tance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of
reasonable professional judgment,” id., at 690. To over­
come that presumption, a defendant must show that
counsel failed to act “reasonabl[y] considering all the
circumstances.” Id., at 688. The Court cautioned that
“[t]he availability of intrusive post-trial inquiry into attor­
ney performance or of detailed guidelines for its evalua­
tion would encourage the proliferation of ineffectiveness
challenges.” Id., at 690.
The Court also required that defendants prove preju­
dice. Id., at 691–692. “The defendant must show that
there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would
have been different.” Id., at 694. “A reasonable probabil­
ity is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in
the outcome.” Ibid. That requires a “substantial,” not just
“conceivable,” likelihood of a different result. Richter, 562

Our review of the California Supreme Court’s decision is
thus “doubly deferential.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556

Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 5–6 (2003) (per curiam)). We take a
