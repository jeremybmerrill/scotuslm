SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

The jury heard evidence of Pinholster’s violent tendencies:
He had kidnapped someone with a knife, cut a person in
the arm with a razor, and had a history of hitting and
kicking people. He threatened to kill the State’s lead
witness. And he had an extensive disciplinary record in
jail.
Brashear offered brief testimony that was apparently
intended to be mitigating. See supra, at 19–20; see also
ante, at 27–28.26 However, as the prosecutor argued,
Brashear was not a neutral witness. See 53 Tr. 7441 (“A
mother clearly loves her son, ladies and gentlemen.
Clearly not the most unbiased witness in the world”).
Notwithstanding Brashear’s obvious self-interest, counsel
failed to offer readily available, objective evidence that
would have substantiated and expanded on her testimony.
Their failure to do so allowed the prosecutor to belittle her
testimony in closing argument. See supra, at 19–20. And
Brashear’s statement that Pinholster would not be alive
much longer because he had “a chip in his head floating
around,” 52 Tr. 7397, could only have undermined her
credibility, as the prosecutor urged, see 53 id., at 7447
(“Does she want you to believe sometime before he got to
——————
26 The majority mischaracterizes several aspects of Brashear’s testi
mony. Although Brashear testified that the family “didn’t have lots of
money,” she followed up that comment by stating that Pinholster did
not bring friends to the house because “it was too nice a house.” 52 Tr.
7404. The prosecutor did not understand Brashear to have testified
that Pinholster’s childhood was deprived. See 53 id., at 7442 (“You
heard that he was not a deprived child”). Nor did the California Su
preme Court on direct appeal. People v. Pinholster, 1 Cal. 4th 865, 910,
824 P. 2d 571, 587 (1992).
Brashear did testify that Pinholster’s stepfather tried to “discipline”
him and that he was “at times” “abusive or near abusive.” 52 Tr. 7392–
7393. She suggested, however, that Pinholster deserved the “disci
pline” he received. See, e.g., id., at 7392 (“Scott was always—he had a
mind of his own”). It is unlikely the jury understood Brashear to be
suggesting that her husband routinely beat Pinholster. The prosecutor
did not come away with this understanding. See 53 id., at 7442.
