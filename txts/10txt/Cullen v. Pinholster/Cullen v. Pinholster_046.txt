SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

quires review of the state court’s “determination of the
facts”—more logically depends on the facts presented to
the state court. Because this provision needs less clarifi
cation on this point than §2254(d)(1), it is all the more
telling that Congress included this phrase in §2254(d)(2)
but elected to exclude it from §2254(d)(1).
Unlike my colleagues in the majority, I refuse to assume
that Congress simply engaged in sloppy drafting. The
inclusion of this phrase in §2254(d)(2)—coupled with its
omission
from
§2254(d)(2)’s
partner
provision,
§2254(d)(1)—provides strong reason to think that Con
gress did not intend for the §2254(d)(1) analysis to be
limited categorically to “the evidence presented in the
State court proceeding.”

The “ ‘broader context of the statute as a whole,’ ” ante,
at 9 (quoting Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341
(1997)), reinforces this conclusion. In particular, Con
gress’ decision to include in AEDPA a provision,
§2254(e)(2), that permits federal evidentiary hearings in
certain circumstances provides further evidence that
Congress did not intend to limit the §2254(d)(1) inquiry to
the state-court record in every case.
We have long recognized that some diligent habeas
petitioners are unable to develop all of the facts support
ing their claims in state court.4 As discussed above, in

diligent efforts to develop the facts might be “thwarted, for example, by
the conduct of another or by happenstance”); id., at 434 (noting that the
prosecution might have “concealed the facts” supporting “a claim which

not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing” or “there is a substantial
allegation of newly discovered evidence”), overruled in part on other
grounds by Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 5 (1992).
