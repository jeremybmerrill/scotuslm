CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

1
After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the court in
structed the jury to return six days later for the penalty
phase. This prompted discussion at sidebar regarding
whether the State had provided notice of its intent to offer
aggravating evidence. Pinholster’s court-appointed attor
ney, Wilbur Dettmar, argued that the State should be
precluded from offering aggravating evidence:
“I am not presently prepared to offer anything by way
of mitigation. If I was going to proceed on mitigation,
the people would have the right to rebuttal with or
without notice.
“I took the position, since the people had not given
notice, I had not prepared any evidence by way of miti
gation. I would submit it on that basis.” 52 Re
porter’s Tr. 7250 (hereinafter Tr.) (emphasis added).
Undoubtedly anticipating that counsel might need addi
tional time to prepare an adequate mitigation defense, the
court asked Dettmar whether a continuance would be
helpful in the event it ruled against him. He declined the
offer on the spot, stating: “I think we would probably still
go forward on Monday. Clearly the one person that comes
to mind is the defendant’s mother. How much beyond that
I don’t know. I don’t think the pa[ss]age of time would
make a great deal of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258. After
hearing testimony, the court denied Pinholster’s motion to
preclude aggravating evidence.
At the penalty phase, defense counsel called only one
witness: Pinholster’s mother, Burnice Brashear. Brashear
testified that Pinholster “never really wanted for anything
at home too much” and “had everything normally materi
alwise that most people have.” Id., at 7395. She said that
Pinholster was “different” from his siblings, whom she
characterized as “basically very good children.” Id., at
7401–7402. Pinholster, she said, had a “friendly” relation
