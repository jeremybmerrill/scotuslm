SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Ante, at 10. Under §2254(d)(1), federal courts routinely
engage in analysis that the state court itself might never
have conducted or did not conduct. For example, when a
state court summarily denies a claim without explanation,
as the California Supreme Court did here, district courts
must deny habeas relief pursuant to §2254(d)(1) so long as
“there is any reasonable argument” supporting the denial
of the petitioner’s claim. Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 16). We likewise ask whether a state-court
decision unreasonably applied clearly established federal
law when the state court issued a reasoned decision but
failed to cite federal law altogether. See Early v. Packer,
537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002) (per curiam). Determining whether a
state court could reasonably have denied a petitioner relief
in light of newly discovered evidence is not so different
than determining whether there is any reasonable basis
for a state court’s unreasoned decision.
Admittedly, the text of §2254(d)(1), standing alone, does
not compel either reading of that provision. But constru
ing §2254(d)(1) to permit consideration of evidence prop
erly introduced in federal court best accords with the text
of §2254(d)(2) and AEDPA’s structure as a whole. By
interpreting §2254(d)(1) to prevent nondiligent petitioners
from gaming the system—the very purpose of
§2254(e)(2)—the majority potentially has put habeas relief
out of reach for diligent petitioners with meritorious
claims based on new evidence.
C
The majority claims that its holding is “consistent” with
our case law. Ante, at 10. Quite the opposite is true: Our
cases reflect our previous understanding that evidence
properly admitted pursuant to §2254(e)(2) is relevant to
the §2254(d)(1) analysis.
In Landrigan, JUSTICE THOMAS, the author of today’s
opinion, confirmed this understanding of the interplay
