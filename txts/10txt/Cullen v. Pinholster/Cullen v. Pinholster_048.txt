SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Other courts of appeals, including the court below, have
struck a more considered balance. These courts have held
that §2254(d)(1) continues to apply but that new evidence
properly presented in a federal hearing is relevant to the
reasonableness of the state-court decision. See Pinholster
v. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 668 (CA9 2009) (en banc) (“If the
evidence is admissible under Michael Williams or
§2254(e)(2), and if it does not render the petitioner’s
claims unexhausted . . . , then it is properly considered in
evaluating whether the legal conclusion reached by the
state habeas court was a reasonable application of Su
preme Court law”); accord, Wilson v. Mazzuca, 570 F. 3d
490, 500 (CA2 2009); Pecoraro v. Walls, 286 F. 3d 439, 443
(CA7 2002); Valdez v. Cockrell, 274 F. 3d 941, 952 (CA5
2001). This approach accommodates the competing goals,
reflected in §§2254(d) and 2254(e)(2), of according defer
ence to reasonable state-court decisions and preserving
the opportunity for diligent petitioners to present evidence
to the federal court when they were unable to do so in
state court.
The majority charts a third, novel course that, so far as I
am aware, no court of appeals has adopted: §2254(d)(1)
continues to apply when a petitioner has additional evi
dence that he was unable to present to the state court, but
the district court cannot consider that evidence in deciding
whether the petitioner has satisfied §2254(d)(1). The
problem with this approach is its potential to bar federal
habeas relief for diligent habeas petitioners who cannot
present new evidence to a state court.
Consider, for example, a petitioner who diligently at
tempted in state court to develop the factual basis of a
claim that prosecutors withheld exculpatory witness
statements in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83
(1963). The state court denied relief on the ground that
the withheld evidence then known did not rise to the level
of materiality required under Brady. Before the time for
