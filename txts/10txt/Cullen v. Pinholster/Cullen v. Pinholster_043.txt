CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

asking whether the evidence the petitioner seeks to pre
sent would satisfy AEDPA’s demanding standards, they
would needlessly prolong federal habeas proceedings.
Third, even when a petitioner seeks to introduce new
evidence that would entitle him to relief, AEDPA prohibits
him from doing so, except in a narrow range of cases,
unless he “made a reasonable attempt, in light of the
information available at the time, to investigate and pur
sue claims in state court.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.
420, 435 (2000) (Michael Williams). Thus, §2254(e)(2)
provides:
“If the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis
of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall
not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless
the applicant shows that—
“(A) the claim relies on—
“(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroac
tive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme
Court, that was previously unavailable; or
“(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been
previously discovered through the exercise of due dili
gence; and
“(B) the facts underlying the claim would be suffi
cient to establish by clear and convincing evidence
that but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact
finder would have found the applicant guilty of the
underlying offense.”
In Michael Williams, we construed the opening clause of
this provision—which triggers the bar on evidentiary
hearings—to apply when “there is lack of diligence, or
some greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or the
prisoner’s counsel.”2 Id., at 432. AEDPA thus bars an
——————
2 Section 2254(e)(2) also governs an attempt to obtain relief “based on
new evidence without an evidentiary hearing.” Holland v. Jackson, 542
U. S. 649, 653 (2004) (per curiam) (emphasis deleted).
