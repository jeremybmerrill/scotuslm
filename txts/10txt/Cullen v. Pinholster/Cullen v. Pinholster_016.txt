CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of the Court

If anything, the decision in Michael Williams supports
our holding. The lower court in that case had determined
that the one claim subject to §2254(d)(1) did not satisfy
that statutory requirement. In light of that ruling, this
Court concluded that it was “unnecessary to reach the
question whether §2254(e)(2) would permit a [federal]
hearing on th[at] claim.” Id., at 444. That conclusion is
fully consistent with our holding that evidence later intro­
duced in federal court is irrelevant to §2254(d)(1) review.
The Court of Appeals’ reliance on Holland v. Jackson,
542 U. S. 649 (2004) (per curiam), was also mistaken. In
Holland, we initially stated that “whether a state court’s
decision was unreasonable [under §2254(d)(1)] must be
assessed in light of the record the court had before it.” Id.,
at 652. We then went on to assume for the sake of argu­
ment what some Courts of Appeals had held⎯that
§2254(d)(1), despite its mandatory language, simply does
not apply when a federal habeas court has admitted new
evidence that supports a claim previously adjudicated in
state court.6 Id., at 653. There was no reason to decide
that question because regardless, the hearing should have
been barred by §2254(e)(2). Today, we reject that assump­
tion and hold that evidence introduced in federal court
has no bearing on §2254(d)(1) review. If a claim has
been adjudicated on the merits by a state court, a fed­
eral habeas petitioner must overcome the limitation of
§2254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.7

satisfy §2254(d), from receiving an evidentiary hearing.
6 In Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U. S. 74 (2005) (per curiam), on which
the Court of Appeals also relied, we made the same assumption. Id., at
79–80 (discussing the State’s “Holland argument”).
7 Pinholster and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR place great weight on the fact
that §2254(d)(2) includes the language “in light of the evidence pre­
sented in the State court proceeding,” whereas §2254(d)(1) does not.
See post, at 6–7. The additional clarity of §2254(d)(2) on this point,
however, does not detract from our view that §2254(d)(1) also is plainly
limited to the state-court record. The omission of clarifying language
