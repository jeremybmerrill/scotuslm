Opinion of the Court

here, that counsel had adequately performed at the pen­
alty phase of trial.

The Court of Appeals held that the California Supreme
Court had unreasonably applied Strickland because Pin­
holster’s attorneys “w[ere] far more deficient than . . . the
attorneys in Terry Williams, Wiggins [v. Smith, 539 U. S.
510 (2003)], and Rompilla [v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374 (2005)],
where in each case the Supreme Court upheld the peti­
tioner’s ineffective assistance claim.” 590 F. 3d, at 671.
The court drew from those cases a “constitutional duty to
investigate,” id., at 674, and the principle that “[i]t is
prima facie ineffective assistance for counsel to ‘abandon[ ]
their investigation of [the] petitioner’s background after
having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his his­
tory from a narrow set of sources,’ ” ibid. (quoting Wiggins
v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524–525 (2003)). The court ex­
plained that it could not “lightly disregard” a failure to
introduce evidence of “excruciating life history” or “night­
marish childhood.” 590 F. 3d, at 684 (internal quotation
marks omitted).
The Court of Appeals misapplied Strickland and over­
looked “the constitutionally protected independence of
counsel and . . . the wide latitude counsel must have in
making tactical decisions.” 466 U. S., at 689. Beyond the
general requirement of reasonableness, “specific guide­
lines are not appropriate.” Id., at 688. “No particular set
of detailed rules for counsel’s conduct can satisfactorily
take account of the variety of circumstances faced by
defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions . . . .”
Id., at 688–689. Strickland itself rejected the notion that
the same investigation will be required in every case. Id.,
at 691 (“[C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investi­
gations or to make a reasonable decision that makes par­
ticular investigations unnecessary” (emphasis added)). It
