CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

The majority’s reading of §2254(d)(1) appears ultimately
to rest on its understanding that state courts must have
the first opportunity to adjudicate habeas petitioners’
claims. See ante, at 9–10 (“It would be contrary to
[AEDPA’s exhaustion requirement] to allow a petitioner to
overcome an adverse state-court decision with new evi
dence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed
by that court in the first instance effectively de novo”).10
JUSTICE BREYER takes the same position. See ante, at 2
(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(AEDPA is designed “to give the State a first opportunity
to consider most matters”). I fully agree that habeas
petitioners must attempt to present evidence to state
courts in the first instance, as does JUSTICE ALITO, see
ante, at 2. Where I disagree with the majority is in my
understanding that §2254(e)(2) already accomplishes this
result.
By reading §2254(d)(1) to do the work of
§2254(e)(2), the majority gives §2254(e)(2) an unnaturally
cramped reading. As a result, the majority either has
foreclosed habeas relief for diligent petitioners who,
through no fault of their own, were unable to present
exculpatory evidence to the state court that adjudicated
their claims or has created a new set of procedural com
plexities for the lower courts to navigate to ensure the
availability of the Great Writ for diligent petitioners.
3
These considerations lead me to agree with the courts of
appeals that have concluded that a federal court should
assess the reasonableness of a state court’s application of
clearly established federal law under §2254(d)(1) in light
of evidence properly admitted in a federal evidentiary
hearing. There is nothing “strange” about this approach.
——————
10 Under my reading of §2254(d)(1), of course, the district court would
review properly admitted new evidence through the deferential lens of
§2254(d)(1), not de novo.
