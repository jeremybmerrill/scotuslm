CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of the Court

suicide by drug overdose, and there are passing references
to Pinholster’s own drug dependency. According to Dr.
Stalberg, Pinholster’s “school records” apparently evi­
denced “some degree” of brain damage. App. to Brief in
Opposition 219. Mostly, there are just a few new details
about Pinholster’s childhood.
Pinholster apparently
looked like his biological father, whom his grandparents
“loathed.” Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616
(Cal.), Exh. 98, p. 1. Accordingly, whenever his grandpar­
ents “spanked or disciplined” the kids, Pinholster “always
got the worst of it.” Ibid. Pinholster was mostly unsuper­
vised and “didn’t get much love,” because his mother and
stepfather were always working and “were more concerned
with their own lives than the welfare of their kids.” Id., at
2. Neither parent seemed concerned about Pinholster’s
schooling. Finally, Pinholster’s aunt once saw the children
mixing flour and water to make something to eat, al­
though “[m]ost meals consisted of canned spaghetti and
foods of that ilk.” Id., at 1.
Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinhol­
ster presented in state habeas, we cannot say that the
California Supreme Court’s determination was unreason­
able. Having already heard much of what is included in
the state habeas record, the jury returned a sentence of
death. Moreover, some of the new testimony would likely
have undercut the mitigating value of the testimony by
Pinholster’s mother. The new material is thus not so
significant that, even assuming Pinholster’s trial counsel
performed deficiently, it was necessarily unreasonable for
the California Supreme Court to conclude that Pinholster
had failed to show a “substantial” likelihood of a different
sentence. Richter, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (citing
Strickland, 466 U. S., at 693).
