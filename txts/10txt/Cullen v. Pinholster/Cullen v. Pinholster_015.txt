Opinion of the Court

Our recent decision in Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S.
465 (2007), is consistent as well with our holding here. We
explained that “[b]ecause the deferential standards pre­
scribed by §2254 control whether to grant habeas relief, a
federal court must take into account those standards in
deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.”
Id., at 474. In practical effect, we went on to note, this
means that when the state-court record “precludes habeas
relief” under the limitations of §2254(d), a district court is
“not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.” Id., at 474
(citing with approval the Ninth Circuit’s recognition that
“an evidentiary hearing is not required on issues that can
be resolved by reference to the state court record” (internal
quotation marks omitted)).
The Court of Appeals wrongly interpreted Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 420 (2000) (Michael Williams), as sup­
porting the contrary view.
The question there was
whether the lower court had correctly determined that
§2254(e)(2) barred the petitioner’s request for a federal
evidentiary hearing.4 Michael Williams did not concern
whether evidence introduced in such a hearing could be
considered under §2254(d)(1). In fact, only one claim at
issue in that case was even subject to §2254(d); the rest
had not been adjudicated on the merits in state-court
proceedings. See id., at 429 (“Petitioner did not develop,
or raise, his claims . . . until he filed his federal habeas
petition”).5

(opinion of Stevens, J.).
4 If a prisoner has “failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in
State court proceedings,” §2254(e)(2) bars a federal court from holding
an evidentiary hearing, unless the applicant meets certain statutory
requirements.
5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s suggestion that Michael Williams “rejected”
the conclusion here, see post, at 15, is thus quite puzzling. In the
passage that she quotes, see ibid., the Court merely explains that
§2254(e)(2) should be interpreted in a way that does not preclude a
state prisoner, who was diligent in state habeas court and who can
