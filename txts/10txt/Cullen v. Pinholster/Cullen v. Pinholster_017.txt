Opinion of the Court 


B

Pinholster’s contention that our holding renders
§2254(e)(2) superfluous is incorrect. Section 2254(e)(2)
imposes a limitation on the discretion of federal habeas
courts to take new evidence in an evidentiary hearing.
See Landrigan, supra, at 473 (noting that district courts,
under AEDPA, generally retain the discretion to grant an
evidentiary hearing). Like §2254(d)(1), it carries out
“AEDPA’s goal of promoting comity, finality, and federal­
ism by giving state courts the first opportunity to review
[a] claim, and to correct any constitutional violation in the
first instance.” Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).8
Section 2254(e)(2) continues to have force where
§2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief. For exam­
ple, not all federal habeas claims by state prisoners fall
within the scope of §2254(d), which applies only to claims
“adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.” At
a minimum, therefore, §2254(e)(2) still restricts the discre­
tion of federal habeas courts to consider new evidence
when deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the
merits in state court. See, e.g., Michael Williams, 529
U. S., at 427–429.9
Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new
——————
from §2254(d)(1) just as likely reflects Congress’ belief that such lan­
guage was unnecessary as it does anything else.
8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s argument that §2254(d)(1) must be read in a
way that “accommodates” §2254(e)(2), see post, at 9, rests on a funda­
mental misunderstanding of §2254(e)(2). The focus of that section is
not on “preserving the opportunity” for hearings, post, at 9, but rather
on limiting the discretion of federal district courts in holding hearings.
We see no need in this case to address the proper application of
§2254(e)(2). See n. 20, infra. But see post, at 12 (suggesting that we
have given §2254(e)(2) “an unnaturally cramped reading”).
9 In all events, of course, the requirements of §§2254(a) through (c)
remain significant limitations on the power of a federal court to grant
habeas relief.
