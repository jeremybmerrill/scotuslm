SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

529 U. S., at 430. Under the warden’s argument, a peti
tioner who did not develop the record in state court, what
ever the reason, would be barred from presenting evidence
to the federal court. In rejecting that argument, we
observed:
“A prisoner who developed his claim in state court and
can prove the state court’s decision was ‘contrary to,
or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly es
tablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States,’ is not barred from obtain
ing relief by §2254(d)(1). If the opening clause of
§2254(e)(2) covers a request for an evidentiary hear
ing on a claim which was pursued with diligence but
remained undeveloped in state court because, for in
stance, the prosecution concealed the facts, a prisoner
lacking clear and convincing evidence of innocence
could be barred from a hearing on the claim even if he
could satisfy §2254(d).” Id., at 434 (citation omitted;
emphasis added).
A petitioner in the latter situation would almost certainly
be unable to “satisfy §2254(d)” without introducing the
concealed facts in federal court. This passage thus reflects
our understanding that, in some circumstances, a peti
tioner might need an evidentiary hearing in federal court
to prove the facts necessary to satisfy §2254(d). To avoid
foreclosing habeas relief for such petitioners, we concluded
that §2254(e)(2) could not bear the warden’s “harsh read
ing,” which essentially would have held petitioners strictly
at fault for their inability to develop the facts in state
court. Ibid. The majority today gives an equally “harsh
reading” to §2254(d)(1) to achieve the result we rejected in
Michael Williams.12

§2254(d)(1). With respect to one claim asserted by the petitioner, we
observed that “[t]he Court of Appeals rejected this claim on the merits
