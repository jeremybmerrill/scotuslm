CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of the Court

C. J.) (characterizing Pinholster’s efforts as “habeas-by­
sandbagging”). Limiting its review to the state-court
record, the dissent concluded that the California Supreme
Court did not unreasonably apply Strickland. 590 F. 3d,
at 691–723.

unless, with certain exceptions, the applicant has ex­
hausted state remedies.
If an application includes a claim that has been “adjudi­
cated on the merits in State court proceedings,” §2254(d),
an additional restriction applies. Under §2254(d), that
application “shall not be granted with respect to [such a]
