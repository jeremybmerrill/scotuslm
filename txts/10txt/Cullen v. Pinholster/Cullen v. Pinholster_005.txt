VINCENT CULLEN, ACTING WARDEN, PETITIONER
v. SCOTT LYNN PINHOLSTER
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 4, 2011]


JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.*
Scott Lynn Pinholster and two accomplices broke into a
house in the middle of the night and brutally beat and
stabbed to death two men who happened to interrupt the
burglary. A jury convicted Pinholster of first-degree mur­
der, and he was sentenced to death.
After the California Supreme Court twice unanimously
denied Pinholster habeas relief, a Federal District Court
held an evidentiary hearing and granted Pinholster ha­
beas relief under 28 U. S. C. §2254. The District Court
concluded that Pinholster’s trial counsel had been consti­
tutionally ineffective at the penalty phase of trial. Sitting
en banc, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit af­
firmed. Pinholster v. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651 (2009). Consid­
ering the new evidence adduced in the District Court
hearing, the Court of Appeals held that the California
Supreme Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal
law.” §2254(d)(1).
We granted certiorari and now reverse.
