CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of the Court

theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior deci­
sion of this Court.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). After a
thorough review of the state-court record,12 we conclude
that Pinholster has failed to meet that high threshold.
B
There is no dispute that the clearly established federal
law here is Strickland v. Washington. In Strickland, this
Court made clear that “the purpose of the effective assis­
tance guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is not to improve
the quality of legal representation . . . [but] simply to
——————
12 The parties agree that the state-court record includes both the
“allegations of [the] habeas corpus petition . . . and . . . ‘any matter of
record pertaining to the case.’ ” In re Hochberg, 2 Cal. 3d 870, 874, n. 2,
471 P. 2d 1, 3–4, n. 2 (1970) (quoting Cal. Rule of Court 60), rejected on
another ground by In re Fields, 51 Cal. 3d 1063, 1070, n. 3, 800 P. 2d
862, 866, n. 3 (1990); see Reply Brief for Petitioner 16–17; Tr. of Oral
Arg. 45. Under California law, the California Supreme Court’s sum­
mary denial of a habeas petition on the merits reflects that court’s
determination that “the claims made in th[e] petition do not state a
prima facie case entitling the petitioner to relief.” In re Clark, 5
Cal. 4th 750, 770, 855 P. 2d 729, 741–742 (1993). It appears that the
court generally assumes the allegations in the petition to be true, but
does not accept wholly conclusory allegations, People v. Duvall, 9
Cal. 4th 464, 474, 886 P. 2d 1252, 1258 (1995), and will also “review the
record of the trial . . . to assess the merits of the petitioner’s claims,”
Clark, supra, at 770, 855 P. 2d, at 742.
The specific contents of the state-court record depend on which of the
two state habeas proceedings is at issue. One amicus curiae suggests
that both are at issue⎯that is, Pinholster must prove that both Cali­
fornia Supreme Court proceedings involved an unreasonable applica­
tion of law under §2254(d)(1). See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation 26. By contrast, the most favorable approach for Pinholster
would be review of only the second state habeas proceeding, the record
of which includes all of the evidence that Pinholster ever submitted in
state habeas. We have not previously ruled on how to proceed in these
circumstances, and we need not do so here. Even taking the approach
most favorable to Pinholster, and reviewing only whether the California
Supreme Court was objectively unreasonable in the second state
habeas proceeding, we find that Pinholster has failed to satisfy
§2254(d)(1).
