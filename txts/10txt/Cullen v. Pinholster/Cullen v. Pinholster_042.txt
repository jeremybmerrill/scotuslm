tempt to present his claim in state court.” Harrington v.
Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13); see also
§2254(b)(1)(A). With certain narrow exceptions, federal
courts cannot consider a claim at all, let alone accept new
evidence relevant to the claim, if it has not been exhausted
in state court.1 The exhaustion requirement thus reserves
to state courts the first opportunity to resolve factual
disputes relevant to a state prisoner’s claim.
See
O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 845 (1999).
Second, the exhaustion requirement is “complement[ed]”
by the standards set forth in §2254(d). Harrington, 562
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). Under this provision, a fed
eral court may not grant habeas relief on any “claim that
was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings”
unless the adjudication
“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab
lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States; or
“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un
reasonable determination of the facts in light of the
evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”
These standards “control whether to grant habeas relief.”
Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474 (2007). Accord
ingly, we have said, if the factual allegations a petitioner
seeks to prove at an evidentiary hearing would not satisfy
these standards, there is no reason for a hearing. See id.,
at 481. In such a case, the district court may exercise its
“discretion to deny an evidentiary hearing.” Ibid.; see also
infra, at 13–14. This approach makes eminent sense: If
district courts held evidentiary hearings without first

a state prisoner must, as a general matter, properly ex
haust his federal claims in state court to avoid having his claim de
faulted on procedural grounds. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.
722, 750 (1991).
