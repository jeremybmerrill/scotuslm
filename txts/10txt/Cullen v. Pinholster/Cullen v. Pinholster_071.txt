CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

had failed to allege that his counsel’s investigation was
inadequate under Strickland.

The majority also concludes that the California Supreme
Court could reasonably have concluded that Pinholster did
not state a claim of prejudice. This conclusion, in light of
the overwhelming mitigating evidence that was not before
the jury, is wrong. To establish prejudice, “[t]he defendant
must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but
for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro
ceeding would have been different.” Id., at 694. When a
habeas petitioner challenges a death sentence, “the ques
tion is whether there is a reasonable probability that,
absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded
that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circum
stances did not warrant death.” Id., at 695. This inquiry
requires evaluating “the totality of the available mitiga
tion evidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evi
dence adduced in the habeas proceeding—in reweighing it
against the evidence in aggravation.” Terry Williams, 529
U. S., at 397–398. The ultimate question in this case is
whether, taking into account all the mitigating and aggra
vating evidence, “there is a reasonable probability that at
least one juror would have struck a different balance.”
Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 537; see Cal. Penal Code Ann.
§190.4(b) (West 2008) (requiring a unanimous jury verdict
to impose a death sentence).

Like the majority, I first consider the aggravating and
mitigating evidence presented at trial. By virtue of its
verdict in the guilt phase, the jury had already concluded
that Pinholster had stabbed and killed the victims. As the
majority states, the jury saw Pinholster “revel” in his
history of burglaries during the guilt phase. Ante, at 26.
