SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

at 686. To satisfy this benchmark, a defendant must show
both that “counsel’s performance was deficient” and that
“the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.” Id., at
687.
When §2254(d)(1) applies, the question is whether “ ‘fair
minded jurists could disagree’ on the correctness of the
state court’s decision.” Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 11) (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652,
664 (2004)). When the state court rejected a Strickland
claim on the pleadings assuming the allegations to be

state court erred.

When §2254(d) applies, federal-court review is “ ‘doubly’ ”

(quoting Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(slip op., at 11)). In the present AEDPA posture, “[t]he
question is whether there is any reasonable argument that
counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.” Har
rington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). Here, there is
none.
The majority surmises that counsel decided on a strat
