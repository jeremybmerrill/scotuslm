CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of the Court

review Pinholster’s state prison file but argued that such
an invitation did not meet with the “strict demands” of
§190.3. 52 Tr. 7260. Dettmar admitted that the prosecu­
tor, “being as thorough as she is, possibly ha[d] met the
requirement.” Id., at 7250. But if so, he wanted her “to
make that representation to the court.”13 Ibid.
Timesheets indicate that Pinholster’s trial counsel
investigated mitigating evidence.14 Long before the guilty
verdict, Dettmar talked with Pinholster’s mother and
contacted a psychiatrist.15 On February 26, two months
before the penalty phase started, he billed six hours
for “[p]reparation argument, death penalty phase.” See
Clerk’s Tr. 864. Brainard, who merely assisted Dettmar
for the penalty phase, researched epilepsy and also inter­
viewed Pinholster’s mother.16 We know that Brainard
likely spent additional time, not reflected in these entries,
preparing Pinholster’s brother, Terry, who provided some
mitigation testimony about Pinholster’s background dur­
——————
13 Counsel’s argument was persuasive enough to cause the trial court
to hold a hearing and take testimony before denying the motion to
exclude.
14 Both parties agree that these billing records were before the Cali­
fornia Supreme Court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45, 48–49.
15 See Clerk’s Tr. 798 (entry on Jan. 13 for “phone call to defendant’s
mother re medical history”); id., at 864 (entries on Feb. 21 for “Penal
Code research on capital punishment”; Feb. 23 for “conference with
defendant’s mother re childhood problems”; Feb. 25 for “Research on
Pen. C. 190.3”; and Feb. 29 for “photocopying reports for appointed
expert,” “Preparation of Declaration and Order for appointment of
psychiatrist,” “Preparation order of visitation for investigator,” and
“Further research on Pen. C. 190.3”). The time records for Dettmar
unfortunately stop with Mar. 14, so we do not know what he did during
the critical weeks leading up to the penalty phase on May 1.
16 See id., at 869 (entries on Feb. 23 for “Conf. with Bernice Brasher,
Pinholster’s mother”; and Feb. 25 for “Research re; epilepsy and conf.
with nurse”); id., at 1160 (entries on Apr. 11 for “Start prep. for penalty
phase”; Apr. 25 for “Prep. penalty phase and conf. with Mrs. Brashear”;
and Apr. 26 for “Prep. penalty phase”).
