VINCENT CULLEN, ACTING WARDEN, PETITIONER
v. SCOTT LYNN PINHOLSTER
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 4, 2011]


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.
Although I concur in the Court’s judgment, I agree with
the conclusion reached in Part I of the dissent, namely,
that, when an evidentiary hearing is properly held in
federal court, review under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) must
take into account the evidence admitted at that hearing.
As the dissent points out, refusing to consider the evidence
received in the hearing in federal court gives §2254(e)(2)
an implausibly narrow scope and will lead either to results
that Congress surely did not intend or to the distortion of
other provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and the law
on “cause and prejudice.” See post, at 9–12 (opinion of
SOTOMAYOR, J.).
Under AEDPA evidentiary hearings in federal court
should be rare. The petitioner generally must have made
a diligent effort to produce in state court the new evidence
on which he seeks to rely. See §2254(e)(2); Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 433–434 (2000). If that requirement
is not satisfied, the petitioner may establish the factual
predicate for a claim in a federal-court hearing only if,
among other things, “the facts underlying the claim would
be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence
that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder
