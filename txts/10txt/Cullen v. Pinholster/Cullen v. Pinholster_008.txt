CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of the Court

tor “possibly ha[d] met the [notice] requirement.” Ibid.
The trial court asked whether a continuance might be
helpful, but Dettmar declined, explaining that he could
not think of a mitigation witness other than Pinholster’s
mother and that additional time would not “make a great
deal of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258. Three days later,
after hearing testimony, the court found that Pinholster
had received notice while representing himself and denied
the motion to exclude.
The penalty phase was held before the same jury that
had convicted Pinholster. The prosecution produced eight
witnesses, who testified about Pinholster’s history of
threatening and violent behavior, including resisting
arrest and assaulting police officers, involvement with
juvenile gangs, and a substantial prison disciplinary

Burnice Brashear. She gave an account of Pinholster’s
troubled childhood and adolescent years, discussed Pin­
holster’s siblings, and described Pinholster as “a perfect
gentleman at home.” Id., at 7405. Defense counsel did not
call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted Dr. John
Stalberg at least six weeks earlier. Dr. Stalberg noted
Pinholster’s “psychopathic personality traits,” diagnosed
him with antisocial personality disorder, and concluded
that he “was not under the influence of extreme mental or
emotional disturbance” at the time of the murders. App.
131.
After 2½ days of deliberation, the jury unanimously
voted for death on each of the two murder counts. On
mandatory appeal, the California Supreme Court affirmed

P. 2d 571 (1992).
