Opinion of the Court

State’s primary witness. The prosecution brought numer­
ous charges against Pinholster, including two counts of
first-degree murder.
B
The California trial court appointed Harry Brainard and
Wilbur Dettmar to defend Pinholster on charges of first­
degree murder, robbery, and burglary. Before their ap­
pointment, Pinholster had rejected other attorneys and
insisted on representing himself. During that time, the
State had mailed Pinholster a letter in jail informing him

during the penalty phase of trial to support a sentence of
death.
The guilt phase of the trial began on February 28, 1984.

Pinholster asserted that later that night around 1 a.m.,
while he was elsewhere, Corona went to Kumar’s house to
steal more drugs and did not return for three hours.

but insisted that he always used a gun, never a knife. The
jury convicted Pinholster on both counts of first-degree
murder.
Before the penalty phase, Brainard and Dettmar moved
to exclude any aggravating evidence on the ground that
the prosecution had failed to provide notice of the evidence
to be introduced, as required by Cal. Penal Code Ann.
