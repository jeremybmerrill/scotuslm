CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER
Opinion of BREYER, J.

quate, then an (e) hearing might be needed to consider the
petitioner’s (now unblocked) substantive federal claim. Or
if the state-court rejection rested on only one of several
related federal grounds (e.g., that counsel’s assistance was
not “inadequate”), then, if the federal court found that the
state court’s decision in respect to the ground it decided
violated (d), an (e) hearing might be needed to consider
other related parts of the whole constitutional claim (e.g.,
whether the counsel’s “inadequate” assistance was also
prejudicial). There may be other situations in which an (e)
hearing is needed as well.
In this case, however, we cannot say whether an (e)
hearing is needed until we know whether the state court,
in rejecting Pinholster’s claim on the basis presented to
that state court, violated (d). (In my view, the lower
courts’ analysis in respect to this matter is inadequate.)
There is no role in (d) analysis for a habeas petitioner to
introduce evidence that was not first presented to the
state courts. But that does not mean that Pinholster is
without recourse to present new evidence. He can always
return to state court presenting new evidence not previ
ously presented. If the state court again denies relief, he
might be able to return to federal court to make claims
related to the latest rejection, subject to AEDPA’s limita
tions on successive petitions. See §2244.
I am not trying to predict the future course of these
proceedings. I point out only that, in my view, AEDPA is
not designed to take necessary remedies from a habeas
petitioner but to give the State a first opportunity to con
sider most matters and to insist that federal courts prop
erly respect state-court determinations.
