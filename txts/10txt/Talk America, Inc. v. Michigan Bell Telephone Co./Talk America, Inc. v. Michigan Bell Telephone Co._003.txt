therefore are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC must lease
for interconnection, if technically feasible. P. 9.
(3) Third, says the FCC, it is technically feasible to provide ac
cess to the particular entrance facilities at issue in these cases—a
point AT&T does not dispute. P. 10.
(c) Contrary to AT&T’s arguments, the FCC’s interpretation is not
“plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]. ” Auer v.
Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461. First, it is perfectly sensible to read the
FCC’s regulations to include entrance facilities as part of incumbent
LECs’ networks. Second, the FCC’s views do not conflict with 47
CFR §51.5’s definition of interconnection as “the linking of two net
works for the mutual exchange of traffic[, but not] the transport and
termination of traffic.” Pp. 10–12.
(d) Nor is there any other “reason to suspect that the [FCC’s] in
terpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair and considered judg
ment on the matter in question.” Auer, supra, at 462. AT&T incor
rectly suggests that the FCC is attempting to require under
§251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it from requiring under
§251(c)(3) and what the FCC itself said was not required in the Re
mand Order. Pp. 12–16.
