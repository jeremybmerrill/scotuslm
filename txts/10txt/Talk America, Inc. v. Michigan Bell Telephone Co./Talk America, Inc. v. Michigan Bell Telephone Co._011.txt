TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL 

TELEPHONE CO.
Opinion of the Court 





unless the interpretation is “ ‘plainly erroneous or incon­
sistent with the regulation[s]’ ” or there is any other “ ‘rea­
son to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the
agency’s fair and considered judgment on the matter in
question.’ ” Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 12, 14) (quoting
Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461, 462 (1997)).
The Commission contends that its regulations require
AT&T to provide access at cost-based rates to its exist­

has long construed §251(c)(2) to require incumbent LECs
to provide, at cost-based rates, “any technically feasible
method of obtaining interconnection . . . at a particular

The requirement in §51.321(a) to provide a “method of
obtaining interconnection,” the Commission argues, en­
compasses a duty to lease an existing facility to a compet­
ing LEC. When the Commission originally promulgated
§51.321(a), it explained that incumbent LECs would be
required to “adapt their facilities to interconnection” and
to “accept the novel use of, and modification to, [their]
