TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL 

TELEPHONE CO.
Opinion of the Court 





hauling and interconnection, though AT&T makes much of
that fact. AT&T argues that the Commission’s holding
in the Triennial Review Remand Order is broader than
that in the Triennial Review Order. In AT&T’s view, the
Commission concluded in the Triennial Review Remand
Order that competitors are not impaired if they lack cost­
based access to entrance facilities for backhauling or
interconnection.
There are two flaws with AT&T’s reasoning. First, as
we have discussed, the Triennial Review Remand Order
reinstated the ultimate conclusion of the Triennial Review
Order and changed only “the analysis through which [it]
reached that conclusion.” Triennial Review Remand Order
¶137. Second, unlike §251(c)(3)’s unbundling obligation,
§251(c)(2)’s interconnection obligation does not require the
Commission to consider impairment. As the dissent below
observed, it would be surprising indeed if the FCC had
taken the novel step of incorporating impairment into
interconnection without comment. 597 F. 3d, at 389 (opin­
ion of Sutton, J.).

The FCC as amicus curiae has advanced a reasonable
interpretation of its regulations, and we defer to its views.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit is reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of these cases.
