Opinion of the Court

network facilities.” In re Implementation of Local Compe
tition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
11 FCC Rcd. 15499, 15605, ¶202 (1996) (Local Competition
Order). Since then, as AT&T and its amici concede, in­
cumbent LECs have commonly leased certain facilities at
cost-based prices to accommodate interconnection. See
Brief for Respondent 28–29; Brief for United States Tele­
com Association et al. as Amici Curiae 33–35.
As additional support for its assertion that incumbent
LECs are obligated to lease facilities, the FCC highlights
the examples in §51.321(b) of “[t]echnically feasible meth­
ods of obtaining interconnection,” which include “[m]eet
point interconnection arrangements.” In a meet-point
arrangement, an incumbent LEC “accommodat[es]” inter­
connection by building a transmission facility from its
network to a designated point, where it connects with the
competitor’s corresponding transmission facility. Local
Competition Order ¶553. Compared to that requirement,
the Commission argues, the obligation to lease existing
facilities for interconnection is quite modest.

Next, the Commission contends that existing entrance
facilities are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC
must lease for interconnection. According to the FCC, the
Triennial Review Remand Order adopted a regulatory def­
inition that reestablished that entrance facilities are
part of an incumbent LEC’s network. See ¶137; see also
47 CFR §51.319(e) (2005). The end of every entrance
facility is therefore a “point within [an incumbent] car­
rier’s network” at which a competing LEC could request
interconnection, 47 U. S. C. §251(c)(2), and each entrance
facility potentially provides a “technically feasible method
of obtaining interconnection,” 47 CFR §51.321(a) (2010).
