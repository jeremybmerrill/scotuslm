Opinion of the Court

independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to
impairment analysis. It is undisputed that both un­
bundled network elements and interconnection must be
provided at cost-based rates. See §252(d)(1); Brief for
Petitioner in No. 10–313, p. 28; Brief for Petitioners in No.
10–329, p. 7; Brief for Respondent 4.
These cases concern incumbent LECs’ obligation to
share existing “entrance facilities” with competitive LECs.
Entrance facilities are the transmission facilities (typically
wires or cables) that connect competitive LECs’ networks
with incumbent LECs’ networks.
The FCC recently
adopted a regulation specifying that entrance facilities are
not among the network elements that §251(c)(3) requires
incumbents to lease to competitors on an unbundled basis
at cost-based rates. See 47 CFR §51.319(e)(2)(i) (2005).
The Commission noted, however, that it “d[id] not alter
the right of competitive LECs to obtain interconnection
facilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).” In re Unbundled
Access to Network Elements, 20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2611, ¶140
(2005) (Triennial Review Remand Order).
The specific issue here is whether respondent, Michigan
Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Michigan (AT&T),
must lease existing entrance facilities to competitive LECs
at cost-based rates. The FCC interprets its regulations to
require AT&T to do so for the purpose of interconnection.
We begin by reviewing the Commission’s recent actions
regarding entrance facilities and then explain the particu­
lar dispute that is before us today.
A
In 2003, the FCC decided, contrary to its previous or­
ders, that incumbent LECs were not obligated to provide
cost-based unbundled access to entrance facilities under
§251(c)(3). In re Review of Section 251 Unbundling Obli
gations of Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, 18 FCC
Rcd. 16978, 17202–17205, ¶¶365–367 (2003) (Triennial
