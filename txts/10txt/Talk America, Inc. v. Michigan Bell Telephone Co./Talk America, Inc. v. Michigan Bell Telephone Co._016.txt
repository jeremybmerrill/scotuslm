Opinion of the Court

Commission counsel of agency action that is under judicial
review. See ibid.; see also Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.
United States, 371 U. S. 156, 168–169 (1962) (“The courts
may not accept appellate counsel’s post hoc rationaliza­
tions for agency action; [SEC v.] Chenery[ Corp., 332 U. S.
194 (1947),] requires that an agency’s discretionary order
be upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in the
order by the agency itself”). And although the FCC con­
cedes that it is advancing a novel interpretation of its
longstanding interconnection regulations, novelty alone
is not a reason to refuse deference. The Commission ex­
plains that the issue in these cases did not arise until
recently—when it initially eliminated unbundled access to
entrance facilities in the Triennial Review Order. Until
then, the Commission says, a competitive LEC typically
would elect to lease a cost-priced entrance facility under
§251(c)(3) since entrance facilities leased under §251(c)(3)
could be used for any purpose—i.e., both interconnection
and backhauling—but entrance facilities leased under
§251(c)(2) can be used only for interconnection. We see no
reason to doubt this explanation.
AT&T suggests that the Commission is attempting to
require under §251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it
from requiring under §251(c)(3) and what the Commission
itself said was not required in the Triennial Review Re
mand Order. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (“[T]his is a rear guard
effort to preserve [cost-based] pricing for things that the
[C]ommission has said should no longer be available . . . at
[such] pricing”). We do not think that AT&T is correct.

To begin with, AT&T’s accusation does not square with
the regulatory history. The Commission was not com­
pelled to eliminate the obligation to lease unbundled
entrance facilities at cost-based rates.
It is true that, prior to the Triennial Review orders, the
