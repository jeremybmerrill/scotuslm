TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL 

TELEPHONE CO.
Opinion of the Court 





ties are to be used for interconnection: to link the incum­
bent provider’s telephone network with the competitor’s
network for the mutual exchange of traffic. We defer to
the Commission’s views and reverse the judgment below.
I
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), 110
Stat. 56, imposed a number of duties on incumbent pro­
viders of local telephone service in order to facilitate mar­
ket entry by competitors. AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities
Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 371 (1999). The incumbent local ex­
change carriers (LECs) owned the local exchange net­
works: the physical equipment necessary to receive, prop­
erly route, and deliver phone calls among customers.
Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 490
(2002). Before the 1996 Act, a new, competitive LEC could
not compete with an incumbent carrier without basically
replicating the incumbent’s entire existing network. Ibid.
The 1996 Act addressed that barrier to market entry by
requiring incumbent LECs to share their networks with
competitive LECs in several ways, two of which are rele­

LECs to lease “on an unbundled basis”—i.e., a la carte—
network elements specified by the Commission. This
makes it easier for a competitor to create its own network
without having to build every element from scratch. In
identifying which network elements must be available
for unbundled lease under §251(c)(3), the Commission
is required to consider whether access is “necessary”
and whether failing to provide access would “impair” a
competitor’s provision of service. §251(d)(2). Second,
§251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs “provide . . .
interconnection” between their networks and competitive
LECs’ facilities. This ensures that customers on a com­
petitor’s network can call customers on the incumbent’s
network, and vice versa. The interconnection duty is
