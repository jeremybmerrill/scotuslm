TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL 

TELEPHONE CO.
Opinion of the Court 





Commission twice unsuccessfully attempted to impose
sweeping unbundling requirements on incumbent LECs.
See Local Competition Order ¶278; In re Implementation
of Local Competition Provisions of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, 15 FCC Rcd. 3696, 3771–3904, ¶¶162–464
(1999); see also 47 CFR §51.319 (1997); §51.319 (2000).
Each time, the Commission’s efforts were rejected for
taking an unreasonably broad view of “impair[ment]”
under §251(d)(2). See Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S., at 392;
United States Telecom Assn. v. FCC, 290 F. 3d 415, 421–
428 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U. S. 940 (2003). In the
Triennial Review Order, the Commission once again rein­
terpreted the “impair” standard and revised the list of
network elements that incumbents must provide unbun­
dled to competitors.
The Commission’s initial decision to eliminate the obli­
gation to unbundle entrance facilities, however, was not
a result of the narrower view of impairment mandated
by this Court and the D. C. Circuit. Instead, the Commis­
sion determined that entrance facilities need not be pro­
vided on an unbundled basis under §251(c)(3) on the novel
ground that they are not network elements at all—
something no court had ever suggested.
Moreover, since its initial decision to eliminate the
unbundling obligation for entrance facilities, the Commis­
sion has been committed to that position. When the D. C.
Circuit questioned the Commission’s finding that entrance
facilities are not network elements, the Commission re­
sponded by observing that the court “did not reject our
conclusion that incumbent LECs need not unbundle en­
trance facilities, only the analysis through which we
reached that conclusion.” Triennial Review Remand Order
¶137. The Commission then found another way to support
that same conclusion.
