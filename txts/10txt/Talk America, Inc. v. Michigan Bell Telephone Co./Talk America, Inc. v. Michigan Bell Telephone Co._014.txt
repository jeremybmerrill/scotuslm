Opinion of the Court

element—to include entrance facilities. Triennial Review
Remand Order ¶¶136–137; see 47 CFR §51.319(e)(1)
(defining dedicated transport to include “incumbent LEC
transmission facilities . . . between wire centers or
switches owned by incumbent LECs and switches owned
by [competing] carriers”). Given that revised definition, it
is perfectly sensible to conclude that entrance facilities are
a part of incumbent LECs’ networks.
Second, we are not persuaded by AT&T’s argument that
the Commission’s views conflict with the definition of
interconnection in §51.5. That regulation provides: “Inter­
connection is the linking of two networks for the mutual
exchange of traffic. This term does not include the trans­
port and termination of traffic.” AT&T focuses on the
definition’s exclusion of “transport and termination of
traffic.” An entrance facility is a transport facility, AT&T
argues, and it makes no sense to require an incumbent
LEC to furnish a transport facility for interconnection
when the definition of interconnection expressly excludes
transport.
We think AT&T reads too much into the exclusion of
“transport.” The regulation cannot possibly mean that no
transport can occur across an interconnection facility, as
that would directly conflict with the statutory language.
See §251(c)(2) (requiring “interconnection . . . for the
transmission and routing of [local] telephone exchange
service”). The very reason for interconnection is the “mu­
tual exchange of traffic.” 47 CFR §51.5; see also Competi
tive Telecommunications Assn. v. FCC, 117 F. 3d 1068,
1071–1072 (CA8 1997) (“[T]he transmission and routing of
telephone exchange service” is “what the interconnection,
the physical link, would be used for” (internal quotation
marks omitted)).
The better reading of the regulation is that it merely
reflects that the “transport and termination of traffic” is
subject to different regulatory treatment than intercon­
