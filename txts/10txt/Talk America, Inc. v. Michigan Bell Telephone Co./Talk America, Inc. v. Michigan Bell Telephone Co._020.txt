JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court. I would reach the same
result even without benefit of the rule that we will defer to
an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations, a rule in
recent years attributed to our opinion in Auer v. Robbins,
519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997), though it first appeared in our
jurisprudence more than half a century earlier, see Bowles
v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945). In
this suit I have no need to rely on Auer deference, because
I believe the FCC’s interpretation is the fairest reading of
the orders in question. Most cogently, ¶140 of the Trien
nial Review Remand Order serves no purpose unless one
accepts (as AT&T does not) the distinction between back­
hauling and interconnection that is referred to in footnotes
to ¶¶138 and 141 of the order. 20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2610–
2612 (2005). The order would have been clearer, to be
sure, if the distinction had been made in a footnote to ¶140
