Opinion of the Court

rier provides interconnection; and
“(D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just,
reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the agreement and
the requirements of this section and section 252 of
this title.”
Nothing in that language expressly addresses entrance
facilities. Nor does any regulation do so. See Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 6.
AT&T contends that the statute makes clear that an
incumbent LEC need not provide access to any facilities—
much less entrance facilities—to provide interconnection.
The company points out that §251(c)(2) does not mention
incumbent LECs’ facilities, but rather mandates only that
incumbent LECs provide interconnection “for the facilities
and equipment of any [competing] carrier.” In contrast,
AT&T notes, §251(c)(3) requires that incumbent LECs
provide unbundled “access to [their] network elements.”
We do not find the statute so clear. Although §251(c)(2)
does not expressly require that incumbent LECs lease
facilities to provide interconnection, it also does not ex­
pressly excuse them from doing so. The statute says
nothing about what an incumbent LEC must do to “pro­
vide . . . interconnection.” §251(c)(2). “[T]he facilities and
equipment of any [competing] carrier” identifies the
equipment that an incumbent LEC must allow to inter­
connect, but it does not specify what the incumbent LEC
must do to make the interconnection possible. Ibid.

In the absence of any unambiguous statute or regula­
tion, we turn to the FCC’s interpretation of its regulations
in its amicus brief. See, e.g., Chase Bank USA, N. A. v.
McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). As we
reaffirmed earlier this Term, we defer to an agency’s
interpretation of its regulations, even in a legal brief,
