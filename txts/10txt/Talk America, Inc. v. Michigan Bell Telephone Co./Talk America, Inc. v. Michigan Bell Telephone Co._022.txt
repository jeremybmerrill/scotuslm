SCALIA, J., concurring

future adjudications, to do what it pleases. This frustrates
the notice and predictability purposes of rulemaking, and
promotes arbitrary government. The seeming inappro­
priateness of Auer deference is especially evident in cases
such as these, involving an agency that has repeatedly
been rebuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond
its text, and has repeatedly sought new means to the same
ends.
There are undoubted advantages to Auer deference. It
makes the job of a reviewing court much easier, and since
it usually produces affirmance of the agency’s view with­
out conflict in the Circuits, it imparts (once the agency has
spoken to clarify the regulation) certainty and predict­
ability to the administrative process. The defects of Auer
deference, and the alternatives to it, are fully explored in
Manning, Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference
to Agency Interpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum.
L. Rev. 612 (1996). We have not been asked to reconsider
Auer in the present case. When we are, I will be receptive
to doing so.
