LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES
Opinion of the Court

spect to the county’s obligation to pay $60,000 in attor
ney’s fees. That, it wrote, is because “in our circuit . . . the
limitations to liability established in Monell do not apply
to claims for prospective relief,” such as the declaratory
judgment that the Circuit had ordered entered. First Fee
Order 3–4 (citing Chaloux v. Killeen, 886 F. 2d 247, 250
(CA9 1989); Truth v. Kent School Dist., 542 F. 3d 634, 644
(CA9 2008); emphasis added).
The county then asked us to review this last-mentioned
Ninth Circuit holding, namely, the holding that Monell’s
“policy or custom” requirement applies only to claims for
damages but not to claims for prospective relief. Because
the Courts of Appeals are divided on this question, we
granted the county’s petition for certiorari. Compare
Reynolds v. Giuliani, 506 F. 3d 183, 191 (CA2 2007) (hold
ing that Monell’s “policy or custom” requirement applies to
claims for prospective relief as well as claims for dam
ages); Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept., 315 F. 3d 65, 71
(CA1 2002) (same); Greensboro Professional Fire Fighters
Assn., Local 3157 v. Greensboro, 64 F. 3d 962, 967, n. 6
(CA4 1995) (applying the Monell requirement to a prospec
tive relief claim); Church v. Huntsville, 30 F. 3d 1332,
1347 (CA11 1994) (same), with Chaloux, supra, at 251
(holding that Monell does not apply to prospective relief
claims). See also Gernetzke v. Kenosha Unified School
Dist. No. 1, 274 F. 3d 464, 468 (CA7 2001) (reserving the
question but noting the “predominant” view that “Monell’s
holding applies regardless of the nature of the relief
sought”).
We conclude that Monell’s holding applies to §1983
claims against municipalities for prospective relief as well
as to claims for damages.

We begin with §1983 itself, which provides:
