Opinion of the Court

Respondents add that not only did Monell involve a
damages claim, but its holding rests upon the concern that
municipalities might have to pay large damages awards.
The Court so suggests when it points out that municipali
ties should not be liable for an employee’s wrongful acts,
simply by applying agency-based principles of respondeat
superior. But as we have pointed out, the Court’s rejection
of respondeat superior liability primarily rested not on the
municipality’s economic needs, but on the fact that liabil
ity in such a case does not arise out of the municipality’s
own wrongful conduct.
Respondents further claim that, where prospective relief
is at issue, Monell is redundant. They say that a court
cannot grant prospective relief against a municipality
unless the municipality’s own conduct has caused the
violation. Hence, where such relief is otherwise proper,
the Monell requirement “shouldn’t screen out any case.”
Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.
To argue that a requirement is necessarily satisfied,
however, is not to argue that its satisfaction is unneces
sary. If respondents are right, our holding may have
limited practical significance. But that possibility does not
provide us with a convincing reason to sow confusion by
adopting a bifurcated relief-based approach to municipal
liability that the Court has previously rejected.
Finally, respondents make the mirror-image argument
that applying Monell’s requirement to prospective relief
claims will leave some set of ongoing constitutional viola
tions beyond redress. Despite the fact that four Circuits
apply Monell’s requirement to prospective relief, however,
respondents have not presented us with any actual or
hypothetical example that provides serious cause for
concern.
