LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES
Opinion of the Court

department to include all these reports in a Child Abuse
Central Index (Index), where they remain available to
various state agencies for at least 10 years. §11170(a).
The statute also says that if
“a report has previously been filed which subse
quently proves to be unfounded, the Department of
Justice shall be notified in writing of that fact and
shall not retain the report.” §11169(a).
The statute, however, does not set forth procedures for
reviewing whether a previously filed report is unfounded,
or for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in
the Index. Nor, up until the time of this lawsuit, had
California or Los Angeles County created any such proce

responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention
of the reports described in this section”).
The two plaintiffs in this case were initially accused of
child abuse. But they were later exonerated. They sought
to have their names removed from the Index. Unable to
convince the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department to remove
them, they filed this §1983 case against the attorney
general of California, the Los Angeles County sheriff, two
detectives in the sheriff’s department, and the County of
Los Angeles. They sought damages, an injunction, and a
declaration that the defendants had deprived them of their
constitutional rights by failing to create a procedural
mechanism through which one could contest inclusion on
the Index. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; Rev. Stat. §1979,
42 U. S. C. §1983. The District Court for the Central
District of California granted summary judgment to all of
the defendants on the ground that California had not
deprived plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected “liberty”
interest. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed.
The Ninth Circuit held that the Fourteenth Amendment
required the State to provide those included on the list
