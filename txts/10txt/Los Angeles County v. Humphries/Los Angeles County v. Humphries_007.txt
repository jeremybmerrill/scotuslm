Opinion of the Court

“Every person who, under color of any [state] stat
ute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage . . . sub
jects, or causes to be subjected, any . . . other per
son . . . to the deprivation of any rights . . . secured by
the Constitution and laws [of the United States], shall
be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit
in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.”

In 1961, in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court held
that municipal entities were not “person[s]” under §1983.
The Court based this conclusion on the history of the Civil
Rights Act of 1871’s enactment. It noted that Congress
rejected an amendment (called the Sherman amendment)
that would have made municipalities liable for damage
done by private persons “ ‘riotously and tumultuously
assembled.’ ” Id., at 188–190, and n. 38 (quoting Cong.
Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 663 (1871)). This rejection,
the Court thought, reflected a determination by the 1871
House of Representatives that “ ‘Congress had no constitu
tional power to impose any obligation upon county and
town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the
administration of state law.’ ” 365 U. S., at 190 (quoting
Cong. Globe, supra, at 804 (statement of Rep. Poland);
emphasis added). The Court concluded that Congress
must have doubted its “constitutional power . . . to impose
civil liability on municipalities.” 365 U. S., at 190. And
for that reason, Congress must have intended to exclude
municipal corporations as §1983 defendants. The statute’s
key term “person” therefore did not cover municipal enti
ties. Id., at 191.
Sixteen years later, in Monell, the Court reconsidered
the question of municipal liability. After reexamining the
1871 legislative history in detail, the Court concluded that
Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not
because it would have imposed liability upon municipali
