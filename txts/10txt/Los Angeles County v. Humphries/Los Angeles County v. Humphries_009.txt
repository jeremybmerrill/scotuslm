Opinion of the Court

rectly under §1983 for monetary, declaratory, or in
junctive relief where, as here, the action that is al
leged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a
policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision of
ficially adopted and promulgated by that body’s offi
cers. . . . [They can also be sued for] deprivations vis

such a custom has not received formal approval
through the body’s official decisionmaking channels.”
Id., at 690–691 (footnote omitted).
The Court has also included the terms “usage” and “prac
tice” as customs for which liability is appropriate. See
ibid. The length of this list of types of municipal action
leads us here to use a shorthand term “policy or custom,”
but when we do so, we mean to refer to the entire list. See
id., at 694 (using the shorthand “policy or custom”); see
also, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555
U. S. 246, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10) (using the phrase
“custom, policy, or practice,” to describe municipal liability
under §1983).
In sum, in Monell the Court held that “a municipality
cannot be held liable” solely for the acts of others, e.g.,
“solely because it employs a tortfeasor.” 436 U. S., at 691.
But the municipality may be held liable “when execution
of a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury.”
Id., at 694 (emphasis added).

The language of §1983 read in light of Monell’s under
standing of the legislative history explains why claims for
prospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall
within the scope of the “policy or custom” requirement.
Nothing in the text of §1983 suggests that the causation
requirement contained in the statute should change with
the form of relief sought. In fact, the text suggests the
opposite when it provides that a person who meets §1983’s
