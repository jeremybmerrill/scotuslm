Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

“modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed,”
18 U. S. C. §3582(c); but the rule of finality is subject to a
few narrow exceptions. Here, the exception is contained in
a statutory provision enacted to permit defendants whose
Guidelines sentencing range has been lowered by retro
active amendment to move for a sentence reduction if the
terms of the statute are met. The statute provides:
“In the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to
a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range
that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing
Commission pursuant to 28 U. S. C. 994(o) . . . the
court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after
considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to
the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction
is consistent with applicable policy statements issued
by the Sentencing Commission.” §3582(c)(2).
This case concerns the application of the statute to cases
in which defendants enter into plea agreements under
Rule 11(c)(1)(C). That Rule permits the parties to “agree
that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appro
priate disposition of the case, . . . [a request which] binds
the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.” The
question is whether defendants who enter into 11(c)(1)(C)
agreements that specify a particular sentence may be said
to have been sentenced “based on” a Guidelines sentencing
range, making them eligible for relief under §3582(c)(2).
B
Petitioner William Freeman was indicted in 2005 for
various crimes, including possessing with intent to dis
tribute cocaine base. 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1); (b)(1)(C). He
entered into an agreement under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) in which
he agreed to plead guilty to all charges. In return the
Government “agree[d] that a sentence of 106 months’ in
carceration is the appropriate disposition of this case.”
