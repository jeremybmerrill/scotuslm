ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

expressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range applicable
to the charged offense to establish the term of imprison­
ment”—or if such use is “evident from the agreement”—
then the defendant’s “term of imprisonment is ‘based on’
the range employed and the defendant is eligible for sen­
tence reduction under §3582(c)(2).” Ante, at 1, 6. This
exception is in my view as mistaken as the position of the
plurality—and basically for the same reasons.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR begins the departure from her
own rule innocently enough. As she explains, “some (C)
agreements may call for the defendant to be sentenced
within a particular Guidelines sentencing range.” Ante, at
5. In such a case, according to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, there
can be “no doubt” that the prison term the court imposes is
“based on” the agreed-upon sentencing range, and there­
fore the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction. Ibid.
Whether or not that is true, it provides no support for
the next step:
“Similarly, a plea agreement might provide for a
specific term of imprisonment—such as a number of
months—but also make clear that the basis for the
specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range appli­
cable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded
guilty. As long as that sentencing range is evident
from the agreement itself . . . the term of imprison­
ment imposed by the court in accordance with that
agreement is ‘based on’ that range.” Ante, at 6.
This category of cases is not “similar” to the first at all.
It is one thing to say that a sentence imposed pursuant to
an agreement expressly providing that the court will
sentence the defendant within an applicable Guidelines
range is “based on” that range. It is quite another to
conclude that an agreement providing for a specific term is
“similarly” based on a Guidelines range, simply because
the specified term can be said to reflect that range.
