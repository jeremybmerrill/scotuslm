FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

whether derived from a (C) agreement or otherwise—has
legal effect until the court enters judgment imposing it.
As a result, in applying §3582(c)(2) a court must discern
the foundation for the term of imprisonment imposed by
the sentencing judge. As the plurality explains, in the
normal course the district judge’s calculation of the Guide
lines range applicable to the charged offenses will serve as
the basis for the term of imprisonment imposed. See ante,
at 5; see also Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007).
Sentencing under (C) agreements, however, is different.
At the time of sentencing, the term of imprisonment im
posed pursuant to a (C) agreement does not involve the
court’s independent calculation of the Guidelines or con
sideration of the other 18 U. S. C. §3553(a) factors. The
court may only accept or reject the agreement, and if
it chooses to accept it, at sentencing the court may only
impose the term of imprisonment the agreement calls for;
the court may not change its terms. See Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 11(c)(3)(A) (“To the extent the plea agreement is of
the type specified in [Rule 11(c)(1)(C)], the court may
accept the agreement, reject it, or defer a decision until
the court has reviewed the presentence report”); Advisory
Committee’s Notes on 1979 Amendments to Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App., pp. 583–584 (1982 ed.)
(“[C]ritical to a . . . (C) agreement is that the defendant
receive the . . . agreed-to sentence”); accord, United States
v. Rivera-Martínez, 607 F. 3d 283, 286 (CA1 2010); United
States v. Green, 595 F. 3d 432, 438 (CA2 2010).
In the (C) agreement context, therefore, it is the binding
plea agreement that is the foundation for the term of im
prisonment to which the defendant is sentenced. At the
moment of sentencing, the court simply implements the
terms of the agreement it has already accepted. Contrary
to the plurality’s view, see ante, at 5–6, the fact that USSG
§6B1.2(c) (Nov. 2010) instructs a district court to use the
Guidelines as a yardstick in deciding whether to accept a
