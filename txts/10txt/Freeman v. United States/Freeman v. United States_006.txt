FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

Court of Appeals finds no support in §3582(c)(2), Rule
11(c)(1)(C), or the relevant Guidelines policy statements.
In every case the judge must exercise discretion to im
pose an appropriate sentence. This discretion, in turn, is
framed by the Guidelines. And the Guidelines must be
consulted, in the regular course, whether the case is one in
which the conviction was after a trial or after a plea,
including a plea pursuant to an agreement that recom
mends a particular sentence. The district judge’s decision
to impose a sentence may therefore be based on the Guide
lines even if the defendant agrees to plead guilty under
Rule 11(c)(1)(C). Where the decision to impose a sentence
is based on a range later subject to retroactive amend
ment, §3582(c)(2) permits a sentence reduction.
Section 3582(c)(2) empowers district judges to correct sen
tences that depend on frameworks that later prove un
justified. There is no reason to deny §3582(c)(2) relief to
defendants who linger in prison pursuant to sentences
that would not have been imposed but for a since-rejected,
excessive range.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would reverse the judgment on a
different ground set out in the opinion concurring in the
judgment. That opinion, like the dissent, would hold that
sentences following 11(c)(1)(C) agreement are based on the
agreement rather than the Guidelines, and therefore that
§3582(c)(2) relief is not available in the typical case. But
unlike the dissent she would permit the petitioner here to
seek a sentence reduction because his plea agreement in
express terms ties the recommended sentence to the
Guidelines sentencing range.
The reasons that lead those Members of the Court who
join this plurality opinion may be set forth as follows.
