FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

11(e)(1) (1982) (specifying that the parties to a (C) agree
ment may “agree that a specific sentence is the appropri
ate disposition of the case”); United States v. French, 719
F. 2d 387, 389, n. 2 (CA11 1983) (per curiam) (noting that
a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement was a “ ‘binding’ plea
bargain”).1
In the absence of any indication from the statutory text
or legislative history that §3582(c)(2) was meant to fun
damentally alter the way in which Rule 11(c)(1)(C) oper
ates, I cannot endorse the plurality’s suggestion that
§3582(c)(2) should be understood “to permit the district
court to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the
sentencing range in question was a relevant part of the
analytic framework the judge used to determine the sen
tence or to approve the agreement.” Ante, at 6; cf. Dillon
v. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8)
(“Congress intended [§3582(c)(2)] to authorize only a
limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence”).
By the same token, the mere fact that the parties to a
(C) agreement may have considered the Guidelines in the
course of their negotiations does not empower the court
under §3582(c)(2) to reduce the term of imprisonment they
ultimately agreed upon, as Freeman argues. Undoubt
edly, he is correct that in most cases the Government and
the defendant will negotiate the term of imprisonment in a
(C) agreement by reference to the applicable Guidelines
provisions. See Brief for Petitioner 30–31 (“[T]he Guide
lines are . . . the starting point and initial benchmark for
plea negotiations”); Brief for United States 33 (noting the
“concededly strong likelihood that the parties will . . .

to 2002, Rule 11’s provisions governing binding plea agree
ments were located in Rule 11(e)(1)(C). In substance they were largely
identical to the current rules in 11(c)(1)(C). See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
11(e)(1)(C) (2000).
