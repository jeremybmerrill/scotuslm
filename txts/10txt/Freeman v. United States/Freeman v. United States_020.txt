specific sentence”). This only makes sense; plea bargain
ing necessarily occurs in the shadow of the sentencing
scheme to which the defendant would otherwise be sub

(2005) (“[P]lea bargaining takes place in the shadow of . . .

sentence the defendant accordingly, and there can be no
doubt that the term of imprisonment the court imposes is
“based on” the agreed-upon sentencing range within the
meaning of §3582(c)(2). If that Guidelines range is sub
sequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the de
