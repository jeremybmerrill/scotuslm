Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

statements—require the conclusion that the district court
has authority to entertain §3582(c)(2) motions when sen
tences are imposed in light of the Guidelines, even if the
defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement.
III
The transcript of petitioner’s sentencing hearing reveals
that his original sentence was based on the Guidelines.
The District Court first calculated the sentencing range,
as both §3553(a)(4) and §6B1.2(c) require. App. 47a, 49a.
It explained that it “considered the advisory guidelines
and 18 USC 3553(a),” and that “the sentence imposed . . .
fall[s] within the guideline rang[e] and [is] sufficient to
meet the objectives of the law.” Id., at 48a–49a. Apart
from the defense attorney’s initial statement that the case
involved a “(C) plea,” id., at 47a, the hearing proceeded as
if the agreement did not exist. The court expressed its
independent judgment that the sentence was appropriate
in light of the applicable Guidelines range, and its decision
was therefore “based on” that range.
IV
The Government asks this Court to hold that sentences
like petitioner’s, which follow an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement,
are based only on the agreement and not the Guidelines,
and therefore that defendants so sentenced are ineligible
for §3582(c)(2) relief. The Government’s position rests in
part on the concern that the conclusion reached here will
upset the bargain struck between prosecutor and defen
dant. See Brief for United States 42–43. That, however,
has nothing to do with whether a sentence is “based on”
the Guidelines under §3582(c)(2). And in any event, the
concern is overstated. Retroactive reductions to sentenc
ing ranges are infrequent, so the problem will not arise
often. Thompson, DOJ’s Attack on Federal Judicial “Leni
