FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

fendant is eligible for sentence reduction.
Similarly, a plea agreement might provide for a specific
term of imprisonment—such as a number of months—but
also make clear that the basis for the specified term is
a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offense
to which the defendant pleaded guilty. As long as that
sentencing range is evident from the agreement itself, for
purposes of §3582(c)(2) the term of imprisonment imposed
by the court in accordance with that agreement is “based
on” that range. Therefore, when a (C) agreement ex
pressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range to establish
the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently
lowered by the Commission, the defendant is eligible for
sentence reduction under §3582(c)(2).2
In so holding, I necessarily reject the categorical rule
advanced by the Government and endorsed by the dissent,
which artificially divorces a (C) agreement from its ex
press terms.3 Because the very purpose of a (C) agreement

dissent suggests that this rule results from a “mistaken shift in
analysis” in this opinion from the actions of the judge to the intent of
the parties. See post, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). The purpose of a
(C) agreement, however, is to bind the sentencing court to the terms
agreed upon by the parties. See supra, at 3–4. Therefore, to determine
whether a sentence imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement was “based
on” a Guidelines sentencing range, the reviewing court must necessar
ily look to the agreement itself.
3 The majority of the Courts of Appeals to have addressed this ques
tion have taken approaches consistent with the one I take today. See
United States v. Rivera-Martínez, 607 F. 3d 283, 286–287 (CA1 2010);
United States v. Ray, 598 F. 3d 407, 409–410 (CA7 2010); United States
v. Main, 579 F. 3d 200, 203 (CA2 2009); United States v. Scurlark, 560
F. 3d 839, 842–843 (CA8 2009). It appears that only the Third Circuit
has applied the absolute rule advanced by the Government. See United
States v. Sanchez, 562 F. 3d 275, 282, and n. 8 (2009). As noted by the
plurality, see ante, at 1, even the Sixth Circuit allows for sentence
reduction “to avoid a miscarriage of justice or to correct a mutual
mistake,” United States v. Peveler, 359 F. 3d 369, 378, n. 4 (2004) (in
ternal quotation marks omitted). And only two Courts of Appeals
have adopted a wide-ranging approach similar to the one suggested by
