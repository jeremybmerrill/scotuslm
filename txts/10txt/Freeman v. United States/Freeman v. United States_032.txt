FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

prisonment will be based on that range,” and therefore
subject to reduction if the Commission subsequently low­
ers that range. Ibid. In this case, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR
concludes that Freeman’s agreement contemplated such a
reduction, even though the parties had “agree[d] that a
sentence of 106 months’ incarceration is the appropriate
disposition of this case.” App. 26a.
There is, however, no indication whatever that the par­
ties to the agreement contemplated the prospect of low­
ered sentencing ranges. And it is fanciful to suppose that
the parties would have said “106 months” if what they
really meant was “a sentence at the lowest end of the
applicable Guidelines range.” Cf. App. 25a (parties in this
case recommending “a fine at the lowest end of the appli­
cable Guideline Range”). In concluding otherwise, the
concurrence “ignore[s] the agreement’s express terms.”
Ante, at 7, n. 4.
The reality is that whenever the parties choose a fixed
term, there is no way of knowing what that sentence was
“based on.” The prosecutor and the defendant could well
have had quite different reasons for concluding that 106
months was a good deal. Perhaps the prosecutor wanted
to devote the limited resources of his office to a different
area of criminal activity, rather than try this case. Per­
haps the defendant had reason to question the credibility
of one of his key witnesses, and feared a longer sentence if
the case went to trial.
Indeed, the fact that there may be uncertainty about
how to calculate the appropriate Guidelines range could be
the basis for agreement on a fixed term in a plea under
Rule 11(c)(1)(C). Here the agreement made clear that
there was some doubt about the Guidelines calculations.
See App. 28a (“Both parties reserve the right to object to
the USSG §4A1.1 calculation of defendant’s criminal
history”); ibid. (the parties acknowledge that their Guide­
lines calculations “are not binding upon the Court” and
