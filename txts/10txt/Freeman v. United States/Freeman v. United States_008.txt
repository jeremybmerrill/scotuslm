FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

App. 26a. The agreement states that “[b]oth parties have
independently reviewed the Sentencing Guidelines appli
cable in this case,” and that “[Freeman] agrees to have his
sentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guide
lines.” The agreement reflects the parties’ expectation
that Freeman would face a Guidelines range of 46 to 57
months, id., at 27a–28a (Offense Level 19, Criminal His
tory Category IV), along with a consecutive mandatory
minimum of 60 months for possessing a firearm in fur
therance of a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U. S. C.
§924(c)(1)(A). The recommended sentence of 106 months
thus corresponded with the minimum sentence suggested
by the Guidelines, in addition to the 60-month §924(c)
(1)(A) sentence.
The District Court accepted the plea agreement. At the
sentencing hearing, the court “adopt[ed] the findings of
the probation officer disclosed in the probation report and
application of the guidelines as set out therein.” App. 47a.
“[H]aving considered the advisory guidelines and 18 USC
3553(a),” the court imposed the recommended 106-month
sentence, which was “within the guideline ranges”—the
46- to 57-month range the parties had anticipated plus the
mandatory 60 months under §924(c)(1)(A)—and “sufficient
to meet the objectives of the law.” Id. at 48a–49a.
Three years later, the Commission issued a retroactive
amendment to the Guidelines to remedy the significant
disparity between the penalties for cocaine base and pow
der cocaine offenses. See United States Sentencing Com
mission, Guidelines Manual Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706
(Nov. 2010) (USSG) (effective Nov. 1, 2007) (adjusting
Guidelines); id., Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008) (mak
ing Amendment 706 retroactive). Its effect was to reduce
Freeman’s applicable sentencing range to 37 to 46 months,
again with the consecutive 60-month mandatory mini
mum. App. 142a–144a (Sealed).
