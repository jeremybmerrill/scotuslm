ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

that the “defendant understands the Court will independ­
ently calculate the Guidelines at sentencing and defendant
may not withdraw the plea of guilty solely because the
Court does not agree with . . . [the] Sentencing Guideline
application”).
In addition, parties frequently enter plea agreements
that reflect prosecutorial decisions not to pursue particu­
lar counts. If a defendant faces three counts, and agrees
to plead to one if the prosecutor does not pursue the other
two, is the sentence reflected in the Rule 11(c)(1)(C)
agreement in any sense “based on” the Guidelines sentenc­
ing range for the one count to which the defendant
pleaded? Surely not. The concurrence tacitly concedes as
much when it suggests that an agreement to “drop[ ] a
charge or forgo[ ] a future charge” could ultimately be
grounds for not reducing the defendant’s sentence. Ante,
at 8, n. 6. But what this really shows is a basic flaw in the
“based on” test adopted by that opinion.
Finally, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s approach will foster con­
fusion in an area in need of clarity. As noted, courts
will be hard pressed to apply the distinction between
referring to and relying on a Guidelines range. Other
questions abound:
What if the agreement contains a particular Guidelines
calculation but the agreement’s stipulated sentence is out­
side the parties’ predicted Guidelines range? The test
in the concurring opinion is whether the agreement “uses”
or “employs” a Guidelines sentencing range to establish
the term of imprisonment, ante, at 1, not whether that
term falls within the range. In this case, what if the term
was 53 months—exactly half the low end of the sentencing
range anticipated by the parties? Is it “evident” in that
case that the Guidelines were used or employed to estab­
lish the agreed-upon sentence?*
