FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

Criminal Sentencing, 44 Tulsa L. Rev. 519, 535 (2009).
More important, the district court’s authority under
§3582(c)(2) is subject to significant constraints, constraints
that can be enforced by appellate review.
The binding policy statement governing §3582(c)(2)
motions places considerable limits on district court discre
tion. All Guidelines decisions from the original sentencing
remain in place, save the sentencing range that was al
tered by retroactive amendment. USSG §1B1.10(b)(1). In
an initial sentencing hearing, a district court can vary
below the Guidelines; but, by contrast, below-Guidelines
modifications in §3582(c)(2) proceedings are forbidden,
USSG §1B1.10(b)(2)(A), except where the original sen
tence was itself a downward departure. §1B1.10(b)(2)(B).
And the court must always “consider the nature and seri
ousness of the danger to any person or the community that
may be posed by a reduction in the defendant’s term of
imprisonment.” §1B1.10, comment., n. 1(B)(ii). The dis
trict court’s authority is limited; and the Courts of Ap
peals, and ultimately this Court, can ensure that district
courts do not overhaul plea agreements, thereby abusing
their authority under §3582(c)(2). See Dillon v. United
States, 560 U. S. ___ (2010) (reviewing and affirming a
§3582(c)(2) sentence reduction); Gall, 552 U. S., at 49 (all
sentences are reviewable for abuse of discretion).
The Government would enact a categorical bar on
§3582(c)(2) relief. But such a bar would prevent district
courts from making an inquiry that is within their own
special knowledge and expertise. What is at stake in this
case is a defendant’s eligibility for relief, not the extent of
that relief. Indeed, even where a defendant is permitted
to seek a reduction, the district judge may conclude that a
reduction would be inappropriate. District judges have a
continuing professional commitment, based on scholarship
and accumulated experience, to a consistent sentencing
policy. They can rely on the frameworks they have de
