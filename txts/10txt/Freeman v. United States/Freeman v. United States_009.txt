Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

§3582(c)(2). The District Court, however, denied the
motion, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
affirmed. United States v. Goins, 355 Fed. Appx. 1 (2009).
Adhering to its decision in United States v. Peveler, 359
F. 3d 369 (2004), the Court of Appeals held that defen
dants sentenced following 11(c)(1)(C) agreements that
specify a particular sentence are ineligible for §3582(c)(2)
relief, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake.
This Court granted certiorari. 561 U. S. __ (2010).

Federal sentencing law requires the district judge in
every case to impose “a sentence sufficient, but not greater
than necessary, to comply with” the purposes of federal
sentencing, in light of the Guidelines and other §3553(a)
factors. 18 U. S. C. §3553(a). The Guidelines provide a
framework or starting point—a basis, in the commonsense
meaning of the term—for the judge’s exercise of discretion.
E.g., 1 Oxford English Dictionary 977 (2d ed. 1989). Rule
11(c)(1)(C) permits the defendant and the prosecutor to
agree that a specific sentence is appropriate, but that
agreement does not discharge the district court’s inde
pendent obligation to exercise its discretion. In the usual
sentencing, whether following trial or plea, the judge’s
reliance on the Guidelines will be apparent, for the judge
will use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the
analysis and impose a sentence within the range. Gall v.
United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007). Even where the
judge varies from the recommended range, id., at 50, if the
judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to
explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guidelines
are in a real sense a basis for the sentence.
Rule 11(c)(1)(C) makes the parties’ recommended sen
tence binding on the court “once the court accepts the plea
agreement,” but the governing policy statement confirms
that the court’s acceptance is itself based on the Guide
