FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

Act’s purposes.
The crack-cocaine range here is a prime example of an
unwarranted disparity that §3582(c)(2) is designed to cure.
The Commission amended the crack-cocaine Guidelines
to effect a “partial remedy” for the “urgent and compel
ling” problem of crack-cocaine sentences, which, the Com
mission concluded, “significantly undermines the various
congressional objectives set forth in the Sentencing Re
form Act.” United States Sentencing Commission, Report
to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy,
pp. 8–10 (May 2007); see also USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt.
706; Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 99–100
(2007). The Commission determined that those Guide
lines were flawed, and therefore that sentences that relied
on them ought to be reexamined. There is no good reason
to extend the benefit of the Commission’s judgment only to
an arbitrary subset of defendants whose agreed sentences
were accepted in light of a since-rejected Guidelines range
based on whether their plea agreements refer to the
Guidelines. Congress enacted §3582(c)(2) to remedy sys
temic injustice, and the approach outlined in the opinion
concurring in the judgment would undercut a systemic
solution.
Even when a defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agree
ment, the judge’s decision to accept the plea and impose
the recommended sentence is likely to be based on the
Guidelines; and when it is, the defendant should be eligi
ble to seek §3582(c)(2) relief. This straightforward analy
sis would avoid making arbitrary distinctions between
similar defendants based on the terms of their plea
agreements. And it would also reduce unwarranted dis
parities in federal sentencing, consistent with the pur
poses of the Sentencing Reform Act.
