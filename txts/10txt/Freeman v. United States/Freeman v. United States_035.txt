ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

ticularly unfortunate given that the whole point of Rule
11(c)(1)(C) agreements is to provide the parties with cer­
tainty about sentencing.

As with any negotiation, parties entering a Rule 11(c)
(1)(C) plea agreement must take the bitter with the
sweet. Because of today’s decision, however, Freeman gets
more sweet and the Government more bitter than either
side bargained for. But those who will really be left with a
sour taste after today’s decision are the lower courts
charged with making sense of it going forward.
I respectfully dissent.
