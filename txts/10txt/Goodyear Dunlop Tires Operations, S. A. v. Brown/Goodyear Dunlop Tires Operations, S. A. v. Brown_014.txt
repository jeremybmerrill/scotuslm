Opinion of the Court

States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one
of those States if its allegedly defective merchandise has
there been the source of injury to its owner or to others” (em
phasis added)). But ties serving to bolster the exercise
of specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination
that, based on those ties, the forum has general jurisdic
tion over a defendant. See, e.g., Stabilisierungsfonds Fur
Wein v. Kaiser Stuhl Wine Distributors Pty. Ltd., 647 F. 2d
200, 203, n. 5 (CADC 1981) (defendants’ marketing ar
rangements, although “adequate to permit litigation of
claims relating to [their] introduction of . . . wine into
the United States stream of commerce, . . . would not be
adequate to support general, ‘all purpose’ adjudicatory
authority”).
A corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts within
a state,” International Shoe instructed, “is not enough to
support the demand that the corporation be amenable to
suits unrelated to that activity.” 326 U. S., at 318. Our
1952 decision in Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co.
remains “[t]he textbook case of general jurisdiction appro
priately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not
consented to suit in the forum.” Donahue v. Far Eastern
Air Transport Corp., 652 F. 2d 1032, 1037 (CADC 1981).
Sued in Ohio, the defendant in Perkins was a Philippine
mining corporation that had ceased activities in the Phil
ippines during World War II. To the extent that the com
pany was conducting any business during and immedi
ately after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it
was doing so in Ohio: the corporation’s president main
tained his office there, kept the company files in that
office, and supervised from the Ohio office “the necessarily
limited wartime activities of the company.” Perkins, 342
U. S., at 447–448. Although the claim-in-suit did not arise
in Ohio, this Court ruled that it would not violate due
process for Ohio to adjudicate the controversy. Ibid.; see
Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 779–780,
