Opinion of the Court

facturer or seller of goods would be amenable to suit, on
any claim for relief, wherever its products are distributed.
But cf. World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 296 (every
seller of chattels does not, by virtue of the sale, “appoint
the chattel his agent for service of process”).
Measured against Helicopteros and Perkins, North Caro
lina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to
subject petitioners to general jurisdiction. Unlike the
defendant in Perkins, whose sole wartime business activ
ity was conducted in Ohio, petitioners are in no sense at
home in North Carolina. Their attenuated connections to
the State, see supra, at 4–5, fall far short of the “the con
tinuous and systematic general business contacts” neces
sary to empower North Carolina to entertain suit against
them on claims unrelated to anything that connects them
to the State. Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416.5

Respondents belatedly assert a “single enterprise” the

Carolina with those of Goodyear USA and other Goodyear
entities. See Brief for Respondents 44–50. In effect,

5 As earlier noted, see supra, at 6, the North Carolina Court of Ap
peals invoked the State’s “well-recognized interest in providing a forum
in which its citizens are able to seek redress for injuries that they have
sustained.” 199 N. C. App., at 68, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394. But “[g]eneral
jurisdiction to adjudicate has in [United States] practice never been
based on the plaintiff’s relationship to the forum. There is nothing in
[our] law comparable to . . . article 14 of the Civil Code of France (1804)
under which the French nationality of the plaintiff is a sufficient
ground for jurisdiction.” von Mehren & Trautman 1137; see Clermont
& Palmer, Exorbitant Jurisdiction, 58 Me. L. Rev. 474, 492–495 (2006)
(French law permitting plaintiff-based jurisdiction is rarely invoked
in the absence of other supporting factors). When a defendant’s act
outside the forum causes injury in the forum, by contrast, a plaintiff’s
residence in the forum may strengthen the case for the exercise of
specific jurisdiction. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, 788 (1984); von
Mehren & Trautman 1167–1173.
