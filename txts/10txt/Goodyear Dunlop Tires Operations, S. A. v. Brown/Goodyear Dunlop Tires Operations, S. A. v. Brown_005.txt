GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.
v. BROWN
Opinion of the Court

the North Carolina court’s jurisdiction over it; Goodyear
USA’s foreign subsidiaries, however, maintained that
North Carolina lacked adjudicatory authority over them.
A state court’s assertion of jurisdiction exposes defen
dants to the State’s coercive power, and is therefore sub
ject to review for compatibility with the Fourteenth
Amendment’s Due Process Clause. International Shoe
Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316 (1945) (assertion of
jurisdiction over out-of-state corporation must comply with
“ ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice’ ”
(quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463 (1940))).
Opinions in the wake of the pathmarking International
Shoe decision have differentiated between general or all
purpose jurisdiction, and specific or case-linked jurisdic
tion. Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall,
466 U. S. 408, 414, nn. 8, 9 (1984).
A court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign
(sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any
and all claims against them when their affiliations with
the State are so “continuous and systematic” as to render
them essentially at home in the forum State. See Interna
tional Shoe, 326 U. S., at 317. Specific jurisdiction, on the
other hand, depends on an “affiliatio[n] between the forum
and the underlying controversy,” principally, activity or an
occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is
therefore subject to the State’s regulation. von Mehren &
Trautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analy
sis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121, 1136 (1966) (hereinafter von
Mehren & Trautman); see Brilmayer et al., A General
Look at General Jurisdiction, 66 Texas L. Rev. 721, 782
(1988) (hereinafter Brilmayer). In contrast to general, all
purpose jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction is confined to
adjudication of “issues deriving from, or connected with,
the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.” von
