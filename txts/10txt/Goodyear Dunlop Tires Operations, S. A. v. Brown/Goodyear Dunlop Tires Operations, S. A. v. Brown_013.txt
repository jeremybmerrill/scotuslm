GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.
v. BROWN
Opinion of the Court

sonal jurisdiction in “any action claiming injury to person
or property within this State arising out of [the defen
dant’s] act or omission outside this State,” if, “in addi
tion[,] at or about the time of the injury,” ”[p]roducts . . .
manufactured by the defendant were used or consumed,
within this State in the ordinary course of trade.” N. C.
Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–75.4(4)(b) (Lexis 2009).3 As the North
Carolina Court of Appeals recognized, this provision of the
State’s long-arm statute “does not apply to this case,” for
both the act alleged to have caused injury (the fabrication
of the allegedly defective tire) and its impact (the accident)
occurred outside the forum. See 199 N. C. App., at 61,
n. 6, 681 S. E. 2d, at 390, n. 6.4
The North Carolina court’s stream-of-commerce analysis
elided the essential difference between case-specific and
all-purpose (general) jurisdiction. Flow of a manufac
turer’s products into the forum, we have explained, may
bolster an affiliation germane to specific jurisdiction. See,
e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 297 (where “the
sale of a product . . . is not simply an isolated occurrence,
but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distribu
tor to serve . . . the market for its product in [several]

3 Cf. D. C. Code §13–423(a)(4) (2001) (providing for specific jurisdic
tion over defendant who “caus[es] tortious injury in the [forum] by an
act or omission outside the [forum]” when, in addition, the defendant
“derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed . . . in the
[forum]”).
4 The court instead relied on N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–75.4(1)(d), see
199 N. C. App., at 57, 681 S. E. 2d, at 388, which provides for jurisdic
tion, “whether the claim arises within or without [the] State,” when the
defendant “[i]s engaged in substantial activity within this State,
whether such activity is wholly interstate, intrastate, or otherwise.”
This provision, the North Carolina Supreme Court has held, was “in
tended to make available to the North Carolina courts the full juris
dictional powers permissible under federal due process.” Dillon v.
Numismatic Funding Corp., 291 N. C. 674, 676, 231 S. E. 2d 629, 630
(1977).
