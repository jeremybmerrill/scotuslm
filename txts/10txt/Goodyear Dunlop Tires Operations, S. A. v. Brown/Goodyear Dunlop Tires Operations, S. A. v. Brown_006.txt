Opinion of the Court

in France, and the tire alleged to have caused the accident
was manufactured and sold abroad, North Carolina courts
lacked specific jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy.
The North Carolina Court of Appeals so acknowledged.
Brown v. Meter, 199 N. C. App. 50, 57–58, 681 S. E. 2d
382, 388 (2009). Were the foreign subsidiaries nonetheless
amenable to general jurisdiction in North Carolina courts?
Confusing or blending general and specific jurisdictional
inquiries, the North Carolina courts answered yes. Some
of the tires made abroad by Goodyear’s foreign subsidiar

gave North Carolina courts the handle needed for the
exercise of general jurisdiction over the foreign corpora
tions. Id., at 67–68, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394–395.
A connection so limited between the forum and the for
eign corporation, we hold, is an inadequate basis for the
exercise of general jurisdiction. Such a connection does
not establish the “continuous and systematic” affiliation
necessary to empower North Carolina courts to entertain
claims unrelated to the foreign corporation’s contacts with
the State.

suit for wrongful-death damages in the Superior Court of
Onslow County, North Carolina, in their capacity as ad
ministrators of the boys’ estates. Attributing the accident
to a tire that failed when its plies separated, the parents
alleged negligence in the “design, construction, testing,
