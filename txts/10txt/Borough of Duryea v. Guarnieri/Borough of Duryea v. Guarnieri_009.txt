BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI
Opinion of the Court

some power to restrain her.” Waters v. Churchill, 511
U. S. 661, 675 (1994) (plurality opinion). Restraints are
justified by the consensual nature of the employment
relationship and by the unique nature of the government’s
interest.
This case arises under the Petition Clause, not the
Speech Clause. The parties litigated the case on the prem­
ise that Guarnieri’s grievances and lawsuit are petitions
protected by the Petition Clause. This Court’s precedents
confirm that the Petition Clause protects the right of in­
dividuals to appeal to courts and other forums estab­

“[T]he right of access to courts for redress of wrongs is an
aspect of the First Amendment right to petition the gov­

897 (1984); see also BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U. S.
516, 525 (2002); Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB,
461 U. S. 731, 741 (1983); California Motor Transport Co.
v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508, 513 (1972). Al­
though retaliation by a government employer for a public
employee’s exercise of the right of access to the courts may
implicate the protections of the Petition Clause, this case
provides no necessity to consider the correct application of
the Petition Clause beyond that context.
Although this case proceeds under the Petition Clause,
Guarnieri just as easily could have alleged that his em­
ployer retaliated against him for the speech contained
within his grievances and lawsuit. That claim would have
been subject to the public concern test already described.
Because Guarnieri chose to proceed under the Petition
Clause, however, the Court of Appeals applied a more
generous rule. Following the decision of the Court of
Appeals in San Filippo, supra, at 443, Guarnieri was
deemed entitled to protection from retaliation so long as
his petition was not a “sham.” Under that rule, defen­
dants and other public employers might be liable under
