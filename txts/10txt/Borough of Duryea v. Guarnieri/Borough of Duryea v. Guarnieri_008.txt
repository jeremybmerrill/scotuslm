Opinion of the Court

ployee must show that he or she spoke as a citizen on a
matter of public concern. Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138,
147 (1983). If an employee does not speak as a citizen, or
does not address a matter of public concern, “a federal
court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the
wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency
allegedly in reaction to the employee’s behavior.” Ibid.
Even if an employee does speak as a citizen on a matter of
public concern, the employee’s speech is not automatically
privileged. Courts balance the First Amendment interest
of the employee against “the interest of the State, as an
employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services
it performs through its employees.” Pickering v. Board of
Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391
U. S. 563, 568 (1968).
This framework “reconcile[s] the employee’s right to
engage in speech and the government employer’s right to
protect its own legitimate interests in performing its
mission.” San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 82 (2004) (per

contract for public employment. “Our responsibility is to
ensure that citizens are not deprived of [these] fundamen­
tal rights by virtue of working for the government.” Con
nick, supra, at 147; see also Keyishian v. Board of Regents
of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605–606 (1967).
Nevertheless, a citizen who accepts public employment
“must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.”
Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 418 (2006). The gov­
ernment has a substantial interest in ensuring that all of
its operations are efficient and effective. That interest
may require broad authority to supervise the conduct of
public employees. “When someone who is paid a salary so
that she will contribute to an agency’s effective operation
begins to do or say things that detract from the agency’s
effective operation, the government employer must have
