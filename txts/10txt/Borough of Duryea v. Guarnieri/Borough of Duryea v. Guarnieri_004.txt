BOROUGH OF DURYEA, PENNSYLVANIA, ET AL., 

PETITIONERS v. CHARLES J. GUARNIERI 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[June 20, 2011] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the court.
Among other rights essential to freedom, the First
Amendment protects “the right of the people . . . to peti­
tion the Government for a redress of grievances.” U. S.
Const., Amdt. 1. This case concerns the extent of the
protection, if any, that the Petition Clause grants public
employees in routine disputes with government employ­
ers. Petitions are a form of expression, and employees
who invoke the Petition Clause in most cases could invoke
as well the Speech Clause of the First Amendment. To
show that an employer interfered with rights under the
Speech Clause, the employee, as a general rule, must show
that his speech was on a matter of public concern, as that
term is defined in the precedents of this and other courts.
Here the issue is whether that test applies when the
employee invokes the Petition Clause.
Alone among the Courts of Appeals to have addressed
the issue, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has
held that the public concern test does not limit Petition
Clause claims by public employees. For the reasons stated
below, this conclusion is incorrect.
