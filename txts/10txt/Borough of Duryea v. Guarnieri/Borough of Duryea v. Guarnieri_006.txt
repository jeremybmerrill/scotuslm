Opinion of the Court

under 42 U. S. C. §1983. Guarnieri claimed that his first
union grievance was a petition protected by the Petition
Clause of the First Amendment, and he alleged that the
directives issued upon his reinstatement were retaliation
for that protected activity.
After this suit was filed, the council denied a request
by Guarnieri for $338 in overtime. The United States
Department of Labor investigated and concluded that
Guarnieri was entitled to be paid. The council offered
Guarnieri a check for the amount, but Guarnieri refused
to accept it. Instead, Guarnieri amended his complaint to
encompass the denial of overtime. Guarnieri alleged that
his §1983 lawsuit was a petition and that the denial of
overtime constituted retaliation for his having filed the
lawsuit.
Under the law of the Circuit, the defendants could not
obtain judgment as a matter of law on the basis that
the lawsuit and grievances were not on a matter of public

instructed the jury that the lawsuit and union grievances
were “protected activity . . . under the constitution,” and
that the jury could find defendants liable if it found an
adequate connection between the protected activity and
the alleged retaliation. Id., at 61:17–20; 62. The jury
found in favor of Guarnieri. The jury awarded $45,000 in
compensatory damages and $24,000 in punitive damages
for the directives, as well as $358 in compensatory dam­
ages and $28,000 in punitive damages for the denial of
overtime. The District Court awarded $45,000 in attor­
ney’s fees and denied defendants’ renewed motion for
judgment as a matter of law.
Defendants appealed on the ground that Guarnieri’s
