BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

Sherman Act that had been held to immunize certain
lobbying (legislature-petitioning) activity, did not apply to
sham litigation that “sought to bar . . . competitors from
meaningful access to adjudicatory tribunals,” 404 U. S., at
510–512. The three other cases cited by the Court as
holding that lawsuits are petitions, ante, at 6, are all
statutory interpretation decisions construing the National
Labor Relations Act, albeit against the backdrop of the
Petition Clause. See BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536
U. S. 516, 534–536 (2002); Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467
U. S. 883, 896–897 (1984) Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc.
v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 741–743 (1983). The Court has
never actually held that a lawsuit is a constitutionally
protected “Petition,” nor does today’s opinion hold that.
The Court merely observes that “[t]he parties litigated the
case on the premise that Guarnieri’s grievances and law
suit are petitions protected by the Petition Clause,” ante,
at 6, and concludes that Guarnieri’s 42 U. S. C. §1983
claim would fail even if that premise were correct.
I find the proposition that a lawsuit is a constitutionally
protected “Petition” quite doubtful. The First Amend
ment’s Petition Clause states that “Congress shall make
no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people . . . to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” The
reference to “the right of the people” indicates that the
Petition Clause was intended to codify a pre-existing
individual right, which means that we must look to
historical practice to determine its scope. See District of
Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 579, 592 (2008).
There is abundant historical evidence that “Petitions”
were directed to the executive and legislative branches of
government, not to the courts. In 1765, the Stamp Act
Congress stated “[t]hat it is the right of the British sub
jects in these colonies to petition the King or either House
of Parliament.” Declaration of Rights and Grievances,
