BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI
Opinion of SCALIA, J.

would largely resolve the legitimate practical concerns
identified by the Court, ante, at 10–12, while recognizing
and giving effect to the difference between the Speech and
Petition Clauses.
Under what I think to be the proper test, the Third
Circuit judgment before us here should be reversed in part
and affirmed in part. The portion of it upholding Guarni
eri’s claim of retaliation for having filed his union griev
ance must be reversed. A union grievance is the epitome
of a petition addressed to the government in its capacity
as the petitioner’s employer. No analogous petitions to the
government could have been filed by private citizens, who
are not even permitted to avail themselves of Guarnieri’s
union grievance procedure. Contrariwise, the portion of
the judgment upholding Guarnieri’s claim of retaliation
for having filed his §1983 claim must be affirmed. Given
that Guarnieri was not an employee of the Federal Gov
ernment, it is impossible to say that the §1983 claim was
addressed to government in its capacity as his employer. I
think it clear that retaliating against a state employee for
writing a letter to his Congressman about his state job
would run afoul of the Petition Clause. Assuming that the
§1983 lawsuit should be treated like a letter to a Con
gressman for Petition Clause purposes—a proposition
which, I again emphasize, is doubtful, but which the par
ties do not dispute in this case—retaliation for having filed
his lawsuit also violates the Clause.

cerning employee grievance was matter of private concern because it
did “not allege . . . fraud or corruption in [defendant’s] implementation
of its personnel policies and appeal procedures”).
