BOROUGH OF DURYEA, PENNSYLVANIA, ET AL., 

PETITIONERS v. CHARLES J. GUARNIERI 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

[June 20, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment in part and
dissenting in part.
I disagree with two aspects of the Court’s reasoning.
First, the Court is incorrect to state that our “precedents
confirm that the Petition Clause protects the right of
individuals to appeal to courts and other forums estab
lished by the government for resolution of legal disputes.”
Ante, at 6. Our first opinion clearly saying that lawsuits
are “Petitions” under the Petition Clause came less than
40 years ago. In California Motor Transport Co. v. Truck
ing Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508 (1972),1 an opinion by Justice
Douglas, the Court asserted that “[t]he right of access to
the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.”
Id., at 510. As authority it cited two habeas corpus cases,
Johnson v. Avery, 393 U. S. 483 (1969), and Ex parte Hull,
312 U. S. 546 (1941), neither of which even mentioned the
Petition Clause. The assertion, moreover, was pure dic
tum. The holding of California Motor Transport was that
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, a judicial gloss on the
——————
1 Respondent would agree, since he cited this case in argument as the
earliest. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36. There were, however, three cases in the
1960’s which adverted vaguely to lawsuits as involving the right to
petition. See Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn., 389 U. S. 217, 222–
224 (1967); Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1,
7 (1964); NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 430 (1963).
