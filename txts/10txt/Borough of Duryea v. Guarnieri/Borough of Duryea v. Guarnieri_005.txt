BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI 

Opinion of the Court 


I

Charles Guarnieri filed a union grievance challenging
his termination as chief of police for the borough of
Duryea, a town of about 4,600 persons in northeastern
Pennsylvania. His grievance proceeded to arbitration
pursuant to the police union collective-bargaining agree­
ment. The arbitrator found that the borough council,
Duryea’s legislative body and the entity responsible for
Guarnieri’s termination, committed procedural errors in
connection with the termination; and the arbitrator also
found that Guarnieri engaged in misconduct, including
“attempting to intimidate Council members.” App. 37, 38.
The arbitrator ordered Guarnieri reinstated after a disci­
plinary suspension. Id., at 38.
Upon Guarnieri’s return to the job, the council issued 11
directives instructing Guarnieri in the performance of his
duties. The council’s attorney explained that the council
“wanted to be sure that the chief understood what was
going to be expected of him upon his return.” Tr. 19:12–14
(Apr. 16, 2008). One directive prohibited Guarnieri from
working overtime without the council’s “express permis­
sion.” App. 59, ¶1. Another indicated that “[t]he police
car is to be used for official business only.” Id., at 60, ¶9.
A third stated that the “Duryea municipal building is a
smoke free building” and that the “police department is
not exempt.” Id., at 61, ¶10. Guarnieri testified that,
because of these and other directives, his “coming back
wasn’t a warm welcome feeling.” Tr. 65:7–8 (Apr. 15,
2008). Guarnieri filed a second union grievance challeng­
ing the directives. The arbitrator instructed the council to
modify or withdraw some of the directives on the grounds
that they were vague, interfered with the authority of
the mayor, or were contrary to the collective-bargaining
agreement.
Guarnieri filed this lawsuit against the borough, the
borough council, and individual members of the council
