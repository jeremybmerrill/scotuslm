BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI
Opinion of the Court

grievances and lawsuit did not address matters of public
concern. Courts outside the Third Circuit have held that
allegedly retaliatory actions by government employers
against government employees may not give rise to liabil­
ity under the Petition Clause unless the employee’s peti­
tion related to a matter of public concern. See, e.g., Kirby
v. Elizabeth City, 388 F. 3d 440, 448–449 (CA4 2004);
Tang v. Rhode Island, Dept. of Elderly Affairs, 163 F. 3d 7,
11–12 (CA1 1998); White Plains Towing Corp. v. Patter
son, 991 F. 2d 1049, 1059 (CA2 1993). These courts rely
on a substantial overlap between the rights of speech and
petition to justify the application of Speech Clause pre­
cedents to Petition Clause claims. They reason that,
whether the grievance is considered under the Speech
Clause or the Petition Clause, the government employer is
entitled to take adverse action against the employee
unless the dispute involves a matter of public concern.
Rejecting that view, the Court of Appeals here affirmed
the award of compensatory damages, although it found
insufficient evidence to sustain the award of punitive
damages. The Court of Appeals concluded that “ ‘a public
employee who has petitioned the government through a
formal mechanism such as the filing of a lawsuit or griev­
ance is protected under the Petition Clause from retalia­
tion for that activity, even if the petition concerns a matter
of solely private concern.’ ” 364 Fed. Appx. 749, 753 (CA3
2010) (quoting Foraker v. Chaffinch, 501 F. 3d 231, 236
(CA3 2007)). The decision of the Court of Appeals was
consistent with the rule adopted and explained by that
court in San Filippo v. Bongiovanni, 30 F. 3d 424, 442
(1994). This Court granted certiorari to resolve the con­
flict in the Courts of Appeals. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).
