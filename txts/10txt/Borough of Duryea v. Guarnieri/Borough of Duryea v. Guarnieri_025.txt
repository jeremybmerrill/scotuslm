THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

Guarnieri’s employer. See post, at 8 (opinion of SCALIA,
J.). Second, Guarnieri addressed his §1983 suit to the
Federal Government in its capacity as sovereign, not to
the local government as his employer. See ibid. But the
Court of Appeals did not consider whether the local gov
ernment’s interest as an employer “in achieving its goals
as effectively and efficiently as possible” nevertheless
outweighs Guarnieri’s interest in petitioning the Federal
Government regarding his local employment. Engquist,
supra, at 598 (internal quotation marks omitted). I would
vacate and remand for the Court of Appeals to conduct
that analysis in the first instance.
