Opinion of the Court

King’s assent and became part of the law of England. See
S. Gardiner, The First Two Stuarts and the Puritan Revo­
lution, 1603–1660, pp. 60–61 (1886). The Petition of Right
occupies a place in English constitutional history super­
seded in importance, perhaps, only by Magna Carta itself
and the Declaration of Right of 1689.
The following years saw use of mass petitions to address
matters of public concern. See 8 D. Hume, History of
England from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolu­
tion in 1688, p. 122 (1763) (“Tumultuous petitioning . . .
was an admirable expedient . . . for spreading discontent,
and for uniting the nation in any popular clamour”). In
1680, for instance, more than 15,000 persons signed a
petition regarding the summoning and dissolution of Par­
liament, “one of the major political issues agitating the
nation.” Knights, London’s ‘Monster’ Petition, 36 Histori­
cal Journal 39, 40–43 (1993). Nine years later, the Decla­
ration of Right listed the illegal acts of the sovereign and
set forth certain rights of the King’s subjects, one of which
was the right to petition the sovereign. It stated that “it
is the Right of the Subjects to petition the King, and all
Commitments and Prosecutions for such Petitioning are
Illegal.” 1 W. & M., ch. 2; see also L. Schwoerer, The
Declaration of Rights, 1689, pp. 69–71 (1981).
The Declaration of Independence of 1776 arose in the
same tradition. After listing other specific grievances and
wrongs, it complained, “In every stage of these Oppres­
sions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble
terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by
repeated injury.” The Declaration of Independence ¶30.
After independence, petitions on matters of public con­
cern continued to be an essential part of contemporary
debates in this country’s early history. Two years before
the adoption of the Constitution, James Madison’s Memo­
rial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments, an
important document in the history of the Establishment
