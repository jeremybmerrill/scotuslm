Opinion of the Court 


III 

Because the Third Circuit did not find it necessary to
apply this framework, there has been no determination
as to how it would apply in the context of this case. The
parties did not address the issue in the opening brief or
the response, and the United States did not address the
issue in its brief as amicus curiae. In their reply brief,
petitioners suggest that this Court should address the
issue and resolve it in their favor. Yet in their opening
brief petitioners sought only vacatur and remand. This
Court need not consider this issue without the benefit of
full briefs by the parties.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
