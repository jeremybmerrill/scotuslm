BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI
Opinion of the Court

government in the effective and efficient management of
its internal affairs. Pickering, supra, at 568. If that
balance favors the public employee, the employee’s First
Amendment claim will be sustained. If the interference
with the government’s operations is such that the balance
favors the employer, the employee’s First Amendment
claim will fail even though the petition is on a matter of
public concern.
As under the Speech Clause, whether an employee’s
petition relates to a matter of public concern will depend
on “the content, form, and context of [the petition], as
revealed by the whole record.” Connick, 461 U. S., at 147–
148, and n. 7. The forum in which a petition is lodged will
be relevant to the determination of whether the petition
relates to a matter of public concern. See Snyder v.
Phelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8–9). A peti­
tion filed with an employer using an internal grievance
procedure in many cases will not seek to communicate to
the public or to advance a political or social point of view
beyond the employment context.
Of course in one sense the public may always be inter­
ested in how government officers are performing their
duties. But as the Connick and Pickering test has evolved,
that will not always suffice to show a matter of public
concern. A petition that “involves nothing more than a
complaint about a change in the employee’s own duties”
does not relate to a matter of public concern and accord­
ingly “may give rise to discipline without imposing any
special burden of justification on the government em­
ployer.” United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S.
454, 466 (1995). The right of a public employee under the
Petition Clause is a right to participate as a citizen,
through petitioning activity, in the democratic process. It
is not a right to transform everyday employment disputes
into matters for constitutional litigation in the federal
courts.
