BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI
Opinion of the Court

Clause, was presented to the General Assembly of the Com­
monwealth of Virginia as a petition. See 1 D. Laycock, Religious Liberty: Overviews and History 90 (2010);
Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v.
Winn, 563 U. S. ___ , ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12–13). It
attracted over 1,000 signatures. Laycock, supra, at 90,
n. 153. During the ratification debates, Antifederalists
circulated petitions urging delegates not to adopt the
Constitution absent modification by a bill of rights. Boyd,
Antifederalists and the Acceptance of the Constitution:
Pennsylvania, 1787–1792, 9 Publius, No. 2, pp. 123, 128–
133 (Spring 1979).
Petitions to the National Legislature also played a
central part in the legislative debate on the subject of
slavery in the years before the Civil War. See W. Miller,
Arguing About Slavery (1995). Petitions allowed partici­

The History and Significance of the Right to Petition, 66
Ford. L. Rev. 2153, 2182 (1998). For instance, petitions by
women seeking the vote had a role in the early woman’s
suffrage movement. See Cogan & Ginzberg, 1846 Petition
for Woman’s Suffrage, New York State Constitutional
Convention, 22 Signs 427, 437–438 (1997). The right to
petition is in some sense the source of other fundamental
rights, for petitions have provided a vital means for citi­
zens to request recognition of new rights and to assert
existing rights against the sovereign.
Petitions to the courts and similar bodies can likewise
address matters of great public import. In the context of
the civil rights movement, litigation provided a means for
“the distinctive contribution of a minority group to the
ideas and beliefs of our society.” NAACP v. Button, 371
U. S. 415, 431 (1963). Individuals may also “engag[e] in
