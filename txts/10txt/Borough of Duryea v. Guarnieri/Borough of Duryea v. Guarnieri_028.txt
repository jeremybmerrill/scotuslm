Opinion of SCALIA, J.

Documentary History 195, 198 (1971); it made no mention
of petitions directed to the courts. As of 1781, seven state
constitutions protected citizens’ right to apply or petition
for redress of grievances; all seven referred only to legisla
tive petitions. See Andrews, A Right of Access to Court
Under the Petition Clause of the First Amendment: De
fining the Right, 60 Ohio St. L. J. 557, 604–605, n. 159
(1999). The Judiciary Act of 1789 did not grant federal
trial courts jurisdiction to hear lawsuits arising under
federal law; there is no indication anyone ever thought
that this restriction infringed on the right of citizens to
petition the Federal Government for redress of grievances.
The fact that the Court never affirmed a First Amendment
right to litigate until its unsupported dictum in 1972—
after having heard almost 200 years’ worth of lawsuits,
untold numbers of which might have been affected by a
First Amendment right to litigate—should give rise to a
strong suspicion that no such right exists. “[A] universal
and long-established tradition of prohibiting certain con
duct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition is
constitutional: Principles of liberty fundamental enough to
have been embodied within constitutional guarantees are
not readily erased from the Nation’s consciousness.”
Nevada Comm’n on Ethics v. Carrigan, ante, at 4 (internal
quotation marks omitted).
I acknowledge, however, that scholars have made de
tailed historical arguments to the contrary. See, e.g.,
Andrews, supra, at 595–625; Pfander, Sovereign Immu
nity and the Right to Petition: Toward a First Amendment
Right to Pursue Judicial Claims Against the Government,
91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 899, 903–962 (1997). As the Court’s
opinion observes, the parties have not litigated the issue,
and so I agree we should leave its resolution to another
day.
Second, and of greater practical consequence, I disagree
with the Court’s decision to apply the “public concern”
