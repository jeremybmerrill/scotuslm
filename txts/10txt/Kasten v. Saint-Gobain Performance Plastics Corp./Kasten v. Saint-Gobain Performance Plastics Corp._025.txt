be unwarranted. If we are to apply our new jurisprudence
that deference is appropriate only when Congress has
given the agency authority to make rules carrying the
force of law, see Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 255–
256 (2006), deference is improper here. The EEOC has
no such authority. Although the Secretary of Labor and
his subordinates have authority to issue regulations
under various provisions of the FLSA, see, e.g., §203(l);
§206(a)(2), they have no general authority to issue regula
tions interpreting the Act, and no specific authority to
issue regulations interpreting §215(a)(3).
Presumably for this reason, the Court’s opinion seems to
suggest that only so-called Skidmore deference is appro
priate, see Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140
(1944).5 This doctrine states that agencies’ views are
“ ‘entitled to respect’ ” to the extent they have “ ‘the power
to persuade.’ ” Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S.
576, 587 (2000) (quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140).6 For

perhaps not. The actual quantum of deference measured out by
the Court’s opinion is unclear—seemingly intentionally so. The Court
says that it is giving “a degree of weight” to the Secretary and EEOC’s
views “given Congress’ delegation of enforcement powers to federal
administrative agencies.” Ante, at 12. But it never explicitly states the
level of deference applied, and includes a mysterious citation of United
States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001), along with a parenthetical
saying that “sometimes . . . judicial deference [is] intended even in [the]
absence of rulemaking authority.” Ante, at 13. I say this is mysterious
because Mead clearly held that rulemaking authority was necessary for
full Chevron deference, see Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). I have chosen to interpret
the Court as referring to Skidmore deference, rather than Chevron
deference or something in-between, in order to minimize the Court’s
ongoing obfuscation of this once-clear area of administrative law. See
Mead, supra, at 245 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
6 In my view this doctrine (if it can be called that) is incoherent, both
linguistically and practically. To defer is to subordinate one’s own
judgment to another’s. If one has been persuaded by another, so that
one’s judgment accords with the other’s, there is no room for deferral—
only for agreement. Speaking of “Skidmore deference” to a persuasive
