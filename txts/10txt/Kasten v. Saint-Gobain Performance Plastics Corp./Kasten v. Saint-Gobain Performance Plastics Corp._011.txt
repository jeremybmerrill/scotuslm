KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


Looking beyond the Act, we find other statutes that
contain antiretaliation provisions. Those statutes, how­
ever, use somewhat different language.
See, e.g.,
§158(a)(4) (protecting an employee who has “filed charges
or given testimony”); §623(d) (protecting those who
“opposed any [unlawful] practice” (emphasis added));
42 U. S. C. §§2000e–3(a), 12203(a) (same); 29 U. S. C.
§2615(a)(2) (similar). See also, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §2087(a)(1)
(2006 ed., Supp. III) (“provided . . . to the employer . . .
information relating to any violation” (emphasis added));
§2651(a) (similar); 30 U. S. C. §815(c)(1) (“filed or made a
complaint” (emphasis added)); 42 U. S. C. §5851(a)(1)(A)
(“notified his employer” (emphasis added)); 49 U. S. C.
§42121(a)(1) (“provided . . . information” (emphasis
added)); §60129(a)(1) (same). Some of this language is
broader than the phrase before us, but, given the fact that
the phrase before us lends itself linguistically to the
broader, “oral” interpretation, the use of broader language
elsewhere may mean (1) that Congress wanted to limit the
scope of the phrase before us to writings, or (2) that Con­
gress did not believe the different phraseology made a
significant difference in this respect. The language alone
does not tell us whether Congress, if intending to protect
orally expressed grievances elsewhere, did or did not
intend to leave those oral grievances unprotected here.
The bottom line is that the text, taken alone, cannot
provide a conclusive answer to our interpretive question.
The phrase “filed any complaint” might, or might not,
encompass oral complaints. We must look further.

Several functional considerations indicate that Congress
intended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well
as written, “complaint[s].” First, an interpretation that
limited the provision’s coverage to written complaints
