KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


“In many plants where there is a high degree of illit­
eracy, the writing of grievances by employees works a
substantial hardship. In other plants where there is
considerable dirt and special clothes must be worn, it
is often not practicable to write up grievances during
work hours.” 1 The Termination Report of the Na­
tional War Labor Board, p. 122.
To limit the scope of the antiretaliation provision to the
filing of written complaints would also take needed flexi­
bility from those charged with the Act’s enforcement. It
could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines,
interviews, and other oral methods of receiving com­
plaints. And insofar as the antiretaliation provision cov­
ers complaints made to employers (a matter we need not
decide, see infra, at 14–15), it would discourage the use of
desirable informal workplace grievance procedures to
secure compliance with the Act. Cf. Burlington Industries,
Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 764 (1998) (reading Title VII
to encourage the development of effective grievance proce­
dures to deter misconduct); D. McPherson, C. Gates, & K.
Rogers, Resolving Grievances: A Practical Approach 38–40
(1983) (describing the significant benefits of unwritten
complaints).
Given the need for effective enforcement of the National
Labor Relations Act (NLRA), this Court has broadly inter­
preted the language of the NLRA’s antiretaliation provi­
sion—“filed charges or given testimony,” 29 U. S. C.
§158(a)(4)—as protecting workers who neither filed
charges nor were “called formally to testify” but simply
“participate[d] in a [National Labor Relations] Board
investigation.” NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123
(1972) (emphasis added). The similar enforcement needs
of this related statute argue for an interpretation of the
word “complaint” that would provide “broad rather than
narrow protection to the employee,” id., at 122 (and would
