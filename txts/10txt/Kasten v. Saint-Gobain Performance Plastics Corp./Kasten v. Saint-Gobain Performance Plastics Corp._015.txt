KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


is “filed” when “a reasonable, objective person would have
understood the employee” to have “put the employer on
notice that [the] employee is asserting statutory rights
under the [Act].” Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26. We agree. To
fall within the scope of the antiretaliation provision, a
complaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a
reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both
content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by
the statute and a call for their protection. This standard
can be met, however, by oral complaints, as well as by
written ones.

Second, given Congress’ delegation of enforcement pow­
ers to federal administrative agencies, we also give a
degree of weight to their views about the meaning of this
enforcement language. See 29 U. S. C. §216(c) (vesting
enforcement power in Secretary of Labor); Reorganization
Plan No. 1 of 1978, 5 U. S. C. App. §1, p. 664 (transferring
to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
enforcement of this antiretaliation provision as part of its
Equal Pay Act enforcement responsibilities); Skidmore v.
Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944) (giving weight to a
persuasive articulation of views within an agency’s area of
expertise).
The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view
that the words “filed any complaint” cover oral, as well as
written, complaints. The Department of Labor articulated
that view in an enforcement action filed many years ago,
Goldberg v. Zenger, 43 CCH LC ¶31,155, pp. 40,985,
40,986 (D Utah 1961). It has subsequently reaffirmed
that view in briefs. See, e.g., Brief for Secretary of Labor
as Amicus Curiae Supporting Petition for Rehearing with
Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in Lambert v. Ackerley,
No. 96–36017 etc. (CA9), pp. 6–7. And more recently it
has acted in accordance with that view by creating a hot­
