PLASTICS CORP.

SCALIA, J., dissenting 


violation . . . .” 30 U. S. C. §815(c)(1).1
Third, the phrase “filed any complaint” appears along
side three other protected activities: “institut[ing] or
caus[ing] to be instituted any proceeding under or related
to this chapter,” “testif[ying] in any such proceeding,” and
“serv[ing] . . . on an industry committee.”2 29 U. S. C.
§215(a)(3). Since each of these three activities involves
an interaction with governmental authority, we can fairly
attribute this characteristic to the phrase “filed any com
plaint” as well. “That several items in a list share an
attribute counsel in favor of interpreting the other items
as possessing that attribute as well.” Beecham v. United
States, 511 U. S. 368, 371 (1994).
And finally, the 1938 version of the FLSA, while creat
ing private rights of action for other employer violations,
see §16(b), 52 Stat. 1069, did not create a private right of
action for retaliation. That was added in 1977, see §10, 91
Stat. 1252. Until then, only the Administrator of the
Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor could
enforce the retaliation provision. See §11(a), 52 Stat.
1066. It would seem more strange to require the employee
to go to the Administrator to establish, and punish retalia
tion for, his intracompany complaint, than to require the
Administrator-protected complaint to be filed with the

1 Kasten and this Court’s opinion, ante, at 7, argue that the use of the
modifier “any” in the phrase “filed any complaint” suggests that Con
gress meant to define the word “complaint” expansively. Not so. The
modifier “any” does not cause a word that is in context narrow to
become broad. The phrase “to cash a check at any bank” does not refer
to a river bank, or even a blood bank.
2 Section 5 of the original FLSA, which has since been repealed,
charged industry committees with recommending minimum wages for
certain industries to the Department of Labor. 52 Stat. 1062. In order
to perform this function, industry committees were empowered, among
other things, to “hear . . . witnesses” and “receive . . . evidence.” §8(b),
id., at 1064.
