Opinion of the Court

App. 1925) (“filed oral pleadings”).
Filings may more often be made in writing. See, e.g.,
Ritter v. United States, 28 F. 2d 265, 267 (CA3 1928)
(finding words “file a claim for refund” to require a written
request in context of tax code). But we are interested in
the filing of “any complaint.” So even if the word “filed,”
considered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation
limited to writings, the phrase “any complaint” suggests a
broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.
See, e.g., Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 7). The upshot is that the three-word
phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive
question.
We can look further to other appearances of the word
“filed” in the Act. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 226
(1994) (examining “contextual indications” of the meaning
of a term). That word (or a variant) appears in numerous
other provisions. But its appearance elsewhere in the Act
does not resolve the linguistic question before us. Some of
those other provisions (1) involve filed material that,
unlike a complaint, is of a kind that is virtually always in
writing. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §203(l) (employers must
“have on file an unexpired certificate” (emphasis added));
§210(a) (Secretary must “file in the court the record of
the industry committee” (emphasis added)); ibid. (industry
committee must “file” its findings and recommendations).
Others (2) specifically require a writing, see, e.g.,
§214(c)(5)(A) (requiring employee’s “consent in writing” to
join collective action to be “filed” (emphasis added));
§216(b) (same). And the remainder (3) leave the oral/
written question unresolved—just as does the provision
before us. See, e.g., §210(b) (prohibiting a stay unless
movant “file[s] in court an undertaking” (emphasis
added)); §214(c)(5)(A) (employee “may file . . . a petition”
for review of a special wage rate (emphasis added)).
