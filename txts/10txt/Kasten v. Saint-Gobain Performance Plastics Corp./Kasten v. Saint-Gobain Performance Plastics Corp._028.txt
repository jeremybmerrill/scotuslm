KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

SCALIA, J., dissenting 


question whether a complaint is “sufficiently clear and de
tailed,” ante, at 12, carries the requisite “degree of formal
ity,” ante, at 11, or provides “fair notice,” ibid., whatever
those terms may require.
The test the Court adopts amply disproves its conten
tion that “we can decide the oral/written question sepa
rately,” ante, at 15. And it makes little sense to consider
that question at all in the present case if neither oral nor
written complaints to employers are protected, cf. United
States v. Grubbs, 547 U. S. 90, 94, n. 1 (2006). This Court
should not issue an advisory opinion as to what would
have been the scope of a retaliation provision covering
complaints to employers if Congress had enacted such a
provision.
