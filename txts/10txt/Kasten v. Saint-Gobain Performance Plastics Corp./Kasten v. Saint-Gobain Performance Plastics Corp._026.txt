KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

SCALIA, J., dissenting 


the reasons stated above, the agencies’ views here lack the
“power to persuade.”
II
The Court’s opinion claims that whether §215(a)(3)
covers intracompany complaints is not fairly included in
the question presented because the argument, although
raised below, was not made in Saint-Gobain’s response to
Kasten’s petition for certiorari. Citing this Court’s Rule
15.2 and Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13
(1996), the opinion says that this Court does “not normally
consider a separate legal question not raised in the certio
rari briefs.” Ante, at 15.
It regularly does so, however, under the circumstances
that obtain here. (Curiously enough, Caterpillar, the case
cited by the Court, was one instance.) Rule 15.2 is per
missive rather than mandatory: “Any objection to consid
eration of a question presented based on what occurred in
the proceedings below . . . may be deemed waived unless
called to the Court’s attention in the brief in opposition.”
(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the Court has often per
mitted parties to defend a judgment on grounds not raised
in the brief in opposition when doing so is “predicate to an
intelligent resolution of the question presented, and there
fore fairly included therein.” Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S.
33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also
Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258–259, n. 5 (1980).
Kasten’s petition for certiorari phrases the question
presented as follows: “Is an oral complaint of a violation of
the Fair Labor Standards Act protected conduct under the
anti-retaliation provision, 29 U. S. C. §215(a)(3)?” Pet. for
Cert. i. Surely the word “complaint” in this question must
be assigned an implied addressee. It presumably does not
include a complaint to Judge Judy. And the only plausible
—————— 

agency position does nothing but confuse.
