Opinion of the Court

line to receive oral complaints, see Dept. of Labor, Compli­
ance Assistance By Law—The Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA), http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-flsa.htm
(as visited Mar. 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s
case file) (directing participants who wish to “file a com­
plaint” to contact a local office “or call the Department’s
Toll-Free Wage and Hour Help Line at 1–866–4–US–
WAGE”).
The EEOC has set forth a similar view in its Compli­
ance Manual, Vol. 2, §8–II(B)(1), p. 8–3, and n. 12 (1998),
and in multiple briefs, see, e.g., Brief for EEOC as Amicus
Curiae in Support of Petition for Rehearing with Sugges­

to our conclusion. Skidmore, supra, at 140; cf. United
States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229, 234–235 (2001)
(Court sometimes finds judicial deference intended even in
absence of rulemaking authority); Babbitt v. Sweet Home
Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 703–
704, and n. 18 (1995) (agency views, where the law coun­
sels deference, can clarify otherwise ambiguous statutory
provisions).

Finally, we note that Saint-Gobain invokes the “rule of
lenity” in support of its “written complaint” interpretation.
That rule applies primarily to the interpretation of crimi­
nal statutes. It leads us to favor a more lenient interpre­
