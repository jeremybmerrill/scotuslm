Opinion of the Court

alternative claim. Cf. post, at 1–5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).

We conclude that the Seventh Circuit erred in determin­
ing that oral complaints cannot fall within the scope of the
phrase “filed any complaint” in the Act’s antiretaliation
provision. We leave it to the lower courts to decide
whether Kasten will be able to satisfy the Act’s notice
requirement. We vacate the Circuit’s judgment and re­
mand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
