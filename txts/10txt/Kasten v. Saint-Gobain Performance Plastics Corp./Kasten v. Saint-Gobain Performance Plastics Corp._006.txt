Opinion of the Court

lenged on” the location in court, “they would lose”; he told
his lead operator that the location was illegal and that he
“was thinking about starting a lawsuit about the place­
ment of the time clocks”; and he told the human resources
manager and the operations manager that he thought the
location was illegal and that the company would “lose” in
court. Record in No. 3:07–cv–00686–bbc (WD Wis.), Doc.
87–3, pp. 31–34 (deposition of Kevin Kasten). This activ­
ity, Kasten concludes, led the company to discipline him
and, in December 2006, to dismiss him.
Saint-Gobain presents a different version of events. It
denies that Kasten made any significant complaint about
the timeclock location. And it says that it dismissed Kas­
ten simply because Kasten, after being repeatedly warned,
failed to record his comings and goings on the timeclock.
For present purposes we accept Kasten’s version of
these contested events as valid. See Scott v. Harris, 550
U. S. 372, 380 (2007). That is because the District Court
entered summary judgment in Saint-Gobain’s favor. 619
F. Supp. 2d 608, 610 (WD Wis. 2008). And it did so, not
because it doubted Kasten’s ability to prove the facts he
alleged, but because it thought the Act did not protect oral
complaints. Id., at 611–613. On appeal, the Seventh
Circuit agreed with the District Court that the Act’s an­
tiretaliation provision does not cover oral complaints. 570
F. 3d 834, 838–840 (2009).
Kasten sought certiorari. And in light of conflict among
the Circuits as to whether an oral complaint is protected,
we granted Kasten’s petition. Compare Hagan v. Echostar
Satellite, L. L. C., 529 F. 3d 617, 625–626 (CA5 2008)
(antiretaliation provision covers oral complaints); Lambert
v. Ackerley, 180 F. 3d 997, 1007 (CA9 1999) (en banc)
(same); with Lambert v. Genesee Hospital, 10 F. 3d 46, 55–
56 (CA2 1993) (antiretaliation provision does not cover
informal complaints to supervisors). See also Pacheco v.
Whiting Farms, Inc., 365 F. 3d 1199, 1206 (CA10 2004)
