Opinion of the Court

permit the use of the word “file” in conjunction with oral
material. One can, for example, file an oral statement
that enters a matter “into the order of business.” 1 Funk
& Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English
Language 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (def. 2) (to file is to “present
in the regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body, so
that it shall go upon the records or into the order of busi­
ness”). This possibility is significant because it means
that dictionary meanings, even if considered alone, do not
necessarily limit the scope of the statutory phrase to writ­
ten complaints. Cf. Crawford v. Metropolitan Government
of Nashville and Davidson Cty., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(slip op., at 5) (looking for the “limits” of a linguistic
phrase rather than what “exemplif[ies]” its application).
In addition to the dictionary definitions, we have found
that legislators, administrators, and judges have all some­
times used the word “file” in conjunction with oral state­
ments. Thus state statutes sometimes contemplate oral
filings. See, e.g., Alaska Stat. §47.32.090(a) (2008) (“file a
verbal or written complaint”); Cal. Health & Safety
Code Ann. §17055(a) (West 2006) (“file an administrative complaint orally or in writing”); D. C. Code §7–
1231.12(a)(2)(B) (2001) (“filing his or her grievance, orally
or in writing”); Ga. Code Ann. §§31–8–124(a), (c), 31–8–
134(b) (2009) (“to file a grievance,” a person may “submit
an oral or written complaint”); Ind. Code §27–8–28–14(a)
(2009) (“file a grievance orally or in writing”); Me. Rev.
Stat. Ann., Tit. 34–B, §5604(3)(B) (2009) (“filed through an
oral request”); Miss. Code Ann. §69–47–23(4) (2005) (“file
a written or oral complaint”); Mo. Rev. Stat. §198.088.3(3)
(2009) (to have a complaint “filed,” a person “shall write or
cause to be written his grievance or shall state it orally”);
Nev. Rev. Stat. §§618.336(2)(a), 618.341(1)(a) (2009) (“oral
or written complaint filed”); N. J. Stat. Ann. §30:4C–12
(West 2008) (“written or oral complaint may be filed”);
N. Y. Ins. Law Ann. §§3217–a(a)(7), 4324(a)(7) (West
