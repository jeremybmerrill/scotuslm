KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

SCALIA, J., dissenting 


bodies. I agree with at least the second part of SaintGobain’s contention. The plain meaning of the critical
phrase and the context in which appears make clear that
the retaliation provision contemplates an official grievance
filed with a court or an agency, not oral complaints—or
even formal, written complaints—from an employee to an
employer.
A
In isolation, the word “complaint” could cover Kasten’s
objection: It often has an expansive meaning, connoting
any “[e]xpression of grief, regret, pain . . . or resentment.”
Webster’s New International Dictionary 546 (2d ed. 1934)
(hereinafter Webster’s). But at the time the FLSA was
passed (and still today) the word when used in a legal
context has borne a specialized meaning: “[a] formal alle
gation or charge against a party, made or presented to the
appropriate court or officer.” Ibid. See also Cambridge
Dictionary of American English 172 (2000) (“a formal
statement to a government authority that you have a legal
cause to complain about the way you have been treated”);
3 Oxford English Dictionary 608 (2d ed. 1989) (“[a] state
ment or injury or grievance laid before a court or judicial
authority . . . for purposes of prosecution or of redress”).
There are several reasons to think that the word bears
its specialized meaning here. First, every other use of the
word “complaint” in the FLSA refers to an official filing
with a governmental body. Sections 216(b) and (c) both
state that the right to bring particular types of actions
“shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint” by the
Secretary of Labor, and §216(c) clarifies that the statute of
limitations begins running in actions to recover unpaid
wages “on the date when the complaint is filed.” These
provisions unquestionably use “complaint” in the narrow
legal sense. Identical words used in different parts of a
statute are presumed to have the same meaning absent
