KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


(antiretaliation provision covers unofficial assertion of
rights); EEOC v. White & Son Enterprises, 881 F. 2d 1006,
1011–1012 (CA11 1989) (same); Moore v. Freeman, 355
F. 3d 558, 562–563 (CA6 2004) (assuming without discus­
sion that oral complaints are covered); Brennan v. Maxey’s
Yamaha, Inc., 513 F. 2d 179, 181 (CA8 1975) (same).

The sole question presented is whether “an oral com­
plaint of a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act” is
“protected conduct under the [Act’s] anti-retaliation provi­
sion.” Pet. for Cert. i. The Act protects employees who
have “filed any complaint,” 29 U. S. C. §215(a)(3), and
interpretation of this phrase “depends upon reading the
whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context
of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authori­
ties that inform the analysis,” Dolan v. Postal Service, 546
U. S. 481, 486 (2006). This analysis leads us to conclude
that the language of the provision, considered in isolation,
may be open to competing interpretations. But consider­
ing the provision in conjunction with the purpose and
context leads us to conclude that only one interpretation is
permissible.
A
We begin with the text of the statute. The word “filed”
has different relevant meanings in different contexts.
Some dictionary definitions of the word contemplate a
writing. See, e.g., Webster’s New International Dictionary
945 (2d ed. 1934) (def. 4(a)) (to file is to “deliver (a paper or
instrument) to the proper officer so that it is received by
him to be kept on file, or among the records of his office”
(emphasis added)); Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dic­
tionary 462 (1983) (def. 2(a)) (one definition of “file” is “to
place among official records as prescribed by law”).
But other dictionaries provide different definitions that
