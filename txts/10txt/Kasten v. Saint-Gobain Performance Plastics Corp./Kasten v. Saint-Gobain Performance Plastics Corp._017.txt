KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE 

PLASTICS CORP.

Opinion of the Court 


tation of a criminal statute “when, after consulting tradi­
tional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an
ambiguous statute.” United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S.
10, 17 (1994). We agree with Saint-Gobain that those who
violate the antiretaliation provision before us are subject
to criminal sanction, 29 U. S. C. §216(a). And we have
said that the rule of lenity can apply when a statute with
criminal sanctions is applied in a noncriminal context.
See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11, n. 8 (2004). But
after engaging in traditional methods of statutory inter­
pretation, we cannot find that the statute remains suffi­
ciently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of
lenity here.
C
Alternatively, Saint-Gobain claims that it should prevail
because Kasten complained to a private employer, not to
the Government; and, in Saint-Gobain’s view, the antire­
taliation provision applies only to complaints filed with
the Government. Saint-Gobain advanced this claim in the
lower courts, which held to the contrary. 570 F. 3d, at
837–838; 619 F. Supp. 2d, at 613. But Saint-Gobain said
nothing about it in response to Kasten’s petition for certio­
rari. Indeed, it did not mention the claim in this Court
until it filed its brief on the merits.
We do not normally consider a separate legal question
not raised in the certiorari briefs. See this Court’s Rule
15.2; Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13
(1996). We see no reason to make an exception here.
Resolution of the Government/private employer question
is not a “ ‘ “predicate to an intelligent resolution” ’ ” of the
oral/written question that we granted certiorari to decide.
See ibid. (quoting Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38
(1996)). That is to say, we can decide the oral/written
question separately—on its own. And we have done so.
Thus, we state no view on the merits of Saint-Gobain’s
