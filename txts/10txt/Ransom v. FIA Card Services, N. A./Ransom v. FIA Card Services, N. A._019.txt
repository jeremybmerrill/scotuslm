RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.
Opinion of the Court

for non-loan or -lease ownership costs that no National or
Local Standard covers. Accordingly, the “notwithstand
ing” sentence does nothing to alter our conclusion that the
“Ownership Costs” table does not apply to a debtor whose
car is not encumbered.
C
Ransom finally contends that his view of the means test
is necessary to avoid senseless results not intended by
Congress. At the outset, we note that the policy concerns
Ransom emphasizes pale beside one his reading creates:
His interpretation, as we have explained, would frustrate
BAPCPA’s core purpose of ensuring that debtors devote
their full disposable income to repaying creditors. See
supra, at 8–9. We nonetheless address each of Ransom’s
policy arguments in turn.
Ransom first points out a troubling anomaly: Under our
interpretation, “[d]ebtors can time their bankruptcy filing
to take place while they still have a few car payments left,
thus retaining an ownership deduction which they would
lose if they filed just after making their last payment.”
Brief for Petitioner 54. Indeed, a debtor with only a single
car payment remaining, Ransom notes, is eligible to claim
a monthly ownership deduction. Id., at 15, 52.
But this kind of oddity is the inevitable result of a stan
dardized formula like the means test, even more under
Ransom’s reading than under ours. Such formulas are by
their nature over- and under-inclusive. In eliminating the
pre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median
income debtors’ expenses, on the ground that it leant itself
to abuse, Congress chose to tolerate the occasional peculi
arity that a brighter-line test produces. And Ransom’s
alternative reading of the statute would spawn its own
anomalies—even placing to one side the fundamental
strangeness of giving a debtor an allowance for loan or
lease payments when he has not a penny of loan or lease
