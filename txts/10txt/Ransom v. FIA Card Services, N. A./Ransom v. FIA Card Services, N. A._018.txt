Opinion of the Court

look up’ dollar amounts in the tables without either refer
ring to IRS guidelines for using the tables or imposing pre
existing assumptions about how [they] are to be navi
gated” (footnote omitted)). Some amount of interpretation
is necessary to decide what the deduction is for and
whether it is applicable to Ransom; and so we are brought
back full circle to our prior analysis.
B
Ransom next argues that viewing the car-ownership
deduction as covering no more than loan and lease pay
ments is inconsistent with a separate sentence of the
means test that provides: “Notwithstanding any other
provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the
debtor shall not include any payments for debts.”
§707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The car-ownership deduction cannot
comprise only loan and lease payments, Ransom contends,
because those payments are always debts. See Brief for
Petitioner 28, 44–45.
Ransom ignores that the “notwithstanding” sentence
governs the full panoply of deductions under the National
and Local Standards and the Other Necessary Expense
categories. We hesitate to rely on that general provision
to interpret the content of the car-ownership deduction
because Congress did not draft the former with the latter
specially in mind; any friction between the two likely
reflects only a lack of attention to how an across-the-board
exclusion of debt payments would correspond to a particu
lar IRS allowance.11 Further, the “notwithstanding” sen
tence by its terms functions only to exclude, and not to
authorize, deductions. It cannot establish an allowance
——————
11 Because Ransom does not make payments on his car, we need not
and do not resolve how the “notwithstanding” sentence affects the
vehicle-ownership deduction when a debtor has a loan or lease expense.

tive views on this question); Tr. of Oral Arg. 51–52.
