the National Standards and Local Standards, and the
debtor’s actual monthly expenses for the categories
specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the
Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for the area in which
the debtor resides.” §707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).

§5.15.1.8 (Oct. 2, 2009), http://www.irs.gov/irm/part5/irm_05-015
001.html#d0e1012 (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 7, 2011, and
available in Clerk of Court’s case file). The Local Standards authorize
deductions for two kinds of expenses: (1) housing and utilities; and (2)
transportation. Id., §5.15.1.9.
