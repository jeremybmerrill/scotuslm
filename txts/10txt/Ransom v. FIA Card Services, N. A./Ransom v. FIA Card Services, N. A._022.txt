ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 11, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.
I would reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit. I
agree with the conclusion of the three other Courts of
Appeals to address the question: that a debtor who owns a
car free and clear is entitled to the car-ownership allow
ance. See In re Washburn, 579 F. 3d 934 (CA8 2009); In re
Tate, 571 F. 3d 423 (CA5 2009); In re Ross-Tousey, 549 F.
3d 1148 (CA7 2008).
The statutory text at issue is the phrase enacted in the
Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection
Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), “applicable monthly expense
amounts specified under the National Standards and
Local Standards,” 11 U. S. C. §707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The
Court holds that the word “applicable” in this provision
imports into the Local Standards a directive in the Inter
nal Revenue Service’s Collection Financial Standards,
which have as their stated purpose “to help determine a
taxpayer’s ability to pay a delinquent tax liability,” App. to
Brief for Respondent 1a. That directive says that “[i]f a
taxpayer has no car payment,” the Ownership Cost provi
sions of the Local Standards will not apply. Id., at 3a.
That directive forms no part of the Local Standards to
which the statute refers; and the fact that portions of the
Local Standards are to be disregarded for revenue
