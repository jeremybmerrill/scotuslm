RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.
Opinion of the Court

that is owned outright,” he states, “accords best with
economic reality.” Id., at 52. In essence, Ransom seeks an
emergency cushion for car owners. But nothing in the
statute authorizes such a cushion, which all debtors pre
sumably would like in the event some unexpected need
arises. And a person who enters bankruptcy without any
car at all may also have to buy one during the plan period;
yet Ransom concedes that a person in this position cannot
claim the ownership deduction. Tr. of Oral Arg. 20. The
appropriate way to account for unanticipated expenses
like a new vehicle purchase is not to distort the scope of a
deduction, but to use the method that the Code provides
for all Chapter 13 debtors (and their creditors): modifica
tion of the plan in light of changed circumstances. See
§1329(a)(1); see also supra, at 17.
IV
Based on BAPCPA’s text, context, and purpose, we hold
that the Local Standard expense amount for transporta
tion “Ownership Costs” is not “applicable” to a debtor who
will not incur any such costs during his bankruptcy plan.
Because the “Ownership Costs” category covers only loan
and lease payments and because Ransom owns his car free
from any debt or obligation, he may not claim the allow
ance. In short, Ransom may not deduct loan or lease
expenses when he does not have any. We therefore affirm
the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.
It is so ordered.
