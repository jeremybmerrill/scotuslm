SCALIA, J., dissenting

maintain “the connection between the means test and the
statutory provision it is meant to implement—the authori
zation of an allowance for (but only for) ‘reasonably neces
sary’ expenses,” ante, at 12. Nor do I think this difficulty
is eliminated by the deus ex machina of 11 U. S. C.
§1329(a)(1), which according to the Court would allow an
unsecured creditor to “move to modify the plan to increase
the amount the debtor must repay,” ante, at 17. Apart
from the fact that, as a practical matter, the sums in
volved would hardly make this worth the legal costs,
allowing such ongoing revisions of matters specifically
covered by the rigid means test would return us to “the
pre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median
income debtors’ expenses,” ante, at 16. If the BAPCPA
had thought such adjustments necessary, surely it would
have taken the much simpler and more logical step of
providing going in that the ownership expense allowance
would apply only so long as monthly payments were due.
The reality is, to describe it in the Court’s own terms,
that occasional overallowance (or, for that matter, under
allowance) “is the inevitable result of a standardized
formula like the means test . . . . Congress chose to toler
ate the occasional peculiarity that a brighter-line test
produces.” Ibid. Our job, it seems to me, is not to elimi
nate or reduce those “oddit[ies],” ibid., but to give the
formula Congress adopted its fairest meaning. In my
judgment the “applicable monthly expense amounts” for
operating costs “specified under the . . . Local Standards,”
are the amounts specified in those Standards for either
one car or two cars, whichever of those is applicable.
