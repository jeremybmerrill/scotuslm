ring an expense in the relevant category. Further, the statute’s pur
pose—to ensure that debtors pay creditors the maximum they can af
ford—is best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with
the statutory text, to reflect a debtor’s ability to afford repayment.
Pp. 6–9.
(b) The vehicle-ownership category covers only the costs of a car
loan or lease. The expense amount listed ($471) is the average
monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide; it is not intended
to estimate other conceivable expenses associated with maintaining a
car. Maintenance expenses are the province of the separate “Operat
ing Costs” deduction. A person who owns a car free and clear is enti
tled to the “Operating Costs” deduction for all driving-related ex
penses. But such a person may not claim the “Ownership Costs”
deduction, because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car
loan or lease. The IRS’ Collection Financial Standards reinforce this
conclusion by making clear that individuals who have a car but make
no loan or lease payments may take only the operating-costs deduc
tion. Because Ransom owns his vehicle outright, he incurs no ex
pense in the “Ownership Costs” category, and that expense amount is
therefore not “applicable” to him. Pp. 9–11.
(c) Ransom’s arguments to the contrary—an alternative interpreta
tion of the key word “applicable,” an objection to the Court’s view of
the scope of the “Ownership Costs” category, and a criticism of the
policy implications of the Court’s approach—are unpersuasive.
