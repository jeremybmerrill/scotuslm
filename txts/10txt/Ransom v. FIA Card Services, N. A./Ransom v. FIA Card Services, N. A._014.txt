Opinion of the Court

Because Ransom owns his vehicle free and clear of any
encumbrance, he incurs no expense in the “Ownership
Costs” category of the Local Standards. Accordingly, the
car-ownership expense amount is not “applicable” to him,
and the Ninth Circuit correctly denied that deduction.
III
Ransom’s argument to the contrary relies on a different
interpretation of the key word “applicable,” an objection to
our view of the scope of the “Ownership Costs” category,
and a criticism of the policy implications of our approach.
We do not think these claims persuasive.
A
Ransom first offers another understanding of the term
“applicable.” A debtor, he says, determines his “applica
ble” deductions by locating the box in each National or
Local Standard table that corresponds to his geographic
location, income, family size, or number of cars. Under
this approach, a debtor “consult[s] the table[s] alone” to
determine his appropriate expense amounts. Reply Brief
for Petitioner 16. Because he has one car, Ransom argues
that his “applicable” allowance is the sum listed in the
first column of the “Ownership Costs” table ($471); if he
had a second vehicle, the amount in the second column
($332) would also be “applicable.” On this approach, the
word “applicable” serves a function wholly internal to the
tables; rather than filtering out debtors for whom a deduc
tion is not at all suitable, the term merely directs each
——————
does not “incorporat[e]” or otherwise “impor[t]” the IRS’s guidance.
Post, at 1, 4 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The dissent questions what possible
basis except incorporation could justify our consulting the IRS’s view,
post, at 4, n., but we think that basis obvious: The IRS creates the
National and Local Standards referenced in the statute, revises them
as it deems necessary, and uses them every day. The agency might,
therefore, have something insightful and persuasive (albeit not control
ling) to say about them.
