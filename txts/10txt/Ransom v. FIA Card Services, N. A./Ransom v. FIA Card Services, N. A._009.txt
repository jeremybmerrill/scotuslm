RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.
Opinion of the Court

cured creditors. Ibid.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir
cuit affirmed. In re Ransom, 577 F. 3d 1026, 1027 (2009).
The plain language of the statute, the court held, “does not
allow a debtor to deduct an ‘ownership cost’ . . . that the
debtor does not have.” Id., at 1030. The court observed
that “[a]n ‘ownership cost’ is not an ‘expense’—either
actual or applicable—if it does not exist, period.” Ibid.
We granted a writ of certiorari to resolve a split of au
thority over whether a debtor who does not make loan or
lease payments on his car may claim the deduction for
vehicle-ownership costs. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).4 We now
affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.
II
Our interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code starts
“where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of
the statute itself.” United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises,
Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241 (1989). As noted, the provision of
the Code central to the decision of this case states:
“The debtor’s monthly expenses shall be the debtor’s
applicable monthly expense amounts specified under
the National Standards and Local Standards, and the
debtor’s actual monthly expenses for the categories
specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the
[IRS] for the area in which the debtor resides.”
§707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).
The key word in this provision is “applicable”: A debtor
may claim not all, but only “applicable” expense amounts

4 Compare In re Ransom, 577 F. 3d 1026, 1027 (CA9 2009) (case be
low), with In re Washburn, 579 F. 3d 934, 935 (CA8 2009) (permitting
the allowance), In re Tate, 571 F. 3d 423, 424 (CA5 2009) (same), and
In re Ross-Tousey, 549 F. 3d 1148, 1162 (CA7 2008) (same). The ques
tion has also divided bankruptcy courts. See, e.g., In re Canales, 377
B. R. 658, 662 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2007) (citing dozens of cases reach
ing opposing results).
