Opinion of the Court

lease payments may not take the car-ownership deduction.
I

A

“Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention
and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA or Act) to
correct perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system.” Mi
lavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S.
___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1). In particular, Congress
adopted the means test—“[t]he heart of [BAPCPA’s] con
sumer bankruptcy reforms,” H. R. Rep. No. 109–31, pt. 1,
p. 2 (2005) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.), and the home of the
statutory language at issue here—to help ensure that
debtors who can pay creditors do pay them. See, e.g., ibid.
(under BAPCPA, “debtors [will] repay creditors the maxi
mum they can afford”).
In Chapter 13 proceedings, the means test provides a
formula to calculate a debtor’s disposable income, which
the debtor must devote to reimbursing creditors under a
court-approved plan generally lasting from three to five
years. §§1325(b)(1)(B) and (b)(4).1 The statute defines
“disposable income” as “current monthly income” less
“amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” for “main
tenance or support,” business expenditures, and certain
charitable contributions. §§1325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii). For a
debtor whose income is above the median for his State, the
means test identifies which expenses qualify as “amounts
——————
1 Chapter 13 borrows the means test from Chapter 7, where it is used
as a screening mechanism to determine whether a Chapter 7 proceed
ing is appropriate. Individuals who file for bankruptcy relief under
Chapter 7 liquidate their nonexempt assets, rather than dedicate their
future income, to repay creditors. See 11 U. S. C. §§704(a)(1), 726. If
the debtor’s Chapter 7 petition discloses that his disposable income as
calculated by the means test exceeds a certain threshold, the petition is
presumptively abusive. §707(b)(2)(A)(i). If the debtor cannot rebut the
presumption, the court may dismiss the case or, with the debtor’s
consent, convert it into a Chapter 13 proceeding. §707(b)(1).
