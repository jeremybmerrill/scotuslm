Opinion of the Court

come of $4,248.56 per month. Id., at 46. He also listed
monthly expenses totaling $4,038.01. Id., at 53. In de
termining those expenses, Ransom claimed a car
ownership deduction of $471 for the Camry, the full
amount specified in the IRS’s “Ownership Costs” table.
Id., at 49. Ransom listed a separate deduction of $338 for
car-operating costs. Ibid. Based on these figures, Ransom
had disposable income of $210.55 per month. Id., at 53.
Ransom proposed a 5-year plan that would result in
repayment of approximately 25% of his unsecured debt.
Id., at 55. FIA objected to confirmation of the plan on the

income to unsecured creditors. Id., at 64. In particular,
FIA argued that Ransom should not have claimed the car
ownership allowance because he does not make loan or

without this allowance, Ransom’s disposable income would
be $681.55—the $210.55 he reported plus the $471 he
deducted for vehicle ownership. Id., at 71. The difference
over the 60 months of the plan amounts to about $28,000.

cle.” Id., at 41.
Ransom appealed to the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy
Appellate Panel, which affirmed. In re Ransom, 380 B. R.
799, 808–809 (2007). The panel reasoned that an “expense
[amount] becomes relevant to the debtor (i.e., appropriate
or applicable to the debtor) when he or she in fact has such
an expense.” Id., at 807. “[W]hat is important,” the panel
noted, “is the payments that debtors actually make, not
how many cars they own, because [those] payments . . .
are what actually affect their ability to” reimburse unse
