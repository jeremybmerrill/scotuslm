SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

Ante, at 8–12 (distinguishing the regulatory record in this
case from that in Geier).
Especially in light of the “statutory saving clause that
foresees the likelihood of a continued meaningful role for
state tort law,” ante, at 11, respondents have not carried
their burden of establishing that the agency here “deliber
ately sought variety” to achieve greater safety, Geier, 529
U. S., at 878. Therefore, the Williamsons’ tort suit does
not present an obstacle to any “significant federal regula
tory objective,” ante, at 5, and may not be pre-empted.
For these reasons, I concur.
