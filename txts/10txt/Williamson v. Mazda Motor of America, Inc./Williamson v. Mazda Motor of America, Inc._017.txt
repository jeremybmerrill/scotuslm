WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

one of the options is an obstacle to the achievement of a
federal regulatory objective and may be pre-empted.*
Rather, Geier turned on the fact that the agency, via Fed
eral Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, “deliberately
sought variety—a mix of several different passive re
straint systems.” 529 U. S., at 878; ante, at 7. As the
United States notes, “a conflict results only when the
Safety Act (or regulations implementing the Safety Act)
does not just set out options for compliance, but also pro
vides that the regulated parties must remain free to
choose among those options.” Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 8. In other words, the mere fact that an
agency regulation allows manufacturers a choice between
options is insufficient to justify implied pre-emption;
courts should only find pre-emption where evidence exists
that an agency has a regulatory objective—e.g., obtaining
a mix of passive restraint mechanisms, as in Geier—whose
achievement depends on manufacturers having a choice
between options. A link between a regulatory objective
and the need for manufacturer choice to achieve that
objective is the lynchpin of implied pre-emption when
there is a saving clause.
Absent strong indications from the agency that it needs
manufacturers to have options in order to achieve a “sig
nificant . . . regulatory objective,” ante, at 5, state tort
suits are not “obstacle[s] to the accomplishment . . . of the
full purposes and objectives” of federal law, Hines v.
Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941). As the majority
explains, the agency here gave no indication that its safety
goals required the mixture of seatbelt types that resulted
from manufacturers’ ability to choose different options.
