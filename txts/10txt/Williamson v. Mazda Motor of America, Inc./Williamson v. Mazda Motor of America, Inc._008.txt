Opinion of the Court

Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded
that the saving clause does not foreclose or limit the op
eration of “ordinary pre-emption principles, grounded in
longstanding precedent.” Id., at 874.
These two holdings apply directly to the case before us.
We here consider (1) the same statute, 15 U. S. C. §1381 et
seq.; (2) a later version of the same regulation, FMVSS
208; and (3) a somewhat similar claim that a state tort
action conflicts with the federal regulation. In light of
Geier, the statute’s express pre-emption clause cannot pre
empt the common-law tort action; but neither can the
statute’s saving clause foreclose or limit the operation of
ordinary conflict pre-emption principles. We consequently
turn our attention to Geier’s third subsidiary question,
whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the
federal regulation.
III
Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state
law that “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and
execution of the full purposes and objectives” of a federal
law is pre-empted. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67
(1941). See ibid. (federal statute can pre-empt a state
statute); Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504
(1992) (federal statute can pre-empt a state tort suit);
Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S.
141 (1982) (federal regulation can pre-empt a state stat
ute); Geier, supra (federal regulation can pre-empt a state
tort suit). In Geier we found that the state law stood as an
“ ‘obstacle’ to the accomplishment” of a significant federal
regulatory objective, namely, the maintenance of manufac
turer choice. 529 U. S., at 886. We must decide whether
the same is true here.

At the heart of Geier lies our determination that giving
