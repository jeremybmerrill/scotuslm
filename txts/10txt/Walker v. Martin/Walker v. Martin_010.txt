Opinion of the Court

ing from the State’s alleged violation of his constitutional
rights. See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87–91
(1977).
II 

A

“A federal habeas court will not review a claim rejected
by a state court ‘if the decision of [the state] court rests on
a state law ground that is independent of the federal
question and adequate to support the judgment.’ ” Kind
ler, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (quoting Coleman v.
Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991)). The state-law
ground may be a substantive rule dispositive of the case,
or a procedural barrier to adjudication of the claim on the
merits. See Sykes, 433 U. S., at 81–82, 90.
Ordinarily, a state prisoner seeking federal habeas relief
must first “exhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts
of the State,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A), thereby affording
those courts “the first opportunity to address and correct
alleged violations of [the] prisoner’s federal rights,” Cole
man, 501 U. S., at 731. The adequate and independent
state ground doctrine furthers that objective, for without
it, “habeas petitioners would be able to avoid the exhaus
tion requirement by defaulting their federal claims in
state court.” Id., at 732. Accordingly, absent showings of
“cause” and “prejudice,” see Sykes, 433 U. S., at 84–85,
federal habeas relief will be unavailable when (1) “a state
court [has] declined to address a prisoner’s federal claims
because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural
requirement,” and (2) “the state judgment rests on inde
pendent and adequate state procedural grounds.” Cole
man, 501 U. S., at 729–730.
B
To qualify as an “adequate” procedural ground, a state
rule must be “firmly established and regularly followed. ”
