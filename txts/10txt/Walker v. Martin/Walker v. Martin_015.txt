WALKER v. MARTIN
Opinion of the Court

tion enables a court to home in on case-specific considera
tions and to avoid the harsh results that sometimes
attend consistent application of an unyielding rule. See
Prihoda v. McCaughtry, 910 F. 2d 1379, 1385 (CA7 1990)
(“Uncertainty is not enough to disqualify a state’s
procedural ground as one ‘adequate’ under federal law. If
it were, states would be induced to make their rules
draconian . . . .”).
A state ground, no doubt, may be found inadequate
when “discretion has been exercised to impose novel and
unforeseeable requirements without fair or substantial
support in prior state law . . . .” 16B C. Wright, A. Miller,
& E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §4026, p. 386
(2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright & Miller); see Prihoda,
910 F. 2d, at 1383 (state ground “applied infrequently,
unexpectedly, or freakishly” may “discriminat[e] against
the federal rights asserted” and therefore rank as “inade
quate”). Martin does not contend, however, that in his
case, the California Supreme Court exercised its discretion
in a surprising or unfair manner.
“[S]ound procedure often requires discretion to exact or
excuse compliance with strict rules,” 16B Wright & Miller
§4028, p. 403, and we have no cause to discourage stan
dards allowing courts to exercise such discretion. As this
Court observed in Kindler, if forced to choose between
mandatory rules certain to be found “adequate,” or more
supple prescriptions that federal courts may disregard as
“inadequate,” “many States [might] opt for mandatory
rules to avoid the high costs that come with plenary fed
eral review.” 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). “Th[at]
result would be particularly unfortunate for [habeas peti
tioners], who would lose the opportunity to argue that a
procedural default should be excused through the exercise
of judicial discretion.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).8
