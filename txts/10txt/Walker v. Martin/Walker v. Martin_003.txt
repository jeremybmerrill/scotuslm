U. S. C. §2255(f)(4). Although “ ‘due diligence’ is an inexact measure
of how much delay is too much,” Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S.
295, 309, n. 7, “use of an imprecise standard is no justification for de
priving [a rule’s] language of any meaning,” ibid. Nor is California’s
time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed.
Each year, the California State Supreme Court summarily denies
hundreds of habeas petitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Contrary
to Martin’s argument, California’s time bar is not infirm simply be
cause a court may opt to bypass the Clark/Robbins assessment and
summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.
Nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a
showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case. Discre
tion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to
avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an
unyielding rule. A state ground may be found inadequate when a
court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner,
but Martin makes no such contention here. Pp. 7–12.
(c) This decision leaves unaltered the Court’s repeated recognition
that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural require
ments to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against
claims of federal rights. See, e.g., Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala.,
338 U. S. 294, 298–299. On the record here, however, there is no ba
sis for concluding that California’s rule operates in such a discrimina
tory manner. P. 13.
