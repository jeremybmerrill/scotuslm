Opinion of the Court

And California’s case law made it altogether plain that
Martin’s delay of nearly five years ranked as “substantial.”
See Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 829–831, 838, and n. 13, 959
P. 2d, at 293–294, 299, and n. 13 (delay of four years
barred claim); In re Tsaturyan, No. B156012, 2002 WL
1614107, *3 (Cal. App., July 23, 2002) (delay of 16 months
barred claim). See also In re Miller, No. B186447, 2006
WL 1980385, *2–3 (Cal. App., July 17, 2006) (delay of two
years and six months barred claim).
Martin nevertheless urges that California’s rule is too
vague to be regarded as “firmly established.” “[R]eason
able time” period and “substantial delay,” he maintains,
are “meaningless terms.” Brief for Respondent 48 (inter
nal quotation marks omitted). We disagree. Indetermi
nate language is typical of discretionary rules. Applica
tion of those rules in particular circumstances, however,
can supply the requisite clarity.
Congressional statutes and this Court’s decisions, we
note, have employed time limitations that are not stated
in precise, numerical terms. Former Federal Habeas
Corpus Rule 9(a), for example, set no fixed time limit on
submission of habeas petitions. The Rule permitted dis
missal of a state prisoner’s petition when it appeared that
delay in commencing litigation “prejudiced [the State] in
its ability to respond.” 28 U. S. C. §2254 Rule 9(a) (1994
ed.). To stave off dismissal, the petitioner had to show
that he could not earlier have known, “by the exercise of
reasonable diligence,” the grounds on which he based the
petition. Ibid. In Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269 (2005),
we instructed district courts, when employing stay and
abeyance procedure, see supra, at 5, n. 3, to “place reason
——————
authority that had such a grossly misleading profile of the petitioner
before it that, absent the trial error or omission, no reasonable judge or
jury would have imposed a sentence of death; or (iv) that the petitioner
was convicted or sentenced under an invalid statute.” In re Robbins, 18
Cal. 4th 770, 780–781, 959 P. 2d 311, 318 (1998).
