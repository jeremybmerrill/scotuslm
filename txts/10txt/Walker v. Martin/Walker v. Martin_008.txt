In December 1986, Charles Martin participated in a
robbery and murder in California. Martin fled the State,
but eight years later he was extradited to California to
stand trial. Convicted in state court of murder and rob
bery, Martin was sentenced to life in prison without the
possibility of parole. In 1997, the California Court of
Appeal affirmed his conviction and sentence, and the
California Supreme Court denied review.
Martin initiated his first round of state habeas proceed
ings in 1998, and the next year, the California Supreme
Court denied his petition. He then filed a habeas petition
in the appropriate U. S. District Court. Finding that
Martin’s federal petition included ineffective-assistance-of
counsel claims he had not aired in state court, the District
Court stayed the federal proceedings pending Martin’s
return to state court to exhaust his remedies there.3
In March 2002, Martin filed his second habeas petition
in the California Supreme Court, raising the federal in
effective assistance claims his earlier filing omitted. He
gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional
claims until nearly five years after his sentence and con
viction became final. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36, 39. In Septem
ber 2002, the California Supreme Court denied Martin’s
petition in an order typical of that court’s summary dispo
sitions for failure to file “as promptly as the circumstances
——————
3 Rather than dismiss a petition containing both exhausted and un
exhausted claims, “a district court might stay the petition and hold it in
abeyance while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his
previously unexhausted claims. Once the petitioner exhausts his state
remedies, the district court will lift the stay and allow the petitioner to
proceed in federal court.” Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 275–276
(2005).
