WALKER v. MARTIN
Opinion of the Court

allow.” Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at 738,
n. 5. The order read in its entirety: “Petition for writ of
habeas corpus is DENIED. (See In re Clark (1993) 5 Cal.
4th 750, In re Robbins (1998) 18 Cal. 4th 770, 780.).” See
App. to Pet. for Cert. 60.
Having exhausted state postconviction remedies, Martin
returned to federal court and filed an amended petition.
Based upon the California Supreme Court’s time-bar
disposition, the District Court dismissed Martin’s belat
edly asserted claims as procedurally precluded. Id., at 27,
57. The Ninth Circuit vacated the dismissal order and
remanded the case, directing the District Court to deter
mine the “adequacy” of the State’s time bar. Martin v.
Hubbard, 192 Fed. Appx. 616, 618 (2006). The District
Court again rejected Martin’s petition, stating that “[t]he
California timeliness bar as set forth in . . . Clark/Robbins
is clearly defined, well established and consistently ap
plied.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 4.
The Ninth Circuit again disagreed. Controlled by its
prior decision in Townsend, 562 F. 3d, at 1207–1208, the
Court of Appeals held that California’s time bar “has yet
to be firmly defined” and was not shown by the State to be
“consistently applied.” 357 Fed. Appx., at 794. The re
mand order directed the District Court to determine the
merits of the claims Martin asserted in his second petition
to the California Supreme Court.
We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), to determine
the “adequacy” of California’s practice under which a
prisoner may be barred from collaterally attacking his
conviction when he has “substantially delayed” filing his
habeas petition. Martin does not here dispute that the
time limitation is an “independent” state ground. See
Brief in Opposition 5–6. See also Bennett v. Mueller, 322
F. 3d 573, 582–583 (CA9 2003). Nor does he contend that
he established “cause” and “prejudice,” i.e., cause for the
delay in asserting his claims and actual prejudice result
