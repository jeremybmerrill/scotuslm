WALKER v. MARTIN
Opinion of the Court

able time limits on a petitioner’s trip to state court and
back.” 544 U. S., at 278.
Current federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for
filing a petition to one year. The clock runs from “the date
on which the [supporting] facts . . . could have been dis
covered through the exercise of due diligence.” 28 U. S. C.
§2255(f)(4) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (applicable to federal
prisoners); see §2244(d)(1)(D) (2006 ed.) (similar provision
applicable to state prisoners). “[D]ue diligence,” we have
observed, “ is an inexact measure of how much delay is too
much.” Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S. 295, 309, n. 7
(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). But “use of an
imprecise standard,” we immediately added, “is no justifi
cation for depriving [a rule’s] language of any meaning.”
Ibid. “[I]t would seem particularly strange to disregard
state procedural rules that are substantially similar to
those to which we give full force in our own courts.” Kindler, 558 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8).
Nor is California’s time rule vulnerable on the ground
that it is not regularly followed. Each year, the California
Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas
petitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Brief for Appellant
in No. 08–15752 (CA9), pp. 31–32. On the same day the
court denied Martin’s petition, it issued 21 other
Clark/Robbins summary denials. See Brief for Habeas
Corpus Resource Center as Amicus Curiae 20. In rea
soned opinions, too, California courts regularly invoke
Clark, Robbins, and Gallego to determine whether a ha
beas petition is time barred.6
Martin argued below that California’s time bar is not
regularly followed in this sense: Use of summary denials
