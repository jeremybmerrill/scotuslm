WALKER, WARDEN, ET AL. v. MARTIN
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 09–996.

Argued November 29, 2010—Decided February 23, 2011

While most States set determinate time limits for collateral relief appli
cations, California courts “appl[y] a general ‘reasonableness’ stan
dard” to judge whether a habeas petition is timely filed, Carey v. Saf
fold, 536 U. S. 214, 222. Under that standard, “a [habeas] petition
should be filed as promptly as the circumstances allow . . . ,” In re
Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d 729, 738, n. 5. Three deci
sions, Clark, In re Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 959 P. 2d 311, and In re
Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th 825, 959 P. 2d 290, describe California’s timeli
ness requirement. A prisoner must seek habeas relief without “sub
stantial delay,” e.g., Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 3d, at 317, as
“measured from the time the petitioner or counsel knew, or reasona
bly should have known, of the information offered in support of the
claim and the legal basis of the claim,” id., at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.
All California courts have “original jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro
ceedings.” Cal. Const., Art. VI, §10. Because a habeas petitioner
may skip over the lower courts and file directly in the California Su
preme Court, that court rules on a staggering number of habeas peti
tions each year. A summary denial citing Clark and Robbins means
that the petition is rejected as untimely. California courts, however,
have discretion to bypass a timeliness issue and, instead, summarily
reject the petition for want of merit.
Respondent Martin was convicted of murder and robbery, and was
sentenced to life in prison without parole. After the California Su
preme Court denied Martin’s first state habeas petition, he filed a
federal habeas petition. The District Court ordered a stay to permit
Martin to return to state court to raise ineffective-assistance-of
counsel claims he had not previously aired. Martin raised those
claims in his second habeas petition in the California Supreme Court,
