Opinion of the Court

makes it “impossible to tell” why the California Supreme
Court “decides some delayed petitions on the merits and
rejects others as untimely.” Brief for Appellant in No. 08–
15752 (CA9), pp. 37–38. We see no reason to reject Cali
fornia’s time bar simply because a court may opt to bypass
the Clark/Robbins assessment and summarily dismiss a
petition on the merits, if that is the easier path. See, e.g.,
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984) (“[A]
court need not determine whether counsel’s performance
was deficient . . . [i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffec
tiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice
. . . .”); cf. Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574,
585 (1999) (“It is hardly novel for a federal court to choose
among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case
on the merits.”).
The Ninth Circuit concluded that California’s time bar
is not consistently applied because outcomes under the
rule vary from case to case. See 357 Fed. Appx., at 794.
For example, in People v. Fairbanks, No. C047810, 2006
WL 950267, *2–*3 (Cal. App., Apr. 11, 2006), a one-year
delay was found substantial, while in In re Little, No.
D047468, 2008 WL 142832, *4, n. 6 (Cal. App., Jan. 16,
2008), a delay of 14 months was determined to be
insubstantial.

inspection may reveal that “seeming ‘inconsistencie[s]’ . . . are
not necessarily . . . arbitrar[y] or irrationa[l].” Thornburgh v. Abbott,
490 U. S. 401, 417, n. 15 (1989). Fairbanks and Little are illustrative.
In Fairbanks, the court found that petitioner did not act diligently
when she waited to withdraw her guilty plea until one year after
learning that revocation of her driver’s license was irreversible. 2006
WL 950267, *2–*3. In Little, a pro se prisoner claimed that his trial
counsel should have raised a posttraumatic stress disorder defense.
Although the filing delay was 14 months, the court entertained it on
the merits. 2008 WL 142832, *4, *14. Given the discrete context in
which each case arose, the two decisions present no square conflict.
