Opinion of the Court 


C

Today’s decision, trained on California’s timeliness rule
for habeas petitions, leaves unaltered this Court’s re
peated recognition that federal courts must carefully
examine state procedural requirements to ensure that
they do not operate to discriminate against claims of
federal rights. See Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala., 338
U. S. 294, 298–299 (1949); Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U. S. 22,
24–25 (1923); 16B Wright & Miller §4026, p. 386 (noting
“risk that discretionary procedural sanctions may be
invoked more harshly against disfavored federal rights,
. . . deny[ing] [litigants] a fair opportunity to present
federal claims”). See also Kindler, 558 U. S., at ___
(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (a state proce
dural ground would be inadequate if the challenger shows
a “purpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees”).
On the record before us, however, there is no basis for
concluding that California’s timeliness rule operates to the
particular disadvantage of petitioners asserting federal
rights.

For the reasons stated, we find no inadequacy in Cali
fornia’s timeliness rule generally or as applied in Martin’s
case. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit is therefore
Reversed.

rules cannot take account of the gravity of a procedural failure, the

strength of the excuses offered, or the importance of the procedural and 

substantive consequences of excusing or punishing the failure.”).
