While most States set determinate time limits for collat
eral relief applications, in California, neither statute nor
rule of court does so. Instead, California courts “appl[y] a
general ‘reasonableness’ standard” to judge whether a
habeas petition is timely filed. Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S.
214, 222 (2002). The basic instruction provided by the
California Supreme Court is simply that “a [habeas] peti
tion should be filed as promptly as the circumstances
allow . . . .” Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at
738, n. 5.
Three leading decisions describe California’s timeliness
requirement: Robbins, Clark, and In re Gallego, 18 Cal.
4th 825, 959 P. 2d 290 (1998). A prisoner must seek ha
beas relief without “substantial delay,” Robbins, 18 Cal.
4th, at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317; Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 833,
959 P. 2d, at 296; Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 783, 855 P. 2d, at
750, as “measured from the time the petitioner or counsel
knew, or reasonably should have known, of the informa
tion offered in support of the claim and the legal basis for
the claim,” Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.
Petitioners in noncapital cases have “the burden of estab
lishing (i) absence of substantial delay, (ii) good cause for
the delay, or (iii) that the claim falls within an exception
to the bar of untimeliness.” Id., at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317.1
