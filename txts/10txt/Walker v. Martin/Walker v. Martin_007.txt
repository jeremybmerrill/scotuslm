WALKER v. MARTIN
Opinion of the Court

California’s collateral review regime differs from that of
other States in a second notable respect: All California
courts “have original jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro
ceedings,” Cal. Const., Art. VI, §10, thus “no appeal lies
from the denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus,”
Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 767, n. 7, 855 P. 2d, at 740, n. 7. “[A]
prisoner whose petition has been denied by the superior
court can obtain review of his claims only by the filing of a
new petition in the Court of Appeal.” Ibid. The new
petition, however, must be confined to claims raised in the
initial petition. See In re Martinez, 46 Cal. 4th 945, 956,
209 P. 3d 908, 915 (2009).
Because a habeas petitioner may skip over the lower
courts and file directly in the California Supreme Court,
In re Kler, 188 Cal. App. 4th 1399, 1403, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d
889, 891–892 (2010), that court rules on a staggering
number of habeas petitions each year.2 The court issues
generally unelaborated “summary denials” of petitions
that “d[o] not state a prima facie case for relief” or that
contain “claims [that] are all procedurally barred.” People

(internal quotation marks omitted). A summary denial
citing Clark and Robbins means that the petition is re
jected as untimely. See, e.g., Brief for Habeas Corpus
Resource Center as Amicus Curiae 20, and n. 23. Califor
nia courts have discretion, however, to bypass a timeliness
issue and, instead, summarily reject the petition for want
