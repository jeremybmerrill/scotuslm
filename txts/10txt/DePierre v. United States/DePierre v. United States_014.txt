Opinion of the Court

light of the structure of the subclause, the word “cocaine”
is needed as the reference point for “salts” and “isomers.”
The word “cocaine” in subclause (II) also performs an
other critical function. Clause (iii) penalizes offenses
involving “a mixture or substance described in clause (ii)
which contains cocaine base.” §§841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B)(iii)
(emphasis added). In other words, clause (ii) imposes a
penalty for offenses involving cocaine-related substances
generally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for
a subset of those substances—the ones that “contai[n]
cocaine base.” For this structure to work, however,
§841(b)(1) must “describ[e] in clause (ii)” substances con
taining chemically basic cocaine, which then comprise the
subset described in clause (iii). If such substances were
not present in clause (ii), clause (iii) would only apply to
substances that contain both chemically basic cocaine and
one of the other elements enumerated in clause (ii). Pre
sumably, the result would be that clause (iii) would not
apply to crack cocaine, freebase, or coca paste offenses, as
there is no indication that, in addition to “cocaine base”
(i.e., C17H21NO4), those substances contain cocaine “salts”
(e.g., cocaine hydrochloride), ecgonine, or any of the other
elements enumerated in clause (ii). In short, the exclusion
of “cocaine” from clause (ii) would result in clause (iii)
effectively describing a null set, which obviously was not
Congress’ intent.
Of course, this redundancy could have been avoided by
simply drafting clause (iii) to penalize offenses involving
“a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,”
without reference to clause (ii)—that is, Congress could
have drafted clause (iii) to specify a separate set of cocaine
related substances, not a subset of those in clause (ii).
That we may rue inartful legislative drafting, however,
does not excuse us from the responsibility of construing a
