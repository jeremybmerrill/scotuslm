DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIRST CIRCUIT
No. 09–1533. Argued February 28, 2011—Decided June 9, 2011
In 1986, increasing public concern over the dangers of illicit drugs—in
particular, the new phenomenon of crack cocaine—prompted Con
gress to revise the penalties for criminal offenses involving cocaine
related substances. Following several hearings, Congress enacted
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA). The statute provides a
mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for certain drug offenses in
volving “(ii) 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing
a detectable amount of . . . (II) cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric
isomers, and salts of isomers, [or] (iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture
or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.” 21
U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(A). The statute similarly provides a 5-year sen
tence for offenses involving 500 grams of a substance enumerated in
clause (ii) or 5 grams of one outlined in clause (iii). §841(b)(1)(B).
In 2005, petitioner DePierre was indicted for distribution of 50
grams or more of cocaine base under §§841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).
The District Court declined DePierre’s request that the jury be in
structed that, in order to find DePierre guilty of distribution of “co
caine base,” it must find that his offense involved crack cocaine.
DePierre was convicted, and the court sentenced him to the 120
months in prison mandated by the statute. The First Circuit af
firmed, rejecting DePierre’s argument that §841(b)(1)(A)(iii) should
be read only to apply to offenses involving crack cocaine. Instead, it
adhered to its precedent holding that “cocaine base” refers to all
forms of cocaine base.
Held: “[C]ocaine base,” as used in §841(b)(1), means not just “crack co
caine,” but cocaine in its chemically basic form. Pp. 7–18.
(a) The most natural reading of “cocaine base” in clause (iii) is co
caine in its chemically basic form—i.e., the molecule found in crack
