Opinion of the Court

The United States Sentencing Commission subsequently
promulgated Sentencing Guidelines for drug-trafficking
offenses. Under the Guidelines, the offense levels for drug
crimes are tied to the drug type and quantity involved.
See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines
Manual §2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2010) (USSG). The Commission
originally adopted the ADAA’s 100-to-1 ratio for offenses
involving “cocaine” and “cocaine base,” though instead of
setting only two quantity thresholds, as the ADAA did, the
Guidelines “set sentences for the full range of possible
drug quantities.” Commission Report 1; see generally
Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 96–97.4
The original version of §2D1.1(c) did not define “cocaine
base” as used in that provision, but in 1993 the Commis
sion issued an amendment to explain that “ ‘[c]ocaine
base,’ for the purposes of this guideline, means ‘crack,’ ”
that is, “the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually
prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium
bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike
form.” USSG App. C, Amdt. 487 (effective Nov. 1, 1993);
see also USSG §2D1.1(c), n. (D). The Commission noted
that “forms of cocaine base other than crack (e.g., coca
paste . . .) will be treated as cocaine.” USSG App. C,
Amdt. 487.5

In April 2005, petitioner Frantz DePierre sold two bags
——————
4 In 2007 the Commission increased the quantity of cocaine base re
quired to trigger each offense level, reducing the cocaine base-to-cocaine
sentencing ratio under the Guidelines. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt.
706 (effective Nov. 1, 2007). Unless otherwise noted, we cite to the
current versions of the relevant Guidelines provisions.
5 The Guidelines’ Drug Quantity Table only lists “cocaine” and “co
caine base” among its enumerated controlled substances, but the
application notes make clear that the term “cocaine” includes “ecgonine
and coca leaves,” as well as “salts, isomers, and salts of isomers” of
cocaine. §2D1.1(c), and comment., n. 5.
