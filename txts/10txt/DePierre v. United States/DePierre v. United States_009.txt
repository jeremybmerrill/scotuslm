DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

of drugs to a Government informant. DePierre was subse
quently indicted on a charge of distributing 50 grams or
more of cocaine base under §§841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).6
At trial, a Government chemist testified that the sub
stance in the bags, which weighed 55.1 grams, was “co
caine base.” Tr. 488, 490. She was not able to identify any
sodium bicarbonate. Id., at 499. A police officer testified
that the substance in question was “off-white [and]
chunky.” Id., at 455.
DePierre asked the District Court to instruct the jury
that, in order to find him guilty of distribution of cocaine
base, it must find that his offense involved “the form
of cocaine base known as crack cocaine.” App. in No. 08–
2101 (CA1), p. 43. His proposed jury instruction defined
“crack” identically to the Guidelines definition. See id., at
43–44; see also USSG §2D1.1(c), n. (D). In addition, DePierre asked the court to instruct the jury that “[c]hemi
cal analysis cannot establish a substance as crack because
crack is chemically identical to other forms of cocaine base,
although it can reveal the presence of sodium bicarbonate,
which is usually used in the processing of crack.” App. in
No. 08–2101, at 44.
The court, however, instructed the jury that “the statute
that’s relevant asks about cocaine base. Crack cocaine is a
form of cocaine base, so you’ll tell us whether or not what
was involved is cocaine base . . . .” Tr. 585 (paragraph
break omitted). The jury form asked whether the offense
involved “over 50 grams of cocaine base.” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 17a. The jury found DePierre guilty of distributing
50 grams or more of cocaine base, and the court sentenced
DePierre to 120 months in prison as required by the statute.

was also indicted for distribution of powder cocaine under
§841(a)(1) and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial num
ber under 18 U. S. C. §922(k). He was convicted by jury of the former
offense and pleaded guilty to the latter prior to trial.
