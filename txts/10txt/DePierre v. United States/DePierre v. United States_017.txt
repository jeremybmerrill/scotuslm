DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

(stating that the ability to inhale vapor “is the reason why
crack, or cocaine free-base, is so dangerous”). This is not,
however, a feature unique to crack cocaine, and freebase
and coca paste were also acknowledged as dangerous,
smokeable forms of cocaine. See, e.g., id., at 70 (prepared
statement of Dr. Charles R. Schuster, Director, National
Institute on Drug Abuse) (reporting on the shift from
snorting powder cocaine to “newer more dangerous routes
of administration, such as freebase smoking”); id., at 19–
20 (statement of Dr. Byck) (describing the damaging ef
fects of cocaine smoking on people in Peru).
Moreover, the testimony of witnesses before Congress
did not clearly distinguish between these base forms of
cocaine; witnesses repeatedly used terms like “cocaine
base,” “freebase,” or “cocaine freebase” in a manner that
grouped crack cocaine with other substances containing
chemically basic forms of cocaine. See, e.g., Trafficking
and Abuse of “Crack” in New York City, House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, 99th Cong.,
2d Sess., 258 (1986) (statement of Robert M. Stutman,
Special Agent in Charge, Drug Enforcement Admin., Dept.
of Justice) (“[C]ocaine in its alkaloid form [is] commonly
known on the street as crack, rock, base, or freebase”);
Crack Cocaine Hearing 71 (statement of Dr. Schuster) (“In
other words, ‘crack’ is a street name for cocaine freebase”).
In fact, prior to passage of the ADAA, multiple bills were
introduced in Congress that imposed enhanced penalties
on those who trafficked in “cocaine base,” e.g., S. 2787,
99th Cong., 2d Sess., §1 (1986), as well as “cocaine free
base,” e.g., H. R. 5394, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., §101 (1986);
H. R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., §608(a) (1986).
Given crack cocaine’s sudden emergence and the simi
larities it shared with other forms of cocaine, this lack of
clarity is understandable, as is Congress’ desire to adopt a
statutory term that would encompass all forms. Congress
faced what it perceived to be a new threat of massive
