DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

parties whether coca leaves in their natural, unprocessed
form actually contain chemically basic cocaine. Compare
Brief for Petitioner 15, 17, n. 10, with Brief for United
States 43. Even assuming that DePierre is correct as a
matter of chemistry that coca leaves contain cocaine in its
base form,12 see Physicians Brief 2, 11, the Government
has averred that it “would not be able to make that show
ing in court,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, and that “coca leaves
should not be treated as containing ‘cocaine base’ for
purposes of Clause (iii),” Brief for United States 45.
It is unsurprising, therefore, that the Government in its
brief disclaimed awareness of any prosecution in which
it had sought, or the defendant had received, a statutory
minimum sentence enhanced under clause (iii) for an of
fense involving coca leaves. Id., at 44. And although
this question is not before us today, we note that Congress’
deliberate choice to enumerate “coca leaves” in clause (ii)
strongly indicates its intent that offenses involving such
leaves be subject to the higher quantity thresholds of that
clause. Accordingly, there is little danger that the statute
will be read in the “absurd” manner DePierre fears.

In addition, DePierre suggests that because the Sen
tencing Commission has, since 1993, defined “cocaine
base” to mean “crack” for the purposes of the Federal
Sentencing Guidelines, we should do the same with re
spect to §841(b)(1). We do not agree. We have never held
that, when interpreting a term in a criminal statute,
deference is warranted to the Sentencing Commission’s
definition of the same term in the Guidelines. Cf. Neal v.
United States, 516 U. S. 284, 290–296 (1996). And we

appears that Congress itself is of the view that coca leaves con
tain “cocaine,” as subclause (I) exempts offenses involving “coca leaves
from which cocaine . . . ha[s] been removed.” §§841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(I),
(B)(ii)(I).
