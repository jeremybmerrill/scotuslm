scope. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing 4 (statement of
Sen. Nunn) (“[C]ocaine use, particularly in the more pure
form known as crack, is at near epidemic proportions”);
id., at 21 (statement of Dr. Byck) (“We are dealing with
a worse drug . . . than we have ever dealt with, or that
anybody has ever dealt with in history”). Accordingly, Con
gress chose statutory language broad enough to meet
that threat. As we have noted, “statutory prohibitions
often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably
comparable evils.” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Ser
vices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998). In the absence of any
indication in the statutory text that Congress intended
only to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penal
ties, we cannot adopt DePierre’s narrow construction. See
Lewis v. Chicago, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9)
(“It is not for us to rewrite [a] statute so that it covers only
what we think is necessary to achieve what we think
Congress really intended”).

DePierre also argues that we should read the term “co
caine base” to mean “crack cocaine,” rather than chemi
cally basic cocaine, because the latter definition leads to
an absurd result. Cf. EEOC v. Commercial Office Prod
ucts Co., 486 U. S. 107, 120 (1988) (plurality opinion). He
contends that, because coca leaves themselves contain
cocaine, under the Government’s approach an offense
involving 5 grams of coca leaves will be subject to the 5
year minimum sentence in §841(b)(1)(B)(iii), even though
those leaves would produce only .05 grams of smokeable
cocaine. See Brief for Petitioner 41–42. While we agree that
it would be questionable to treat 5 grams of coca leaves as
equivalent to 500 grams of powder cocaine for minimum
sentence purposes, we are not persuaded that such a
result would actually obtain in light of our decision today.
To begin with, it is a matter of dispute between the
