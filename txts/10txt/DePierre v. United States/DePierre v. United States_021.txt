DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

ute and the graduated sentencing scheme established
by the Guidelines. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 107–108;
Neal, 516 U. S., at 291–292. Accordingly, we reject DePierre’s suggestion that the term “cocaine base” as used in
clause (iii) must be given the same definition as it has
under the Guidelines.

Finally, DePierre argues that, because §841(b)(1) is at
the very least ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires us to
interpret the statute in his favor. See United States v.
Santos, 553 U. S. 507, 514 (2008) (“The rule of lenity
requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in
favor of the defendants subjected to them”). As evinced by
the preceding discussion, we cannot say that the statute is
crystalline. The rule, however, is reserved for cases
where, “after seizing everything from which aid can be
derived, the Court is left with an ambiguous statute.”
Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993) (internal
quotation marks and alterations omitted). Applying the
normal rules of statutory construction in this case, it is
clear that Congress used the term “cocaine base” in clause
(iii) to penalize more severely not only offenses involving
“crack cocaine,” but those involving substances containing
chemically basic cocaine more generally. There is no per
suasive justification for reading the statute otherwise.
Because the statutory text allows us to make far more
than “a guess as to what Congress intended,” Reno v.
Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 65 (1995) (internal quotation marks
omitted), the rule of lenity does not apply in DePierre’s
favor.

We hold that the term “cocaine base” as used in
§841(b)(1) means not just “crack cocaine,” but cocaine in
its chemically basic form. We therefore affirm the judg
ment of the Court of Appeals.
It is so ordered.
