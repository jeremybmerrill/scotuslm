DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

vision for mandatory minimum sentences. See, e.g.,
§841(b)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. III). After holding several
hearings specifically addressing the emergence of crack
cocaine, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of
1986 (ADAA), 100 Stat. 3207, which provided mandatory
minimum sentences for controlled-substance offenses in
volving specific quantities of drugs.
As relevant here, the ADAA provided a mandatory 10
year sentence for certain drug offenses involving 5 kilo
grams or more of “a mixture or substance containing a
detectable amount of ” various cocaine-related elements,
including coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts; it also
called for the same sentence for offenses involving only
50 grams or more of “a mixture or substance . . . which
contains cocaine base.” ADAA, §1002, 100 Stat. 3207–2
(amending §§841(b)(1)(A)(ii)–(iii)) (emphasis added). The
ADAA also stipulated a mandatory 5-year sentence for
offenses involving 500 grams of a mixture or substance
containing coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts, or 5
grams of a mixture or substance containing “cocaine base.”
Id., at 3207–3 (amending §§841(b)(1)(B)(ii)–(iii)).
Thus, the ADAA established a 100-to-1 ratio for the
threshold quantities of cocaine-related substances that
triggered the statute’s mandatory minimum penalties.
That is, 5 grams or more of “a mixture or substance . . .
which contains cocaine base” was penalized as severely as
100 times that amount of the other cocaine-related ele
ments enumerated in the statute. These provisions were
still in effect at the time of petitioner’s conviction and
sentence.3 See §§841(b)(1)(A)–(B) (2000 ed. and Supp. V).
——————
3 Due to a recent amendment, the quantity ratio in §841(b)(1) is now
roughly 18-to-1, but otherwise the relevant statutory provisions are
unchanged from those in effect at the time DePierre was sentenced.
See Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), §2, 124 Stat. 2372 (changing the
quantity in §841(b)(1)(A)(iii) from 50 to 280 grams and in subparagraph
(B)(iii) from 5 to 28 grams).
