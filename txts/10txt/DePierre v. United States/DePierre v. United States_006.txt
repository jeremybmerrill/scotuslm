cocaine molecule, Physicians Brief 4, and the resulting
solid substance can be cooled and broken into small pieces
and then smoked, Commission Report 14. This substance
is commonly known as “crack” or “crack cocaine.”2 Alter
natively, powder cocaine can be dissolved in water and
ammonia (also a base); with the addition of ether, a solid
substance—known as “freebase”—separates from the solu
tion, and can be smoked. Id., at 13. As with crack cocaine,
freebase contains cocaine in its chemically basic form.

Chemically, therefore, there is no difference between the
cocaine in coca paste, crack cocaine, and freebase—all are
cocaine in its base form. On the other hand, cocaine in its
base form and in its salt form (i.e., cocaine hydrochloride)
are chemically different, though they have the same active
ingredient and produce the same physiological and psy
chotropic effects. See id., at 14–22. The key difference
between them is the method by which they generally enter
the body; smoking cocaine in its base form—whether as
coca paste, freebase, or crack cocaine—allows the body to
absorb the active ingredient quickly, thereby producing a
shorter, more intense high than obtained from insufflating
cocaine hydrochloride. Ibid.; see generally Kimbrough v.
United States, 552 U. S. 85, 94 (2007).

In 1986, increasing public concern over the dangers
associated with illicit drugs—and the new phenomenon
of crack cocaine in particular—prompted Congress to re
vise the penalties for criminal offenses involving cocaine
related substances. See id., at 95–96. At the time, federal
law generally tied the penalties for drug offenses to both
the type of drug and the quantity involved, with no pro

2 Though the terms “crack” and “crack cocaine” are interchangeable,
in this opinion we adopt DePierre’s practice and generally employ the
latter.
