FRANTZ DEPIERRE, PETITIONER v. 

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[June 9, 2011]


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
At the time of petitioner’s conviction and sentence,
federal law mandated a minimum 10-year sentence for
persons convicted of certain drug offenses, 21 U. S. C.
§841(a), including those involving 50 grams or more of
“a mixture or substance . . . which contains cocaine base,”
§841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and a minimum 5-year sentence for
offenses involving 5 grams or more of the same,
§841(b)(1)(B)(iii). This case requires us to decide whether
the term “cocaine base” as used in this statute refers
generally to cocaine in its chemically basic form or exclu
sively to what is colloquially known as “crack cocaine.” We
conclude that “cocaine base” means the former.

A

As a matter of chemistry, cocaine is an alkaloid with the
molecular formula C17H21NO4. Webster’s Third New In
ternational Dictionary 434 (2002). An alkaloid is a base—
that is, a compound capable of reacting with an acid to
form a salt.1 Id., at 54, 180; see also Brief for Individual
