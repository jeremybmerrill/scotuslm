Opinion of the Court

(suggesting that a “statute’s basic purpose” might support
the conclusion that “two sets of different words mean the
same thing”).
III
DePierre offers four additional arguments in support of his
view that the term “cocaine base” in clause (iii) is best read
to mean “crack cocaine.” We do not find them convincing.
A
DePierre first argues that we should read “cocaine base”
to mean “crack cocaine” because, in passing the ADAA,
Congress in 1986 intended to penalize crack cocaine
offenses more severely than those involving other sub
stances containing C17H21NO4. As is evident from the pre
ceding discussion, this position is not supported by the
statutory text. To be sure, the records of the contempora
neous congressional hearings suggest that Congress was
most concerned with the particular dangers posed by the
advent of crack cocaine. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing
1 (statement of Chairman Roth) (“[We] mee[t] today to
examine a frightening and dangerous new twist in the
drug abuse problem—the growing availability and use of a
cheap, highly addictive, and deadly form of cocaine known
on the streets as ‘crack’ ”); see generally Commission Re
port 116–118; Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 95–96.
It does not necessarily follow, however, that in passing
the ADAA Congress meant for clause (iii)’s lower quantity
thresholds to apply exclusively to crack cocaine offenses.
Numerous witnesses at the hearings testified that the
primary reason crack cocaine was so dangerous was
because—contrary to powder cocaine—cocaine in its base
form is smoked, which was understood to produce a faster,
more intense, and more addictive high than powder co
caine. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing 20 (statement of
Dr. Robert Byck, Yale University School of Medicine)
