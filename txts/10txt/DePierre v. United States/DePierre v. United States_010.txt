Opinion of the Court

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Cir
cuit affirmed, rejecting DePierre’s argument that
§841(b)(1)(A)(iii) should be read only to apply to offenses
involving crack cocaine. 599 F. 3d 25, 30–31 (2010).
While noting the division on this question among the
Courts of Appeals, id., at 30–31, and nn. 3, 4, the First
Circuit adhered to its own precedent and “read the statute
according to its terms,” holding that “ ‘cocaine base’ refers
to ‘all forms of cocaine base, including but not limited to
crack cocaine.’ ” Id., at 30–31 (quoting United States v.
Anderson, 452 F. 3d 66, 86–87 (CA1 2006)). We granted
certiorari to resolve the longstanding division in authority
among the Courts of Appeals on this question. 562 U. S.
___ (2010).
