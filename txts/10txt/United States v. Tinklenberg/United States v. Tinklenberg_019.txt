Opinion of the Court

hold that its interpretations of those two provisions are
mistaken. Nonetheless the conclusions the court drew
from those two interpretations in relevant part cancel
each other out such that the court’s ultimate conclusion
that Tinklenberg’s trial failed to comply with the Speedy
Trial Act’s deadline is correct. Therefore, the Sixth Cir
cuit’s judgment ordering dismissal of the indictment on
remand is
Affirmed.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
