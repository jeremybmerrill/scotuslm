Opinion of SCALIA, J.

tion . . . except that any time consumed in excess of ten
days from . . . an order directing such transportation, and
the defendant’s arrival at the destination shall be pre
sumed to be unreasonable.” If “delay” means trial delay, it
makes little sense for Congress to have placed a limit upon
the “time consumed” in transporting a defendant rather
than upon the permissible postponement of trial date.
The Speedy Trial Act’s structure also suggests that
§3161(h)(1)(D) is meant to apply automatically and is not
dependent on predicate findings of postponement. Section
3161(h) lists various types of delay that may be excluded,
the first six of which (including §3161(h)(1)(D)) make no
reference to any required findings. But the seventh, which
excludes “delay resulting from a continuance granted by
any judge,” conditions that exclusion upon certain find
ings, §3161(h)(7)(A). In light of this difference in formula
tion, we have held that the first six exclusions are “ ‘auto
matic,’ ” apply “regardless of the specifics of the case,” and
require no district-court findings. Bloate v. United States,
559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1, n. 1, 6);
see also Henderson v. United States, 476 U. S. 321, 327
(1986). Tinklenberg’s incorporation of a threshold inquiry
into §3161(h)(1)(D) would make it none of these things.
Delay of trial is also ruled out by the fact that the text
is forward looking. It says that the “following periods of
delay shall be excluded in computing . . . the time within
which the trial . . . must commence.” §3161(h) (emphasis
added). This is designed to enable the determination in
advance of the date by which the trial “must commence.”
Quite obviously, if the specified delays did not count
unless and until they delayed the trial, one could not know
whether they counted until after the fact. And on that
interpretation the provision should have read, not “the
time within which the trial . . . must commence,” but
rather “the time within which the trial . . . should have
commenced.”
