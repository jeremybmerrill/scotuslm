UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG
Opinion of the Court

period of 10 days unless the statute specifically excludes
them. See 74 Am. Jur. 2d, Time §22, p. 589 (2001)
(in calculating time periods expressed in statutes, “when
the time stipulated must necessarily include one or more
Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays, those days will not be
excluded, in the absence of an express proviso for their
exclusion”). Many courts have treated statutory time
periods this way. See, e.g., Howeisen v. Chapman, 195
Ind. 381, 383–384, 145 N. E. 487, 488 (1924); American
Tobacco Co. v. Strickling, 88 Md. 500, 508–511, 41 A.
1083, 1086 (1898). And Congress has tended specifically
to exclude weekend days and holidays from statutory time
periods of 10 days when it intended that result. Compare
18 U. S. C. §3142(d)(2) (permitting the temporary deten
tion of certain defendants “for a period of not more than
ten days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays”)
and 5 U. S. C. §552a(d)(2)(A) (requiring an agency to
acknowledge receipt of a request to amend agency records
within “10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
public holidays)”) with 18 U. S. C. §2518(9) (establishing a
10-day period for disclosing applications for and court
orders authorizing wiretaps without specifically excluding
weekends and holidays) and §4244(a) (providing a 10-day
period after conviction for filing a motion to request men
tal health treatment without specifically excluding week
ends and holidays). Indeed, Rule 45 has been recently
modified so that now (though not at the time of Tinklen
berg’s proceedings) it requires a similar result. Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 45(a)(1) (2010) (instructing that weekend days
and holidays are to be counted when calculating all time
periods, including statutory time periods for which no
alternative method of computing time is specified).
