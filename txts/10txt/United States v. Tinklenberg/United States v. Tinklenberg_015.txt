Opinion of the Court

motion actually caused postponement of the trial in each
individual case. But the Sixth Circuit’s interpretation
would nonetheless significantly limit the premise of “auto
matic application” upon which the case rests.
Fifth, for those who find legislative history useful, it is
worthwhile noting, (as this Court noted in Henderson)
that the Senate Report concerning the reenactment of the
provision in 1979 described it, along with the other provi
sions in §3161(h)(1), as referring to “specific and recurring
periods of time often found in criminal cases,” and charac
terized them as “automatically excludable delay,” S. Rep.
No. 96–212, p. 9 (1979). See H. R. Rep. No. 93–1508, at 21
(“The time limits would be tolled by hearings, proceedings
and necessary delay which normally occur prior to the
trial of criminal cases” (emphasis added)); S. Rep. No. 93–
1021, at 21 (“[The Act] has carefully constructed exclu
sions and exceptions which permit normal pre-trial prepa
ration in the ordinary noncomplex cases which represent
the bulk of business in the Federal courts”). But cf. id., at
35 (paragraph (h)(1) excludes “[d]elays caused by proceed
ings relating to the defendant” (emphasis added)).
Sixth, because all the subparagraphs but one under
paragraph (1) begin with the phrase “delay resulting
from,” the Sixth Circuit’s interpretation would potentially
extend well beyond pretrial motions and encompass such
matters as mental and physical competency examinations,
interlocutory appeals, consideration of plea agreements,
and the absence of essential witnesses. See §3161(h)(1)
(2006 ed., Supp. III); §3161(h)(3)(A) (2006 ed.). Given the
administrative complexity the causation requirement
would bring about in all these areas, those Circuits that
have considered a causation requirement in respect to
these other matters have rejected it. See, e.g., United
States v. Pete, 525 F. 3d 844, 852 (CA9 2008) (interlocutory
appeal); United States v. Miles, 290 F. 3d 1341, 1350
(CA11 2002) (unavailability of essential witnesses); United
