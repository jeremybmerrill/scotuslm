UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. JASON LOUIS 

TINKLENBERG 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[May 26, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U. S. C. §3161 et seq.,
provides that in “any case in which a plea of not guilty is
entered, the trial . . . shall commence within seventy days”
from the later of (1) the “filing date” of the information or
indictment or (2) the defendant’s initial appearance before
a judicial officer (i.e., the arraignment). §3161(c)(1). The
Act goes on to list a set of exclusions from the 70-day
period, including “delay resulting from any pretrial mo
tion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion
of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such
motion.” §3161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis
added).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
held in this case that a pretrial motion falls within this
exclusion only if it “actually cause[s] a delay, or the expec
tation of a delay, of trial.” 579 F. 3d 589, 598 (2009). In
our view, however, the statutory exclusion does not con
tain this kind of causation requirement. Rather, the filing
of a pretrial motion falls within this provision irrespective
of whether it actually causes, or is expected to cause, delay
