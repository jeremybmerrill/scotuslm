Opinion of the Court

cific sublist in the statute before us in this definitional
sense—as “periods of delay” or as bringing about delay.
After all, the exclusion of any of the specific periods de
scribed always delays the expiration of the 70-day Speedy
Trial deadline. Or Congress might have described the
specific periods listed in paragraph (1) as “periods of de
lay” and “delay[s] resulting from” simply because periods
of the type described often do cause a delay in the start of
trial. Both explanations show that, linguistically speak
ing, one can read the statutory exclusion as automatically
applying to the specific periods described without leaving
to the district court the task of determining whether the
period described would or did actually cause a postpone
ment of the trial in the particular case. Thus, language
alone cannot resolve the basic question presented in this
case. But when read in context and in light of the stat
ute’s structure and purpose, we think it clear that Con
gress intended subparagraph (D) to apply automatically.
C
We now turn to several considerations, which, taken
together, convince us that the subparagraphs that specifi
cally list common pretrial occurrences apply automatically
in the way we have just described. First, subparagraph
(D) clarifies that the trial court should measure the period
of excludable delay for a pretrial motion “from the filing of
the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or
other prompt disposition of such motion,” but nowhere
does it mention the date on which the trial begins or was
expected to begin. §3161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III).
Thus, it is best read to instruct measurement of the time
actually consumed by consideration of the pretrial mo
tion. Two other related subparagraphs contain clarifying
language that contemplates measurement of the time
actually consumed by the specified pretrial occurrence
without regard to the commencement of the trial. See
