UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG
Opinion of the Court

in starting a trial.
I
Jason Louis Tinklenberg, the respondent, was convicted
of violating federal drug and gun laws. 18 U. S. C.
§922(g)(1) (felon in possession of a firearm); 21 U. S. C.
§843(a)(6) (possession of items used to manufacture a
controlled substance). He made his initial appearance
before a judicial officer on October 31, 2005, and the
Speedy Trial clock then began to run. His trial began on
August 14, 2006, 287 days later. Just before trial,
Tinklenberg asked the District Court to dismiss the in
dictment on the ground that the trial came too late, vio
lating the Speedy Trial Act’s 70-day requirement. The
District Court denied the motion after finding that 218
of the 287 days fell within various Speedy Trial Act exclu
sions, leaving 69 nonexcludable days, thereby making the
trial timely.
On appeal the Sixth Circuit agreed with the District
Court that many of the 287 days were excludable. But it
disagreed with the District Court about the excludability
of time related to three pretrial motions. The Government
filed the first motion, an unopposed motion to conduct a
video deposition of a witness, on August 1, 2006; the Dis
trict Court disposed of the motion on August 3, 2006. The
Government filed the second motion, an unopposed motion
to bring seized firearms into the courtroom as evidence at
trial, on August 8, 2006; the District Court disposed of the
motion on August 10, 2006. Tinklenberg filed the third
motion, a motion to dismiss the indictment under the
Speedy Trial Act, on August 11, 2006; the District Court
denied that motion on August 14, 2006. In the Sixth
Circuit’s view, the nine days during which the three mo
tions were pending were not excludable because the mo
tions did not “actually cause a delay, or the expectation of
delay, of trial.” 579 F. 3d, at 598. Because these 9 days
