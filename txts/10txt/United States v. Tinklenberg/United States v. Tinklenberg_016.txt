UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG
Opinion of the Court

States v. Robinson, 887 F. 2d 651, 656–657 (CA6 1989)
(trial on other charges). That further complexity, along

ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added).
The District Court granted Tinklenberg’s request for a
competency evaluation and he was transported to a medi

within the 20-day period, only 2 days, not 10 days, were
considered excessive, during which the 70-day Speedy
Trial Act clock continued to tick.
Tinklenberg argues that subparagraph (F) does not
