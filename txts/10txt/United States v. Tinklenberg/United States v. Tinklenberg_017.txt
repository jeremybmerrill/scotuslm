Opinion of the Court

exempt weekend days and holidays; hence the court
should have considered 10, not 2, days to be excessive.
And the parties concede that those 8 extra ticking days are
enough to make the difference between compliance with,
and violation of, the Act.
As the Solicitor General notes, we may consider, or
“decline to entertain,” alternative grounds for affirmance.
See United States v. Nobles, 422 U. S. 225, 242, n. 16
(1975). In this case, we believe it treats Tinklenberg, who
has already served his sentence, more fairly to consider
the alternative ground and thereby more fully to dispose of
the case.
The Sixth Circuit exempted weekend days and holidays
because it believed that subparagraph (F) incorporated
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a). At the relevant
time, that Rule excluded weekend days and holidays when
computing any period of time specified in the “rules,” in
“any local rule,” or in “any court order” that was less than
11 days. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 45(a) (2005). But in our
view subparagraph (F) does not incorporate Rule 45. The
Act does not say that it incorporates Rule 45. The Gov
ernment has given us no good reason for reading it as
incorporating the Rule. And the Rule itself, as it existed
at the relevant time, said that it applied to “rules” and to
“orders,” but it said nothing about statutes. Other things
being equal, the fact that Rule 45 is revised from time to
time also argues against its direct application to subpara
graph (F). That is because those changes, likely reflecting
considerations other than those related to the Speedy
Trial Act, may well leave courts treating similar defen
dants differently.
Without relying upon a cross-reference to Rule 45, we
believe the better reading of subparagraph (F) would
include weekend days and holidays in its 10-day time
period. Under the common-law rule, weekend days and
holidays are included when counting a statutory time
