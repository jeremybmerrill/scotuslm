UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG
Opinion of the Court

§3161(h)(1)(F) (“Any time consumed in excess of ten days
from the date an order of removal or an order directing
such transportation, and the defendant’s arrival at the
destination shall be presumed to be unreasonable”);
§3161(h)(1)(H) (“delay reasonably attributable to any
period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any pro
ceeding concerning the defendant is actually under ad
visement by the court”). If “delay” truly referred to the
postponement of trial, then presumably those subpara
graphs would instruct that excludable periods should be
measured from the date that trial was otherwise sched

Second, we are impressed that during the 37 years since
Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act, every Court of
Appeals has considered the question before us now, and
every Court of Appeals, implicitly or explicitly, has re
jected the interpretation that the Sixth Circuit adopted in
this case. See United States v. Wilson, 835 F. 2d 1440,
1443 (CADC 1987) (explicit), abrogated on other grounds
by Bloate v. United States, 559 U. S. ___ (2010); United
States v. Hood, 469 F. 3d 7, 10 (CA1 2006) (explicit);
United States v. Cobb, 697 F. 2d 38, 42 (CA2 1982) (ex
plicit), abrogated on other grounds by Henderson v. United
States, 476 U. S. 321 (1986); United States v. Novak, 715
F. 2d 810, 813 (CA3 1983) (explicit) abrogated on other
grounds by Henderson v. United States, 476 U. S. 321
(1986); United States v. Dorlouis, 107 F. 3d 248, 253–254
(CA4 1997) (explicit); United States v. Green, 508 F. 3d

Titlbach, 339 F. 3d 692, 698 (CA8 2003) (implicit); United
