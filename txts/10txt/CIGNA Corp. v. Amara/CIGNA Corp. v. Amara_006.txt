CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
Opinion of the Court

them with less generous benefits. See Employee Retire
ment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) §§102(a),
104(b), 204(h), 88 Stat. 841, 848, 862, as amended, 29
U. S. C. §§1022(a), 1024(b), 1054(h).
The District Court agreed that the disclosures made by
CIGNA violated its obligations under ERISA. In deter
mining relief, the court found that CIGNA’s notice failures
had caused the employees “likely harm.” The Court then
reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits
accordingly. It found legal authority for doing so in
ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B) (authoriz
ing a plan “participant or beneficiary” to bring a “civil
action” to “recover benefits due to him under the terms of
his plan”).
We agreed to decide whether the District Court applied
the correct legal standard, namely, a “likely harm” stan
dard, in determining that CIGNA’s notice violations
caused its employees sufficient injury to warrant legal
relief. To reach that question, we must first consider a
more general matter—whether the ERISA section just
mentioned (ERISA’s recovery-of-benefits-due provision,
§502(a)(1)(B)) authorizes entry of the relief the District
Court provided. We conclude that it does not authorize
this relief. Nonetheless, we find that a different equity
related ERISA provision, to which the District Court also
referred, authorizes forms of relief similar to those that
the court entered. §502(a)(3), 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(3).
Section 502(a)(3) authorizes “appropriate equitable
relief ” for violations of ERISA. Accordingly, the relevant
standard of harm will depend upon the equitable theory by
which the District Court provides relief. We leave it to the
District Court to conduct that analysis in the first in
stance, but we identify equitable principles that the court
might apply on remand.
