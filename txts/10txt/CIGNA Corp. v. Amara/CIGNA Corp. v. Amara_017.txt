Opinion of the Court

standard for determining harm is beside the point. We
believe that this preliminary question is closely enough
related to the question presented that we shall consider it
at the outset.
A
The District Court ordered relief in two steps. Step 1: It
ordered the terms of the plan reformed (so that they pro
vided an “A plus B,” rather than a “greater of A or B”
guarantee). Step 2: It ordered the plan administrator
(which it found to be CIGNA) to enforce the plan as re
formed. One can fairly describe step 2 as consistent with
§502(a)(1)(B), for that provision grants a participant the
right to bring a civil action to “recover benefits due . . .
under the terms of his plan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B).
And step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by the
“terms of [the] plan” as reformed.
But what about step 1? Where does §502(a)(1)(B) grant
a court the power to change the terms of the plan as they
previously existed? The statutory language speaks of
“enforc[ing]” the “terms of the plan,” not of changing them.
29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(l)(B) (emphasis added). The provision
allows a court to look outside the plan’s written language
in deciding what those terms are, i.e., what the language
means. See UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526
U. S. 358, 377–379 (1999) (permitting the insurance terms
of an ERISA-governed plan to be interpreted in light of
state insurance rules). But we have found nothing sug
gesting that the provision authorizes a court to alter those
terms, at least not in present circumstances, where that
change, akin to the reform of a contract, seems less like
the simple enforcement of a contract as written and more
like an equitable remedy. See infra, at 18.
Nor can we accept the Solicitor General’s alternative
rationale seeking to justify the use of this provision. The
Solicitor General says that the District Court did enforce
