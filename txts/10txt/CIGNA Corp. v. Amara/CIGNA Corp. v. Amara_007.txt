Opinion of the Court 


I

Because our decision rests in important part upon the
circumstances present here, we shall describe those cir
cumstances in some detail. We still simplify in doing so.
But the interested reader can find a more thorough de
scription in two District Court opinions, which set forth
that court’s findings reached after a lengthy trial. See 559
F. Supp. 2d 192 (Conn. 2008); 534 F. Supp. 2d 288 (Conn.
2008).
A
Under CIGNA’s pre-1998 defined-benefit retirement
plan, an employee with at least five years service would
receive an annuity annually paying an amount that de
pended upon the employee’s salary and length of service.
Depending on when the employee had joined CIGNA, the
annuity would equal either (1) 2 percent of the employee’s
average salary over his final three years with CIGNA,
multiplied by the number of years worked (up to 30); or (2)
12⁄3 percent of the employee’s average salary over his final
five years with CIGNA, multiplied by the number of years
worked (up to 35). Calculated either way, the annuity
would approach 60 percent of a longtime employee’s final
salary. A well-paid longtime employee, earning, say,
$160,000 per year, could receive a retirement annuity
paying the employee about $96,000 per year until his
death. The plan offered many employees at least one
other benefit: They could retire early, at age 55, and re
ceive an only-somewhat-reduced annuity.
In November 1997, CIGNA sent its employees a news
letter announcing that it intended to put in place a new
pension plan. The new plan would substitute an “account
balance plan” for CIGNA’s pre-existing defined-benefit
system. App. 991a (emphasis deleted). The newsletter
added that the old plan would end on December 31, 1997,
that CIGNA would introduce (and describe) the new plan
