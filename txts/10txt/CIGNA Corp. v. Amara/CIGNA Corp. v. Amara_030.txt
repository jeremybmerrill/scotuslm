ticularly complicated,” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205, and said
that “in view of these knotty issues . . . the Court need not,
and does not, decide whether Plaintiffs could obtain relief
under §502(a)(3),” id., at 206.
It is assuredly not our normal practice to decide issues
that a lower court “need not, and does not, decide,” see
Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S.

certain cases from this Court that narrowed the applica

I find no such implication whatever—not even a weak one.
The District Court simply said that §502(a)(1)(B) provided
relief, and that under our cases §502(a)(3) might not do so.
While some Members of this Court have sought to divine
what legislators would have prescribed beyond what they
did prescribe, none to my knowledge has hitherto sought
to guess what district judges would have decided beyond

footnote of the Government’s brief, see Brief for United States as
