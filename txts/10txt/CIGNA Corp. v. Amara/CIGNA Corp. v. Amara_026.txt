CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
Opinion of the Court

To be sure, just as a court of equity would not surcharge
a trustee for a nonexistent harm, 4 Scott & Ascher §24.9,
a fiduciary can be surcharged under §502(a)(3) only upon a
showing of actual harm—proved (under the default rule
for civil cases) by a preponderance of the evidence. That
actual harm may sometimes consist of detrimental reli
ance, but it might also come from the loss of a right pro
tected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents. In the
present case, it is not difficult to imagine how the failure
to provide proper summary information, in violation of the
statute, injured employees even if they did not themselves
act in reliance on summary documents—which they might
not themselves have seen—for they may have thought
fellow employees, or informal workplace discussion, would
have let them know if, say, plan changes would likely
prove harmful. We doubt that Congress would have
wanted to bar those employees from relief.
The upshot is that we can agree with CIGNA only to a
limited extent. We believe that, to obtain relief by sur
charge for violations of §§102(a) and 104(b), a plan partici
pant or beneficiary must show that the violation injured
him or her. But to do so, he or she need only show harm
and causation. Although it is not always necessary to
meet the more rigorous standard implicit in the words
“detrimental reliance,” actual harm must be shown.
We are not asked to reassess the evidence. And we are
not asked about the other prerequisites for relief. We are
asked about the standard of prejudice. And we conclude
that the standard of prejudice must be borrowed from
equitable principles, as modified by the obligations and
injuries identified by ERISA itself. Information-related
circumstances, violations, and injuries are potentially too
various in nature to insist that harm must always meet
that more vigorous “detrimental harm” standard when
equity imposed no such strict requirement.
