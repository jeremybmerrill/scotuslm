Opinion of the Court

$100,000 times 7 (years then worked) times 12⁄3 percent, or
$11,667 per year—when he retired in 2031 at age 65. The
2031 price of an annuity paying $11,667 per year until
death depends upon interest rates and mortality assump
tions at that time. If we assume the annuity would pay 7
percent until the holder’s death (and we use the mortality
assumptions used by the plan, see App. 407a (incorporat
ing the mortality table prescribed by Rev. Rul. 95–6,
1995–1 Cum. Bull. 80)), then the 2031 price of such an
annuity would be about $120,500. And CIGNA should
initially deposit in this individual’s account on January 1,
1998, an amount that will grow to become $120,500, 33
years later, in 2031, when the individual retires. If we
assume a 5 percent average interest rate, then that
amount presently (i.e., as of January 1, 1998) equals about
$24,000. And (with one further mortality-related adjust
ment that we shall describe infra, at 6–7) that is the
amount, more or less, that the new plan’s transition rules
would have required CIGNA initially to deposit. Then
CIGNA would make further annual deposits, and all the
deposited amounts would earn compound interest. When
the employee retired, he would receive the resulting lump
sum.
The new plan also provided employees a guarantee: An
employee would receive upon retirement either (1) the
amount to which he or she had become entitled as of
January 1, 1998, or (2) the amount then in his or her
individual account, whichever was greater. Thus, the
employee in our example would receive (in 2031) no less
than an annuity paying $11,667 per year for life.

The District Court found that CIGNA’s initial descrip
tions of its new plan were significantly incomplete and
misled its employees. In November 1997, for example,
