CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
Opinion of the Court

sometime during 1998, and that the new plan would apply
retroactively to January 1, 1998.
Eleven months later CIGNA filled in the details. Its
new plan created an individual retirement account for
each employee. (The account consisted of a bookkeeping
entry backed by a CIGNA-funded trust.) Each year
CIGNA would contribute to the employee’s individual
account an amount equal to between 3 percent and 8.5
percent of the employee’s salary, depending upon age,
length of service, and certain other factors. The account
balance would earn compound interest at a rate equal to
the return on 5-year treasury bills plus one-quarter per
cent (but no less than 4.5 percent and no greater than 9
percent). Upon retirement the employee would receive the
amount then in his or her individual account—in the form
of either a lump sum or whatever annuity the lump sum
then would buy. As promised, CIGNA would open the
accounts and begin to make contributions as of January 1,
1998.
But what about the retirement benefits that employees
had already earned prior to January 1, 1998? CIGNA
promised to make an initial contribution to the individ
ual’s account equal to the value of that employee’s already
earned benefits. And the new plan set forth a method for
calculating that initial contribution. The method con
sisted of calculating the amount as of the employee’s
(future) retirement date of the annuity to which the em
ployee’s salary and length of service already (i.e., as of
December 31, 1997) entitled him and then discounting
that sum to its present (i.e., January 1, 1998) value.
An example will help: Imagine an employee born on
January 1, 1966, who joined CIGNA in January 1991 on
his 25th birthday, and who (during the five years preced
ing the plan changeover) earned an average salary of
$100,000 per year. As of January 1, 1998, the old plan
would have entitled that employee to an annuity equal to
