Opinion of the Court

$11,667 in our example) or “B” (that which they would
earn via CIGNA’s annual deposits under the new plan,
including CIGNA’s initial deposit). And it substituted a
provision that would guarantee each employee “A” (that
which they had already earned, as of December 31, 1997,
under the old plan) plus “B” (that which they would earn
via CIGNA’s annual deposits under the new plan, exclud
ing CIGNA’s initial deposit). In our example, the District
Court’s remedy would no longer force our employee to
choose upon retirement either an $11,667 annuity or his
new plan benefits (including both CIGNA’s annual depos

under the terms of his plan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B).
The court wrote that its orders in effect awarded “benefits
under the terms of the plan” as reformed. 559 F. Supp. 2d,
at 212.
At the same time the court considered whether ERISA
§502(a)(3) also provided legal authority to enter this relief.
That provision states that a civil action may be brought
“by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to en
join any act or practice which violates any provision of
this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to ob
tain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress
such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this
