SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

be far different from what the District Court imposed.3

I agree with the Court that an SPD is not part of
an ERISA plan, and that, as a result, a plan participant
or beneficiary may not recover for misrepresentations in
an SPD under §502(a)(1)(B). Because this is the only
question properly presented for our review, and the only
question briefed and argued before us, I concur only in the
judgment.

3 It is also not obvious that the relief sought in this case would consti
tute an equitable surcharge allowable under Mertens v. Hewitt Associ
ates, 508 U. S. 248 (1993). Cf. Knieriem v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 434
F. 3d 1058, 1063–1064 (CA8 2006). This question, however, like the
Court’s entire discussion of §502(a)(3), is best left for a case in which
the issue is raised and briefed.
