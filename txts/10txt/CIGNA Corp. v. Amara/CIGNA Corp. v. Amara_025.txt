Opinion of the Court

§502(a)(3) (which authorizes the court to enter “appropri
ate equitable relief ” to redress ERISA “violations”). Hence
any requirement of harm must come from the law of
equity.
Looking to the law of equity, there is no general princi
ple that “detrimental reliance” must be proved before a
remedy is decreed. To the extent any such requirement
arises, it is because the specific remedy being contem
plated imposes such a requirement. Thus, as CIGNA
points out, when equity courts used the remedy of estop
pel, they insisted upon a showing akin to detrimental
reliance, i.e., that the defendant’s statement “in truth,
influenced the conduct of ” the plaintiff, causing “preju
dic[e].” Eaton §61, at 175; see 3 Pomeroy §805. Accord
ingly, when a court exercises its authority under
§502(a)(3) to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a
showing of detrimental reliance must be made.
But this showing is not always necessary for other
equitable remedies. Equity courts, for example, would
reform contracts to reflect the mutual understanding of
the contracting parties where “fraudulent suppression[s],
omission[s], or insertion[s],” 1 Story §154, at 149, “mate
rial[ly] . . . affect[ed]” the “substance” of the contract, even
if the “complaining part[y]” was negligent in not realizing
its mistake, as long as its negligence did not fall below a
standard of “reasonable prudence” and violate a legal
duty. 3 Pomeroy §§856, 856b, at 334, 340–341; see Balt
zer, 115 U. S., at 645; Eaton §307(b).
Nor did equity courts insist upon a showing of detrimen
tal reliance in cases where they ordered “surcharge.”
Rather, they simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made
whole following a trustee’s breach of trust. In such in
stances equity courts would “mold the relief to protect the
rights of the beneficiary according to the situation in
volved.” Bogert §861, at 4. This flexible approach belies a
strict requirement of “detrimental reliance.”
