CIGNA CORP. ET AL. v. AMARA ET AL., INDIVIDUALLY 

AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 09–804.

Argued November 30, 2010—Decided May 16, 2011

Until 1998, petitioner CIGNA Corporation’s pension plan provided a
retiring employee with an annuity based on preretirement salary and
length of service. Its new plan replaced that annuity with a cash
balance based on a defined annual contribution from CIGNA, in
creased by compound interest. The new plan translated already
earned benefits under the old plan into an opening amount in the
cash balance account. Respondents, on behalf of beneficiaries of the
CIGNA Pension Plan (also a petitioner), challenged the new plan’s
adoption, claiming, as relevant here, that CIGNA’s notice of the
changes was improper, particularly because the new plan in certain
respects provided them with less generous benefits. The District
Court found that CIGNA’s disclosures violated its obligations under
§§102(a), 104(b), and 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income Se

CIGNA’s notice defects had caused the employees “likely harm.” It
then reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits ac
cordingly, finding its authority in ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), which author
izes a plan “participant or beneficiary” to bring a “civil action” to “re
cover benefits due . . . under the terms of his plan.” The Second
Circuit affirmed.
Held:
1. Although §502(a)(1)(B) did not give the District Court authority
to reform CIGNA’s plan, relief is authorized by §502(a)(3), which al
lows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary “to obtain other appropri
ate equitable relief” to redress violations of ERISA “or the [plan’s]
terms.” Pp. 12–20.
(a) The court ordered relief in two steps. Step 1: It ordered the
