CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

that it is not is eliminated by ERISA’s repeated differen
tiation of SPDs from the “written instruments” that con
stitute a plan, see, e.g., §§1029(c), 1024(b)(2), and ERISA’s
assignment to different entities of responsibility for draft
ing and amending SPDs on the one hand and plans on the
other, see §§1002(1), (2)(A); 1021(a) (2006 ed. and Supp.
III), 1024(b)(1); Beck v. PACE Int’l Union, 551 U. S. 96,
101 (2007). An SPD, moreover, would not fulfill its pur
pose of providing an easily accessible summary of the plan
if it were an authoritative part of the plan itself; the minor
omissions appropriate for a summary would risk revising
the plan.
Nothing else needs to be said to dispose of this case.
The District Court based the relief it awarded upon
ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), and that provision alone. It thought
that the “benefits” due “under the terms of the plan,” 29
U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), could derive from an SPD, either
because the SPD is part of the plan or because it is capable
of somehow modifying the plan. Under either justifica
tion, that conclusion is wrong. An SPD is separate from a
plan, and cannot amend a plan unless the plan so pro
vides. See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514
U. S. 73, 79, 85 (1995). I would go no further.
The Court, however, ventures on to address a different
question: whether respondents may recover under
§502(a)(3) of ERISA, which allows plan participants “to
obtain other appropriate equitable relief.” 29 U. S. C.
§1132(a)(3). The District Court expressly declined to
answer this question, stating that it “need not consider
whether any relief ordered under §502(a)(1)(B) would also
be available under §502(a)(3).” 559 F. Supp. 2d 192, 205
(Conn. 2008). It did note that §502(a)(3) might not help
respondents because that provision authorizes only relief
that was “ ‘typically available in equity.’ ” Ibid. (quoting
Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S.
204, 210 (2002)). But it described this question as “par
