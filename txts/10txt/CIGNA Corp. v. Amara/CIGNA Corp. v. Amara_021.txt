Opinion of the Court

that the fiduciary sought to obtain a lien attaching to (or a
constructive trust imposed upon) money that the benefici
ary had received from the tort-case defendant. But we
noted that the money in question was not the “particular”
money that the tort defendant had paid. And, tradition
ally speaking, relief that sought a lien or a constructive
trust was legal relief, not equitable relief, unless the funds
in question were “particular funds or property in the
defendant’s possession.” 534 U. S., at 213 (emphasis

The case before us concerns a suit by a beneficiary
against a plan fiduciary (whom ERISA typically treats as
a trustee) about the terms of a plan (which ERISA typi

Associates, Inc., 552 U. S. 248, 253, n. 4 (2008); Varity
Corp., 516 U. S., at 496–497. It is the kind of lawsuit that,
before the merger of law and equity, respondents could
have brought only in a court of equity, not a court of law.

The District Court’s affirmative and negative injunc
