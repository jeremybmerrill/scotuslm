Opinion of the Court

asked CIGNA, for example, to “ ‘[d]isclose details’ ” about
the plan, to provide “ ‘individual comparisons,’ ” or to show
“ ‘[a]n actual projection for retirement.’ ” Id., at 342. But
CIGNA did not do so. Instead (in the words of one inter
nal document), it “ ‘focus[ed] on NOT providing employees
before and after samples of the Pension Plan changes.’ ”
Id., at 343.
The District Court concluded, as a matter of law, that
CIGNA’s representations (and omissions) about the plan,
made between November 1997 (when it announced the
plan) and December 1998 (when it put the plan into effect)
violated:
(a) ERISA §204(h), implemented by Treas. Reg.
§1.411(d)–6, 26 CFR §1.411(d)–6 (2000), which (as it ex

administrator also sent a “written notice” that provided
either the text of the amendment or summarized its likely
effects, 29 U. S. C. §1054(h) (2000 ed.) (amended 2001);
Treas. Reg. §1.411(d)–6, Q&A–10, 63 Fed. Reg. 68682
(1998); and
(b) ERISA §§102(a) and 104(b), which require a plan
administrator to provide beneficiaries with summary plan
descriptions and with summaries of material modifica

the average plan participant,” that are “sufficiently accu
rate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such par
ticipants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations
under the plan,” 29 U. S. C. §§1022(a), 1024(b) (2006 ed.
and Supp. III).

The District Court then turned to the remedy. First, the
court agreed with CIGNA that only employees whom
CIGNA’s disclosure failures had harmed could obtain
