SIMILARLY SITUATED

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[May 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that §502(a)(1)(B) of the Em
ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),
29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), does not authorize relief for
misrepresentations in a summary plan description (SPD).
I do not join the Court’s opinion because I see no need and
no justification for saying anything more than that.
Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA states that a plan partici
pant or beneficiary may bring a civil action “to recover
benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce
his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his
rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.”
ERISA defines the word “plan” as “an employee welfare
benefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or a plan
which is both,” 29 U. S. C. §1002(3), and it requires that
a “plan” “be established and maintained pursuant to a
written instrument,” §1102(a)(1). An SPD, in contrast, is
a disclosure meant “to reasonably apprise [plan] partici
pants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations
under the plan.” §1022(a). It would be peculiar for a doc
ument meant to “apprise” participants of their rights
“under the plan” to be itself part of the “plan.” Any doubt
