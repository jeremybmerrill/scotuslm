Opinion of the Court

Second, the District Court’s remedy essentially held
CIGNA to what it had promised, namely, that the new
plan would not take from its employees benefits they had
already accrued. This aspect of the remedy resembles
estoppel, a traditional equitable remedy. See, e.g., E.
Merwin, Principles of Equity and Equity Pleading §910
(H. Merwin ed. 1895); 3 Pomeroy §804. Equitable estoppel
“operates to place the person entitled to its benefit in the
same position he would have been in had the representa
tions been true.” Eaton §62, at 176. And, as Justice Story
long ago pointed out, equitable estoppel “forms a very
essential element in . . . fair dealing, and rebuke of all
fraudulent misrepresentation, which it is the boast of
courts of equity constantly to promote.” 2 Story §1533, at
776.
Third, the District Court injunctions require the plan
administrator to pay to already retired beneficiaries
money owed them under the plan as reformed. But the
fact that this relief takes the form of a money payment
does not remove it from the category of traditionally equi
table relief. Equity courts possessed the power to provide
relief in the form of monetary “compensation” for a loss
resulting from a trustee’s breach of duty, or to prevent the
trustee’s unjust enrichment.

Trusts §95, and Comment a (Tent. Draft No. 5, Mar. 2,
2009) (hereinafter Third Restatement); Eaton §§211–212,
at 440. Indeed, prior to the merger of law and equity this
kind of monetary remedy against a trustee, sometimes
called a “surcharge,” was “exclusively equitable.” Princess
