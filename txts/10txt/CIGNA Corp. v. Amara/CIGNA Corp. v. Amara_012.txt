CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
Opinion of the Court

But the latter advantage does not cancel out the former
disadvantage, for most individuals are risk averse. And
that means that most of CIGNA’s employees would have
preferred that CIGNA, rather than they, bear these risks.
The amounts likely involved are significant. If, in our
example, interest rates between 1998 and 2031 averaged 4
percent rather than the 5 percent we assumed, and if in
2031 annuities paid 6 percent rather than the 7 percent
we assumed, then CIGNA would have had to make an
initial deposit of $35,500 (not $24,000) to assure that
employee the $11,667 annual annuity payment to which
he had already become entitled. Indeed, that $24,000 that
CIGNA would have contributed (leaving aside the life
insurance problem) would have provided enough money to
buy (in 2031) an annuity that assured the employee an
annual payment of only about $8,000 (rather than
$11,667).
We recognize that the employee in our example (like
others) might have continued to work for CIGNA after
January 1, 1998; and he would thereby eventually have
earned a pension that, by the time of his retirement, was
worth far more than $11,667. But that is so because
CIGNA made an additional contribution for each year
worked after January 1, 1998. If interest rates fell (as
they did), it would take the employee several additional
years of work simply to catch up (under the new plan) to
where he had already been (under the old plan) as of
January 1, 1998—a phenomenon known in pension jargon
as “wear away,” see 534 F. Supp. 2d, at 303–304 (referring
to respondents’ requiring 6 to 10 years to catch up).
The District Court found that CIGNA told its employees
nothing about any of these features of the new plan—
which individually and together made clear that CIGNA’s
descriptions of the plan were incomplete and inaccurate.
The District Court also found that CIGNA intentionally
misled its employees. A focus group and many employees
