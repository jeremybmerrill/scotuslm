CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
Opinion of the Court

trict Court resembles forms of traditional equitable relief.
That is because equity chancellors developed a host of
other “distinctively equitable” remedies—remedies that
were “fitted to the nature of the primary right” they were
intended to protect. 1 S. Symons, Pomeroy’s Equity Juris
prudence §108, pp. 139–140 (5th ed. 1941) (hereinafter
Pomeroy). See generally 1 J. Story, Commentaries on
Equity Jurisprudence §692 (12th ed. 1877) (hereinafter
Story). Indeed, a maxim of equity states that “[e]quity
suffers not a right to be without a remedy.” R. Francis,
Maxims of Equity 29 (1st Am. ed. 1823). And the relief
entered here, insofar as it does not consist of injunctive
relief, closely resembles three other traditional equitable
remedies.
First, what the District Court did here may be regarded
as the reformation of the terms of the plan, in order to
remedy the false or misleading information CIGNA pro
vided. The power to reform contracts (as contrasted with
the power to enforce contracts as written) is a traditional
power of an equity court, not a court of law, and was used
to prevent fraud. See Baltzer v. Raleigh & Augusta R. Co.,
115 U. S. 634, 645 (1885) (“[I]t is well settled that equity
would reform the contract, and enforce it, as reformed, if
the mistake or fraud were shown”); Hearne v. Marine Ins.
Co., 20 Wall. 488, 490 (1874) (“The reformation of written
contracts for fraud or mistake is an ordinary head of eq
uity jurisdiction”); Bradford v. Union Bank of Tenn., 13
How. 57, 66 (1852); J. Eaton, Handbook of Equity Juris
prudence §306, p. 618 (1901) (hereinafter Eaton) (courts of
common law could only void or enforce, but not reform, a
contract); 4 Pomeroy §1375, at 1000 (reformation “chiefly
occasioned by fraud or mistake,” which were themselves
concerns of equity courts); 1 Story §§152–154; see also 4
Pomeroy §1375, at 999 (equity often considered refor
mation a “preparatory step” that “establishes the real
contract”).
