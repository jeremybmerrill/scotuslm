CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

the same entity.
Admittedly, reformation might be available if the third
party was an agent of a contracting party and its misrep
resentations could thus be attributed to it under agency
law. But such a relationship has not been alleged and is
unlikely here. An ERISA administrator’s duty to provide
employees with an SPD arises by statute, 29 U. S. C.
§1024(b)(1), and not by reason of its relationship to the
sponsor. The administrator is a legally distinct entity.
Moreover, it is incoherent to think of the administrator as
agent and the sponsor as principal. Were this the case,
and were the administrator contracting with employees as
an agent of the sponsor in producing the SPD, then the
SPD would be part of the plan or would amend it—exactly
what the opinion for the Court rejects in Part II–A, ante,
at 13–15. And, in any event, SPDs may be furnished
months after an employee accepts a pension or benefit
plan. §1024(b)(1). Reformation is meant to effectuate
mutual intent at the time of contracting, and that intent is
not retroactively revised by subsequent misstatements.
Equitable estoppel and surcharge are perhaps better
suited to the facts of this case. CIGNA admits that re
spondents might be able to recover under §502(a)(3) pur
suant to an equitable estoppel theory, but it presumably
makes this concession only because questions of reliance
would be individualized and potentially inappropriate for
class-action treatment. Surcharge (which CIGNA does not
concede and which is not briefed) may encounter the same
problem. The amount for which an administrator may
be surcharged is, as the opinion for the Court notes, the
“actual harm” suffered by an employee, ante, at 22—that
is, harm stemming from reliance on the SPD or the lost
opportunity to contest or react to the switch. Cf. 3 A. Scott
& W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts §205, pp. 237–243 (4th ed.
1988). A remedy relating only to that harm would of course
