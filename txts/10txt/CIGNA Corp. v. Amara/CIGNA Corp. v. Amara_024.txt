CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
Opinion of the Court

bill being filed to charge the defendant, as a trustee, for a
breach of trust”); 1 J. Perry, A Treatise on the Law of
Trusts and Trustees §17, p. 13 (2d ed. 1874) (common-law
attempts “to punish trustees for a breach of trust in dam
ages, . . . w[ere] soon abandoned”).
The surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust
committed by a fiduciary encompassing any violation of a
duty imposed upon that fiduciary. See Second Restate
ment §201; Adams 59; 4 Pomeroy §1079; 2 Story §§1261,
1268. Thus, insofar as an award of make-whole relief is
concerned, the fact that the defendant in this case, unlike
the defendant in Mertens, is analogous to a trustee makes
a critical difference. See 508 U. S., at 262–263. In sum,
contrary to the District Court’s fears, the types of reme
dies the court entered here fall within the scope of the
term “appropriate equitable relief ” in §502(a)(3).
III
Section 502(a)(3) invokes the equitable powers of the
District Court. We cannot know with certainty which
remedy the District Court understood itself to be impos
ing, nor whether the District Court will find it appropriate
to exercise its discretion under §502(a)(3) to impose that
remedy on remand. We need not decide which remedies
are appropriate on the facts of this case in order to resolve
the parties’ dispute as to the appropriate legal standard in
determining whether members of the relevant employee
class were injured.
The relevant substantive provisions of ERISA do not set
forth any particular standard for determining harm. They
simply require the plan administrator to write and to
distribute written notices that are “sufficiently accurate
and comprehensive to reasonably apprise” plan partici
pants and beneficiaries of “their rights and obligations
under the plan.” §102(a); see also §§104(b), 204(h). Nor
can we find a definite standard in the ERISA provision,
