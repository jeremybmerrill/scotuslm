CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
Opinion of the Court

relief. But it did not require each individual member of
the relevant CIGNA employee class to show individual
injury. Rather, it found (1) that the evidence presented
had raised a presumption of “likely harm” suffered by the
members of the relevant employee class, and (2) that
CIGNA, though free to offer contrary evidence in respect
to some or all of those employees, had failed to rebut that
presumption. It concluded that this unrebutted showing
was sufficient to warrant class-applicable relief.
Second, the court noted that §204(h) had been inter
preted by the Second Circuit to permit the invalidation of
plan amendments not preceded by a proper notice, prior to
the 2001 amendment that made this power explicit. 559
F. Supp. 2d, at 207 (citing Frommert v. Conkright, 433
F. 3d 254, 263 (2006)); see 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)(6) (2006
ed.) (entitling participants to benefits “without regard to
[the] amendment” in case of an “egregious failure”). But
the court also thought that granting this relief here would
harm, not help, the injured employees. That is because
the notice failures all concerned the new plan that took
effect in December 1998. The court thought that the
notices in respect to the freezing of old-plan benefits,
effective December 31, 1997, were valid. To strike the new
plan while leaving in effect the frozen old plan would not
help CIGNA’s employees.
The court considered treating the November 1997 notice
as a sham or treating that notice and the later 1998 no
tices as part and parcel of a single set of related events.
But it pointed out that respondents “ha[d] argued none of
these things.” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 208. And it said that
the court would “not make these arguments now on [re
spondents’] behalf.” Ibid.
Third, the court reformed the terms of the new plan’s
guarantee. It erased the portion that assured participants
who retired the greater of “A” (that which they had al
ready earned as of December 31, 1997, under the old plan,
