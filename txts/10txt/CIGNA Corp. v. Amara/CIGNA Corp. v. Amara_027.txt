Opinion of the Court

IV
We have premised our discussion in Part III on the need
for the District Court to revisit its determination of an
appropriate remedy for the violations of ERISA it identi
fied. Whether or not the general principles we have dis
cussed above are properly applicable in this case is for it or
the Court of Appeals to determine in the first instance.
Because the District Court has not determined if an ap
propriate remedy may be imposed under ยง502(a)(3), we
must vacate the judgment below and remand this case for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
