CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA
Opinion of the Court

the plan’s terms as written, adding that the “plan” in
cludes the disclosures that constituted the summary plan
descriptions. In other words, in the view of the Solicitor
General, the terms of the summaries are terms of the
plan.
Even if the District Court had viewed the summaries
as plan “terms” (which it did not, see supra, at 10–11),
however, we cannot agree that the terms of statutorily
required plan summaries (or summaries of plan modifica
tions) necessarily may be enforced (under §502(a)(1)(B)) as
the terms of the plan itself. For one thing, it is difficult to
square the Solicitor General’s reading of the statute with
ERISA §102(a), the provision that obliges plan adminis
trators to furnish summary plan descriptions. The syntax
of that provision, requiring that participants and benefici
aries be advised of their rights and obligations “under the
plan,” suggests that the information about the plan pro
vided by those disclosures is not itself part of the plan.
See 29 U. S. C. §1022(a). Nothing in §502(a)(1)(B) (or, as
far as we can tell, anywhere else) suggests the contrary.
Nor do we find it easy to square the Solicitor General’s
reading with the statute’s division of authority between a
plan’s sponsor and the plan’s administrator. The plan’s
sponsor (e.g., the employer), like a trust’s settlor, creates
the basic terms and conditions of the plan, executes a
written instrument containing those terms and conditions,
and provides in that instrument “a procedure” for making
amendments. §402, 29 U. S. C. §1102. The plan’s admin
istrator, a trustee-like fiduciary, manages the plan, follows
its terms in doing so, and provides participants with the
summary documents that describe the plan (and modifica
tions) in readily understandable form. §§3(21)(A), 101(a),
102, 104, 29 U. S. C. §§1002(21)(A), 1021(a), 1022, 1024
(2006 ed. and Supp. III). Here, the District Court found
that the same entity, CIGNA, filled both roles. See 534
F. Supp. 2d, at 331. But that is not always the case.
