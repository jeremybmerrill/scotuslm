Opinion of the Court

multiplying the otherwise-required deposit by the prob
ability that the employee would live until retirement—a
90 percent probability in the example of our 32-year-old,
supra, at 4–5. And that meant that CIGNA’s initial de
posit in our example—the amount that was supposed to
grow to $120,500 by 2031—would be less than $22,000,
not $24,000 (the number we computed). The employee, of
course, would receive a benefit in return—namely, a form
of life insurance. But at least some employees might have
preferred the retirement benefit and consequently could
reasonably have thought it important to know that the
new plan traded away one-tenth of their already-earned
benefits for a life insurance policy that they might not
have wanted.
Third, the new plan shifted the risk of a fall in interest
rates from CIGNA to its employees. Under the old plan,
CIGNA had to buy a retiring employee an annuity that
paid a specified sum irrespective of whether falling inter
est rates made it more expensive for CIGNA to pay for
that annuity. And falling interest rates also meant that
any sum CIGNA set aside to buy that annuity would grow
more slowly over time, thereby requiring CIGNA to set
aside more money to make any specific sum available at
retirement. Under the new plan CIGNA did not have to
buy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specific
sum. The employee would simply receive whatever sum
his account contained. And falling interest rates meant
that the account’s lump sum would earn less money each
year after the employee retired. Annuities, for example,
would become more expensive (any fixed purchase price
paying for less annual income). At the same time falling
interest meant that the individual account would grow
more slowly over time, leaving the employee with less
money at retirement.
Of course, interest rates might rise instead of fall, leav
ing CIGNA’s employees better off under the new plan.
