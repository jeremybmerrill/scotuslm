Opinion of the Court

We largely agree. Although §2’s saving clause preserves
generally applicable contract defenses, nothing in it sug
gests an intent to preserve state-law rules that stand as
an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA’s objectives.
Cf. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 872
(2000); Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530
U. S. 363, 372–373 (2000). As we have said, a federal
statute’s saving clause “ ‘cannot in reason be construed as
[allowing] a common law right, the continued existence of
which would be absolutely inconsistent with the provisions
of the act. In other words, the act cannot be held to
destroy itself.’ ” American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v.
Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524 U. S. 214, 227–228
(1998) (quoting Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton
Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426, 446 (1907)).
We differ with the Concepcions only in the application of
this analysis to the matter before us. We do not agree that
rules requiring judicially monitored discovery or adher
ence to the Federal Rules of Evidence are “a far cry from
this case.” Brief for Respondents 32. The overarching
purpose of the FAA, evident in the text of §§2, 3, and 4,
is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements
according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined
proceedings. Requiring the availability of classwide arbi
tration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitra
tion and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the FAA.

The “principal purpose” of the FAA is to “ensur[e] that
private arbitration agreements are enforced according to

sion. It says that to its knowledge “we have not . . . applied the Act to
strike down a state statute that treats arbitrations on par with judicial
and administrative proceedings,” post, at 10 (opinion of BREYER, J.), and
that “we should think more than twice before invalidating a state law
that . . . puts agreements to arbitrate and agreements to litigate ‘upon
the same footing’ ” post, at 4–5.
