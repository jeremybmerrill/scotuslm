AT&T MOBILITY LLC, PETITIONER v. VINCENT 

CONCEPCION ET UX. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 27, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
The Federal Arbitration Act says that an arbitration
agreement “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,
save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for
the revocation of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2 (emphasis
added). California law sets forth certain circumstances in
which “class action waivers” in any contract are unen­
forceable. In my view, this rule of state law is consistent
with the federal Act’s language and primary objective. It
does not “stan[d] as an obstacle” to the Act’s “accomplish­
ment and execution.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,
67 (1941). And the Court is wrong to hold that the federal
Act pre-empts the rule of state law.

The California law in question consists of an authorita­
tive state-court interpretation of two provisions of the
California Civil Code. The first provision makes unlawful
all contracts “which have for their object, directly or in­
directly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his
own . . . violation of law.” Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §1668 (West
1985). The second provision authorizes courts to “limit the
application of any unconscionable clause” in a contract so
“as to avoid any unconscionable result.” §1670.5(a).
