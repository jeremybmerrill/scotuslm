AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
BREYER, J., dissenting

sovereigns in our federal system, we have long presumed
that Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law
causes of action”). But federalism is as much a question
of deeds as words. It often takes the form of a concrete
decision by this Court that respects the legitimacy of a
State’s action in an individual case. Here, recognition of
that federalist ideal, embodied in specific language in this
particular statute, should lead us to uphold California’s
law, not to strike it down. We do not honor federalist
principles in their breach.
With respect, I dissent.
