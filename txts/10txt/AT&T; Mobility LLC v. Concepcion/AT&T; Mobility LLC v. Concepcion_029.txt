AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
BREYER, J., dissenting

The specific rule of state law in question consists of the
California Supreme Court’s application of these principles
to hold that “some” (but not “all”) “class action waivers” in
consumer contracts are exculpatory and unconscionable
under California “law.” Discover Bank v. Superior Ct., 36
Cal. 4th 148, 160, 162, 113 P. 3d 1100, 1108, 1110 (2005).
In particular, in Discover Bank the California Supreme
Court stated that, when a class-action waiver
“is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a set­
ting in which disputes between the contracting parties
predictably involve small amounts of damages, and
when it is alleged that the party with the superior
bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliber­
ately cheat large numbers of consumers out of indi­
vidually small sums of money, then . . . the waiver
becomes in practice the exemption of the party ‘from
responsibility for [its] own fraud, or willful injury to
the person or property of another.’ ” Id., at 162–163,
113 P. 3d, at 1110.
In such a circumstance, the “waivers are unconscionable
under California law and should not be enforced.” Id., at
163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110.
The Discover Bank rule does not create a “blanket policy
in California against class action waivers in the consumer
context.” Provencher v. Dell, Inc., 409 F. Supp. 2d 1196,
1201 (CD Cal. 2006). Instead, it represents the “appli­
cation of a more general [unconscionability] principle.”
Gentry v. Superior Ct., 42 Cal. 4th 443, 457, 165 P. 3d 556,
564 (2007). Courts applying California law have enforced
class-action waivers where they satisfy general uncon­
scionability standards. See, e.g., Walnut Producers of Cal.
v. Diamond Foods, Inc., 187 Cal. App. 4th 634, 647–650,
114 Cal. Rptr. 3d 449, 459–462 (2010); Arguelles-Romero
v. Superior Ct., 184 Cal. App. 4th 825, 843–845, 109 Cal.
Rptr. 3d 289, 305–307 (2010); Smith v. Americredit Finan
