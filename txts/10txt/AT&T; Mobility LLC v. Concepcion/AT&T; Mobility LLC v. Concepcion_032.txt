BREYER, J., dissenting

upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the
revocation of any contract,” 9 U. S. C. §2.
Thus, insofar as we seek to implement Congress’ intent,
we should think more than twice before invalidating a
state law that does just what §2 requires, namely, puts
agreements to arbitrate and agreements to litigate “upon
the same footing.”
III
The majority’s contrary view (that Discover Bank stands
as an “obstacle” to the accomplishment of the federal law’s
objective, ante, at 9–18) rests primarily upon its claims
that the Discover Bank rule increases the complexity of
arbitration procedures, thereby discouraging parties from
entering into arbitration agreements, and to that extent
discriminating in practice against arbitration. These
claims are not well founded.
For one thing, a state rule of law that would sometimes
set aside as unconscionable a contract term that forbids
class arbitration is not (as the majority claims) like a rule
that would require “ultimate disposition by a jury” or
“judicially monitored discovery” or use of “the Federal
Rules of Evidence.” Ante, at 8, 9. Unlike the majority’s
examples, class arbitration is consistent with the use of
arbitration. It is a form of arbitration that is well known
in California and followed elsewhere. See, e.g., Keating v.
Superior Ct., 167 Cal. Rptr. 481, 492 (App. 1980) (officially
depublished); American Arbitration Association (AAA),
Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (2003),
http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=21936 (as visited Apr. 25,
2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file); JAMS,
The Resolution Experts, Class Action Procedures (2009).
Indeed, the AAA has told us that it has found class ar­
bitration to be “a fair, balanced, and efficient means of
resolving class disputes.” Brief for AAA as Amicus Curiae
in Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp., O. T.
