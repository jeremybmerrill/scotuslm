AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
BREYER, J., dissenting

hostility to arbitration, for example by refusing to order
specific performance of agreements to arbitrate. See
S. Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924). The Act
sought to eliminate that hostility by placing agreements to
arbitrate “ ‘upon the same footing as other contracts.’ ”
Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 511 (1974)
(quoting H. R. Rep. No. 96, at 2; emphasis added).
Congress was fully aware that arbitration could provide
procedural and cost advantages. The House Report em­
phasized the “appropriate[ness]” of making arbitration
agreements enforceable “at this time when there is so
much agitation against the costliness and delays of litiga­
tion.” Id., at 2. And this Court has acknowledged that
parties may enter into arbitration agreements in order to

(we “reject the suggestion that the overriding goal of the
Arbitration Act was to promote the expeditious resolution
of claims”); id., at 219, 217–218 (“[T]he intent of Congress”
requires us to apply the terms of the Act without regard
to whether the result would be “possibly inefficient”); cf.
id., at 220 (acknowledging that “expedited resolution of
disputes” might lead parties to prefer arbitration). The
relevant Senate Report points to the Act’s basic purpose
when it says that “[t]he purpose of the [Act] is clearly set
forth in section 2,” S. Rep. No. 536, at 2 (emphasis added),
namely, the section that says that an arbitration agree­
ment “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save
