AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
Opinion of the Court

simply “a refinement of the unconscionability analysis
applicable to contracts generally in California.” 584 F. 3d,
at 857. In response to AT&T’s argument that the Con
cepcions’ interpretation of California law discriminated
against arbitration, the Ninth Circuit rejected the conten
tion that “ ‘class proceedings will reduce the efficiency and
expeditiousness of arbitration’ ” and noted that “ ‘Discover
Bank placed arbitration agreements with class action
waivers on the exact same footing as contracts that bar
class action litigation outside the context of arbitration.’ ”
Id., at 858 (quoting Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless
Services, Inc., 498 F. 3d 976, 990 (CA9 2007)).
We granted certiorari, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).

The FAA was enacted in 1925 in response to widespread
judicial hostility to arbitration agreements. See Hall
Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576,
581 (2008). Section 2, the “primary substantive provision
of the Act,” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury
Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983), provides, in relevant
part, as follows:
“A written provision in any maritime transaction or
a contract evidencing a transaction involving com
merce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter
arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be
valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such
grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation
of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2.
We have described this provision as reflecting both a
“liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,” Moses H.
Cone, supra, at 24, and the “fundamental principle that
arbitration is a matter of contract,” Rent-A-Center, West,
Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ____ , ____ (2010) (slip op., at 3).
In line with these principles, courts must place arbitration
