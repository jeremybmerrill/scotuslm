lution of claims,” but to “ensure judicial enforcement of
privately made agreements to arbitrate,” 470 U. S., at 219,
Dean Witter went on to explain: “This is not to say that
Congress was blind to the potential benefit of the legisla
tion for expedited resolution of disputes. Far from it . . . .”
Id., at 220. It then quotes a House Report saying that
“the costliness and delays of litigation . . . can be largely
eliminated by agreements for arbitration.” Ibid. (quoting
H. R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924)). The
concluding paragraph of this part of its discussion begins
as follows:
“We therefore are not persuaded by the argument

objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve
‘streamlined proceedings and expeditious results,’ ” which
objective would be “frustrated” by requiring a dispute to be
heard by an agency first. 552 U. S., at 357–358. That
