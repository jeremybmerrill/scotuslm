AT&T MOBILITY LLC, PETITIONER v. VINCENT 

CONCEPCION ET UX. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 27, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) makes
agreements to arbitrate “valid, irrevocable, and enforce
able, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity
for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2. We
consider whether the FAA prohibits States from condition
ing the enforceability of certain arbitration agreements on
the availability of classwide arbitration procedures.
I
In February 2002, Vincent and Liza Concepcion entered
into an agreement for the sale and servicing of cellular
telephones with AT&T Mobility LCC (AT&T).1 The con
tract provided for arbitration of all disputes between the
parties, but required that claims be brought in the parties’
“individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member
in any purported class or representative proceeding.” App.

1 The

Concepcions’ original contract was with Cingular Wireless.
AT&T acquired Cingular in 2005 and renamed the company AT&T
Mobility in 2007. Laster v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d 849, 852,
