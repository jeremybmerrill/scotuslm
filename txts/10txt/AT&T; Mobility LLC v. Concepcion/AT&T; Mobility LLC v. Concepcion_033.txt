AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
BREYER, J., dissenting

2009, No. 08–1198, p. 25 (hereinafter AAA Amicus Brief).
And unlike the majority’s examples, the Discover Bank
rule imposes equivalent limitations on litigation; hence
it cannot fairly be characterized as a targeted attack on
arbitration.
Where does the majority get its contrary idea—that
individual, rather than class, arbitration is a “fundamen­
tal attribut[e]” of arbitration? Ante, at 9. The majority
does not explain. And it is unlikely to be able to trace its
present view to the history of the arbitration statute itself.

The New Federal Arbitration Law, 12 Va. L. Rev. 265, 281
(1926); AAA, Year Book on Commercial Arbitration in the
United States (1927). This last mentioned feature of the
history—roughly equivalent bargaining power—suggests,
if anything, that California’s statute is consistent with,
and indeed may help to further, the objectives that Con­
gress had in mind.
Regardless, if neither the history nor present practice
suggests that class arbitration is fundamentally incom­
