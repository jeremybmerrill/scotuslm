Opinion of the Court

were not charged for the phones, but they were charged
$30.22 in sales tax based on the phones’ retail value. In
March 2006, the Concepcions filed a complaint against
AT&T in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California. The complaint was later consoli
dated with a putative class action alleging, among other
things, that AT&T had engaged in false advertising and
fraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised as free.
In March 2008, AT&T moved to compel arbitration
under the terms of its contract with the Concepcions. The
Concepcions opposed the motion, contending that the ar
bitration agreement was unconscionable and unlawfully
exculpatory under California law because it disallowed
classwide procedures. The District Court denied AT&T’s
motion. It described AT&T’s arbitration agreement fa
vorably, noting, for example, that the informal dispute
resolution process was “quick, easy to use” and likely to
“promp[t] full or . . . even excess payment to the customer
without the need to arbitrate or litigate”; that the $7,500
premium functioned as “a substantial inducement for the
consumer to pursue the claim in arbitration” if a dispute
was not resolved informally; and that consumers who were
members of a class would likely be worse off. Laster v.
T-Mobile USA, Inc., 2008 WL 5216255, *11–*12 (SD Cal.,
Aug. 11, 2008). Nevertheless, relying on the California
Supreme Court’s decision in Discover Bank v. Superior
Court, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P. 3d 1100 (2005), the court
found that the arbitration provision was unconscionable
because AT&T had not shown that bilateral arbitration
adequately substituted for the deterrent effects of class
actions. Laster, 2008 WL 5216255, *14.
The Ninth Circuit affirmed, also finding the provision
unconscionable under California law as announced in
Discover Bank. Laster v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d
849, 855 (2009). It also held that the Discover Bank rule
was not preempted by the FAA because that rule was
