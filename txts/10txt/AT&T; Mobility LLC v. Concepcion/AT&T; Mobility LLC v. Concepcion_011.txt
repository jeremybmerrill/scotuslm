Opinion of the Court

agreements; but it would presumably apply to contracts
purporting to restrict discovery in litigation as well.
Other examples are easy to imagine. The same argu
ment might apply to a rule classifying as unconscionable
arbitration agreements that fail to abide by the Federal
Rules of Evidence, or that disallow an ultimate disposition
by a jury (perhaps termed “a panel of twelve lay arbitra
tors” to help avoid preemption). Such examples are not
fanciful, since the judicial hostility towards arbitration
that prompted the FAA had manifested itself in “a great
variety” of “devices and formulas” declaring arbitration
against public policy. Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire
Fabrics, Inc., 271 F. 2d 402, 406 (CA2 1959). And al
though these statistics are not definitive, it is worth not
ing that California’s courts have been more likely to hold
contracts to arbitrate unconscionable than other contracts.

The Concepcions suggest that all this is just a parade of
horribles, and no genuine worry. “Rules aimed at destroy
ing arbitration” or “demanding procedures incompatible
with arbitration,” they concede, “would be preempted by
the FAA because they cannot sensibly be reconciled with
Section 2.” Brief for Respondents 32. The “grounds”
available under §2’s saving clause, they admit, “should not
be construed to include a State’s mere preference for pro
cedures that are incompatible with arbitration and ‘would
wholly eviscerate arbitration agreements.’ ” Id., at 33
