AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
THOMAS, J., concurring

agreement, such as by proving fraud or duress. 9 U. S. C.
§§2, 4. Under this reading, I would reverse the Court of
Appeals because a district court cannot follow both the
FAA and the Discover Bank rule, which does not relate to
defects in the making of an agreement.
This reading of the text, however, has not been fully
developed by any party, cf. Brief for Petitioner 41, n. 12,
and could benefit from briefing and argument in an ap
propriate case. Moreover, I think that the Court’s test will
often lead to the same outcome as my textual interpreta
tion and that, when possible, it is important in interpret
ing statutes to give lower courts guidance from a majority
of the Court. See US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535
U. S. 391, 411 (2002) (O’Connor, J., concurring). Therefore,
although I adhere to my views on purposes-and-objectives
pre-emption, see Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, ___ (2009)
(opinion concurring in judgment), I reluctantly join the
Court’s opinion.
I
The FAA generally requires courts to enforce arbitration
agreements as written. Section 2 provides that “[a] writ
ten provision in . . . a contract . . . to settle by arbitration a
controversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . .
shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon
such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation
of any contract.” Significantly, the statute does not paral
lel the words “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable” by refer
encing the grounds as exist for the “invalidation, revoca
tion, or nonenforcement” of any contract. Nor does the
statute use a different word or phrase entirely that might
arguably encompass validity, revocability, and enforce
ability. The use of only “revocation” and the conspicuous
omission of “invalidation” and “nonenforcement” suggest
that the exception does not include all defenses applicable
to any contract but rather some subset of those defenses.
