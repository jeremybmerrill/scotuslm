AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
Opinion of the Court

found this scheme sufficient to provide incentive for the
individual prosecution of meritorious claims that are not
immediately settled, and the Ninth Circuit admitted that
aggrieved customers who filed claims would be “essen
tially guarantee[d]” to be made whole, 584 F. 3d, at 856, n.
9. Indeed, the District Court concluded that the Concep
cions were better off under their arbitration agreement
with AT&T than they would have been as participants in
a class action, which “could take months, if not years,
and which may merely yield an opportunity to submit a
claim for recovery of a small percentage of a few dollars.”

Because it “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment
and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Con
gress,” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941), Cali
fornia’s Discover Bank rule is preempted by the FAA. The
judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
