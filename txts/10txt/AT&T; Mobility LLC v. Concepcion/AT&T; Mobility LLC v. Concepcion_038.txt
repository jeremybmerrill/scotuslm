BREYER, J., dissenting

(2009); (slip op., at 13); Doctor’s Associates, supra, at 687;
Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 281
(1995); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Ex
press, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 483–484 (1989); Perry v. Tho
mas, 482 U. S. 483, 492–493, n. 9 (1987); Mitsubishi
Motors, supra, at 627. And we have recognized that “[t]o
immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial chal­
lenge” on grounds applicable to all other contracts “would
be to elevate it over other forms of contract.” Prima Paint
Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 404,
n. 12 (1967); see also Marchant v. Mead-Morrison Mfg.
Co., 252 N. Y. 284, 299, 169 N. E. 386, 391 (1929) (Car­
dozo, C. J.) (“Courts are not at liberty to shirk the process
of [contractual] construction under the empire of a belief
that arbitration is beneficent any more than they may
shirk it if their belief happens to be the contrary”); Cohen
& Dayton, 12 Va. L. Rev., at 276 (the Act “is no infringe­
ment upon the right of each State to decide for itself what
contracts shall or shall not exist under its laws”).
These cases do not concern the merits and demerits of
class actions; they concern equal treatment of arbitration
contracts and other contracts. Since it is the latter ques­
tion that is at issue here, I am not surprised that the
majority can find no meaningful precedent supporting its
decision.
IV
By using the words “save upon such grounds as exist at
law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,” Con­
gress retained for the States an important role incident to
agreements to arbitrate. 9 U. S. C. §2. Through those
words Congress reiterated a basic federal idea that has
long informed the nature of this Nation’s laws. We have
often expressed this idea in opinions that set forth pre­
sumptions. See, e.g., Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S.
470, 485 (1996) (“[B]ecause the States are independent
