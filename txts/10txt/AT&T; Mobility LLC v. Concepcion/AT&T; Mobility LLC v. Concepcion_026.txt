THOMAS, J., concurring

II
Under this reading, the question here would be whether
California’s Discover Bank rule relates to the making of an
agreement. I think it does not.
In Discover Bank, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P. 3d 1100, the
California Supreme Court held that “class action waivers
are, under certain circumstances, unconscionable as unlaw
fully exculpatory.” Id., at 65, 113 P. 3d, at 1112; see
also id., at 161, 113 P. 3d, at 1108 (“[C]lass action waivers
[may be] substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they
may operate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses
that are contrary to public policy”). The court concluded
that where a class-action waiver is found in an arbitration
agreement in certain consumer contracts of adhesion, such
waivers “should not be enforced.” Id., at 163, 113 P. 3d, at
1110. In practice, the court explained, such agreements
“operate to insulate a party from liability that otherwise
would be imposed under California law.” Id., at 161, 113
P. 3d, at 1108, 1109. The court did not conclude that a
customer would sign such an agreement only if under the
influence of fraud, duress, or delusion.
The court’s analysis and conclusion that the arbitration
agreement was exculpatory reveals that the Discover Bank
rule does not concern the making of the arbitration
agreement. Exculpatory contracts are a paradigmatic ex
ample of contracts that will not be enforced because of
public policy. 15 G. Giesel, Corbin on Contracts §§85.1,
85.17, 85.18 (rev. ed. 2003). Indeed, the court explained
that it would not enforce the agreements because they are
“ ‘against the policy of the law.’ ” 36 Cal. 4th, at 161, 113
P. 3d, at 1108 (quoting Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §1668); see
also 36 Cal. 4th, at 166, 113 P. 3d, at 1112 (“Agreements
to arbitrate may not be used to harbor terms, conditions
and practices that undermine public policy” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Refusal to enforce a contract
for public-policy reasons does not concern whether the
