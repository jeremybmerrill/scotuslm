THOMAS, J., concurring

See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (“It is our
duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of
a statute” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Concededly, the difference between revocability, on the
one hand, and validity and enforceability, on the other, is
not obvious. The statute does not define the terms, and
their ordinary meanings arguably overlap. Indeed, this
Court and others have referred to the concepts of revoca
bility, validity, and enforceability interchangeably. But
this ambiguity alone cannot justify ignoring Congress’
clear decision in §2 to repeat only one of the three
concepts.
To clarify the meaning of §2, it would be natural to look
to other portions of the FAA. Statutory interpretation
focuses on “the language itself, the specific context in
which that language is used, and the broader context of
the statute as a whole.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519
U. S. 337, 341 (1997). “A provision that may seem am
biguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of
the statutory scheme . . . because only one of the permissi
ble meanings produces a substantive effect that is com
patible with the rest of the law.” United Sav. Assn. of Tex.
v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S.
365, 371 (1988).
Examining the broader statutory scheme, §4 can be read
to clarify the scope of §2’s exception to the enforcement of
arbitration agreements. When a party seeks to enforce an
arbitration agreement in federal court, §4 requires that
“upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for
arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in
issue,” the court must order arbitration “in accordance
with the terms of the agreement.”
Reading §§2 and 4 harmoniously, the “grounds . . . for
the revocation” preserved in §2 would mean grounds re
lated to the making of the agreement. This would require
enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate unless a party
