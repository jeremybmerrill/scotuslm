AT&T MOBILITY LLC, PETITIONER v. VINCENT 

CONCEPCION ET UX. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[April 27, 2011] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.
Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) provides
that an arbitration provision “shall be valid, irrevocable,
and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or
in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2.
The question here is whether California’s Discover Bank
rule, see Discover Bank v. Superior Ct., 36 Cal. 4th 148,
113 P. 3d 1100 (2005), is a “groun[d] . . . for the revocation
of any contract.”
It would be absurd to suggest that §2 requires only that
a defense apply to “any contract.” If §2 means anything,
it is that courts cannot refuse to enforce arbitration agree
ments because of a state public policy against arbitration,
even if the policy nominally applies to “any contract.”
There must be some additional limit on the contract de
fenses permitted by §2. Cf. ante, at 17 (opinion of the
Court) (state law may not require procedures that are “not
arbitration as envisioned by the FAA” and “lac[k] its bene
fits”); post, at 5 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (state law may
require only procedures that are “consistent with the use
of arbitration”).
I write separately to explain how I would find that limit
in the FAA’s text. As I would read it, the FAA requires
that an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party
successfully challenges the formation of the arbitration
