AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
Opinion of the Court

rule, we said, would “at the least, hinder speedy resolution
of the controversy.” Id., at 358.5
California’s Discover Bank rule similarly interferes with
arbitration. Although the rule does not require classwide
arbitration, it allows any party to a consumer contract to
demand it ex post. The rule is limited to adhesion con
tracts, Discover Bank, 36 Cal. 4th, at 162–163, 113 P. 3d,
at 1110, but the times in which consumer contracts were
anything other than adhesive are long past.6 Carbajal v.
H&R Block Tax Servs., Inc., 372 F. 3d 903, 906 (CA7
2004); see also Hill v. Gateway 2000, Inc., 105 F. 3d 1147,
1149 (CA7 1997). The rule also requires that damages be
predictably small, and that the consumer allege a scheme
to cheat consumers. Discover Bank, supra, at 162–163,
113 P. 3d, at 1110. The former requirement, however, is

5 Relying

upon nothing more indicative of congressional understand
ing than statements of witnesses in committee hearings and a press
release of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the dissent suggests
that Congress “thought that arbitration would be used primarily where
merchants sought to resolve disputes of fact . . . [and] possessed roughly
equivalent bargaining power.” Post, at 6. Such a limitation appears
nowhere in the text of the FAA and has been explicitly rejected by our
cases. “Relationships between securities dealers and investors, for
example, may involve unequal bargaining power, but we [have] never
theless held . . . that agreements to arbitrate in that context are en
forceable.” Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 33
(1991); see also id., at 32–33 (allowing arbitration of claims arising
under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 despite
allegations of unequal bargaining power between employers and
employees). Of course the dissent’s disquisition on legislative history
fails to note that it contains nothing—not even the testimony of a stray
witness in committee hearings—that contemplates the existence of
class arbitration.
6 Of course States remain free to take steps addressing the concerns
that attend contracts of adhesion—for example, requiring class-action
waiver provisions in adhesive agreements to be highlighted. Such steps
cannot, however, conflict with the FAA or frustrate its purpose to
ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to
their terms.
