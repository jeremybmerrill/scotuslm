AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
BREYER, J., dissenting

“[a]rbitration is poorly suited to . . . higher stakes” lacks
empirical support. Ante, at 16. Indeed, the majority
provides no convincing reason to believe that parties are
unwilling to submit high-stake disputes to arbitration.
And there are numerous counterexamples. Loftus, Rivals
Resolve Dispute Over Drug, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16,
2011, p. B2 (discussing $500 million settlement in dispute
submitted to arbitration); Ziobro, Kraft Seeks Arbitration
In Fight With Starbucks Over Distribution, Wall Street
Journal, Nov. 30, 2010, p. B10 (describing initiation of an
arbitration in which the payout “could be higher” than
$1.5 billion); Markoff, Software Arbitration Ruling Gives
I.B.M. $833 Million From Fujitsu, N. Y. Times, Nov. 30,
1988, p. A1 (describing both companies as “pleased with
the ruling” resolving a licensing dispute).
Further, even though contract defenses, e.g., duress and
unconscionability, slow down the dispute resolution proc­
ess, federal arbitration law normally leaves such matters
to the States. Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561
U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (arbitration agreements
“may be invalidated by ‘generally applicable contract
defenses’ ” (quoting Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto,
517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996))). A provision in a contract of
adhesion (for example, requiring a consumer to decide
very quickly whether to pursue a claim) might increase
the speed and efficiency of arbitrating a dispute, but the
State can forbid it. See, e.g., Hayes v. Oakridge Home, 122
Ohio St. 3d 63, 67, 2009–Ohio–2054, ¶19, 908 N. E. 2d
408, 412 (“Unconscionability is a ground for revocation of
an arbitration agreement”); In re Poly-America, L. P., 262
S. W. 3d 337, 348 (Tex. 2008) (“Unconscionable contracts,
however—whether relating to arbitration or not—are
unenforceable under Texas law”). The Discover Bank rule
amounts to a variation on this theme. California is free to
define unconscionability as it sees fit, and its common law
is of no federal concern so long as the State does not adopt
