BREYER, J., dissenting

cial Servs., Inc., No. 09cv1076, 2009 WL 4895280 (SD Cal.,
Dec. 11, 2009); cf. Provencher, supra, at 1201 (considering
Discover Bank in choice-of-law inquiry). And even when
they fail, the parties remain free to devise other dispute
mechanisms, including informal mechanisms, that, in con­

Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989).

purpose as one of “ensur[ing] judicial enforcement” of
arbitration agreements. Ibid.; see also Marine Transit
Corp. v. Dreyfus, 284 U. S. 263, 274, n. 2 (1932) (“ ‘The
purpose of this bill is to make valid and enforcible agree­
ments for arbitration’ ” (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 96, 68th
Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1924); emphasis added)); 65 Cong. Rec.
1931 (1924) (“It creates no new legislation, grants no new

known, prior to the federal Act, many courts expressed
