AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
THOMAS, J., concurring

successfully asserts a defense concerning the formation of
the agreement to arbitrate, such as fraud, duress, or mu
tual mistake. See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin
Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403–404 (1967) (interpreting §4 to
permit federal courts to adjudicate claims of “fraud in the
inducement of the arbitration clause itself” because such
claims “g[o] to the ‘making’ of the agreement to arbitrate”).
Contract defenses unrelated to the making of the agree
ment—such as public policy—could not be the basis for
declining to enforce an arbitration clause.*
——————
* The interpretation I suggest would be consistent with our prece
dent. Contract formation is based on the consent of the parties, and we
have emphasized that “[a]rbitration under the Act is a matter of con
sent.” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989).
The statement in Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483 (1987), suggesting
that §2 preserves all state-law defenses that “arose to govern issues
concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts
generally,” id., at 493, n. 9, is dicta. This statement is found in a
footnote concerning a claim that the Court “decline[d] to address.” Id.,
at 392, n. 9. Similarly, to the extent that statements in Rent-A-Center,
West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ___, ___ n. 1 (2010) (slip op. at ___, n. 1),
can be read to suggest anything about the scope of state-law defenses
under §2, those statements are dicta, as well. This Court has never
addressed the question whether the state-law “grounds” referred to in
§2 are narrower than those applicable to any contract.
Moreover, every specific contract defense that the Court has ac
knowledged is applicable under §2 relates to contract formation. In
Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996), this
Court said that fraud, duress, and unconscionability “may be applied to
invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening §2.” All three
defenses historically concern the making of an agreement. See Morgan
Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty.,
554 U. S. 527, 547 (2008) (describing fraud and duress as “traditional
grounds for the abrogation of [a] contract” that speak to “unfair dealing
at the contract formation stage”); Hume v. United States, 132 U. S. 406,
411, 414 (1889) (describing an unconscionable contract as one “such as
no man in his senses and not under delusion would make” and suggest
ing that there may be “contracts so extortionate and unconscionable on
their face as to raise the presumption of fraud in their inception”
(internal quotation marks omitted)).
