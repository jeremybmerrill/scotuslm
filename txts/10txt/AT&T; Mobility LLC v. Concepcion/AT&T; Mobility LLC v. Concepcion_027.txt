AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
THOMAS, J., concurring

contract was properly made.
Accordingly, the Discover Bank rule is not a “groun[d]
. . . for the revocation of any contract” as I would read §2 of
the FAA in light of §4. Under this reading, the FAA dic
tates that the arbitration agreement here be enforced and
the Discover Bank rule is pre-empted.
