BREYER, J., dissenting

a special rule that disfavors arbitration. Cf. Doctor’s As
sociates, supra, at 687. See also ante, at 4, n. (THOMAS, J.,
concurring) (suggesting that, under certain circumstances,
California might remain free to apply its unconscionability
doctrine).
Because California applies the same legal principles to
address the unconscionability of class arbitration waivers
as it does to address the unconscionability of any other
contractual provision, the merits of class proceedings
should not factor into our decision. If California had
applied its law of duress to void an arbitration agreement,
would it matter if the procedures in the coerced agreement
were efficient?
Regardless, the majority highlights the disadvantages of
class arbitrations, as it sees them. See ante, at 15–16
(referring to the “greatly increase[d] risks to defendants”;
the “chance of a devastating loss” pressuring defendants
“into settling questionable claims”). But class proceedings
have countervailing advantages. In general agreements
that forbid the consolidation of claims can lead small­
dollar claimants to abandon their claims rather than to
litigate. I suspect that it is true even here, for as the
Court of Appeals recognized, AT&T can avoid the $7,500
payout (the payout that supposedly makes the Concep­
cions’ arbitration worthwhile) simply by paying the claim’s
face value, such that “the maximum gain to a customer for
the hassle of arbitrating a $30.22 dispute is still just
$30.22.” Laster v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d 849,
855, 856 (CA9 2009).
What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent
the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees
stemming from a $30.22 claim? See, e.g., Carnegie v.
Household Int’l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656, 661 (CA7 2004) (“The
realistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million
individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a luna­
tic or a fanatic sues for $30”). In California’s perfectly
