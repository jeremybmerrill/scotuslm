AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION
Opinion of the Court

adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the
contracting parties predictably involve small amounts
of damages, and when it is alleged that the party
with the superior bargaining power has carried out a
scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of con
sumers out of individually small sums of money, then
. . . the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of
the party ‘from responsibility for [its] own fraud, or
willful injury to the person or property of another.’
Under these circumstances, such waivers are uncon
scionable under California law and should not be en
forced.” Id., at 162, 113 P. 3d, at 1110 (quoting Cal.
Civ. Code Ann. §1668).
California courts have frequently applied this rule to find
arbitration agreements unconscionable. See, e.g., Cohen v.
DirecTV, Inc., 142 Cal. App. 4th 1442, 1451–1453, 48 Cal.
Rptr. 3d 813, 819–821 (2006); Klussman v. Cross Country
Bank, 134 Cal. App. 4th 1283, 1297, 36 Cal Rptr. 3d 728,
738–739 (2005); Aral v. EarthLink, Inc., 134 Cal. App. 4th
544, 556–557, 36 Cal. Rptr. 3d 229, 237–239 (2005).

The Concepcions argue that the Discover Bank rule,
given its origins in California’s unconscionability doctrine
and California’s policy against exculpation, is a ground
that “exist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any
contract” under FAA §2. Moreover, they argue that even if
we construe the Discover Bank rule as a prohibition on
collective-action waivers rather than simply an application
of unconscionability, the rule would still be applicable to
all dispute-resolution contracts, since California prohibits
waivers of class litigation as well. See America Online,
Inc. v. Superior Ct., 90 Cal. App. 4th 1, 17–18, 108 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 699, 711–713 (2001).
