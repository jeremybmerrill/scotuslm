agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,
Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,

The final phrase of §2, however, permits arbitration
agreements to be declared unenforceable “upon such
grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of
any contract.” This saving clause permits agreements to
arbitrate to be invalidated by “generally applicable con
tract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionabil
ity,” but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or
that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement
to arbitrate is at issue. Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v.
Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996); see also Perry v.
Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492–493, n. 9 (1987). The question
in this case is whether §2 preempts California’s rule clas
sifying most collective-arbitration waivers in consumer
contracts as unconscionable. We refer to this rule as the
Discover Bank rule.
Under California law, courts may refuse to enforce any
contract found “to have been unconscionable at the time it
was made,” or may “limit the application of any uncon
scionable clause.” Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §1670.5(a) (West
1985). A finding of unconscionability requires “a ‘proce
dural’ and a ‘substantive’ element, the former focusing on
‘oppression’ or ‘surprise’ due to unequal bargaining power,
the latter on ‘overly harsh’ or ‘one-sided’ results.” Armen

In Discover Bank, the California Supreme Court applied
this framework to class-action waivers in arbitration
agreements and held as follows:
“[W]hen the waiver is found in a consumer contract of
