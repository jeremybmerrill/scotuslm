Const., Art. 5, §8(b); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §3041.2 (West
2000). The Governor cited the gravity of Clay’s crime;
his extensive criminal history, which reflected “the culmi
nation of a life of crime,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a;
his failure to participate fully in self-help programs; and his
unrealistic plans for employment and housing after being

was an unreasonable application of California’s ‘some

dence” standard is required by the federal Due Process
Clause. Neither assumption is correct.
As to the first: The habeas statute “unambiguously
