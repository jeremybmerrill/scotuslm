SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
GARY SWARTHOUT, WARDEN v. DAMON COOKE 

MATTHEW CATE, SECRETARY, CALIFORNIA 

DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND 

REHABILITATION v. ELIJAH CLAY 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–333.

Decided January 24, 2011


PER CURIAM.
I
California’s parole statute provides that the Board of
Prison Terms “shall set a release date unless it determines
that . . . consideration of the public safety requires a more
lengthy period of incarceration.” Cal. Penal Code Ann.
§3041(b) (West Supp. 2010). If the Board denies parole,
the prisoner can seek judicial review in a state habeas
petition. The California Supreme Court has explained
that “the standard of review properly is characterized as
whether ‘some evidence’ supports the conclusion that the
inmate is unsuitable for parole because he or she currently
is dangerous.” In re Lawrence, 44 Cal. 4th 1181, 1191, 190
P. 3d 535, 539 (2008). See also In re Shaputis, 44 Cal. 4th
1241, 1253–1254, 190 P. 3d 573, 580 (2008); In re Rosen
krantz, 29 Cal. 4th 616, 625–626, 59 P. 3d 174, 183 (2002).
A
Respondent Damon Cooke was convicted of attempted
first-degree murder in 1991, and a California court sen
tenced him to an indeterminate term of seven years to life
in prison with the possibility of parole. In November 2002,
the board determined that Cooke was not yet suitable for
parole, basing its decision on the “especially cruel and
callous manner” of his commitment offense, App. to Pet.
