SWARTHOUT v. COOKE
Per Curiam

603 F. 3d 546, 559 (CA9 2010) (en banc). Greenholtz did
not inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite
procedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that
the evidence required; a fortiori it is no federal concern
here whether California’s “some evidence” rule of judicial
review (a procedure beyond what the Constitution de
mands) was correctly applied.
It will not do to pronounce California’s “some evidence”
rule to be “a component” of the liberty interest, 606 F. 3d,
at 1213. Such reasoning would subject to federal-court
merits review the application of all state-prescribed proce
dures in cases involving liberty or property interests,
including (of course) those in criminal prosecutions. That
has never been the law. To the contrary, we have long
recognized that “a ‘mere error of state law’ is not a denial
of due process.” Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 121, n. 21
(1982); see also Estelle, 502 U. S., at 67–68. Because the
only federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant
inquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not
whether the state court decided the case correctly.
The Ninth Circuit’s questionable finding that there was
no evidence in the record supporting the parole denials is
irrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as
§2254(a) requires. See id., at 67. The short of the matter
is that the responsibility for assuring that the constitu
tionally adequate procedures governing California’s parole
system are properly applied rests with California courts,
and is no part of the Ninth Circuit’s business.
The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents’
——————
a modicum of evidence’ ” can “ ‘help to prevent arbitrary deprivations.’ ”
29 Cal. 4th, at 658, 59 P. 3d, at 205 (quoting Hill, 472 U. S., at 455). In
any event, the question of which due process requirements apply is one
of federal law, not California law; and neither of these citations comes
close to addressing that question. Any doubt on that score is resolved
by a subsequent footnote stating that the court’s decision is premised
only on state law. 29 Cal. 4th, at 658, n. 12, 59 P. 3d, at 205, n. 12.
