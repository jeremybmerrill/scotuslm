SWARTHOUT v. COOKE
Per Curiam

for Cert. 50a; his failure to participate fully in rehabilita
tive programs; his failure to develop marketable skills;
and three incidents of misconduct while in prison. The
board admitted that Cooke had received a favorable psy
chological report, but it dismissed the report as not credi
ble because it included several inconsistent and erroneous
statements.
Cooke filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in
State Superior Court. The court denied his petition. “The
record indicates,” it said, “that there was some evidence,
including but certainly not limited to the life offense, to
support the board’s denial.” Id., at 42a. Cooke subse
quently filed a habeas petition with the California Court of
Appeal and a petition for direct review by the California
Supreme Court. Both were denied.
In October 2004, Cooke filed a federal habeas petition
pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2254 challenging the parole
board’s determination. The District Court denied his
petition. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Cali
fornia’s parole statute created a liberty interest protected
by the Due Process Clause, and that “California’s ‘some
evidence’ requirement” was a “component” of that feder
ally protected liberty interest. Cooke v. Solis, 606 F. 3d
1206, 1213 (2010). It then concluded that the state court
had made an “unreasonable determination of the facts in
light of the evidence” under §2254(d)(2) by finding any
evidence at all that Cooke would pose a threat to public
safety if released. Id., at 1215.
B
Respondent Elijah Clay was convicted of first-degree
murder in 1978, and a California court sentenced him to
imprisonment for seven years to life with the possibility of
parole. In 2003, the board found Clay suitable for parole,
but the Governor exercised his authority to review the
case and found Clay unsuitable for parole. See Cal.
