parole was denied. 442 U. S., at 16. “The Constitution,”
we held, “does not require more.” Ibid. Cooke and Clay
received at least this amount of process: They were al
lowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the
evidence against them, were afforded access to their re
cords in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why
parole was denied. 606 F. 3d, at 1208–1212; App. to Pet.
for Cert. 69a–80a; Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§3041, 3041.5
(West Supp. 2010).
That should have been the beginning and the end of the
federal habeas courts’ inquiry into whether Cooke and
Clay received due process. Instead, however, the Court of
Appeals reviewed the state courts’ decisions on the merits
and concluded that they had unreasonably determined the
facts in light of the evidence. See 606 F. 3d, at 1213–1216;
384 Fed. Appx., at 545–546. Other Ninth Circuit cases
have done the same. See, e.g., Pearson v. Muntz, 606 F. 3d
606, 611 (2010). No opinion of ours supports converting
California’s “some evidence” rule into a substantive fed
eral requirement. The liberty interest at issue here is the
interest in receiving parole when the California standards
for parole have been met, and the minimum procedures
adequate for due-process protection of that interest are
those set forth in Greenholtz.* See Hayward v. Marshall,

* Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the
revocation of good-time credits should apply, citing In re Rosenkrantz,
29 Cal. 4th 616, 657–658, 59 P. 3d 174, 205 (2002), a California Su
preme Court case that refers to our good-time-credits decision in
Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472
U. S. 445 (1985). But Rosenkrantz did not purport to equate Califor
nia’s parole system with good-time credits. It cites Hill twice. The first
citation merely observes that the court relied upon Hill in an earlier
opinion adopting the “some evidence” test for decisions to revoke parole
that had previously been granted. 29 Cal. 4th, at 656, 59 P. 3d, at 204.
The second citation, which does occur in the part of the opinion discuss
ing the need for “some evidence” review in parole decisions, simply
borrows language from Hill to support the proposition that “ ‘[r]equiring
