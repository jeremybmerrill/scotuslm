SWARTHOUT v. COOKE
Per Curiam

provides that a federal court may issue a writ of habeas
corpus to a state prisoner ‘only on the ground that he is in
custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties
of the United States.’ ” Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U. S. ___,
___ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (quoting 28 U. S. C.
§2254(a)). “We have stated many times that ‘federal
habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.’ ”
Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis
v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780 (1990)).
As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under
that provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether
there exists a liberty or property interest of which a per
son has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the
procedures followed by the State were constitutionally
sufficient. Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490
U. S. 454, 460 (1989). Here, the Ninth Circuit held that
California law creates a liberty interest in parole, see 606
F. 3d, at 1213. While we have no need to review that
holding here, it is a reasonable application of our cases.
See Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U. S. 369, 373–381
(1987); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correc
tional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 12 (1979).
Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, a state
interest created by California law. There is no right under
the Federal Constitution to be conditionally released
before the expiration of a valid sentence, and the States
are under no duty to offer parole to their prisoners. Id., at
7. When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the
Due Process Clause requires fair procedures for its vindi
cation—and federal courts will review the application of
those constitutionally required procedures. In the context
of parole, we have held that the procedures required are
minimal. In Greenholtz, we found that a prisoner subject
to a parole statute similar to California’s received ade
quate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be
heard and was provided a statement of the reasons why
