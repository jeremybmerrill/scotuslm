DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND 

REHABILITATION v. ELIJAH CLAY 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–333.

Decided January 24, 2011 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring.
In Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at
Walpole v. Hill, 472 U. S. 445, 455 (1985), this Court held
that, to comply with due process, revocation of a prisoner’s
good time credits must be supported by “some evidence.”
If California law entitled prisoners to parole upon satisfac
tion of specified criteria, then Hill would be closely in
point. See In re Rosenkrantz, 29 Cal. 4th 616, 657–658, 59
P. 3d 174, 205 (2002). The Ninth Circuit, however, has
determined that for California’s parole system, as for
Nebraska’s, Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and
Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1 (1979), is the controlling
precedent. Hayward v. Marshall, 603 F. 3d 546, 559–561
(2010) (en banc)). Given that determination, I agree that
today’s summary disposition is in order.
