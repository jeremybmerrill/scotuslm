Opinion in Chambers

to Opposition to Application for Stay 2, implicates a
standard even more daunting than that applicable to
a stay of a judgment subject to this Court’s review. See
Ehrlichman v. Sirica, 419 U. S. 1310, 1311–1312 (1974)
(Burger, C. J., in chambers). Gray clearly has not established his entitlement to relief from the District Court’s
scheduling order.
The application for a stay is denied.
It is so ordered.
