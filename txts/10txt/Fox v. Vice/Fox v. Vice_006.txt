Opinion of the Court

that his lawyers had had to participate in five lengthy
depositions and review numerous records to defend
against Fox’s charges. Id., at 199. In support of his fee
request, Vice submitted attorney billing records estimat
ing the time spent on the whole suit, without differentiat
ing between the federal and state-law claims. See Supp.
App. 8–67.
The District Court granted the motion for attorney’s fees
on the ground that Fox’s federal claims were frivolous.
Although the state-law allegations had not been found
frivolous (and indeed remained live), the court did not
require Vice to separate out the work his attorneys had
done on the two sets of claims. Docket No. 2:06–cv–135
(WD La., Sept. 22, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. Ac
cording to the court, such “segregation” was unnecessary
because the “various claims arose out of the same transac

defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same
facts.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Simi

the surviving state-law claims. “[T]hroughout the litiga

frivolous §1983 claims. Id., at 32a–33a. The court there

reasonably incurred in defending the suit—a total of
$48,681. Id., at 34a.
A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. 594 F. 3d 423
(CA5 2010). The majority first rejected Fox’s contention
that all claims in a suit must be frivolous for the defen
dant to recover any fees. That rule, the court explained,
would “ ‘allow plaintiffs to prosecute frivolous claims with
out consequenc[e]’ ” so long as they added a single non
frivolous claim. Id., at 428 (quoting Tutor-Saliba Corp. v.
Hailey, 452 F. 3d 1055, 1064 (CA9 2006)). The Court of
Appeals then turned to the District Court’s decision that
Vice was entitled to fees for all time thus far spent on the
