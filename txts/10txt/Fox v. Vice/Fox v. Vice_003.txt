determine whether the trial court asked and answered this but-for
question, rather than some other. Pp. 7–11.
2. The lower courts used an incorrect standard in awarding fees to
Vice. The District Court’s analysis suggests that Vice’s attorneys
would have done much the same work even if Fox had not brought
his frivolous claims. The charges arose out of Vice’s conduct in the
campaign, and with respect both to the frivolous federal claims and to
the non-frivolous state-law claims, his “defense entailed proof or de
nial of essentially the same facts.” It thus seems likely that Vice’s at
torneys would have, e.g., taken many of the same depositions. Al
though the District Court noted the usefulness of the attorneys’ work
in defending against the state-law claims, it failed to take proper ac
count of the overlap between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims.
Its reasoning—that the close relationship between the federal and
state-law claims supported the award—cannot be squared with the
congressional policy of sparing defendants from the costs only of
frivolous litigation. Nor did the Fifth Circuit uphold the award on
the proper ground. It seemed to think Vice could receive fees for any
work useful to defending against a frivolous claim, even if his lawyers
would have done that work regardless. On this record, the case must
be returned to the lower courts. Pp. 12–13.
