FOX v. VICE
Opinion of the Court

an assortment of dirty tricks to try to force Fox out of the
race. In particular, Vice sent an anonymous letter to Fox
threatening to publish damaging charges against him if he
remained a candidate. Vice also arranged for a third party
to publicly accuse Fox of using racial slurs and then to file
a criminal complaint against Fox repeating those allega
tions. And when prosecutors ignored that faux complaint,
Vice leaked it to the press. Yet all of these machinations
failed; Fox won the election. And Vice got an even greater
comeuppance: He was subsequently convicted of criminal
extortion for his election-related conduct.
Fox, however, chose not to let the matter rest; he filed
this suit in Louisiana state court against Vice and the
town of Vinton, also a respondent here. Fox’s complaint
asserted both state-law claims, including defamation, and
federal civil rights claims under 42 U. S. C. §1983, includ
ing interference with his right to seek public office. Vice
and the town (Vice, for short) removed the case to federal
court on the basis of the §1983 claims.
At the end of discovery in the suit, Vice moved for sum
mary judgment on Fox’s federal claims. Fox conceded that
the claims were “no[t] valid,” App. 169, and the District
Court accordingly dismissed them with prejudice. In the
same ruling, the court declined to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims. Docket
No. 2:06–cv–135 (WD La., Oct. 16, 2007), App. to Pet. for
Cert. 38a–40a. The court instead remanded the now
slimmed-down case to state court for adjudication. In
doing so, the District Court observed that “[a]ny trial
preparation, legal research, and discovery may be used by
the parties in the state court proceedings.” Id., at 40a.
Vice then asked the federal court for an award of attor
ney’s fees under §1988, arguing that Fox’s federal claims
were “baseless and without merit.” App. 198. Vice stated
——————
respondent as Vice.
