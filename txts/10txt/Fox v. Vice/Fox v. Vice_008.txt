Opinion of the Court

certiorari to resolve these questions. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).
II
Our legal system generally requires each party to bear
his own litigation expenses, including attorney’s fees, re
gardless whether he wins or loses. Indeed, this principle
is so firmly entrenched that it is known as the “American
Rule.” See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness
Society, 421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975). But Congress has
authorized courts to deviate from this background rule in
certain types of cases by shifting fees from one party to
another. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562
(1992) (listing federal fee-shifting provisions).
The statute involved here, 42 U. S. C. §1988, allows the
award of “a reasonable attorney’s fee” to “the prevailing
party” in various kinds of civil rights cases, including suits
brought under §1983. Most of our decisions addressing
this provision have concerned the grant of fees to prevail
ing plaintiffs. When a plaintiff succeeds in remedying a
civil rights violation, we have stated, he serves “as
a ‘private attorney general,’ vindicating a policy that
Congress considered of the highest priority.” Newman v.
Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402 (1968)
(per curiam). He therefore “should ordinarily recover an
attorney’s fee” from the defendant—the party whose mis
conduct created the need for legal action. Christiansburg
Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 416 (1978) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Fee shifting in such a case at
once reimburses a plaintiff for “what it cos[t] [him] to
vindicate [civil] rights,” Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U. S. 561,
577–578 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted), and
holds to account “a violator of federal law,” Christians
burg, 434 U. S., at 418.
In Christiansburg, we held that §1988 also authorizes a
fee award to a prevailing defendant, but under a different
standard reflecting the “quite different equitable consid
