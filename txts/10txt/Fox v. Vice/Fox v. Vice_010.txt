Opinion of the Court

Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). But the pres
ence of these unsuccessful claims does not immunize a
defendant against paying for the attorney’s fees that the
plaintiff reasonably incurred in remedying a breach of his
civil rights.
Analogous principles indicate that a defendant may
deserve fees even if not all the plaintiff’s claims were
frivolous. In this context, §1988 serves to relieve a defen
dant of expenses attributable to frivolous charges. The
plaintiff acted wrongly in leveling such allegations, and
the court may shift to him the reasonable costs that those
claims imposed on his adversary. See Christiansburg, 434
U. S., at 420–421. That remains true when the plaintiff’s
suit also includes non-frivolous claims. The defendant, of
course, is not entitled to any fees arising from these non
frivolous charges. See ibid. But the presence of reason
able allegations in a suit does not immunize the plaintiff
against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims
imposed.
Indeed, we have previously said exactly this much. In
Hensley, we noted the possibility that a plaintiff might
prevail on one contention in a suit while also asserting an
unrelated frivolous claim. In this situation, we explained,
a court could properly award fees to both parties—to the
plaintiff, to reflect the fees he incurred in bringing the
meritorious claim; and to the defendant, to compensate for
the fees he paid in defending against the frivolous one.
See 461 U. S., at 435, n. 10. We thus made clear that a
court may reimburse a defendant for costs under §1988
even if a plaintiff’s suit is not wholly frivolous. Fee
shifting to recompense a defendant (as to recompense a
plaintiff) is not all-or-nothing: A defendant need not show
that every claim in a complaint is frivolous to qualify for
fees.
The question then becomes one of allocation: In a law
suit involving a mix of frivolous and non-frivolous claims,
