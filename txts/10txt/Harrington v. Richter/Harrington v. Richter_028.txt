Opinion of the Court

indicated no more than that Johnson was not standing up
when the blood pool formed.
It was also reasonable to find Richter had not estab
lished prejudice given that he offered no evidence directly
challenging other conclusions reached by the prosecution’s
experts. For example, there was no dispute that the blood
sample taken near the doorway pool matched Johnson’s
blood type. The California Supreme Court reasonably
could have concluded that testimony about patterns that
form when blood drips to the floor or about the rate at
which Johnson was bleeding did not undermine the re
sults of chemical tests indicating blood type. Nor did
Richter provide any direct refutation of the State’s expert
testimony describing how blood spatter near the couch
suggested a shooting in the living room and how the blood
patterns on Klein’s face were inconsistent with Richter’s
theory that Klein had been killed in the bedroom doorway
and moved to the couch.
There was, furthermore, sufficient conventional circum
stantial evidence pointing to Richter’s guilt. It included
the gun safe and ammunition found at his home; his flight
from the crime scene; his disposal of the .32-caliber gun
and of Johnson’s pistol; his shifting story concerning his
involvement; the disappearance prior to the arrival of the
law enforcement officers of the .22-caliber weapon that
killed Klein; the improbability of Branscombe’s not being
wounded in the shootout that resulted in a combined four
bullet wounds to Johnson and Klein; and the difficulties
the intoxicated and twice-shot Johnson would have had in
carrying the body of a dying man from bedroom doorway
to living room couch, not to mention the lack of any obvi
ous reason for him to do so. There was ample basis for the
California Supreme Court to think any real possibility of
Richter’s being acquitted was eclipsed by the remaining
evidence pointing to guilt.
