KELLY HARRINGTON, WARDEN, PETITIONER v. 

JOSHUA RICHTER 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 19, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in the judgment.
In failing even to consult blood experts in preparation
for the murder trial, Richter’s counsel, I agree with the
Court of Appeals, “was not functioning as the ‘counsel’
guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.”
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 687 (1984). The
strong force of the prosecution’s case, however, was not
significantly reduced by the affidavits offered in support of
Richter’s habeas petition. I would therefore not rank
counsel’s lapse “so serious as to deprive [Richter] of a fair
trial, a trial whose result is reliable.” Ibid. For that rea
son, I concur in the Court’s judgment.
