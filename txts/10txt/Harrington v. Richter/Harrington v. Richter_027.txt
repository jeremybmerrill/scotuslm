HARRINGTON v. RICHTER
Opinion of the Court

was deficient under Strickland.
B
The Court of Appeals further concluded that Richter had
established prejudice under Strickland given the expert
evidence his attorney could have introduced. It held that
the California Supreme Court would have been unreason
able in concluding otherwise. This too was error.
In assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question is
not whether a court can be certain counsel’s performance
had no effect on the outcome or whether it is possible a
reasonable doubt might have been established if counsel
acted differently. See Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. ___,
___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 13); Strickland, 466
U. S., at 693. Instead, Strickland asks whether it is “rea
sonably likely” the result would have been different. Id.,
at 696. This does not require a showing that counsel’s
actions “more likely than not altered the outcome,” but the
difference between Strickland’s prejudice standard and a
more-probable-than-not standard is slight and matters
“only in the rarest case.” Id., at 693, 697. The likelihood
of a different result must be substantial, not just conceiv
able. Id., at 693.
It would not have been unreasonable for the California
Supreme Court to conclude Richter’s evidence of prejudice
fell short of this standard. His expert serology evidence
established nothing more than a theoretical possibility
that, in addition to blood of Johnson’s type, Klein’s blood
may also have been present in a blood sample taken near
the bedroom doorway pool. At trial, defense counsel ex
tracted a concession along these lines from the prosecu
tion’s expert. The pathology expert’s claim about the size
of the blood pool could be taken to suggest only that the
wounded and hysterical Johnson erred in his assessment
of time or that he bled more profusely than estimated.
And the analysis of the purported blood pattern expert
