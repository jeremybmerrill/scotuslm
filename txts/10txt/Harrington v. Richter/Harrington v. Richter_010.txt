Opinion of the Court

son’s but not Klein’s.
Defense counsel’s cross-examination probed weaknesses
in the testimony of these two witnesses. The detective
who testified on blood patterns acknowledged that his
inferences were imprecise, that it was unlikely Klein had
been lying down on the couch when shot, and that he could
not say the blood in the living room was from either of
Klein’s wounds. Defense counsel elicited from the serolo
gist a concession that she had not tested the bedroom
blood sample for cross-contamination. She said that if the
year-old sample had degraded, it would be difficult to tell
whether blood of Klein’s type was also present in the
sample.
For the defense, Richter’s attorney called seven wit
nesses. Prominent among these was Richter himself.
Richter testified he and Branscombe returned to Johnson’s
house just before the shootings in order to deliver some
thing to one of Johnson’s roommates. By Richter’s ac
count, Branscombe entered the house alone while Richter
waited in the driveway; but after hearing screams and
gunshots, Richter followed inside. There he saw Klein
lying not on the couch but in the bedroom doorway, with
Johnson on the bed and Branscombe standing in the
middle of the room. According to Richter, Branscombe
said he shot at Johnson and Klein after they attacked him.
Other defense witnesses provided some corroboration for
Richter’s story. His former girlfriend, for instance, said
she saw the gun safe at Richter’s house shortly before the
shootings.
The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all charges.
Richter was sentenced to life without parole. On appeal,
his conviction was affirmed. People v. Branscombe, 72
