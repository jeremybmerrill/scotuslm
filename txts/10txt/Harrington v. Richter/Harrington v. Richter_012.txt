Opinion of the Court

order denying relief, Richter filed a petition for habeas
corpus in United States District Court for the Eastern
District of California. He reasserted the claims in his
state petition. The District Court denied his petition, and
a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit affirmed. See Richter v. Hickman, 521 F. 3d 1222
(2008). The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc
and reversed the District Court’s decision. See Richter v.
Hickman, 578 F. 3d 944 (2009).
As a preliminary matter, the Court of Appeals ques
tioned whether 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) was applicable to
Richter’s petition, since the California Supreme Court
issued only a summary denial when it rejected his Strick
land claims; but it determined the California decision was
unreasonable in any event and that Richter was entitled
to relief. The court held Richter’s trial counsel was defi
cient for failing to consult experts on blood evidence in
determining and pursuing a trial strategy and in prepar
ing to rebut expert evidence the prosecution might—and
later did—offer. Four judges dissented from the en banc
decision.
We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).

court proceedings unless the adjudication of the
claim—
