HARRINGTON v. RICHTER
Opinion of the Court

involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab
lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States; or
“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un
reasonable determination of the facts in light of the
evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”
As an initial matter, it is necessary to decide whether
§2254(d) applies when a state court’s order is unaccompa
nied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been
denied.
By its terms §2254(d) bars relitigation of any claim
“adjudicated on the merits” in state court, subject only to
the exceptions in §§2254(d)(1) and (d)(2). There is no text
in the statute requiring a statement of reasons. The
statute refers only to a “decision,” which resulted from an
“adjudication.” As every Court of Appeals to consider the
issue has recognized, determining whether a state court’s
decision resulted from an unreasonable legal or factual
conclusion does not require that there be an opinion from
the state court explaining the state court’s reasoning. See
Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 605–606 (CA3 2002);
Wright v. Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, 278 F. 3d
1245, 1253–1254 (CA11 2002); Sellan v. Kuhlman, 261
F. 3d 303, 311–312 (CA2 2001); Bell v. Jarvis, 236 F. 3d
149, 158–162 (CA4 2000) (en banc); Harris v. Stovall, 212
F. 3d 940, 943, n. 1 (CA6 2000); Aycox v. Lytle, 196 F. 3d
1174, 1177–1178 (CA10 1999); James v. Bowersox, 187
F. 3d 866, 869 (CA8 1999). And as this Court has ob
served, a state court need not cite or even be aware of our
cases under §2254(d). Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8
(2002) (per curiam). Where a state court’s decision is
unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner’s
burden still must be met by showing there was no reason
able basis for the state court to deny relief. This is so
whether or not the state court reveals which of the ele
