Opinion of the Court

strate “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would
have been different. A reasonable probability is a prob
ability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”
Id., at 694. It is not enough “to show that the errors had
some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.”
Id., at 693. Counsel’s errors must be “so serious as to
deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is
reliable.” Id., at 687.
“Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an easy
task.” Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip
op., at 14). An ineffective-assistance claim can function as
a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise
issues not presented at trial, and so the Strickland stan
dard must be applied with scrupulous care, lest “intrusive
post-trial inquiry” threaten the integrity of the very ad
versary process the right to counsel is meant to serve.
Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689–690. Even under de novo
review, the standard for judging counsel’s representation
is a most deferential one. Unlike a later reviewing court,
the attorney observed the relevant proceedings, knew of
materials outside the record, and interacted with the
client, with opposing counsel, and with the judge. It is “all
too tempting” to “second-guess counsel’s assistance after
conviction or adverse sentence.” Id., at 689; see also Bell
v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell,
506 U. S. 364, 372 (1993). The question is whether an
attorney’s representation amounted to incompetence
under “prevailing professional norms,” not whether it
deviated from best practices or most common custom.
Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690.
Establishing that a state court’s application of Strick
land was unreasonable under §2254(d) is all the more
difficult.
The standards created by Strickland and
§2254(d) are both “highly deferential,” id., at 689; Lindh v.
Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and when the two
