HARRINGTON v. RICHTER
Opinion of the Court

petition for certiorari with this Court.
became final.

His conviction

C
Richter later petitioned the California Supreme Court
for a writ of habeas corpus. He asserted a number of
grounds for relief, including ineffective assistance of coun
sel. As relevant here, he claimed his counsel was deficient
for failing to present expert testimony on serology, pathol
ogy, and blood spatter patterns, testimony that, he argued,
would disclose the source of the blood pool in the bedroom
doorway. This, he contended, would bolster his theory
that Johnson had moved Klein to the couch.
He offered affidavits from three types of forensic ex
perts. First, he provided statements from two blood se
rologists who said there was a possibility Klein’s blood was
intermixed with blood of Johnson’s type in the sample
taken from near the pool in the bedroom doorway. Second,
he provided a statement from a pathologist who said the
blood pool was too large to have come from Johnson given
the nature of his wounds and his own account of his ac
tions while waiting for the police. Third, he provided a
statement from an expert in bloodstain analysis who said
the absence of “a large number of satellite droplets” in
photographs of the area around the blood in the bedroom
doorway was inconsistent with the blood pool coming from
Johnson as he stood in the doorway. App. 118. Richter
argued this evidence established the possibility that the
blood in the bedroom doorway came from Klein, not John
son. If that were true, he argued, it would confirm his
account, not Johnson’s. The California Supreme Court
denied Richter’s petition in a one-sentence summary
order. See In re Richter, No. S082167 (Mar. 28, 2001),
App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a. Richter did not seek certiorari
from this Court.
