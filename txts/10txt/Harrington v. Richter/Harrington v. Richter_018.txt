Opinion of the Court

Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664 (1996) (discussing
AEDPA’s “modified res judicata rule” under §2244). It
preserves authority to issue the writ in cases where there
is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the
state court’s decision conflicts with this Court’s prece
dents. It goes no farther. Section 2254(d) reflects the view
that habeas corpus is a “guard against extreme malfunc
tions in the state criminal justice systems,” not a substi
tute for ordinary error correction through appeal. Jackson
v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332, n. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J.,
concurring in judgment). As a condition for obtaining
habeas corpus from a federal court, a state prisoner must
show that the state court’s ruling on the claim being pre
sented in federal court was so lacking in justification that
there was an error well understood and comprehended in
existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded dis
agreement.
The reasons for this approach are familiar. “Federal
habeas review of state convictions frustrates both the
States’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their
good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.”
Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 555–556 (1998)
(internal quotation marks omitted). It “disturbs the
State’s significant interest in repose for concluded litiga
tion, denies society the right to punish some admitted
offenders, and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree
matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.”
Reed, 489 U. S., at 282 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).
Section 2254(d) is part of the basic structure of federal
habeas jurisdiction, designed to confirm that state courts
are the principal forum for asserting constitutional chal
lenges to state convictions. Under the exhaustion re
quirement, a habeas petitioner challenging a state convic
tion must first attempt to present his claim in state court.
28 U. S. C. §2254(b). If the state court rejects the claim on
procedural grounds, the claim is barred in federal court
