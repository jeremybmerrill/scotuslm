HARRINGTON v. RICHTER
Opinion of the Court

unless one of the exceptions to the doctrine of Wainwright
v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 82–84 (1977), applies. And if the
state court denies the claim on the merits, the claim is
barred in federal court unless one of the exceptions to
§2254(d) set out in §§2254(d)(1) and (2) applies. Section
2254(d) thus complements the exhaustion requirement
and the doctrine of procedural bar to ensure that state
proceedings are the central process, not just a preliminary
step for a later federal habeas proceeding, see id., at 90.
Here, however, the Court of Appeals gave §2254(d) no
operation or function in its reasoning. Its analysis illus
trates a lack of deference to the state court’s determina
tion and an improper intervention in state criminal proc
esses, contrary to the purpose and mandate of AEDPA and
to the now well-settled meaning and function of habeas
corpus in the federal system.
IV
The conclusion of the Court of Appeals that Richter
demonstrated an unreasonable application by the state
court of the Strickland standard now must be discussed.
To have been entitled to relief from the California Su
preme Court, Richter had to show both that his counsel
provided deficient assistance and that there was prejudice
as a result.
To establish deficient performance, a person challenging
a conviction must show that “counsel’s representation fell
below an objective standard of reasonableness.” 466 U. S.,
at 688. A court considering a claim of ineffective assis
tance must apply a “strong presumption” that counsel’s
representation was within the “wide range” of reasonable
professional assistance. Id., at 689. The challenger’s
burden is to show “that counsel made errors so serious
that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaran
teed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.” Id., at 687.
With respect to prejudice, a challenger must demon
