Opinion of the Court

Evidence at the scene corroborated Johnson’s account.
Investigators found spent shell casings in the bedroom
(where Johnson said he had been shot) and in the living
room (where Johnson indicated Klein had been shot). In
the living room there were two casings, a .32 caliber and a
.22 caliber. One of the bullets recovered from Klein’s body
was a .32 and the other was a .22. In the bedroom there
were two more casings, both .32 caliber. In addition detec
tives found blood spatter near the living room couch and
bloodstains in the bedroom. Pools of blood had collected in
the kitchen and the doorway to Johnson’s bedroom. Inves
tigators took only a few blood samples from the crime
scene. One was from a blood splash on the wall near
the bedroom doorway, but no sample was taken from the
doorway blood pool itself.
Investigators searched Richter’s residence and found
Johnson’s gun safe, two boxes of .22-caliber ammunition,
and a gun magazine loaded with cartridges of the same
brand and type as the boxes. A ballistics expert later
concluded the .22-caliber bullet that struck Klein and
the .22-caliber shell found in the living room matched the
ammunition found in Richter’s home and bore markings
consistent with the model of gun for which the magazine
was designed.
Richter and Branscombe were arrested. At first Richter
denied involvement. He would later admit taking John
son’s pistol and disposing of it and of the .32-caliber
weapon Branscombe used to shoot Johnson and Klein.
Richter’s counsel produced Johnson’s missing pistol, but
neither of the guns used to shoot Johnson and Klein was
found.
B
Branscombe and Richter were tried together on charges
of murder, attempted murder, burglary, and robbery.
Only Richter’s case is presented here.
