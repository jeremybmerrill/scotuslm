HARRINGTON v. RICHTER
Opinion of the Court

dulge “post hoc rationalization” for counsel’s decisionmak
ing that contradicts the available evidence of counsel’s
actions, Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 526–527, neither may they
insist counsel confirm every aspect of the strategic basis

supra, at 7. Representation is constitutionally ineffective
only if it “so undermined the proper functioning of the
adversarial process” that the defendant was denied a fair
trial. Strickland, supra, at 686. Just as there is no expec
tation that competent counsel will be a flawless strategist
or tactician, an attorney may not be faulted for a reason
