HARRINGTON v. RICHTER
Opinion of the Court

*
*
*
The California Supreme Court’s decision on the merits
of Richter’s Strickland claim required more deference than
it received. Richter was not entitled to the relief ordered
by the Court of Appeals. The judgment is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
