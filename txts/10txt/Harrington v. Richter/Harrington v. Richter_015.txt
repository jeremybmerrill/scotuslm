HARRINGTON v. RICHTER
Opinion of the Court

pearing to rest on federal grounds was decided on another
basis).
The presumption may be overcome when there is reason
to think some other explanation for the state court’s deci
sion is more likely. See, e.g., Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501
U. S. 797, 803 (1991). Richter, however, does not make
that showing. He mentions the theoretical possibility that
the members of the California Supreme Court may not
have agreed on the reasons for denying his petition. It is
pure speculation, however, to suppose that happened in
this case. And Richter’s assertion that the mere possibil
ity of a lack of agreement prevents any attribution of
reasons to the state court’s decision is foreclosed by prece

As has been noted before, the California courts or Legis
lature can alter the State’s practices or elaborate more
fully on their import. See Evans v. Chavis, 546 U. S. 189,
197, 199 (2006). But that has not occurred here. This
Court now holds and reconfirms that §2254(d) does not
require a state court to give reasons before its decision can
be deemed to have been “adjudicated on the merits.”
Richter has failed to show that the California Supreme
Court’s decision did not involve a determination of the
merits of his claim. Section 2254(d) applies to his petition.

Federal habeas relief may not be granted for claims
subject to §2254(d) unless it is shown that the earlier state
court’s decision “was contrary to” federal law then clearly
established in the holdings of this Court, §2254(d)(1);
Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000); or that
it “involved an unreasonable application of” such law,
§2254(d)(1); or that it “was based on an unreasonable
determination of the facts” in light of the record before the
state court, §2254(d)(2).
The Court of Appeals relied on the second of these ex
