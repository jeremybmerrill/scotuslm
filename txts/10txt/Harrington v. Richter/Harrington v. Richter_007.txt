HARRINGTON v. RICHTER
Opinion of the Court

vision applies when state-court relief is denied without
an accompanying statement of reasons. If it does, the
question is whether the Court of Appeals adhered to the
statute’s terms, in this case as it relates to ineffective
assistance claims judged by the standard set forth in
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). A second
case decided today, Premo v. Moore, post, p. ___, presents
similar issues. Here, as in that case, it is necessary to
reverse the Court of Appeals for failing to accord required
deference to the decision of a state court.
I
It is necessary to begin by discussing the details of a
crime committed more than a decade and a half ago.
A
Sometime after midnight on December 20, 1994, sher
iff’s deputies in Sacramento County, California, arrived at
the home of a drug dealer named Joshua Johnson. Hours
before, Johnson had been smoking marijuana in the com
pany of Richter and two other men, Christian Branscombe
and Patrick Klein. When the deputies arrived, however,
they found only Johnson and Klein. Johnson was hysteri
cal and covered in blood. Klein was lying on a couch in
Johnson’s living room, unconscious and bleeding. Klein
and Johnson each had been shot twice. Johnson recov
ered; Klein died of his wounds.
Johnson gave investigators this account: After falling
asleep, he awoke to find Richter and Branscombe in his
bedroom, at which point Branscombe shot him. Johnson
heard more gunfire in the living room and the sound of his
assailants leaving. He got up, found Klein bleeding on the
living room couch, and called 911. A gun safe, a pistol,
and $6,000 cash, all of which had been in the bedroom,
were missing.
