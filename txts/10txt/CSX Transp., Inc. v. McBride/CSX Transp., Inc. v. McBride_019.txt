law formulations include, inter alia, the “immediate” or
“nearest” antecedent test; the “efficient, producing cause”
test; the “substantial factor” test; and the “probable,” or
“natural and probable,” or “foreseeable” consequence test.

Notably, CSX itself did not settle on a uniform definition
of the term “proximate cause” in this litigation, nor does
the dissent. In the District Court, CSX requested a jury
instruction defining “proximate cause” to mean “any cause
which, in natural or probable sequence, produced the
injury complained of.” App. 32a. On appeal, “CSX main­
tain[ed] that the correct definition . . . is a ‘direct relation
between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct
alleged.’ ” 598 F. 3d, at 393, n. 3. Before this Court, CSX
called for “a demonstration that the plaintiff’s injury
resulted from the wrongful conduct in a way that was
natural, probable, and foreseeable.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 9–10.
Lay triers, studies show, are scarcely aided by charges
so phrased. See Steele & Thornburg, Jury Instructions: A
Persistent Failure to Communicate, 67 N. C. L. Rev. 77,
88–92, 110 (1988) (85% of actual and potential jurors were
unable to understand a pattern proximate cause instruc­
tion similar to the one requested by CSX); Charrow &

L. Rev. 1306, 1353 (1979) (nearly one quarter of subjects
misunderstood proximate cause to mean “approximate
cause” or “estimated cause”). In light of the potential of
“proximate cause” instructions to leave jurors at sea, it is
not surprising that the drafters of the Restatement (Third)
of Torts avoided the term altogether. See 1 Restatement
(Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional
Harm §29 (2005) (confining liability to “harms that result
from the risks that made the actor’s conduct tortious”); id.,
