CSX nonetheless insists that proximate causation, as
captured in the charge and definitions CSX requested, is a
concept fundamental to actions sounding in negligence.
The Rogers “any part” instruction opens the door to unlim­
ited liability, CSX worries, inviting juries to impose liabil­
ity on the basis of “but for” causation. The dissent shares
these fears. Post, at 5–6, 15–16. But a half century’s
experience with Rogers gives us little cause for concern:
CSX’s briefs did not identify even one trial in which the
instruction generated an absurd or untoward award.9 Nor
has the dissent managed to uncover such a case. Post, at
13–14 (citing no actual case but conjuring up images of
falling pianos and spilled coffee).
While some courts have said that Rogers eliminated the
concept of proximate cause in FELA cases,10 we think it
“more accurate . . . to recognize that Rogers describes the
test for proximate causation applicable in FELA suits.”

9 Pressed on this point at oral argument, CSX directed us to two cases
cited by its amicus. In Richards v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 330 F. 3d
428, 431, 437 (CA6 2003), a defective brake malfunctioned en route,
and the employee was injured while inspecting underneath the train to
locate the problem; the Sixth Circuit sent the case to a jury. In Norfolk
Southern R. Co. v. Schumpert, 270 Ga. App. 782, 783–786, 608 S. E. 2d
236, 238–239 (2004), the employee was injured while replacing a
coupling device that fell to the ground because of a negligently absent
pin; the court upheld a jury award. In our view, the causal link in
these cases is hardly farfetched; in fact, in both, the lower courts
observed that the evidence did not show mere “but for” causation. See
Richards, 330 F. 3d, at 437, and n. 5; Schumpert, 270 Ga. App., at 784,
608 S. E. 2d, at 239.
10 See, e.g., Summers, 132 F. 3d, at 606; Oglesby v. Southern Pacific
Transp. Co., 6 F. 3d 603, 609 (CA9 1993).
