Opinion of the Court

part from the [railroad’s] negligence,” and Congress’ “hu­
manitarian” and “remedial goal[s],” we have recognized
that, in comparison to tort litigation at common law, “a
relaxed standard of causation applies under FELA.”
Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 542–543. In our 1957 decision in
Rogers, we described that relaxed standard as follows:
“Under [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply
whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion
that employer negligence played any part, even the
slightest, in producing the injury or death for which
damages are sought.” 352 U. S., at 506.
As the Seventh Circuit emphasized, the instruction the
District Court gave in this case, permitting a verdict for
McBride if “[railroad] negligence played a part—no matter
how small—in bringing about the injury,” tracked the
language of Rogers. If Rogers prescribes the definition of
causation applicable under FELA, that instruction was
plainly proper. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,
491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (“Considerations of stare decisis
have special force in the area of statutory interpretation
. . . .”). While CSX does not ask us to disturb Rogers, the
railroad contends that lower courts have overread that
opinion. In CSX’s view, shared by the dissent, post, at 9–
10, Rogers was a narrowly focused decision that did not
touch, concern, much less displace common-law formula­
tions of “proximate cause.”
Understanding this argument requires some back­
ground. The term “proximate cause” is shorthand for a
concept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should
give rise to legal liability. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,
R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of
Torts §42, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and
Keeton). “What we . . . mean by the word ‘proximate,’ ” one
noted jurist has explained, is simply this: “[B]ecause of
convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice,
