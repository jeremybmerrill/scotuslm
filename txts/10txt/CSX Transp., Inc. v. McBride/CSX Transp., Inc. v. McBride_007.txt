Opinion of the Court

quested, the Seventh Circuit’s pattern instruction for
FELA cases, which reads:
“Defendant ‘caused or contributed to’ Plaintiff’s injury
if Defendant’s negligence played a part—no matter
how small—in bringing about the injury. The mere
fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean
that the injury was caused by negligence.” Id., at 31a.
For this instruction, the Seventh Circuit relied upon this
Court’s decision in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352
U. S. 500 (1957). The jury returned a verdict for McBride,
setting total damages at $275,000, but reducing that
amount by one-third, the percentage the jury attributed to
plaintiff’s negligence. App. 29a.
CSX appealed to the Seventh Circuit, renewing its ob­
jection to the failure to instruct on “proximate cause.”
Before the appellate court, CSX “maintain[ed] that the
correct definition of proximate causation is a ‘direct rela­
tion between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct
alleged.’ ” 598 F. 3d 388, 393, n. 3 (2010) (quoting Holmes
v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S.
258, 268 (1992)). A properly instructed jury, CSX con­
tended, might have found that the chain of causation was
too indirect, or that the engine configuration was unsafe
because of its propensity to cause crashes during switch­
ing, not because of any risk to an engineer’s hands. Brief
for Defendant-Appellant in No. 08–3557 (CA7), pp. 49–52.
The Court of Appeals approved the District Court’s
instruction and affirmed the judgment entered on the
jury’s verdict. Rogers had “relaxed the proximate cause
requirement” in FELA cases, the Seventh Circuit con­
cluded, a view of Rogers “echoed by every other court of
appeals.” 598 F. 3d, at 399. While acknowledging that a
handful of state courts “still appl[ied] traditional formula­
tions of proximate cause in FELA cases,” id., at 404, n. 7,
the Seventh Circuit said it could hardly declare erroneous
