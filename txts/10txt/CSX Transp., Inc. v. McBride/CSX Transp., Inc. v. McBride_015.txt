Opinion of the Court

In reliance on Rogers, every Court of Appeals that re­
views judgments in FELA cases has approved jury in­
structions on causation identical or substantively equiva­
lent to the Seventh Circuit’s instruction.5 Each appellate
court has rejected common-law formulations of proximate
cause of the kind CSX requested in this case. See supra,
at 2–3. The current model federal instruction, recognizing
that the “FELA causation standard is distinct from the
usual proximate cause standard,” reads:
“The fourth element [of a FELA action] is whether an
injury to the plaintiff resulted in whole or part from
the negligence of the railroad or its employees or
agents. In other words, did such negligence play any
——————
475 (1877). But other pre-Rogers FELA decisions invoked no common­
law formulations. See, e.g., Union Pacific R. Co. v. Huxoll, 245 U. S.
535, 537 (1918) (approving instruction asking whether negligence “con­
tribute[d] ‘in whole or in part’ to cause the death”); Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 524 (1949) (rejecting use of common-law
“dialectical subtleties” concerning the term “proximate cause,” and ap­
proving use of “simple and direct” statutory language). We rely on
Rogers not because “time begins in 1957,” post, at 7, but because Rogers
stated a clear instruction, comprehensible by juries: Did the railroad’s
“negligence pla[y] any part, even the slightest, in producing [the plain­
tiff ’s] injury”? 352 U. S., at 506. In so instructing, Rogers replaced the
array of formulations then prevalent. We have repeated the Rogers
instruction in subsequent opinions, and lower courts have employed it
for over 50 years. To unsettle the law as the dissent urges would show
scant respect for the principle of stare decisis.
