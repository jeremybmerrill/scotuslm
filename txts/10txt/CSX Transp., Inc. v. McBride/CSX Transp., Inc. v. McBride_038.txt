ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

says there is no difference, see ante, at 9, n. 3, but I sus­
pect lawyers litigating FELA cases will prefer one instruc­
tion over the other, depending on whether they represent
the employer or the employee. In any event, if the Court’s
test—whichever version—provides answers to these hypo­
theticals, the Court keeps them to itself.
Proximate cause supplies the vocabulary for answering
such questions. It is useful to ask whether the injury that
resulted was within the scope of the risk created by the
defendant’s negligent act; whether the injury was a natu­
ral or probable consequence of the negligence; whether
there was a superseding or intervening cause; whether the
negligence was anything more than an antecedent event
without which the harm would not have occurred.
The cases do not provide a mechanical or uniform test
and have been criticized for that. But they do “furnish
illustrations of situations which judicious men upon care­
ful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the
line or the other.” Exxon, 517 U. S., at 839 (internal quo­
tation marks omitted).
The Court forswears all these inquiries and—with
them—an accumulated common law history that might
provide guidance for courts and juries faced with causa­
tion questions. See ante, at 1 (FELA “does not incorporate
‘proximate cause’ standards developed in nonstatutory
common-law tort actions”); ante, at 18 (“it is not error in a
FELA case to refuse a charge embracing stock proximate
cause terminology”). It is not necessary to accept every
verbal formulation of proximate cause ever articulated to
recognize that these standards provide useful guidance—
and that juries should receive some instruction—on the
type of link required between a railroad’s negligence and
an employee’s injury.
