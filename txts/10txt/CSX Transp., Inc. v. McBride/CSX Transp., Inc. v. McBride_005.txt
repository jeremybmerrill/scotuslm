CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC., PETITIONER v. 

ROBERT MCBRIDE 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 23, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court,
except as to Part III–A.*
This case concerns the standard of causation applicable
in cases arising under the Federal Employers’ Liability
Act (FELA), 45 U. S. C. §51 et seq. FELA renders rail­
roads liable for employees’ injuries or deaths “resulting in
whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.” §51. In accord
with the text and purpose of the Act, this Court’s decision
in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500 (1957),
and the uniform view of federal appellate courts, we con­
clude that the Act does not incorporate “proximate cause”
standards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort
actions. The charge proper in FELA cases, we hold, sim­
ply tracks the language Congress employed, informing
juries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a
plaintiff employee’s injury if the railroad’s negligence
played any part in bringing about the injury.
