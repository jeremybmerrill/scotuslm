CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE
Opinion of the Court

an instruction that “simply paraphrase[d] the Supreme
Court’s own words in Rogers,” id., at 406.
We granted certiorari to decide whether the causation
instruction endorsed by the Seventh Circuit is proper in
FELA cases. 562 U. S. ___ (2010). That instruction does
not include the term “proximate cause,” but does tell the
jury defendant’s negligence must “pla[y] a part—no matter
how small—in bringing about the [plaintiff’s] injury.” App.

The railroad business was exceptionally hazardous at
the dawn of the twentieth century. As we have recounted,
“the physical dangers of railroading . . . resulted in the
death or maiming of thousands of workers every year,”

able in damages to any person suffering injury while
he is employed by such carrier . . . for such injury or
death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence
of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such car­
rier . . . .” 45 U. S. C. §51 (emphasis added).
Liability under FELA is limited in these key respects:
Railroads are liable only to their employees, and only for
injuries sustained in the course of employment. FELA’s
language on causation, however, “is as broad as could be
framed.” Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 181 (1949).
Given the breadth of the phrase “resulting in whole or in
