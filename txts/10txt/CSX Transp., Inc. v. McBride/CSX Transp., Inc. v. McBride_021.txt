Opinion of the Court

what is reasonably foreseeable under like circumstances.”
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, “[i]f a per­
son has no reasonable ground to anticipate that a par­
ticular condition . . . would or might result in a mishap
and injury, then the party is not required to do anything
to correct [the] condition.” Id., at 118, n. 7 (internal quota­
tion marks omitted).12 If negligence is proved, however,
and is shown to have “played any part, even the slightest,
in producing the injury,” Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506 (empha­
sis added),13 then the carrier is answerable in damages
even if “the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it
occurred” was not “[p]robable” or “foreseeable.” Gallick,
372 U. S., at 120–121, and n. 8 (internal quotation marks
omitted); see 4 F. Harper, F. James, & O. Gray, Law of
Torts §20.5(6), p. 203 (3d ed. 2007); 5 Sand 89–21.
Properly instructed on negligence and causation, and
told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their
“common sense” in reviewing the evidence, see Tr. 205
(Aug. 19, 2008), juries would have no warrant to award
damages in far out “but for” scenarios. Indeed, judges
would have no warrant to submit such cases to the jury.
See Nicholson v. Erie R. Co., 253 F. 2d 939, 940–941 (CA2
1958) (alleged negligence was failure to provide lavatory
for female employee; employee was injured by a suitcase
while looking for a lavatory in a passenger car; applying
Rogers, appellate court affirmed lower court’s dismissal for
lack of causation); Moody v. Boston and Maine Corp., 921

railroad’s violation of a safety statute, however, is negligence per
se. See Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U. S. 426, 438 (1958).
13 The dissent protests that we would require only a showing that
“defendant was negligent in the first place.” Post, at 13. But under
Rogers and the pattern instructions based on Rogers, the jury must find
that defendant’s negligence in fact “played a part—no matter how
small—in bringing about the injury.” See supra, at 2–3, 11–12 (Sev­
enth Circuit pattern instruction and model federal instructions).
