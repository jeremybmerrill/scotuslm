CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

to’ a railroad worker’s injury ‘if [the railroad’s] negligence
played a part—no matter how small—in bringing about
the injury’ ”). If that is proved, “then the carrier is an­
swerable in damages even if the extent of the [injury] or
the manner in which it occurred was not ‘[p]robable’ or
‘foreseeable.’ ” Ante, at 17 (some internal quotation marks
omitted). There is nothing in that language that requires
anything other than “but for” cause. The terms “even the
slightest” and “no matter how small” make clear to juries
that even the faintest whisper of “but for” causation will
do.
At oral argument, counsel for McBride explained that
the correct standard for recovery under FELA is “but-for
plus a relaxed form of legal cause.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.
There is no “plus” in the rule the Court announces today.
In this very case defense counsel was free to argue “but
for” cause pure and simple to the jury. In closing, counsel
informed the jury: “What we also have to show is defen­
dant’s negligence caused or contributed to [McBride’s]
injury. It never would have happened but for [CSX] giving
him that train.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a (emphasis
added).
At certain points in its opinion, the Court acknowledges
that “[i]njuries have countless causes,” not all of which
“should give rise to legal liability.” Ante, at 5. But the
causation test the Court embraces contains no limit on
causation at all.
II
This Court, from the time of FELA’s enactment, under­
stood FELA to require plaintiffs to prove that an em­
ployer’s negligence “is a proximate cause of the accident,”
Davis v. Wolfe, 263 U. S. 239, 243 (1923). See, e.g., ibid.
(“The rule clearly deducible from [prior] cases is that . . .
an employee cannot recover . . . if the [employer’s] failure
. . . is not a proximate cause of the accident . . . but merely
