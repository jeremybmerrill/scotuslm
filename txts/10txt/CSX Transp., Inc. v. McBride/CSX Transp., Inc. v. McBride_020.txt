CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE
Opinion of the Court

Comment b.
Congress, it is true, has written the words “proximate
cause” into a number of statutes.11 But when the legisla­
tive text uses less legalistic language, e.g., “caused by,”
“occasioned by,” “in consequence of,” or, as in FELA,

Actions of Tort (Continued), supra, at 235, misapprehends
how foreseeability figures in FELA cases.
“[R]easonable foreseeability of harm,” we clarified in

therefore, must be asked, initially: Did the carrier “fai[l] to
observe that degree of care which people of ordinary pru­
dence and sagacity would use under the same or similar
circumstances[?]” Id., at 118. In that regard, the jury
may be told that “[the railroad’s] duties are measured by

States not liable to injured employee whose “intoxication . . . is the
proximate cause of the injury”); Act of Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 105, §306, 40
