CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

ing the injury—is no limit at all. It is simply “but for”
causation. Nothing in FELA itself, or our decision in
Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500 (1957),
supports such a boundless theory of liability.
I respectfully dissent.

“Unlike a typical workers’ compensation scheme, which
provides relief without regard to fault, . . . FELA provides
a statutory cause of action sounding in negligence.” Nor
folk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 165 (2007).
When Congress creates such a federal tort, “we start from
the premise” that Congress “adopts the background of
general tort law.” Staub v. Proctor Hospital, 562 U. S. ___,
___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). With respect to FELA in par­
ticular, we have explained that “[a]bsent express language

Recovery for negligence has always required a showing
of proximate cause. “ ‘In a philosophical sense, the con­
sequences of an act go forward to eternity.’ ” Holmes v.
Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258,
266, n. 10 (1992) (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton,
& D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §41, p.
264 (5th ed. 1984)). Law, however, is not philosophy, and
the concept of proximate cause developed at common law
in response to the perceived need to distinguish “but for”
cause from those more direct causes of injury that can
form the basis for liability at law.
The plurality breaks no new ground in criticizing the
variety of formulations of the concept of proximate cause,
ante, at 14–15; courts, commentators, and first-year law
students have been doing that for generations. See Exxon,
supra, at 838. But it is often easier to disparage the prod­
uct of centuries of common law than to devise a plausible
