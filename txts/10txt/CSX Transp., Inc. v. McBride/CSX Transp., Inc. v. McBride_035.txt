CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

employee must establish that the defendant employer
acted negligently and that such negligence contributed

Snipes v. Chicago, Central, & Pacific R. Co., 484 N. W. 2d
162, 164–165 (Iowa 1992) (stating that “[r]ecovery under
the FELA requires an injured employee to prove that the
defendant employer was negligent and that the negligence
proximately caused, in whole or in part, the accident,”
while noting that Rogers’s “threshold for recovery” is
“low”); Marazzato v. Burlington No. R. Co., 249 Mont.
487, 491, 817 P. 2d 672, 675 (1991) (“plaintiff has the
burden of proving that defendant’s negligence was the
proximate cause in whole or in part of the plaintiff’s
[death]”); Reed v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 171 Ohio St. 433,
436, 171 N. E. 2d 718, 721–722 (1961) (“such violation
could not legally amount to a proximate cause of the injury
to plaintiff’s leg”); see also Hager v. Norfolk & W. R. Co.,
No. 87553, 2006 WL 3634373, *6 (Ohio App., Dec. 14,
2006) (“the standard for proximate cause is broader under
FELA than the common law” (internal quotation marks
omitted)).
If nothing more, the views of these courts show that the
question whether—and to what extent—FELA dispenses
with proximate cause is not as “settled” as the Court
would have it, ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omit­
ted). Under these circumstances, it seems important to
correct an interpretation of our own case law that has run,
so to speak, off its own rails.*

* The Court’s contention that our position would unsettle the law
contrary to principles of stare decisis exaggerates the state of the law.
As the court below noted, “[s]ince Rogers, the Supreme Court has not
explained in detail how broadly or narrowly Rogers should be read by
the lower federal courts.” 598 F. 3d 388, 397 (CA7 2010). See also
Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173 (2007) (Souter, J.,
concurring) (“Rogers did not address, much less alter, existing law
governing the degree of causation necessary for redressing negligence
