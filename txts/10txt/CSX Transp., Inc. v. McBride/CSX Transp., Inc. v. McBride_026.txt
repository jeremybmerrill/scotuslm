ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

substitute—which may explain why Congress did not at­
tempt to do so in FELA. Proximate cause is hardly the
only enduring common law concept that is useful despite
its imprecision, see ante, at 14. It is in good company with
proof beyond a reasonable doubt, necessity, willfulness,
and unconscionability—to name just a few.
Proximate cause refers to the basic requirement that
before recovery is allowed in tort, there must be “some
direct relation between the injury asserted and the injuri­
ous conduct alleged,” Holmes, 503 U. S., at 268. It ex­
cludes from the scope of liability injuries that are “too
remote,” “purely contingent,” or “indirect[ ].” Id., at 268,
271, 274. Recognizing that liability must not attach to
“every conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged
wrongdoing,” proximate cause requires a “causal connec­
tion between the wrong and the injury,” Associated Gen.
Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519, 536,
533, n. 26 (1983), that is not so “tenuous . . . that what is
claimed to be consequence is only fortuity,” Exxon, supra,
at 838 (internal quotation marks omitted). It limits liabil­
ity at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of
the kingdom. When FELA was passed, as now, “[t]he
question whether damage in a given case is proximate or
remote [was] one of great importance. . . . [T]he determi­
nation of it determines legal right,” 1 T. Street, Founda­
tions of Legal Liability 110 (1906) (reprint 1980).
FELA expressly abrogated common law tort principles
in four specific ways. See Sorrell, supra, at 166, 168; Con
solidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532,
542–543 (1994). As enacted in 1908, the Act abolished the
common law contributory negligence rule, which barred
plaintiffs whose negligence had contributed to their inju­
ries from recovering for the negligence of another. See Act
of Apr. 22, §3, 35 Stat. 66. FELA also abandoned the so­
called fellow-servant rule, §1, prohibited an assumption of
risk defense in certain cases, §4, and barred employees
