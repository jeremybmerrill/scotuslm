ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

until today—that FELA entirely eliminates proximate
cause as a limit on liability.
III
The Court is correct that the federal courts of appeals
have read Rogers to support the adoption of instructions
like the one given here. But we do not resolve questions
such as the one before us by a show of hands. See Buck
hannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of
Health and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 605 (2001);
id., at 621 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“The dissent’s insis­
tence that we defer to the ‘clear majority’ of Circuit opin­
ion is particularly peculiar in the present case, since that
majority has been nurtured and preserved by our own
misleading dicta”); cf. McNally v. United States, 483 U. S.
350, 365 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (pointing out that
“[e]very court to consider the matter” had disagreed with
the majority’s holding).
In addition, the Court discounts the views of those state
courts of last resort that agree FELA did not relegate
proximate cause to the dustbin. Those courts either reject
the position the Court adopts today or suggest that FELA
does not entirely eliminate proximate cause. See Ballard
v. Union Pacific R. Co., 279 Neb. 638, 644, 781 N. W. 2d
47, 53 (2010) (“an employee must prove the employer’s
negligence and that the alleged negligence is a proximate
cause of the employee’s injury”); CSX Transp., Inc. v.
Miller, 46 So. 3d 434, 450 (Ala. 2010) (“the jury in this
case was properly instructed by the trial court that [re­
spondent] could not be compensated for any injury not
proximately caused by [petitioner’s] negligence”), cf. id., at
461 (quoting Rogers); Raab v. Utah R. Co., 2009 UT 61,
¶20, 221 P. 3d 219, 225 (“Rogers did not speak to the issue
of proximate cause”); Gardner v. CSX Transp., Inc., 201
W. Va. 490, 500, 498 S. E. 2d 473, 483 (1997) (“we hold
that to prevail on a claim under [FELA] . . . a plaintiff
