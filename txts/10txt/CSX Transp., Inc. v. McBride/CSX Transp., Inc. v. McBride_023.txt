Opinion of the Court

defendant railroad “caused or contributed to” a railroad
worker’s injury “if [the railroad's] negligence played a
part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury.”
That, indeed, is the test Congress prescribed for proximate
causation in FELA cases. See supra, at 9, 13. As the
courts below so held, the judgment of the U. S. Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is
Affirmed.
