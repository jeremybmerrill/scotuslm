CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE
Opinion of the Court

the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events
beyond a certain point.” Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co.,
248 N. Y. 339, 352, 162 N. E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J.,
dissenting). Common-law “proximate cause” formulations
varied, and were often both constricted and difficult to
comprehend. See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73–77, 812–813
(2d ed. 1888) (describing, for example, prescriptions pre­
cluding recovery in the event of any “intervening” cause or
any contributory negligence). Some courts cut off liability
if a “proximate cause” was not the sole proximate cause.
Prosser and Keeton §65, p. 452 (noting “tendency . . . to
look for some single, principal, dominant, ‘proximate’
cause of every injury”). Many used definitions resembling
those CSX proposed to the District Court or urged in the
Court of Appeals. See supra, at 2–3 (CSX proposed key
words “natural or probable” or “direct” to describe required
relationship between injury and alleged negligent con­
duct); Prosser and Keeton §43, pp. 282–283.
Drawing largely on Justice Souter’s concurring opinion
in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173
(2007), CSX contends that the Rogers “any part” test
displaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for
injuries involving contributory negligence or other “multi­
ple causes.” Brief for Petitioner 35 (internal quotation
marks omitted).1 Rogers “did not address the requisite
directness of a cause,” CSX argues, hence that question
continues to be governed by restrictive common-law for­
mulations. Ibid.

To evaluate CSX’s argument, we turn first to the facts of
Rogers. The employee in that case was injured while
burning off weeds and vegetation that lined the defen­

1 In Sorrell, the Court held that the causation standard was the same
for railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence, but said
nothing about what that standard should be. 549 U. S., at 164–165.
