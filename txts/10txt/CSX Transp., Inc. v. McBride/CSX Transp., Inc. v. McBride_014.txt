CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE
Opinion of the Court

announced a general standard for causation in FELA
cases, not one addressed exclusively to injuries involving multiple potentially cognizable causes. The very day
Rogers was announced, we applied its “any part” instruc­
tion in a case in which the sole causation issue was the
directness or foreseeability of the connection between the
carrier’s negligence and the plaintiff’s injury. See Fergu
son v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 523–
524 (1957) (plurality opinion).
A few years later, in Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,
372 U. S. 108 (1963), we held jury findings for the plaintiff
proper in a case presenting the following facts: For years,
the railroad had allowed a fetid pool, containing “dead and
decayed rats and pigeons,” to accumulate near its right-of­
way; while standing near the pool, the plaintiff-employee
suffered an insect bite that became infected and required
amputation of his legs. Id., at 109. The appellate court
had concluded there was insufficient evidence of causation
to warrant submission of the case to the jury. Id., at
112. We reversed, reciting the causation standard Rogers
announced. Id., at 116–117, 120–121. See also Crane v.
Cedar Rapids & Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166–167
(1969) (contrasting suit by railroad employee, who “is not
required to prove common-law proximate causation but
only that his injury resulted ‘in whole or in part’ from the
railroad’s violation,” with suit by nonemployee, where
“definition of causation . . . [is] left to state law”); Gott
shall, 512 U. S., at 543 (“relaxed standard of causation
applies under FELA”).4

4 CSX and the dissent observe, correctly, that some of our pre-Rogers
decisions invoked common-law formulations of proximate cause. See,
e.g., Brady v. Southern R. Co., 320 U. S. 476, 483 (1943) (injury must
be “the natural and probable consequence of the negligence” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the “natural or probable” charge
that CSX requested was drawn from Brady, which in turn relied on a
pre-FELA case, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469,
