CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

from contractually releasing their employers from liability,
§5.
But “[o]nly to the extent of these explicit statutory
alterations is FELA an avowed departure from the rules of
the common law.” Gottshall, supra, at 544 (internal quo­
tation marks omitted). FELA did not abolish the familiar
requirement of proximate cause. Because “Congress ex­
pressly dispensed with [certain] common-law doctrines”
in FELA but “did not deal at all with [other] equally well­
established doctrine[s],” I do not believe that “Congress
intended to abrogate [the other] doctrine[s] sub silentio.”

337–338 (1988).
We have applied the standard requirement of proximate
cause to actions under federal statutes where the text did
not expressly provide for it. See Dura Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 342–346 (2005) (securities
fraud); Holmes, supra, at 268–270 (Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act); Associated Gen. Contrac
tors of Cal., Inc., supra, at 529–535 (Clayton Act); cf.
Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy,
460 U. S. 766, 774 (1983) (“the terms ‘environmental ef­
fect’ and ‘environmental impact’ in [the National Envi­
ronmental Policy Act of 1969 should] be read to include a
requirement of a reasonably close causal relationship
between a change in the physical environment and the
effect at issue . . . . like the familiar doctrine of proximate
cause from tort law”).
The Court does not explicitly rest its argument on its
own reading of FELA’s text. The jury instruction on cau­
sation it approves, however, derives from Section 1 of
FELA, 45 U. S. C. §51. See ante, at 1, 16–17. But nothing
in Section 1 is similar to the “express language” Congress
employed elsewhere in FELA when it wanted to abrogate
a common law rule, Sorrell, supra, at 165–166. See, e.g.,
§53 (“the fact that the employee may have been guilty of
