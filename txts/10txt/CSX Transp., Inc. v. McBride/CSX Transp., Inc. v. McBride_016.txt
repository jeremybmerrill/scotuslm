Opinion of the Court

part, even the slightest, in bringing about an injury to
the plaintiff?” 5 L. Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury
Instructions–Civil ¶89.02, pp. 89–38, 89–40, and com­
ment (2010) (hereinafter Sand).
Since shortly after Rogers was decided, charges of this
order have been accepted as the federal model. See W.
Mathes & E. Devitt, Federal Jury Practice and Instruc­
tions §84.12, p. 517 (1965) (under FELA, injury “is proxi­
mately caused by” the defendant’s negligence if the negli­
gence “played any part, no matter how small, in bringing
about or actually causing the injury”).6 The overwhelming
majority of state courts7 and scholars8 similarly compre­
hend FELA’s causation standard.
In sum, the understanding of Rogers we here affirm “has
been accepted as settled law for several decades.” IBP,
Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32 (2005). “Congress has had
[more than 50] years in which it could have corrected our
decision in [Rogers] if it disagreed with it, and has not
chosen to do so.” Hilton v. South Carolina Public Rail
ways Comm’n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991). Countless judges
have instructed countless juries in language drawn from
Rogers. To discard or restrict the Rogers instruction now
would ill serve the goals of “stability” and “predictability”

five Circuits that have published pattern FELA causation in­
structions use the language of the statute or of Rogers rather than
traditional common-law formulations. See Brief for Academy of Rail
Labor Attorneys as Amicus Curiae 19–20.
7 See id., at 21–22, 25–27 (collecting cases and pattern instructions).
The parties dispute the exact figures, but all agree there are no more
than a handful of exceptions. The Seventh Circuit found “[a]t most”
three. 598 F. 3d 388, 404, n. 7 (2010).
