SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES 

EX REL. KIRK 

Opinion of the Court 


Kirk also was unable to articulate a workable definition.
His various proposed definitions suffer the same deficien
cies as the Government’s. Compare Brief for Respondent
27 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 17–18 with Brief for Respondent
34–39 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. Kirk’s first suggestion
would exclude “a lot of things that are labeled . . . report,”
id., at 22, and the second—the definition advanced by the
Court of Appeals—would seem to include written FOIA
responses, id., at 28–29. In the end, it appears that the
“only argument is that FOIA is a different kind of mis
sion”—“a special case.” Id., at 31. We see no basis for that
distinction and adhere to the principle that undefined
statutory terms carry their ordinary meaning.

The DOL’s three written FOIA responses in this case,
along with the accompanying records produced to Mrs.
Kirk, are reports within the meaning of the public dis
closure bar. Whether Kirk’s suit is “based upon . . .
allegations or transactions” disclosed in those reports is a
question for the Court of Appeals to resolve on remand.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
