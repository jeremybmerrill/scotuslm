SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES 

EX REL. KIRK 

GINSBURG, J., dissenting 


to a FOIA request should not automatically qualify as
a “report, hearing, audit, or investigation” preclusive of a
whistleblower’s lawsuit under the public disclosure bar of
the FCA, §3730(e)(4). I would affirm the Second Circuit’s
judgment as faithful to the text, context, purpose, and
history of the FCA’s public disclosure bar.
The Court finds no “textual basis” for the Second Cir
cuit’s interpretation of the statutory language. Ante, at 6.
But the Court of Appeals’ opinion considered text as well
as context. Leaving aside the term “report,” the court
explained:
“All of the other terms in [§3730(e)(4)(A)’s] list of
enumerated sources connote the synthesis of informa

[and] administrative hearings,’ for instance, all entail
a government inquiry into a given subject, here into
an alleged case of fraud. Similarly, government ‘hear
ing[s and] audit[s]’ are processes by which information
is compiled with the concerted aim of deepening a
government entity’s knowledge of a given subject or,
often, determining whether a party is in compliance
with applicable law. . . .
“In this context, the term ‘report’ most readily bears
a narrower meaning than simply ‘something that
gives information.’ Rather, it connotes the compila
tion or analysis of information with the aim of synthe
sizing that information in order to serve some end of
the government, as in a ‘hearing’ or ‘audit.’ It does
not naturally extend to cover the mechanistic produc
tion of documents in response to a FOIA request made
by a member of the public.” 601 F. 3d 94, 107 (2010)
(citations omitted).
Focusing on the FOIA requests in this case, the Court of
Appeals observed that DOL’s responses did not “synthe
size the documents or their contents with the aim of itself
