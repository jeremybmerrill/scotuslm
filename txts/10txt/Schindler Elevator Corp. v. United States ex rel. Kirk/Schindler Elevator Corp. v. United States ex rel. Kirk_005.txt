SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES 

EX REL. KIRK 

Opinion of the Court 


We hold that it does.
I
Petitioner Schindler Elevator Corporation manufac
tures, installs, and services elevators and escalators.2 In
1989, Schindler acquired Millar Elevator Industries, Inc.,
and the two companies merged in 2002.
Since 1999, Schindler and the United States have en
tered into hundreds of contracts that are subject to the
Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of
1972 (VEVRAA). That Act requires contractors like
Schindler to report certain information to the Secretary of
Labor, including how many of its employees are “qualified
covered veterans” under the statute.
38 U. S. C.
§4212(d)(1). VEVRAA regulations required Schindler to
agree in each of its contracts that it would “submit VETS–
100 Reports no later than September 30 of each year.” 48
CFR §52.222–37(c) (2008); see also §22.1310(b).
Respondent Daniel Kirk, a United States Army veteran
who served in Vietnam, was employed by Millar and
Schindler from 1978 until 2003. In August 2003, Kirk
resigned from Schindler in response to what he saw as

from the amended complaint and the filings submitted in opposition to
Schindler’s motion to dismiss.
3 Kirk filed a complaint with the Department of Labor’s Office of Fed
eral Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), claiming that he had
been “improperly demoted and constructively terminated by Schindler
despite his status as a Vietnam era veteran.” App. 23a. The OFCCP
investigated Schindler’s compliance with VEVRAA and found insuffi
cient evidence to support Kirk’s claim. In November 2009, the Depart
ment of Labor affirmed the OFCCP’s finding. 601 F. 3d 94, 99 (CA2
2010).
