omitted).
Because the statute does not define “report,” we look
first to the word’s ordinary meaning. See Gross v. FBL
Financial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,
at 7) (“Statutory construction must begin with the lan
guage employed by Congress and the assumption that the
ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses
the legislative purpose” (internal quotation marks omit
ted)); Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187
(1995) (“When terms used in a statute are undefined, we
give them their ordinary meaning”). A “report” is “some
thing that gives information” or a “notification,” Webster’s
Third New International Dictionary 1925 (1986), or “[a]n
official or formal statement of facts or proceedings,”

that is prepared, presented, or delivered, usually in formal
or organized form”); Random House Dictionary 1634 (2d
ed. 1987) (“an account or statement describing in detail an
event, situation, or the like”).
This broad ordinary meaning of “report” is consistent
with the generally broad scope of the FCA’s public disclo
sure bar. As we explained last Term, to determine the
meaning of one word in the public disclosure bar, we must
consider the provision’s “entire text,” read as an “inte
grated whole.” Graham County Soil and Water Conserva
tion Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___,
___, n. 12 (2010) (slip op., at 8, 12, n. 12); see also Tyler v.
Cain, 533 U. S. 656, 662 (2001) (“We do not . . . construe
the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum”). The other
sources of public disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A), especially
“news media,” suggest that the public disclosure bar pro
