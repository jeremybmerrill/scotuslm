SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES 

EX REL. KIRK 

Opinion of the Court 


“primary meaning.” Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S.
125, 130, 128 (1998). Indeed, we have cautioned recently
against interpreting the public disclosure bar in a way
inconsistent with a plain reading of its text. In Graham
County, we rejected several arguments for construing the
statute narrowly, twice emphasizing that the sole “touch
stone” in the statutory text is “public disclosure.” 559
U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11, 19). We chose in that case
simply to give the text its “most natura[l] read[ing],” id., at
___ (slip op., at 5), and we do so again here.
B
A written agency response to a FOIA request falls
within the ordinary meaning of “report.” FOIA requires
each agency receiving a request to “notify the person
making such request of [its] determination and the
reasons therefor.” 5 U. S. C. §552(a)(6)(A)(i). When an
agency denies a request in whole or in part, it must addi
tionally “set forth the names and titles or positions of each
person responsible for the denial,” “make a reasonable
effort to estimate the volume of any [denied] matter,” and
“provide any such estimate to the person making the
request.” §§552(a)(6)(C)(i), (F). The DOL has adopted
more detailed regulations implementing FOIA and man
dating a response in writing. See 29 CFR §70.21(a) (2009)
(requiring written notice of the grant of a FOIA request
and a description of the manner in which records will be
disclosed); §§70.21(b)–(c) (requiring a “brief statement of
the reason or reasons for [a] denial,” as well as written
notification if a record “cannot be located or has been
destroyed” (italics deleted)). So, too, have other federal
agencies. See, e.g., 28 CFR §16.6 (2010) (Dept. of Justice);
43 CFR §2.21 (2009) (Dept. of Interior); 7 CFR §1.7 (2010)
(Dept. of Agriculture). Such an agency response plainly is
“something that gives information,” a “notification,” and
an “official or formal statement of facts.”
