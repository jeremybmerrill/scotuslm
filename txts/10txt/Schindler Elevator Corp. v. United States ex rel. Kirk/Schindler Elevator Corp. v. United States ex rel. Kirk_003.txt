Syllabus
Court is not troubled by the different treatment. By its plain terms,
the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to oth
ers. See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___. It would not be anoma
lous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the bar’s scope
and some did not. Moreover, Kirk’s assertion that potential defen
dants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA
request for incriminating documents is pure speculation. Cf. id., at
___. There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits
that have long held that FOIA responses are “reports” within the
public disclosure bar’s meaning. Pp. 11–13.
(3) Even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted,
Kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define “report”
to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documents—e.g.,
the Justice Department’s annual report of FOIA statistics—that are
indisputably reports. Pp. 13–14.
(d) Whether Kirk’s suit is “based upon . . . allegations or transac
tions” disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on
remand. P. 14.
601 F. 3d 94, reversed and remanded.
THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,
C. J., and SCALIA, KENNEDY, and ALITO, JJ., joined. GINSBURG, J., filed
a dissenting opinion, in which BREYER and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.
KAGAN, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
