Opinion of the Court

Any records the agency produces along with its written
FOIA response are part of that response, “just as if they
had been reproduced as an appendix to a printed report.”
Mistick, 186 F. 3d, at 384, n. 5. Nothing in the public
disclosure bar suggests that a document and its attach
ments must be disaggregated and evaluated individually.
If an allegation or transaction is disclosed in a record
attached to a FOIA response, it is disclosed “in” that FOIA
response and, therefore, disclosed “in” a report for the
purposes of the public disclosure bar.6
The DOL’s three written FOIA responses to Mrs. Kirk,
along with their attached records, are thus reports within
the meaning of the public disclosure bar. Each response
was an “official or formal statement” that “[gave] informa
tion” and “notif[ied]” Mrs. Kirk of the agency’s resolution
of her FOIA request.

In interpreting a statute, “[o]ur inquiry must cease if
the statutory language is unambiguous,” as we have
found, and “ ‘the statutory scheme is coherent and consis
tent.’ ” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 340 (1997)
(quoting United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489
U. S. 235, 240 (1989)). We are not persuaded by asser
tions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclo
sure bar to encompass written FOIA responses.

The drafting history of the public disclosure bar does not
contradict our holding. As originally enacted in 1863, the
FCA placed no restriction on the sources from which a qui
tam relator could acquire information on which to base a

attached records do not “becom[e]” reports, 601 F. 3d, at 109, but
simply are part of a report.
