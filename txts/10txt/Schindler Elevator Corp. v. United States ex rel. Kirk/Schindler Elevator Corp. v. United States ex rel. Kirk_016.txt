Opinion of the Court

is pure speculation. Cf. Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 19) (rejecting as “strained speculation” an
argument that local governments will manipulate the
public disclosure bar to escape liability). There is no
suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that
have long held that FOIA responses are “reports” within
the meaning of the public disclosure bar.
B
Even if we accepted these extratextual arguments, Kirk
and his amici have provided no principled way to define
“report” to exclude FOIA responses without excluding
other documents that are indisputably reports. The Gov
ernment, for example, struggled to settle on a single defi
nition. Compare Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
19 (“report” must be read to “reflect a focus on situations
in which the government is conducting, or has completed,
some focused inquiry or analysis concerning the relevant
facts”) with id., at 21 (“A FOIA response is not a ‘report’
. . . because the federal agency is not charged with uncov
ering the truth of any matter”), and Tr. of Oral Arg. 33
(“[T]he way to think about it is whether or not the agency
. . . is engaging in a substantive inquiry into and a sub
stantive analysis of information”). It is difficult to see how
the Department of Justice’s “Annual Report” of FOIA
statistics—something that is indisputably a Government
report—would qualify under the latter two definitions.
See Dept. of Justice, Freedom of Information Act Annual Report, Fiscal Year 2010, http://www.justice.gov/oip/
annual_report/2010/cover.htm (as visited May 12, 2011,
and available in Clerk of Court’s case file); see also Tr. of
Oral Arg. 19 (Kirk conceding that the DOJ annual report
is a report). And even if the first definition arguably
encompasses that report, it would seem also to include
FOIA responses, which convey the results of a Govern
ment agency’s “focused inquiry.”
