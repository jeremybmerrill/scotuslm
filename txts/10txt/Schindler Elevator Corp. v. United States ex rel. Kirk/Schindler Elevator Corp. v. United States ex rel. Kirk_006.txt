Opinion of the Court

fraudulent claims for payment to the United States. 31
U. S. C. §3729(a). The FCA authorizes both civil actions
by the Attorney General and private qui tam actions to
enforce its provisions. §3730. When, as here, the Gov
ernment chooses not to intervene in a qui tam action, the
private relator stands to receive between 25% and 30% of
the proceeds of the action. §3730(d)(2).
In an amended complaint filed in June 2007, Kirk al
leged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false
claims for payment under its Government contracts.
According to Kirk, Schindler had violated VEVRAA’s
reporting requirements by failing to file certain required
VETS–100 reports and including false information in
those it did file. The company’s claims for payment were

States, but he asserted that the value of Schindler’s
VEVRAA-covered contracts exceeded $100 million.

Labor (DOL) in response to three FOIA requests. Mrs.
Kirk had sought all VETS–100 reports filed by Schindler
for the years 1998 through 2006. The DOL responded by
letter or e-mail to each request with information about the
records found for each year, including years for which no
responsive records were located. The DOL informed Mrs.
Kirk that it found no VETS–100 reports filed by Schindler
in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, or 2003. For the other years,
the DOL provided Mrs. Kirk with copies of the reports
filed by Schindler, 99 in all.
Schindler moved to dismiss on a number of grounds,
including that the FCA’s public disclosure bar deprived
the District Court of jurisdiction. See §3730(e)(4)(A). The
District Court granted the motion, concluding that most of
Kirk’s allegations failed to state a claim and that the
