SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES 

EX REL. KIRK 

GINSBURG, J., dissenting 


esses.” 601 F. 3d, at 108, n. 6.
The Court regards the case Kirk has brought as “a
classic example of the ‘opportunistic’ litigation that the
public disclosure bar is designed to discourage.” Ante, at
10. 	But as the Second Circuit observed:
“[T]he facts of this case belie the assertion that indi
viduals who are not original sources and who obtain
information through FOIA requests will generally not
be persons with firsthand knowledge of fraud but
rather will be opportunistic litigators. The facts also
illustrate how an overbroad reading of the jurisdic
tional bar would prevent an individual with inde
pendent but partial knowledge of a possible fraud
would be barred from bringing a lawsuit that is nei
ther parasitic nor frivolous.” 601 F. 3d, at 110 (cita
tion omitted).
By ranking DOL’s ministerial response an “administra
tive . . . report,” akin to a “Government Accounting Office
report,” §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted), the Court weak
ens the force of the FCA as a weapon against fraud on
the part of Government contractors. Why should a whis
tleblower attentive to the heightened pleading standards
of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) be barred from
court if he seeks corroboration for his allegations, as Kirk
did, through a FOIA request simply for copies of a contrac
tor’s filings? After today’s decision, which severely limits
whistleblowers’ ability to substantiate their allegations
before commencing suit, that question is worthy of Con
gress’ attention.
