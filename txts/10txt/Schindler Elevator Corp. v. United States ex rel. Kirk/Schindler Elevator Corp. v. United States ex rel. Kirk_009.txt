SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES 

EX REL. KIRK 

Opinion of the Court 


vides “a broa[d] sweep.” Graham County, supra, at ___
(slip op., at 8). The statute also mentions “administrative
hearings” twice, reflecting intent to avoid underinclusive
ness even at the risk of redundancy.
The phrase “allegations or transactions” in §3730(e)
(4)(A) additionally suggests a wide-reaching public disclo
sure bar. Congress covered not only the disclosure of
“allegations” but also “transactions,” a term that courts
have recognized as having a broad meaning. See, e.g.,
Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, 270 U. S. 593, 610
(1926) (“ ‘Transaction’ is a word of flexible meaning”);
Hamilton v. United Healthcare of La., Inc., 310 F. 3d 385,
391 (CA5 2002) (“[T]he ordinary meaning of the term
‘transaction’ is a broad reference to many different types of
business dealings between parties”).

Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower
definition of “report.” The Court of Appeals, in holding
that FOIA responses were not “reports,” looked to the
words “hearing, audit, or investigation,” and the phrase
“criminal, civil, [and] administrative hearings.” It con
cluded that all of these sources “connote the synthesis of
information in an investigatory context” to “serve some
end of the government.” 601 F. 3d, at 107; cf. Brief for
Respondent 30, n. 15 (“Each is part of the government’s
ongoing effort to fight fraud”). Applying the noscitur a
sociis canon, the Court of Appeals then determined that
these “ ‘neighboring words’ ” mandated a narrower mean
ing for “report” than its ordinary meaning. 601 F. 3d, at
107.
The Court of Appeals committed the very error we re
versed in Graham County. Like the Fourth Circuit in that
case, the Second Circuit here applied the noscitur a sociis
canon only to the immediately surrounding words, to the
exclusion of the rest of the statute. See 601 F. 3d, at 107,
