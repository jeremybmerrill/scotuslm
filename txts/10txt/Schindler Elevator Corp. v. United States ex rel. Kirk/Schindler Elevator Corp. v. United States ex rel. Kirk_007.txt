“report” nor an “investigation” within the meaning of the

with United States ex rel. Haight v. Catholic Healthcare

United States ex rel. Mistick PBT v. Housing Auth. of
Pittsburgh, 186 F. 3d 376 (CA3 1999)). We granted certio
rari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and now reverse and remand.

trative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or
Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit,
or investigation, or from the news media, unless the
action is brought by the Attorney General or the
person bringing the action is an original source of

we conclude that a written response to a FOIA request
qualifies as a “report” within the meaning of the public disclosure bar,
we need not address whether an agency’s search in response to a FOIA
request also qualifies as an “investigation.”
