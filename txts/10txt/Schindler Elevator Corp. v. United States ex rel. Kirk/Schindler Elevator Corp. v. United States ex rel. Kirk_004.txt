SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORPORATION, PETI-

TIONER v. UNITED STATES EX REL. 

DANIEL KIRK 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[May 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
The False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U. S. C. §§3729–3733,
prohibits submitting false or fraudulent claims for pay
ment to the United States, §3729(a), and authorizes qui
tam suits, in which private parties bring civil actions in
the Government’s name, §3730(b)(1). This case concerns
the FCA’s public disclosure bar, which generally forecloses
qui tam suits that are “based upon the public disclosure of
allegations or transactions . . . in a congressional, adminis
trative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing,
audit, or investigation.” §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).1
We must decide whether a federal agency’s written re
sponse to a request for records under the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. §552, constitutes a
“report” within the meaning of the public disclosure bar.
——————
1 During the pendency of this case, the Patient Protection and Afford
able Care Act, 124 Stat. 119, amended the public disclosure bar.
Because the amendments are not applicable to pending cases, Graham
County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel.
Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1 (2010) (slip op., at 1, n. 1), this opinion
refers to the statute as it existed when the suit was filed.
