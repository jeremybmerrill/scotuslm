GINSBURG, J., dissenting

would in conducting a ‘hearing’ or ‘audit.’ ” Id., at 108.
Far from “compil[ing] or synthesiz[ing] information to
serve its own investigative or analytic ends,” id., at 111,
DOL merely assembled and duplicated records, or noted
the absence of records.
Contrary to the Court’s assertion, moreover, the Second
Circuit was mindful of the “error we reversed in Graham
County [Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United

559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). Schindler did not make
this argument below. In any event, the point would have
been unavailing. Disclosures “of allegations or transac

added), share a common core of meaning with disclosures
in other sources that involve “processes of uncovering and
analyzing information or . . . the products of those proc
