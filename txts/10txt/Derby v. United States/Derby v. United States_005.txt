SCALIA, J., dissenting

Since our ACCA cases are incomprehensible to judges,
the statute obviously does not give “person[s] of ordinary
intelligence fair notice” of its reach. United States v.
Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 123 (1979) (internal quotation
marks omitted). I would grant certiorari, declare ACCA’s
residual provision to be unconstitutionally vague, and ring
down the curtain on the ACCA farce playing in federal
courts throughout the Nation.
