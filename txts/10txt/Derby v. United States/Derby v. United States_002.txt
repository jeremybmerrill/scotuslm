DERBY v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
Before us are petitions for certiorari by criminal de
fendants asking us to decide whether four more of the “vast
variety of . . . criminal offenses” that we have not yet
addressed, see Sykes v. United States, ante, at 2–4, 7
(SCALIA, J., dissenting), are crimes of violence under the
residual provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act
(ACCA). See 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). They are:
•	 Derby v. United States, No. 10–8373. Relying on its
decision in United States v. Mayer, 560 F. 3d 948
(2009), the Ninth Circuit held that Oregon’s first
degree burglary statute, Ore. Rev. Stat. §164.225
(2009), falls within ACCA’s residual provision. In
Mayer, the Ninth Circuit conceded that Oregon’s
statute does not qualify as the enumerated offense
of generic “burglary” under ACCA because it ap
plies to unlawful entries into “booths, vehicles,
boats, and aircraft,” 560 F. 3d, at 959, and not
just buildings and structures. See Taylor v. United
States, 495 U. S. 575, 598 (1990). Nevertheless, it
held that Oregon’s statute falls within the residual
provision, because burglaries under that statute
lead to a “risk of a physical confrontation.” 560
F. 3d, at 962; but see id., at 952 (Kozinski, C. J.,
dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (not
ing that “Oregon prosecutes as burglars people who
pose no risk of injury to anyone,” such as an indi
vidual who “enter[ed] public telephone booths to
steal change from coin boxes”).
•	 Johnson v. United States, No. 10–8607. The Sec
ond Circuit, over a dissent, held that the Connecti
cut offense of “rioting at a correctional institution,”
Conn. Gen. Stat. §53a–179b(a) (2011), which pun
ishes a defendant who “incites, instigates, orga
nizes, connives at, causes, aids, abets, assists or
takes part in any disorder, disturbance, strike, riot
