Opinion of the Court

The Court then added the sentence upon which the
Court of Appeals relied in the instant case, the sentence
that has been the source of disagreement among Courts of

The quoted statement was in the context of a decision
which held that business competitors had no legal injury,
and the word standing can be interpreted in that sense.

This reading is consistent with the Tennessee Electric
Court’s use of the term “standing” elsewhere in its opinion

Yet the quoted statement also could be read to refer to
standing in the sense of whether the power companies
