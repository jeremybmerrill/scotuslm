of powers and checks and balances; and they are not dis­
abled from relying on those principles in otherwise justici­
able cases and controversies. In INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S.
919 (1983), it was an individual who successfully chal­
lenged the so-called legislative veto—a procedure that
Congress used in an attempt to invalidate an executive
determination without presenting the measure to the
President. The procedure diminished the role of the Ex­
ecutive, but the challenger sought to protect not the
prerogatives of the Presidency as such but rather his
own right to avoid deportation under an invalid order.
Chadha’s challenge was sustained. A cardinal principle of
separation of powers was vindicated at the insistence of an
individual, indeed one who was not a citizen of the United
States but who still was a person whose liberty was at
risk.
Chadha is not unique in this respect. Compare Clinton
v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 433–436 (1998) (injured
parties have standing to challenge Presidential line-item
veto) with Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 829–830 (1997)
(Congress Members do not); see also, e.g., Free Enterprise
Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561
U. S. ___ (2010); Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.
211 (1995); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714 (1986); North
ern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458
U. S. 50 (1982); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U. S. 579 (1952); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.
United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935). If the constitutional
structure of our Government that protects individual
liberty is compromised, individuals who suffer otherwise
justiciable injury may object.
Just as it is appropriate for an individual, in a proper
case, to invoke separation-of-powers or checks-and­
balances constraints, so too may a litigant, in a proper
case, challenge a law as enacted in contravention of consti­
tutional principles of federalism. That claim need not
