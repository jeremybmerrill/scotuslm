BOND v. UNITED STATES
GINSBURG, J., concurring

onment.” Id., at 376–377. If a law is invalid as applied to
the criminal defendant’s conduct, the defendant is entitled
to go free.
For this reason, a court has no “prudential” license to
decline to consider whether the statute under which the
defendant has been charged lacks constitutional applica
tion to her conduct. And that is so even where the consti
tutional provision that would render the conviction void is
directed at protecting a party not before the Court. Our
decisions concerning criminal laws infected with discrimi
nation are illustrative. The Court must entertain the
objection—and reverse the conviction—even if the right to
equal treatment resides in someone other than the de
fendant. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 452–455
(1972) (reversing conviction for distributing contraceptives
because the law banning distribution violated the recipi
ent’s right to equal protection); cf. Craig v. Boren, 429
U. S. 190, 192, 210, and n. 24 (1976) (law penalizing sale
of beer to males but not females aged 18 to 20 could not
be enforced against vendor). See also Grayned v. City of
Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 107, n. 2 (1972); Welsh v. United
States, 398 U. S. 333, 361–362 (1970) (Harlan, J., concur
ring in result) (reversal required even if, going forward,
Congress would cure the unequal treatment by extending
rather than invalidating the criminal proscription).
In short, a law “beyond the power of Congress,” for any
reason, is “no law at all.” Nigro v. United States, 276 U. S.
332, 341 (1928). The validity of Bond’s conviction depends
upon whether the Constitution permits Congress to enact
§229. Her claim that it does not must be considered and
decided on the merits.
