Syllabus
(2) The Government errs in contending that Bond should be
permitted to assert only that Congress could not enact the challenged
statute under its enumerated powers but that standing should be de
nied if she argues that the statute interferes with state sovereignty.
Here, Bond asserts that the public policy of the Pennsylvania, en
acted in its capacity as sovereign, has been displaced by that of the
National Government. The law to which she is subject, the prosecu
tion she seeks to counter, and the punishment she must face might
not have come about had the matter been left for Pennsylvania to de
cide. There is no support for the Government’s proposed distinction
between different federalism arguments for purposes of prudential
standing rules. The principles of limited national powers and state
sovereignty are intertwined. Impermissible interference with state
sovereignty is not within the National Government’s enumerated
powers, and action exceeding the National Government’s enumerated
powers undermines the States’ sovereign interests. Individuals seek
ing to challenge such measures are subject to Article III and pruden
tial standing rules applicable to all litigants and claims, but here,
where the litigant is a party to an otherwise justiciable case or con
troversy, she is not forbidden to object that her injury results from
disregard of the federal structure of the Government. Pp. 12–14.
(c) The Court expresses no view on the merits of Bond’s challenge
to the statute’s validity. P. 14.
