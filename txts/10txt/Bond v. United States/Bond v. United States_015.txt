BOND v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

tional interests, even if a State’s constitutional interests
are also implicated.

In this regard it is necessary to address a misconception
in the position the Government now urges this Court to
adopt. As noted, the Government agrees that petitioner
has standing to challenge the validity of §229. That con­

prosecution she seeks to counter, and the punishment she
must face might not have come about if the matter were
left for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to decide.
Indeed, petitioner argues that under Pennsylvania law the
expected maximum term of imprisonment she could have
received for the same conduct was barely more than a
