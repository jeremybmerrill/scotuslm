Opinion of the Court

denied the motion. Bond entered a conditional plea of
guilty, reserving the right to appeal the ruling on the
validity of the statute. She was sentenced to six years in
prison.
In the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Bond
renewed her challenge to the statute, citing, among other
authorities, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.
The Court of Appeals asked for supplemental briefs on the
question whether Bond had standing to raise the Tenth
Amendment as a ground for invalidating a federal statute
in the absence of a State’s participation in the proceedings.
In its supplemental brief in the Court of Appeals, the
Government took the position that Bond did not have
standing. The Court of Appeals agreed. 581 F. 3d 128
(2009).
When Bond sought certiorari, the Government advised
this Court that it had changed its position and that, in its
view, Bond does have standing to challenge the constitu­
tionality of §229 on Tenth Amendment grounds. See Brief
for United States (filed July 9, 2010). The Court granted
certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2010), and appointed an amicus
curiae to defend the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
Stephen McAllister, a member of the bar of this Court,
filed an amicus brief and presented an oral argument that
have been of considerable assistance to the Court.
II
To conclude that petitioner lacks standing to challenge
a federal statute on grounds that the measure interferes
with the powers reserved to States, the Court of Appeals
relied on a single sentence from this Court’s opinion in
Tennessee Elec. Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U. S. 118 (1939).
See 581 F. 3d, at 136–138. As the Court of Appeals noted
here, other Courts of Appeals have taken a similar ap­
proach. E.g., United States v. Hacker, 565 F.3d 522, 525–
527 (CA8 2009); Oregon v. Legal Servs. Corp., 552 F. 3d
