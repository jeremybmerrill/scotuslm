BOND v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

were the proper litigants to raise a Tenth Amendment is­
sue. To the extent that might have been the intention of
the Tennessee Electric Court, it is, for reasons to be ex­
plained, inconsistent with our later precedents. The sen­
tence from Tennessee Electric that we have quoted and
discussed should be deemed neither controlling nor in­
structive on the issue of standing as that term is now
defined and applied.

Amicus contends that federal courts should not adjudi­
cate a claim like Bond’s because of the prudential rule that
a party “generally must assert his own legal rights and
interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal
rights or interests of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin, 422
U. S. 490, 499, 500 (1975); see also Kowalski v. Tesmer,
543 U. S. 125, 129–130 (2004). In amicus’ view, to argue
that the National Government has interfered with state
sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to

alone. That, however, is not so. As explained below, Bond
seeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests. The
individual, in a proper case, can assert injury from gov­
ernmental action taken in excess of the authority that
federalism defines. Her rights in this regard do not belong
to a State.

The federal system rests on what might at first seem a

creation of two governments, not one.” Alden v. Maine,
527 U. S. 706, 758 (1999). The Framers concluded that
allocation of powers between the National Government
and the States enhances freedom, first by protecting the
integrity of the governments themselves, and second by
protecting the people, from whom all governmental powers
