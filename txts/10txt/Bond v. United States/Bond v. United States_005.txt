BOND v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

determination. The merits of petitioner’s challenge to the
statute’s validity are to be considered, in the first instance,
by the Court of Appeals on remand and are not addressed
in this opinion.
I
This case arises from a bitter personal dispute, leading
to the criminal acts charged here. Petitioner Carol Anne
Bond lived outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After dis­
covering that her close friend was pregnant and that
the father was Bond’s husband, Bond sought revenge.
Bond subjected the woman to a campaign of harassing
telephone calls and letters, acts that resulted in a crimi­
nal conviction on a minor state charge. Bond persisted in
her hostile acts, placing caustic substances on objects the
woman was likely to touch, including her mailbox, car
door handle, and front doorknob. Bond’s victim suffered a
minor burn on her hand and contacted federal investiga­
tors, who identified Bond as the perpetrator.
Bond was indicted in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for, among other
offenses, two counts of violating §229. Section 229 forbids
knowing possession or use of any chemical that “can cause
death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to
humans or animals” where not intended for a “peaceful
purpose.” §§229(a); 229F(1); (7); (8). The statute was en­
acted as part of the Chemical Weapons Convention
Implementation Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 2681–856, 22
U. S. C. §6701 et seq.; 18 U. S. C. §229 et seq. The Act
implements provisions of the Convention on the Prohibi­
tion of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use
of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, a treaty
the United States ratified in 1997.
In the District Court, Bond moved to dismiss the §229
charges, contending the statute was beyond Congress’
constitutional authority to enact. The District Court
