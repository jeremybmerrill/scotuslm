BOND v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

federal structure of our Government. Whether the Tenth
Amendment is regarded as simply a “ ‘truism,’ ” New York,
supra, at 156 (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U. S.
100, 124 (1941)), or whether it has independent force of its
own, the result here is the same.

There is no basis in precedent or principle to deny peti­
tioner’s standing to raise her claims. The ultimate issue of
the statute’s validity turns in part on whether the law can
be deemed “necessary and proper for carrying into Execu­
tion” the President’s Article II, §2 Treaty Power, see U. S.
Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. This Court expresses no view on
the merits of that argument. It can be addressed by the
Court of Appeals on remand.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
