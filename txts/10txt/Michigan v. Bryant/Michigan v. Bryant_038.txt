MICHIGAN v. BRYANT
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

tices that the Confrontation Clause addressed. See, e.g.,
id., at 835–836 (describing “practices that occurred under
the English bail and committal statutes passed during the
reign of Queen Mary”). As the majority notes, Covington
interacted with the police under highly informal circum
stances, while he bled from a fatal gunshot wound. Ante,
at 19–20, 31. The police questioning was not “a formalized
dialogue,” did not result in “formalized testimonial ma
terials” such as a deposition or affidavit, and bore no “indicia of solemnity.” Davis, supra, at 840, 837 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.); see also Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353,
377–378 (2008) (THOMAS, J., concurring). Nor is there any
indication that the statements were offered at trial “in
order to evade confrontation.” Davis, supra, at 840. This
interrogation bears little if any resemblance to the histori
cal practices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to elimi
nate. Covington thus did not “bea[r] testimony” against
Bryant, Crawford, supra, at 51, and the introduction of his
statements at trial did not implicate the Confrontation
Clause. I concur in the judgment.
