Opinion of the Court

condition,” Fed. Rule Evid. 803(2); see also Mich. Rule
Evid. 803(2) (2010), are considered reliable because the
declarant, in the excitement, presumably cannot form a
falsehood. See Idaho v. Wright, 497 U. S. 805, 820 (1990)
(“The basis for the ‘excited utterance’ exception . . . is that
such statements are given under circumstances that
eliminate the possibility of fabrication, coaching, or con
fabulation . . . ”); 5 J. Weinstein & M. Berger, Weinstein’s
Federal Evidence §803.04[1] (J. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed.
2010) (same); Advisory Committee’s Notes on Fed. Rule
Evid. 803(2), 28 U. S. C. App., p. 371 (same). An ongoing
emergency has a similar effect of focusing an individual’s
attention on responding to the emergency.9
Following our precedents, the court below correctly

9 Many other exceptions to the hearsay rules similarly rest on the
belief that certain statements are, by their nature, made for a purpose
other than use in a prosecution and therefore should not be barred by
hearsay prohibitions. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) (statement
by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy); 803(4)
(Statements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment); 803(6)
(Records of Regularly Conducted Activity); 803(8) (Public Records and
Reports); 803(9) (Records of Vital Statistics); 803(11) (Records of Reli
gious Organizations); 803(12) (Marriage, Baptismal, and Similar
Certificates); 803(13) (Family Records); 804(b)(3) (Statement Against
Interest); see also Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S. __, __
(2009) (slip op., at 18) (“Business and public records are generally
admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an
exception to the hearsay rules, but because—having been created for
the administration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of
establishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not testimonial”);
Giles v. California, 554 U. S., at 376 (noting in the context of domestic
violence that “[s]tatements to friends and neighbors about abuse and
intimidation and statements to physicians in the course of receiving
treatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay rules”); Craw
ford, 541 U. S., at 56 (“Most of the hearsay exceptions covered state
ments that by their nature were not testimonial—for example, business
records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy”).
