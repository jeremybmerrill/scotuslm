MICHIGAN v. BRYANT
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

about to die and aware that death was imminent. Were
the issue properly tendered here, I would take up the
question whether the exception for dying declarations
survives our recent Confrontation Clause decisions. The
Michigan Supreme Court, however, held, as a matter of
state law, that the prosecutor had abandoned the issue.
See 483 Mich. 132, 156â€“157, 768 N. W. 2d 65, 78 (2009).
The matter, therefore, is not one the Court can address in
this case.
