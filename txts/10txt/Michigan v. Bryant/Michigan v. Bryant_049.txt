SCALIA, J., dissenting

sible) a defendant will have no constitutionally protected
right to exclude the uncross-examined testimony of such
witnesses. His conviction could rest (as perhaps it did
here) solely on the officers’ recollection at trial of the
witnesses’ accusations.
The Framers could not have envisioned such a hollow
constitutional guarantee. No framing-era confrontation
case that I know of, neither here nor in England, took such
an enfeebled view of the right to confrontation. For exam
ple, King v. Brasier, 1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng. Rep. 202,
202–203 (K. B. 1779), held inadmissible a mother’s ac
count of her young daughter’s statements “immediately on
her coming home” after being sexually assaulted. The
daughter needed to testify herself. But today’s majority
presumably would hold the daughter’s account to her
mother a nontestimonial statement made during an ongo
ing emergency. She could not have known whether her
attacker might reappear to attack again or attempt to
silence the lone witness against him. Her mother likely
listened to the account to assess the threat to her own
safety and to decide whether the rapist posed a threat
to the community that required the immediate interven
tion of the local authorities. Cf. ante, at 29–30. Utter
nonsense.
The 16th- and 17th-century English treason trials that
helped inspire the Confrontation Clause show that today’s
decision is a mistake. The Court’s expansive definition of
an “ongoing emergency” and its willingness to consider the
perspective of the interrogator and the declarant cast a
more favorable light on those trials than history or our
past decisions suggest they deserve. Royal officials con
ducted many of the ex parte examinations introduced
against Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir John Fenwick while
investigating alleged treasonous conspiracies of unknown
scope, aimed at killing or overthrowing the King. See
