Opinion of the Court

potential scope of the dispute and therefore the emergency
in this case thus stretches more broadly than those at
issue in Davis and Hammon and encompasses a threat
potentially to the police and the public.
This is also the first of our post-Crawford Confrontation
Clause cases to involve a gun. The physical separation
that was sufficient to end the emergency in Hammon was
not necessarily sufficient to end the threat in this case;
Covington was shot through the back door of Bryant’s
house. Bryant’s argument that there was no ongoing
emergency because “[n]o shots were being fired,” Brief for
Respondent 27, surely construes ongoing emergency too
narrowly. An emergency does not last only for the time
between when the assailant pulls the trigger and the
bullet hits the victim. If an out-of-sight sniper pauses
between shots, no one would say that the emergency
ceases during the pause. That is an extreme example and
not the situation here, but it serves to highlight the im
plausibility, at least as to certain weapons, of construing
the emergency to last only precisely as long as the violent
act itself, as some have construed our opinion in Davis.
See Brief for Respondent 23–25.
At no point during the questioning did either Covington
or the police know the location of the shooter. In fact,
Bryant was not at home by the time the police searched
his house at approximately 5:30 a.m. 483 Mich., at 136,
768 N. W. 2d, at 67. At some point between 3 a.m. and
5:30 a.m., Bryant left his house. At bottom, there was an
ongoing emergency here where an armed shooter, whose
motive for and location after the shooting were unknown,
had mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks
and a few minutes of the location where the police found
Covington.17

readily distinguishable from the “treasonous conspiracies of unknown
