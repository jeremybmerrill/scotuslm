SCALIA, J., dissenting

the purposes of both the declarant and the police: It “ame
liorates problems that . . . arise” when declarants have
“mixed motives.” Ante, at 21. I am at a loss to know how.
Sorting out the primary purpose of a declarant with mixed
motives is sometimes difficult. But adding in the mixed
motives of the police only compounds the problem. Now
courts will have to sort through two sets of mixed motives
to determine the primary purpose of an interrogation.
And the Court’s solution creates a mixed-motive problem
where (under the proper theory) it does not exist—viz.,
where the police and the declarant each have one motive,
but those motives conflict. The Court does not provide an
answer to this glaringly obvious problem, probably be
cause it does not have one.
The only virtue of the Court’s approach (if it can be
misnamed a virtue) is that it leaves judges free to reach
the “fairest” result under the totality of the circumstances.
If the dastardly police trick a declarant into giving an
incriminating statement against a sympathetic defendant,
a court can focus on the police’s intent and declare the
statement testimonial. If the defendant “deserves” to go to
jail, then a court can focus on whatever perspective is
necessary to declare damning hearsay nontestimonial.
And when all else fails, a court can mix-and-match per
spectives to reach its desired outcome. Unfortunately,
under this malleable approach “the guarantee of confron
tation is no guarantee at all.” Giles v. California, 554

Looking to the declarant’s purpose (as we should), this is
an absurdly easy case. Roughly 25 minutes after Anthony
Covington had been shot, Detroit police responded to a 911
call reporting that a gunshot victim had appeared at a
neighborhood gas station. They quickly arrived at the
scene, and in less than 10 minutes five different Detroit
