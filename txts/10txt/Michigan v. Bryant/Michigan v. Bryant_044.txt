MICHIGAN v. BRYANT
SCALIA, J., dissenting

police officers questioned Covington about the shooting.
Each asked him a similar battery of questions: “what
happened” and when, App. 39, 126, “who shot” the victim,”
id., at 22, and “where” did the shooting take place, id., at
132. See also id., at 113. After Covington would answer,
they would ask follow-up questions, such as “how tall is”
the shooter, id., at 134, “[h]ow much does he weigh,” ibid.
what is the exact address or physical description of the
house where the shooting took place, and what chain
of events led to the shooting. The battery relented when
the paramedics arrived and began tending to Covington’s
wounds.
From Covington’s perspective, his statements had little
value except to ensure the arrest and eventual prosecution
of Richard Bryant. He knew the “threatening situation,”
Davis, 547 U. S., at 832, had ended six blocks away and 25
minutes earlier when he fled from Bryant’s back porch.
See 483 Mich. 132, 135–136, 768 N.W. 2d 65, 67 (2009);
App. 105. Bryant had not confronted him face-to-face
before he was mortally wounded, instead shooting him
through a door. See 483 Mich., at 136–137, 768 N.W. 2d,
at 67. Even if Bryant had pursued him (unlikely), and
after seeing that Covington had ended up at the gas sta
tion was unable to confront him there before the police
arrived (doubly unlikely), it was entirely beyond imagina
tion that Bryant would again open fire while Covington
was surrounded by five armed police officers. And Coving
ton knew the shooting was the work of a drug dealer, not a
spree killer who might randomly threaten others. Id., at
135, 137, 768 N.W. 2d, at 67.
Covington’s knowledge that he had nothing to fear
differs significantly from Michelle McCottry’s state of
mind during her “frantic” statements to a 911 operator at
issue in Davis, 547 U. S., at 827. Her “call was plainly a
call for help against a bona fide physical threat” describing
“events as they were actually happening.” Ibid. She did
