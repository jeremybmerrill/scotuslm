Opinion of the Court

fied about what Covington had told them. The jury re
turned a guilty verdict on charges of second-degree
murder, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and pos
session of a firearm during the commission of a felony.
Bryant appealed, and the Michigan Court of Appeals
affirmed his conviction. No. 247039, 2004 WL 1882661
(Aug. 24, 2004) (per curiam). Bryant then appealed to the
Supreme Court of Michigan, arguing that the trial court
erred in admitting Covington’s statements to the police.
The Supreme Court of Michigan eventually remanded the
case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of
our 2006 decision in Davis. 477 Mich. 902, 722 N. W. 2d
797 (2006). On remand, the Court of Appeals again af
firmed, holding that Covington’s statements were properly
admitted because they were not testimonial. No. 247039,
2007 WL 675471 (Mar. 6, 2007) (per curiam). Bryant
again appealed to the Supreme Court of Michigan, which
reversed his conviction. 483 Mich. 132, 768 N. W. 2d 65.

that Covington’s statements to the police were testimonial
under Crawford and Davis and were therefore inadmissi

ments were admissible as “excited utterances” under the
Michigan Rules of Evidence. 483 Mich., at 142, and n. 6,
768 N. W. 2d, at 70, and n. 6. There was no dispute that
Covington was unavailable at trial and Bryant had no
prior opportunity to cross-examine him. The court there
fore assessed whether Covington’s statements to the police
identifying and describing the shooter and the time and
location of the shooting were testimonial hearsay for
purposes of the Confrontation Clause. The court con
cluded that the circumstances “clearly indicate that the
‘primary purpose’ of the questioning was to establish the
facts of an event that had already occurred; the ‘primary
purpose’ was not to enable police assistance to meet an
ongoing emergency.” Id., at 143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. The
