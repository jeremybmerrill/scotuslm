MICHIGAN v. BRYANT
Opinion of the Court

court explained that, in its view, Covington was describing
past events and as such, his “primary purpose in making
these statements to the police . . . was . . . to tell the police
who had committed the crime against him, where the
crime had been committed, and where the police could find
the criminal.” Id., at 144, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. Noting
that the officers’ actions did not suggest that they per
ceived an ongoing emergency at the gas station, the court
held that there was in fact no ongoing emergency. Id., at
145–147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71–73. The court distinguished
the facts of this case from those in Davis, where we held a
declarant’s statements in a 911 call to be nontestimonial.
It instead analogized this case to Hammon v. Indiana,
which we decided jointly with Davis and in which we
found testimonial a declarant’s statements to police just
after an assault. See 547 U. S., at 829–832. Based on this
analysis, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the
admission of Covington’s statements constituted prejudi
cial plain error warranting reversal and ordered a new
trial. 483 Mich., at 151–153, 768 N. W. 2d, at 75–76. The
court did not address whether, absent a Confrontation
Clause bar, the statements’ admission would have been
otherwise consistent with Michigan’s hearsay rules or due
process.1

1 The Supreme Court of Michigan held that the question whether the
victim’s statements would have been admissible as “dying declarations”
was not properly before it because at the preliminary examination, the
prosecution, after first invoking both the dying declaration and excited
utterance hearsay exceptions, established the factual foundation only
for admission of the statements as excited utterances. The trial court
ruled that the statements were admissible as excited utterances and
did not address their admissibility as dying declarations. 483 Mich., at
153–154, 768 N. W. 2d, at 76–77. This occurred prior to our 2004
decision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, where we first
suggested that dying declarations, even if testimonial, might be admis
sible as a historical exception to the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 56,
n. 6; see also Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358–359 (2008). We
