resulted in the type of nontestimonial statements we
contemplated in Davis.
Finally, we consider the informality of the situation and
the interrogation. This situation is more similar, though
not identical, to the informal, harried 911 call in Davis
than to the structured, station-house interview in Craw

was fluid and somewhat confused: the officers arrived at
different times; apparently each, upon arrival, asked
Covington “what happened?”; and, contrary to the dis
sent’s portrayal, post, at 7–9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), they

suggests that the interrogators’ primary purpose was
simply to address what they perceived to be an ongoing
emergency, and the circumstances lacked any formality
that would have alerted Covington to or focused him on
the possible future prosecutorial use of his statements.
Because the circumstances of the encounter as well as
