MICHIGAN v. BRYANT
Opinion of the Court

N. W. 2d, at 71. But in doing so, the court construed Davis
to have decided more than it did and thus employed an
unduly narrow understanding of “ongoing emergency” that
Davis does not require.
First, the Michigan Supreme Court repeatedly and
incorrectly asserted that Davis “defined” “ ‘ongoing emer
gency.’ ” 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 73; see also
id., at 144, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71–72. In fact, Davis did not
even define the extent of the emergency in that case. The
Michigan Supreme Court erroneously read Davis as decid
ing that “the statements made after the defendant stopped
assaulting the victim and left the premises did not occur
during an ‘ongoing emergency.’ ” 483 Mich., at 150, n. 15,
768 N. W. 2d, at 75, n. 15. We explicitly explained in
Davis, however, that we were asked to review only the
testimonial nature of Michelle McCottry’s initial state
ments during the 911 call; we therefore merely assumed
the correctness of the Washington Supreme Court’s hold
ing that admission of her other statements was harmless,
without deciding whether those subsequent statements
were also made for the primary purpose of resolving an
ongoing emergency. 547 U. S., at 829.
Second, by assuming that Davis defined the outer
bounds of “ongoing emergency,” the Michigan Supreme
Court failed to appreciate that whether an emergency
exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent in
quiry. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20.
Davis and Hammon involved domestic violence, a known
and identified perpetrator, and, in Hammon, a neutralized
threat. Because Davis and Hammon were domestic vio
lence cases, we focused only on the threat to the victims
and assessed the ongoing emergency from the perspective
of whether there was a continuing threat to them. 547
U. S., at 827, 829–830.
Domestic violence cases like Davis and Hammon often
have a narrower zone of potential victims than cases
