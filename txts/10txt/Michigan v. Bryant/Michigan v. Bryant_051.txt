SCALIA, J., dissenting

utterances hearsay exception into the Constitution. Ante,
at 14–15. A statement during an ongoing emergency is
sufficiently reliable, the Court says, “because the prospect
of fabrication . . . is presumably significantly diminished,”
so it “does not [need] to be subject to the crucible of cross
examination.” Id., at 14.
Compare that with the holding of Crawford: “Where
testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of
reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is
the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confronta
tion.” 541 U. S., at 68–69. Today’s opinion adopts, for
emergencies and faux emergencies at least, the discredited
logic of White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 355–356, and n. 8
(1992), and Idaho v. Wright, 497 U. S. 805, 819–820
(1990). White is, of course, the decision that both Craw
ford and Davis found most incompatible with the text and
history of the Confrontation Clause. See Davis, supra, at
825; Crawford, supra, at 58, n. 8. (This is not to say that
that “reliability” logic can actually justify today’s result:
Twenty-five minutes is plenty of time for a shooting victim
to reflect and fabricate a false story.)
The Court announces that in future cases it will look to
“standard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some
statements as reliable,” when deciding whether a state
ment is testimonial. Ante, at 11–12. Ohio v. Roberts, 448
U. S. 56 (1980) said something remarkably similar: An
out-of-court statement is admissible if it “falls within a
firmly rooted hearsay exception” or otherwise “bears ade
quate ‘indicia of reliability.’ ” Id., at 66. We tried that
approach to the Confrontation Clause for nearly 25 years
before Crawford rejected it as an unworkable standard
unmoored from the text and the historical roots of the
Confrontation Clause. See 541 U. S., at 54, 60, 63–65, 67–
68. The arguments in Raleigh’s infamous 17th-century
treason trial contained full debate about the reliability of
Lord Cobham’s ex parte accusations, see Raleigh’s Case,
