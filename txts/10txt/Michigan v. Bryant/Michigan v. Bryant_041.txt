SCALIA, J., dissenting

than a narrative of past events; it is a solemn declaration
made in the course of a criminal trial. For an out-of-court
statement to qualify as testimonial, the declarant must
intend the statement to be a solemn declaration rather
than an unconsidered or offhand remark; and he must
make the statement with the understanding that it may
be used to invoke the coercive machinery of the State
against the accused.1 See Friedman, Grappling with the
Meaning of “Testimonial,” 71 Brooklyn L. Rev. 241, 259
(2005). That is what distinguishes a narrative told to a
friend over dinner from a statement to the police. See
Crawford, supra, at 51. The hidden purpose of an interro
gator cannot substitute for the declarant’s intentional
solemnity or his understanding of how his words may be
used.
A declarant-focused inquiry is also the only inquiry that
would work in every fact pattern implicating the Confron
tation Clause. The Clause applies to volunteered testi
mony as well as statements solicited through police inter
rogation. See Davis, supra, at 822–823, n. 1. An inquiry
into an officer’s purposes would make no sense when a
declarant blurts out “Rick shot me” as soon as the officer
arrives on the scene. I see no reason to adopt a different
test—one that accounts for an officer’s intent—when the
officer asks “what happened” before the declarant makes
his accusation. (This does not mean the interrogator is
irrelevant. The identity of an interrogator, and the con
tent and tenor of his questions, can bear upon whether a
declarant intends to make a solemn statement, and envi
sions its use at a criminal trial. But none of this means
that the interrogator’s purpose matters.)
In an unsuccessful attempt to make its finding of emer

actors are testimonial. See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823,
n. 2 (2006).
