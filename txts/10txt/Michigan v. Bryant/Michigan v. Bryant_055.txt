SCALIA, J., dissenting

Judicial decisions, like the Constitution itself, are noth
ing more than “parchment barriers,” 5 Writings of James
Madison 269, 272 (G. Hunt ed. 1901). Both depend on a
judicial culture that understands its constitutionally
assigned role, has the courage to persist in that role when
it means announcing unpopular decisions, and has the
modesty to persist when it produces results that go
against the judges’ policy preferences. Today’s opinion
falls far short of living up to that obligation—short on the
facts, and short on the law.
For all I know, Bryant has received his just deserts. But
he surely has not received them pursuant to the proce
dures that our Constitution requires. And what has been
taken away from him has been taken away from us all.
