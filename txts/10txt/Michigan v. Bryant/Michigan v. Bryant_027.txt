Opinion of the Court

See n. 11, supra. In determining whether a declarant’s
statements are testimonial, courts should look to all of the
relevant circumstances. Even JUSTICE SCALIA concedes
that the interrogator is relevant to this evaluation, post,
at 3, and we agree that “[t]he identity of an interrogator,
and the content and tenor of his questions,” ibid., can illu
minate the “primary purpose of the interrogation.” The
dissent, see post, at 3–5 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), criticizes
the complexity of our approach, but we, at least, are un
willing to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity. Simpler is not
always better, and courts making a “primary purpose”
assessment should not be unjustifiably restrained from
consulting all relevant information, including the state
ments and actions of interrogators.
Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of the
interrogation by examining the statements and actions of
all participants is also the approach most consistent with
our past holdings. E.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 822–823, n. 1
(noting that “volunteered testimony” is still testimony and
remains subject to the requirements of the Confrontation
Clause).
IV
As we suggested in Davis, when a court must determine
whether the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of a
statement at trial, it should determine the “primary pur
pose of the interrogation” by objectively evaluating the
statements and actions of the parties to the encounter, in
light of the circumstances in which the interrogation
occurs. The existence of an emergency or the parties’
perception that an emergency is ongoing is among the
most important circumstances that courts must take into
account in determining whether an interrogation is tes
timonial because statements made to assist police in
addressing an ongoing emergency presumably lack the
testimonial purpose that would subject them to the
