MICHIGAN v. BRYANT
Opinion of the Court

ments as reliable, will be relevant. Where no such pri
mary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is
the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the
Confrontation Clause.5
Deciding this case also requires further explanation of
the “ongoing emergency” circumstance addressed in Davis.
Because Davis and Hammon arose in the domestic vio
lence context, that was the situation “we had immediately
in mind (for that was the case before us).” 547 U. S., at
826. We now face a new context: a nondomestic dispute,
involving a victim found in a public location, suffering
from a fatal gunshot wound, and a perpetrator whose
location was unknown at the time the police located the
victim. Thus, we confront for the first time circumstances
in which the “ongoing emergency” discussed in Davis
extends beyond an initial victim to a potential threat to
the responding police and the public at large. This new
context requires us to provide additional clarification with
regard to what Davis meant by “the primary purpose of
the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an
ongoing emergency.” Id., at 822.
III
To determine whether the “primary purpose” of an
interrogation is “to enable police assistance to meet an
ongoing emergency,” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822, which would
render the resulting statements nontestimonial, we objec
tively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter
occurs and the statements and actions of the parties.

5 See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823–824 (2006) (explaining
the question before the Court as “whether the Confrontation Clause
applies only to testimonial hearsay” and answering in the affirmative
because “[a] limitation so clearly reflected in the text of the constitu
tional provision must fairly be said to mark out not merely its ‘core,’ but
its perimeter”). See also post, at 2 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
