Opinion of the Court 


A

The Michigan Supreme Court correctly understood that
this inquiry is objective.6 483 Mich., at 142, 768 N. W. 2d,
at 70. Davis uses the word “objective” or “objectively” no
fewer than eight times in describing the relevant inquiry.
See 547 U. S., at 822, 826–828, 830–831, and n. 5; see, e.g.,
id., at 826 (“The question before us in Davis, then, is
whether, objectively considered, the interrogation that
took place in the course of the 911 call produced testimo
nial statements”). “Objectively” also appears in the defini
tions of both testimonial and nontestimonial statements
that Davis established. Id., at 822.
An objective analysis of the circumstances of an encoun
ter and the statements and actions of the parties to it
provides the most accurate assessment of the “primary
purpose of the interrogation.” The circumstances in which
an encounter occurs—e.g., at or near the scene of the crime
versus at a police station, during an ongoing emergency
or afterwards—are clearly matters of objective fact. The
statements and actions of the parties must also be objec
tively evaluated. That is, the relevant inquiry is not the
subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in
a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that rea
sonable participants would have had, as ascertained from
the individuals’ statements and actions and the circum
stances in which the encounter occurred.7

suggests that Michigan is arguing for “a subjective analysis
of the intent of the interrogator’s questioning.” Brief for Respondent
12. We do not read Michigan’s brief to be arguing for a subjective
inquiry, and any such argument would be in error. We do not under
stand the dissent to disagree that the inquiry is objective.
7 This approach is consistent with our rejection of subjective inquiries
in other areas of criminal law. See, e.g., Whren v. United States, 517
U. S. 806, 813 (1996) (refusing to evaluate Fourth Amendment reason
ableness subjectively in light of the officers’ actual motivations); New
York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655–656, and n. 6 (1984) (holding that
an officer’s subjective motivation is irrelevant to determining the
