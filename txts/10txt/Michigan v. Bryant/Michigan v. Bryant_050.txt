MICHIGAN v. BRYANT
SCALIA, J., dissenting

yers as Amicus Curiae 21–22, and n. 11. Social stability in
16th- and 17th-century England depended mainly on the
continuity of the ruling monarch, cf. 1 J. Stephen, A His
tory of the Criminal Law of England 354 (1883), so such a
conspiracy posed the most pressing emergency imaginable.
Presumably, the royal officials investigating it would have
understood the gravity of the situation and would have
focused their interrogations primarily on ending the
threat, not on generating testimony for trial. I therefore

He was a traitor! He spoke, as Raleigh correctly observed,
to establish Raleigh’s guilt and to save his own life. See 1
D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832). Cobham’s state
ments, when assessed from his perspective, had only a
testimonial purpose. The same is true of Covington’s
statements here.

But today’s decision is not only a gross distortion of the
facts. It is a gross distortion of the law—a revisionist

According to today’s opinion, the Davis inquiry into
whether a declarant spoke to end an ongoing emergency or
rather to “prove past events potentially relevant to later
criminal prosecution,” 547 U. S., at 822, is not aimed at
answering whether the declarant acted as a witness.
Instead, the Davis inquiry probes the reliability of a decla
rant’s statements, “[i]mplicit[ly]” importing the excited
