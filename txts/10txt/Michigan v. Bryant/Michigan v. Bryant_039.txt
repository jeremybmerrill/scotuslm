JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.
Today’s tale—a story of five officers conducting suc

purpose, not of obtaining and preserving his testimony
regarding his killer, but of protecting him, them, and

transparently false that professing to believe it demeans
this institution. But reaching a patently incorrect conclu

affects, after all, only the case at hand. In its vain attempt
to make the incredible plausible, however—or perhaps as
an intended second goal—today’s opinion distorts our
Confrontation Clause jurisprudence and leaves it in a
shambles. Instead of clarifying the law, the Court makes
itself the obfuscator of last resort. Because I continue to
adhere to the Confrontation Clause that the People
adopted, as described in Crawford v. Washington, 541
U. S. 36 (2004), I dissent.
