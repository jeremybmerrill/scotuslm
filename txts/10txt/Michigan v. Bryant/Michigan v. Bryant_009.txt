Opinion of the Court

The majority’s opinion provoked two dissents, both of
which would have held Covington’s statements admissible
because they were made in circumstances indicating that
their “primary purpose” was to assist police in addressing
an ongoing emergency. Id., at 157, 768 N. W. 2d, at 79
(opinion of Weaver, J.); id., at 157–158, 768 N. W. 2d, at
79 (opinion of Corrigan, J.). Justice Corrigan’s dissent
explained that the time and space between “the onset of
an emergency and statements about that emergency
clearly must be considered in context.” Id., at 161, 768
N. W. 2d, at 80. Justice Corrigan concluded that the
objective circumstances of Covington’s interaction with
police rendered this case more similar to the nontestimo
nial statements in Davis than to the testimonial state
ments in Crawford. 483 Mich., at 164, 768 N. W. 2d,
at 82.
We granted certiorari to determine whether the Con
frontation Clause barred admission of Covington’s state
ments. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).
II
The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment
states: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall
enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses
against him.” The Fourteenth Amendment renders the
Clause binding on the States. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S.
400, 403 (1965). In Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66
(1980), we explained that the confrontation right does not
bar admission of statements of an unavailable witness if
the statements “bea[r] adequate ‘indicia of reliability.’ ”
——————
noted in Crawford that we “need not decide in this case whether the
Sixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying
declarations.” 541 U. S., at 56, n. 6. Because of the State’s failure to
preserve its argument with regard to dying declarations, we similarly
need not decide that question here. See also post, p. __ (GINSBURG, J.,
dissenting).
