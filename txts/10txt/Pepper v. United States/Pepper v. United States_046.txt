JASON PEPPER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT

[March 2, 2011] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.
I would affirm the Court of Appeals and uphold Pepper’s
sentence. As written, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines
do not permit district courts to impose a sentence below
the Guidelines range based on the defendant’s postsen
tencing rehabilitation.1 See United States Sentencing
Commission, Guidelines Manual §5K2.19 (Nov. 2010)
(USSG). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.
In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265
(2005), the Court rendered the entire Guidelines scheme
advisory, a remedy that was “far broader than necessary
to correct constitutional error.” Kimbrough v. United
States, 552 U. S. 85, 114 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).
Because there is “no principled way to apply the Booker
remedy,” I have explained that it is “best to apply the
statute as written, including 18 U. S. C. §3553(b), which
makes the Guidelines mandatory,” unless doing so would
actually violate the Sixth Amendment. Id., at 116; see
Booker, supra, at 313–326 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in
part); Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 61 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Irizarry v. United States, 553 U. S.
708, 717 (2008) (THOMAS, J., concurring).
I would apply the Guidelines as written in this case
——————
1 I agree with the Court that the law of the case doctrine did not con
trol Pepper’s resentencing. See ante, at 29–31.
