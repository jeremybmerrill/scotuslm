PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., dissenting

because doing so would not violate the Sixth Amendment.
The constitutional problem arises only when a judge
makes “a finding that raises the sentence beyond the
sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by refer
ence to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defen
dant.” Booker, supra, at 313 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).
Pepper admitted in his plea agreement to involvement
with between 1,500 and 5,000 grams of methamphetamine
mixture, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life under
21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(A)(viii).2 United States v. Pepper,
412 F. 3d 995, 996 (CA8 2005). Because Pepper has ad
mitted facts that would support a much longer sentence
than the 65 months he received, there is no Sixth Amend
ment problem in this case.
Under a mandatory Guidelines regime, Pepper’s sen
tence was proper. The District Court correctly calculated
the Guidelines range, incorporated a USSG §5K1.1 depar
ture and the Government’s motion under Federal Rule
of Criminal Procedure 35(b), and settled on a 65-month
sentence. Guideline §5K2.19 expressly prohibits down
ward departures based on “[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative
efforts, even if exceptional.” Nor is there any provision in
the Guidelines for the “variance” Pepper seeks, as such
variances are creations of the Booker remedy. I would
therefore affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold
Pepper’s sentence.
Although this outcome would not represent my own
policy choice, I am bound by the choices made by Congress
and the Federal Sentencing Commission. Like the major
ity, I believe that postsentencing rehabilitation can be
highly relevant to meaningful resentencing. See ante, at
13–15. In light of Pepper’s success in escaping drug addic

2 Pepper also stated that he understood both the 10-year statutory
minimum and that the Government was making no promises about any
exceptions.
