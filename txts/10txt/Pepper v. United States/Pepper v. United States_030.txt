PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

gorically to ignore not only postsentencing rehabilitation,
but any postsentencing information, including, for exam
ple, evidence that a defendant had committed postsentenc
ing offenses. Our precedents, however, provide no basis to
support such a categorical bar. See, e.g., Wasman, 468
U. S., at 572 (“[A] sentencing authority may justify an
increased sentence by affirmatively identifying relevant
conduct or events that occurred subsequent to the original
sentencing proceedings”); cf. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395
U. S. 711, 723 (1969). Indeed, even the Court of Appeals
below does not accept the logical consequence of its ap
proach as it permits district courts to consider postsen
tencing conduct that would support a higher sentence.
See United States v. Stapleton, 316 F. 3d 754, 757 (CA8
2003). Nothing in §§3553(a) and 3661, however, remotely
suggests that Congress intended district courts to consider
only postsentencing evidence detrimental to a defendant
while turning a blind eye to favorable evidence of a defen
dant’s postsentencing rehabilitation. Cf. United States v.
Jones, 460 F. 3d 191, 196 (CA2 2006) (“Obviously, the
discretion that Booker accords sentencing judges to impose
non-Guidelines sentences cannot be an escalator that only
goes up”).
Finally, we note that §§3553(a)(5) and (a)(6) describe
only two of the seven sentencing factors that courts must
consider in imposing sentence. At root, amicus effectively
invites us to elevate two §3553(a) factors above all others.
We reject that invitation. See Gall, 552 U. S., at 49–50
(instructing sentencing courts to “consider all of the
§3553(a) factors” (emphasis added)).
D
For the reasons stated above, we hold that the Court of
Appeals erred in categorically precluding the District
Court from considering evidence of Pepper’s postsentenc
ing rehabilitation after his initial sentence was set aside
