PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

sentencing framework applies both at a defendant’s initial
sentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after a
sentence has been set aside on appeal. See 18 U. S. C.
§3742(g) (“A district court to which a case is remanded . . .
shall resentence a defendant in accordance with section
3553”); see also Dillon v. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 10) (distinguishing between “sentence
modification proceedings” under 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2),
which “do not implicate the interests identified in Booker,”
and “plenary resentencing proceedings,” which do).
B
In light of the federal sentencing framework described
above, we think it clear that when a defendant’s sentence
has been set aside on appeal and his case remanded for
resentencing, a district court may consider evidence of a
defendant’s rehabilitation since his prior sentencing and
that such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a
downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.
Preliminarily, Congress could not have been clearer in
directing that “[n]o limitation . . . be placed on the infor
mation concerning the background, character, and con
duct” of a defendant that a district court may “receive and
consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sen
tence.” 18 U. S. C. §3661. The plain language of §3661
makes no distinction between a defendant’s initial sen
tencing and a subsequent resentencing after a prior sen
tence has been set aside on appeal. We have recognized
that “the broad language of §3661” does not provide “any
basis for the courts to invent a blanket prohibition against
considering certain types of evidence at sentencing.”
Watts, 519 U. S., at 152. A categorical bar on the consid
eration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence would
directly contravene Congress’ expressed intent in §3661.
In addition, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation
may be highly relevant to several of the §3553(a) factors
