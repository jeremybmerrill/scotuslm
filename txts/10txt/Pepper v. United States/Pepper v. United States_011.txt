Opinion of the Court

Memorandum in No. 03–CR–4113–LRR (ND Iowa), Doc.
198, pp. 7, 10. The court also rejected Pepper’s request for
a downward variance based on, inter alia, his postsentenc
ing rehabilitation. Id., at 16.
The District Court reconvened Pepper’s resentencing
hearing in January 2009. The court’s decision to grant a
20 percent downward departure for substantial assistance
resulted in an advisory Guidelines range of 77 to 97

The Court of Appeals affirmed Pepper’s 65-month sen

but concluded that Pepper’s argument was foreclosed by
Circuit precedent holding that “post-sentencing rehabilita

downward variance.” Id., at 964–965 (citing United States
v. Jenners, 473 F. 3d 894, 899 (CA8 2007); United States v.
McMannus, 496 F. 3d 846, 852, n. 4 (CA8 2007)).
The Court of Appeals also rejected Pepper’s claim that

Pepper II and Pepper III required the District Court to

5 After the District Court resentenced Pepper to 65 months’ impris
onment, Pepper was returned to federal custody. On July 22, 2010,
after we granted Pepper’s petition for a writ of certiorari, the District
Court granted his motion for release pending disposition of the case
here.
