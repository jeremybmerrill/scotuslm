PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

to invalidate §3742(g)(2).12
Amicus contends that any constitutional infirmity in
§3742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating §3742(j)(1)(B)
rather than §3742(g)(2). Brief for Amicus Curiae in Sup
port of Judgment Below 21–22. Section 3742(j)(1)(B)
provides that a “ground of departure” is “permissible” for
purposes of §3742(g)(2)(B) only if it is, inter alia, “author
ized under section 3553(b).” In Booker, we noted that
“statutory cross-references” to the SRA provisions we
invalidated were also constitutionally infirm. 543 U. S., at
259. Because §3742(j)(1)(B) incorporates a cross-reference
to §3553(b)(1), one of the provisions we invalidated in
Booker, amicus suggests that invalidating §3742(j)(1)(B)
would cure any constitutional defect in §3742(g)(2)(B). As
the Government explains, however, even if §3742(j)(1)(B)
were invalidated and a district court could depart on any
ground at an initial sentencing, the district court would
not be able to depart on any new ground at resentencing
so long as §3742(g)(2) remains in force. Because amicus’
proposed solution would still result in the Guidelines
being effectively mandatory at resentencing in an entire
set of cases, it fails to remedy the fundamental constitu
tional defect of §3742(g)(2).

12 Amicus

National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers
(NACDL) argues that, because §3742(g)(2)(B) permits a non-Guidelines
sentence only with respect to certain “departures,” that provision
“appears to preclude sentencing courts on remand from granting any
and all variances under Section 3553(a).” Brief for NACDL as Amicus
Curiae 11 (emphasis added). In Irizarry v. United States, 553 U. S. 708
(2008), we held that a “ ‘[d]eparture’ is a term of art under the Guide
lines and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed under the
framework set out in the Guidelines”; in contrast, a “variance” refers to
a non-Guidelines sentence outside the Guidelines framework. Id., at
714. Irizarry’s holding construed the term “departure” in Rule 32(h) of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because we conclude that
§3742(g)(2) is constitutionally infirm and must be invalidated, we need
not decide whether its reference to “departure[s]” includes variances.
