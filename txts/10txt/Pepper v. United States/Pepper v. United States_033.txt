California, 460 U. S. 605, 618 (1983). This doctrine “di
rects a court’s discretion, it does not limit the tribunal’s
power.” Ibid. Accordingly, the doctrine “does not apply if
the court is ‘convinced that [its prior decision] is clearly
erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.’ ” Agostini
v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 236 (1997) (quoting Arizona, 460
U. S., at 618, n. 8; alteration in original).
Pepper argues that, because the original sentencing
judge’s decision to grant the 40 percent departure was
never set aside by the Court of Appeals or this Court, it
constituted the law of the case. As such, Pepper contends
that Chief Judge Reade should not have disturbed that
ruling absent “compelling justification” for overturning it.
Brief for Petitioner 56. According to Pepper, because
Chief Judge Reade identified no such justification, the law

at 949, 953. Thus, even assuming, arguendo, that the
original sentencing court’s decision to impose a 40 percent
departure was at one point law of the case, Pepper III
effectively wiped the slate clean. To be sure, Pepper III
vacated Pepper’s 24-month sentence on grounds unrelated
to the substantial assistance departure, but that fact does
not affect our conclusion. “A criminal sentence is a pack
age of sanctions that the district court utilizes to effectu
ate its sentencing intent.” United States v. Stinson, 97
F. 3d 466, 469 (CA11 1996) (per curiam). Because a dis
trict court’s “original sentencing intent may be under
mined by altering one portion of the calculus,” United
States v. White, 406 F. 3d 827, 832 (CA7 2005), an appel
