PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of BREYER, J.

that rests upon them.
IV
In sum, the sentencing statutes, as we have interpreted
them, require courts of appeals to review sentences for
reasonableness, including sentences that depart or vary
from a specific Guideline. The appellate courts should
review those decisions more closely when they rest upon
disagreement with Guidelines policy. Kimbrough, 552
U. S., at 109. They should review those decisions with
greater deference when they rest upon case-specific cir
cumstances that place the case outside a specific Guide
line’s “heartland.” See ibid.; Rita, 551 U. S., at 351; Koon,
518 U. S., at 98–99.
By interpreting the sentencing statutes in this way, we
can remain faithful to Congress’ basic intent in writing
them—despite the need to invalidate statutory provisions
that conflict with the Sixth Amendment. The statutes
create a Sentencing Commission with authority to develop
sentencing policy embodied in the Guidelines. The Guide
lines are to further the statutes’ basic objective, namely
greater sentencing uniformity, while also taking account
of special individual circumstances, primarily by permit
ting the sentencing court to depart in nontypical cases. By
collecting trial courts’ reasons for departure (or variance),
by examining appellate court reactions, by developing
statistical and other empirical information, by considering
the views of expert penologists and others, the Commis
sion can revise the Guidelines accordingly. See USSG ch.
1, pt. A1, §3. Trial courts, appellate courts, and the Com
mission all have a role to play in what is meant to be an
iterative, cooperative institutional effort to bring about a
more uniform and a more equitable sentencing system.
See id., at 1–15. I would interpret the statutes before us
accordingly.
