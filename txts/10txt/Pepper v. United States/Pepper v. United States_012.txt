PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

reduce the applicable Guidelines range by at least 40
percent pursuant to USSG §5K1.1. The court noted that
its remand orders in Pepper II and Pepper III were “gen
eral remand[s] for resentencing,” which “did not place any
limitations on the discretion of the newly assigned district
court judge in resentencing.” 570 F. 3d, at 963. The court
further noted that, although issues decided by an appel
late court become law of the case on remand to the sen
tencing court, its earlier decisions merely held that a 40
percent downward departure for substantial assistance
was not an abuse of discretion, not that the district court
would be bound by the 40 percent departure previously
granted. Id., at 963–964.
We granted Pepper’s petition for a writ of certiorari, 561
U. S. ___ (2010), to decide two questions: (1) whether a
district court, after a defendant’s sentence has been set
aside on appeal, may consider evidence of a defendant’s
postsentencing rehabilitation to support a downward
variance when resentencing the defendant, a question that
has divided the Courts of Appeals;6 and (2) whether the
resentencing court was required, under the law of the case
doctrine, to apply the same percentage departure from the
Guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been
applied at Pepper’s prior sentencing. Because the United
States has confessed error in the Court of Appeals’ ruling
on the first question, we appointed an amicus curiae to

6 Compare, e.g., United States v. Lorenzo, 471 F. 3d 1219, 1221 (CA11
2006) (per curiam) (precluding consideration of postsentencing rehabili
tative conduct); United States v. Sims, 174 F. 3d 911, 913 (CA8 1999)
(same), with United States v. Lloyd, 469 F. 3d 319, 325 (CA3 2006)
(permitting consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation in excep
tional cases); United States v. Hughes, 401 F. 3d 540, 560, n. 19 (CA4
2005) (instructing district court to adjust Guidelines calculation on
remand “if new circumstances have arisen or events occurred since
[defendant] was sentenced that impact the range prescribed by the
guidelines”).
