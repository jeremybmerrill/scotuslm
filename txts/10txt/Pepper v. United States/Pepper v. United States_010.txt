PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

per’s] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by 40% pur
suant to USSG §5K1.1.” United States v. Pepper, No. 03–
CR–4113–LRR, 2007 WL 2076041, *4 (ND Iowa 2007). In
the meantime, Pepper petitioned this Court for a writ of
certiorari, and in January 2008, we granted the petition,
vacated the judgment in Pepper II, and remanded the case
to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of
Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38 (2007). See Pepper v.
United States, 552 U. S. 1089 (2008).
On remand, the Court of Appeals held that Gall did not
alter its prior conclusion that “post-sentence rehabilitation
is an impermissible factor to consider in granting a down
ward variance.” 518 F. 3d 949, 953 (CA8 2008) (Pepper
III). The court again reversed the sentence and remanded
for resentencing.
In October 2008, Chief Judge Reade convened Pepper’s
second resentencing hearing. Pepper informed the court
that he was still attending school and was now working as
a supervisor for the night crew at a warehouse retailer,
where he was recently selected by management as “associ
ate of the year” and was likely to be promoted the follow
ing January. App. 320, 323. Pepper also stated that he
had recently married and was now supporting his wife and
her daughter. Id., at 321. Pepper’s father reiterated that
Pepper was moving forward in both his career and his
family life and that he remained in close touch with
his son. See id., at 300–304.
In December 2008, Chief Judge Reade issued a sentenc
ing memorandum. Noting that the remand language of
Pepper III was nearly identical to the language in Pepper
II, the court again observed that it was “not bound to
reduce [Pepper’s] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by
40%” for substantial assistance and concluded that Pepper
was entitled only to a 20 percent downward departure
because the assistance was “timely, helpful and impor
tant” but “in no way extraordinary.” Sealed Sentencing
