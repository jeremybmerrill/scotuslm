PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of BREYER, J.

closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge
varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge’s view
that the Guidelines range ‘fails properly to reflect §3553(a)
considerations’ even in a mine-run case.” 552 U. S., at

Unlike the majority, I would decide the question
Kimbrough left open. And I would follow its suggested
framework for evaluating “reasonableness.” As Kim
brough suggests, doing so takes proper account of the
comparative institutional abilities of trial courts, appellate
courts, and the Sentencing Commission. The trial court
typically better understands the individual circumstances
of particular cases before it, while the Commission has
comparatively greater ability to gather information, to
consider a broader national picture, to compare sentences
attaching to different offenses, and ultimately to write
more coherent overall standards that reflect nationally
uniform, not simply local, sentencing policies.
Applying Kimbrough’s suggested framework, I would
reason very much as does the majority. The first question
is whether a sentencing judge might sometimes take ac
count of a (resentenced) offender’s postsentencing rehabili
tation—despite a Guideline policy statement that says
never. I would find that it is reasonable for the judge to
disregard the Guidelines’ absolute prohibition, despite the
Commission’s comparatively greater policy-formation
abilities. That is because the Guideline policy statement
itself runs counter to ordinary Guideline sentencing policy,
which rarely forbids departures and then for very strong
policy reasons. Supra, at 2. See USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b).
The Commission offers no convincing justification for
creating this exception with respect to postsentencing
rehabilitation. The Commission’s commentary says that
