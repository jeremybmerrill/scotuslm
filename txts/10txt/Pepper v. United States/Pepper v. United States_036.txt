PEPPER v. UNITED STATES 

Opinion of BREYER, J. 


I

The Guideline in question consists of a policy statement
that sets forth an exception to normal Guideline rules.
Normally, the Guidelines authorize a sentencing judge to
consider a departure from an ordinary Guidelines sen
tence in any case “where conduct significantly differs from
the norm” to which “a particular guideline linguistically
applies.” USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b) (discussing the Guide
lines’ general approach to departures). The policy state
ment at issue is one of a handful of Guideline rules that
nonetheless forbid departure. It says that a defendant’s
“[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if excep
tional, . . . are not an appropriate basis for a downward
departure when resentencing.” USSG §5K2.19. The
policy statement thereby adds “Post-Sentencing Rehabili
tative Efforts” to such factors as race, sex, national origin,
creed, religion, and socioeconomic status, which the Guide
lines absolutely prohibit the sentencing judge from taking
into account. USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b).
II
Can a sentencing court, despite this policy statement,
take account of postsentencing rehabilitation in the par
ticular circumstances that this case presents? I cannot
find the answer to this question in the language of the
sentencing statutes, in sentencing traditions, in the preGuidelines case of Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241
(1949), or in this Court’s use of the word “advisory.” As
the majority points out, a sentencing statute forbids any
“ ‘limitation’ ” on the “ ‘information concerning the back
ground, character, and conduct’ ” that “ ‘a court . . . may . . .
consider.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §3661 (empha
sis deleted)). But this provision must refer to all relevant
information. See USSG §1B1.4 and comment. (generally
incorporating §3661, but noting that there are certain
factors that should not be considered for any purpose). If
