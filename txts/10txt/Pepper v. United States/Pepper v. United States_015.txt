Opinion of the Court

unlimited either as to the kind of information [they] may
consider, or the source from which it may come.” United
States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972).8
The SRA did constrain sentencing courts’ discretion in
important respects, most notably by making the Guide
lines mandatory, see 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed.,
Supp. IV), and by specifying various factors that courts
must consider in exercising their discretion, see §3553(a).
In our seminal decision in Booker, we held that where
facts found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence
increased the applicable Guidelines range, treating the
Guidelines as mandatory in those circumstances violated
the Sixth Amendment right of criminal defendants to be
tried by a jury and to have every element of an offense
proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt.
543 U. S., at 243–244. Our remedial opinion in Booker
invalidated two offending provisions in the SRA, see id., at
245 (invalidating 18 U. S. C. §§3553(b)(1), 3742(e)), and
instructed the district courts to treat the Guidelines as
“effectively advisory,” 543 U. S., at 245.
Our post-Booker opinions make clear that, although a
sentencing court must “give respectful consideration to the
Guidelines, Booker permits the court to tailor the sentence
in light of other statutory concerns as well.” Kimbrough v.
United States, 552 U. S. 85, 101 (2007) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, although the
“Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial
benchmark,” district courts may impose sentences within
statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all
of the factors listed in §3553(a), subject to appellate review
for “reasonableness.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 49–51. This

course, sentencing courts’ discretion under §3661 is subject to
constitutional constraints. See, e.g., United States v. Leung, 40 F. 3d
577, 586 (CA2 1994) (“A defendant’s race or nationality may play no
adverse role in the administration of justice, including at sentencing”).
