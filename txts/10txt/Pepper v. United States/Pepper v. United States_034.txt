PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing
plan . . . to satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U. S. C.
§3553(a),” Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 253
(2008). That is precisely what the Eighth Circuit did here.
Accordingly, because the Court of Appeals in Pepper III
remanded for de novo resentencing, we conclude that
Chief Judge Reade was not bound by the law of the case
doctrine to apply the same 40 percent departure that had
been applied at Pepper’s prior sentencing.

For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is
vacated in part and affirmed in part, and the case is re
manded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or deci
sion of this case.
