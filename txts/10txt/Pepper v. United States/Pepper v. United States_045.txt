Opinion of ALITO, J.

By the time of the enactment of the Sentencing Reform
Act in 1984, this scheme had fallen into widespread disre
pute. See, e.g., Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,
366 (1989) (noting “[f]undamental and widespread dissat
isfaction with the uncertainties and the disparities” of this
scheme); United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 142
(1980) (“It has been observed . . . that sentencing is one of
the areas of the criminal justice system most in need of
reform”); S. Rep. No. 98–223, p. 62 (1983) (“The shameful
disparity in criminal sentences is a major flaw in the
existing criminal justice system”). Under this system,
each federal district judge was free to implement his or
her individual sentencing philosophy, and therefore the
sentence imposed in a particular case often depended
heavily on the spin of the wheel that determined the judge
to whom the case was assigned. See Bullington v. Mis
souri, 451 U. S. 430, 444, n. 16 (1981) (“There has been no
attempt to separate policymaking from individual sentenc
ing determinations” (internal quotation marks omitted));
M. Frankel, Criminal Sentences: Law Without Order 5
(1973) (“[T]he almost wholly unchecked and sweeping
powers we give to judges in the fashioning of sentences are
terrifying and intolerable for a society that professes
devotion to the rule of law”).
Some language in today’s opinion reads like a paean to
that old regime, and I fear that it may be interpreted as
sanctioning a move back toward the system that prevailed
prior to 1984. If that occurs, I suspect that the day will
come when the irrationality of that system is once again
seen, and perhaps then the entire Booker line of cases will
be reexamined.
