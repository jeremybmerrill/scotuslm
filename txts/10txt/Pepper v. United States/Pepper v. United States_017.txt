Opinion of the Court

that Congress has expressly instructed district courts to
consider at sentencing. For example, evidence of postsen
tencing rehabilitation may plainly be relevant to “the
history and characteristics of the defendant.” §3553(a)(1).
Such evidence may also be pertinent to “the need for the
sentence imposed” to serve the general purposes of sen
tencing set forth in §3553(a)(2)—in particular, to “afford
adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” “protect the
public from further crimes of the defendant,” and “provide
the defendant with needed educational or vocational train
ing . . . or other correctional treatment in the most ef
fective manner.” §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(D); see McMannus, 496
F. 3d, at 853 (Melloy, J., concurring) (“In assessing . . .
deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation, 18
U. S. C. §3553(a)(2)(B)(C) & (D), there would seem to be no
better evidence than a defendant’s post-incarceration
conduct”). Postsentencing rehabilitation may also criti
cally inform a sentencing judge’s overarching duty under
§3553(a) to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater
than necessary” to comply with the sentencing purposes
set forth in §3553(a)(2).
As the original sentencing judge recognized, the exten
sive evidence of Pepper’s rehabilitation since his initial
sentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appro
priate sentence in this case. Most fundamentally, evi
dence of Pepper’s conduct since his release from custody in
June 2005 provides the most up-to-date picture of Pepper’s
“history and characteristics.” §3553(a)(1); see United
States v. Bryson, 229 F. 3d 425, 426 (CA2 2000) (“[A]
court’s duty is always to sentence the defendant as he
stands before the court on the day of sentencing”). At the
time of his initial sentencing in 2004, Pepper was a 25
year-old drug addict who was unemployed, estranged from
his family, and had recently sold drugs as part of a
methamphetamine conspiracy. By the time of his second
resentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug-free for
