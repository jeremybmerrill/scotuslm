PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

3553(a).
Although a separate statutory provision,
§3742(g)(2), prohibits a district court at resentencing from
imposing a sentence outside the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at
the prior sentencing—thus effectively precluding the court
from considering postsentencing rehabilitation for pur
poses of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence—that provi
sion did not survive our holding in United States v.
Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), and we expressly invalidate
it today.
We hold that when a defendant’s sentence has been set
aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may
consider evidence of the defendant’s postsentencing reha
bilitation and that such evidence may, in appropriate
cases, support a downward variance from the now
advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Sepa
rately, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ ruling that the law
of the case doctrine did not require the District Court in
this case to apply the same percentage departure from the
Guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been
applied at petitioner’s prior sentencing.

and charged with conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or
more of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U. S. C. §846.
After pleading guilty, Pepper appeared for sentencing
before then-Chief Judge Mark W. Bennett of the U. S.
District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. Pepper’s
sentencing range under the Guidelines was 97 to 121
months.1 The Government moved for a downward depar

datory minimum of 120 months’ imprisonment, the mandatory mini
mum did not apply because he was eligible for safety-valve relief
pursuant to 18 U. S. C. §3553(f) (2000 ed.) and §5C1.2 of the United
States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (Nov. 2003) (USSG).
