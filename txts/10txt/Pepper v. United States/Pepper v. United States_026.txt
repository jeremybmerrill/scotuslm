PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

sis of whether §3553(a) permits consideration of evidence
of postsentencing rehabilitation.
As we explained above, evidence of postsentencing
rehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the
sentencing factors that Congress has specifically in
structed district courts to consider. See supra, at 13–15
(discussing §§3553(a), (a)(1), (a)(2)(B)–(D)). Amicus, how
ever, argues that consideration of postsentencing reha
bilitation is inconsistent with two sentencing factors:
§3553(a)(5), which directs sentencing courts to consider
“any pertinent policy statement” of the Sentencing Com
mission, and §3553(a)(6), which requires courts to consider
“the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities
among defendants with similar records who have been
found guilty of similar conduct.”
With regard to §3553(a)(5), amicus points to the Sen
tencing Commission’s policy statement in USSG §5K2.19,
which provides that “[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative
efforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant
after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant
offense[,] are not an appropriate basis for a downward
departure when resentencing the defendant for that of
fense.” According to amicus, that policy statement is
“clear and unequivocal,” and as an exercise of the Sentenc
ing Commission’s “core function,” should be given effect.
——————
PROTECT Act of 2003, §401(e), 117 Stat. 671, was not aimed at prohib
iting district courts from considering postsentencing developments.
Rather, it was meant to ensure that under the then-mandatory Guide
lines system, when a particular departure was reversed on appeal, the
district court could not impose the same sentence on remand on the
basis of a different departure. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 108–66, pp. 58–
59 (2003) (noting that §401 of the PROTECT Act, inter alia, “prevent[s]
sentencing courts, upon remand, from imposing the same illegal depar
ture on a different theory”). Like the provisions invalidated in Booker,
then, the purpose of §3742(g)(2) was “to make Guidelines sentencing
even more mandatory than it had been.” 543 U. S. 220, 261 (2005). As
we recognized in Booker, that purpose has “ceased to be relevant.” Ibid.
