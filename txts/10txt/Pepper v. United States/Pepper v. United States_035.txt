JASON PEPPER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT

[March 2, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I join Part III of the Court’s opinion as to the second
question presented. As to the first question presented,
I agree with the Court’s conclusion. And I agree with
its opinion to the extent that it is consistent with this
concurrence.
Like the majority, I believe Booker requires us to hold
18 U. S. C. §3742(g)(2) unconstitutional. See ante, at 15–
21; United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005); see also
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000). And, like
the majority, I believe that the law does not require a
sentencing court to follow a Guideline policy statement
that forbids taking account of postsentencing rehabilita
tion. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines
Manual §5K2.19 (Nov. 2010) (USSG). I would emphasize,
however, that this conclusion does not leave a sentencing
court free to disregard the Guidelines at will. To the
contrary, the law permits the court to disregard the Guide
lines only where it is “reasonable” for a court to do so.
Booker, supra, at 261–262; Gall v. United States, 552 U. S.
38, 51–52 (2007); Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.
85, 109 (2007). And an appellate court must be guided by
the basic sentencing objectives of the statutes that create
the Guidelines in determining whether, in disregarding the
Guidelines, the sentencing court has acted unreasonably.
