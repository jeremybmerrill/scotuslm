ing courts to consider the widest possible breadth of
information about a defendant “ensures that the punish
ment will suit not merely the offense but the individual
defendant.” Wasman v. United States, 468 U. S. 559, 564
(1984).
In 1970, Congress codified the “longstanding principle
that sentencing courts have broad discretion to consider
various kinds of information” at 18 U. S. C. §3577 (1970
ed.). United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 151 (1997) (per

doing so, however, Congress recodified §3577 without
change at §3661. The Sentencing Commission, moreover,

unless otherwise prohibited by law. See 18 U. S. C.
§3661.” USSG §1B1.4 (2010) (emphasis added).
Both Congress and the Sentencing Commission thus
expressly preserved the traditional discretion of sentenc
