PEPPER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

mand to apply the Guidelines range, as §3742(g)(2) does,
will often result in a Sixth Amendment violation for the
reasons we explained in Booker. Accordingly, as with the
provisions in Booker, the proper remedy here is to invali
date §3742(g)(2).
The sentencing proceeding at issue in Booker itself
illustrates why §3742(g)(2) cannot withstand Sixth
Amendment scrutiny. The district court in Booker in
creased the defendant’s then-mandatory Guidelines range
based on a drug-quantity finding that it, rather than
the jury, made. 543 U. S., at 227. After we held that the
Guidelines must be treated as advisory, we remanded the
case for resentencing. Id., at 267. Had §3742(g)(2) re
mained valid after Booker, the district court on remand
would have been required to sentence within the Guide
lines range because it did not depart from the Guidelines
at the original sentencing. Accordingly, the resentencing
judge in Booker would have been required under
§3742(g)(2) to impose a Guidelines sentence based on
judge-found facts concerning drug quantity, the precise
result that Booker forbids.
The same result would occur in any sentencing in which
a district court erroneously refuses to impose a sentence
outside the Guidelines range “based on a misunderstand
ing of its authority to depart under or vary from the
Guidelines.” Reply Brief for United States 16. For exam
ple, if §3742(g)(2) remained valid, there would be no rem
edy at resentencing if a district court erroneously believed
the Guidelines were presumptively reasonable, see Nelson
v. United States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam)
(slip op., at 2), or if it mistakenly thought that a nonGuidelines sentence required extraordinary circum
stances, see Gall, 552 U. S., at 47, or if it incorrectly con
cluded that it could not vary from the Guidelines based on
a policy disagreement with their disparate treatment of
crack and powder cocaine, see Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at
