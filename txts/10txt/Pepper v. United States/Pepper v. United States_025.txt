Opinion of the Court

2
Amicus’ next cluster of arguments focuses on Congress’ sentencing objectives under §3553(a). Preliminarily,
amicus contends that even if §3742(g)(2) is constitution
ally invalid, that provision reflects a congressional policy
determination that only information available at the time
of original sentencing should be considered, and that this
policy determination should inform our analysis of
whether §3553(a) permits consideration of postsentencing
rehabilitation evidence. This argument, however, is based
on a faulty premise.
Contrary to amicus’ contention, §3742(g)(2) does not
reflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration
of evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation at resentenc
ing. To be sure, §3742(g)(2) has the incidental effect of
limiting the weight a sentencing court may place on post
sentencing rehabilitation by precluding the court from
resentencing outside the Guidelines range on a “ground of
departure” on which it did not previously rely. But on its
face, nothing in §3742(g)(2) prohibits a district court from
considering
postsentencing
developments—including
postsentencing rehabilitation—in selecting a sentence
within the applicable Guidelines range. Section 3742(g)(2)
also does not apply to resentencings that occur for reasons
other than when a sentence is overturned on appeal and
the case is remanded (e.g., when a sentence is set aside on
collateral review under 28 U. S. C. §2255). In such cir
cumstances, §3742(g)(2) does not restrict a district court at
all, much less with respect to consideration of postsentenc
ing developments. Accordingly, because we see no general
congressional policy reflected in §3742(g)(2) to preclude
resentencing courts from considering postsentencing
information,13 that provision has no bearing on our analy
