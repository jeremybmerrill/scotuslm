Opinion of the Court

contravenes Congress’ directives in §§3661 and 3553(a).
C
Amicus nevertheless advances two principal arguments
in defense of the Court of Appeals’ ruling: (1) 18 U. S. C.
§3742(g)(2), which restricts the discretion of a resentenc

sentencing rehabilitation; and (2) permitting district
courts to consider postsentencing rehabilitation would
defeat Congress’ objectives under §3553(a). We are not

“shall not impose a sentence outside the applicable
guidelines range except upon a ground that—
“(A) was specifically and affirmatively included in
the written statement of reasons required by section
3553(c) in connection with the previous sentencing of
the defendant prior to the appeal; and
“(B) was held by the court of appeals, in remanding
the case, to be a permissible ground of departure.”
In operation, §3742(g)(2) restricts the discretion of a dis

“ground of departure” that was expressly relied upon in
the prior sentencing and upheld on appeal. Amicus thus
correctly contends that, on its face, §3742(g)(2) effectively
forecloses a resentencing court from considering evidence
of a defendant’s postsentencing rehabilitation for purposes
of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence because, as a prac
tical matter, such evidence did not exist at the time of the
