Opinion of the Court

The Court of Appeals also rested its holding on this
ground, reasoning that “ ‘allowing [postsentencing reha
bilitation] evidence to influence [defendant’s] sentence
would be grossly unfair to the vast majority of defendants
who receive no sentencing-court review of any positive
post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts.’ ” 570 F. 3d, at 965
(quoting McMannus, 496 F. 3d, at 852, n. 4). But amicus
points to no evidence, nor are we aware of any, suggesting
that Congress enacted §3553(a)(6) out of a concern with
disparities resulting from the normal trial and sentencing
process.16 The differences in procedural opportunity that
may result because some defendants are inevitably sen
tenced in error and must be resentenced are not the kinds
of “unwarranted” sentencing disparities that Congress
sought to eliminate under §3553(a)(6). Cf. United States v.
LaBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 761–762 (1997) (disparity arising
from exercise of prosecutorial discretion not unwarranted);
United States v. Rhodes, 145 F. 3d 1375, 1381 (CADC
1998) (“Distinguishing between prisoners whose convic
tions are reversed on appeal and all other prisoners hardly
seems ‘unwarranted’ ”).
As the Government explains, moreover, the logic of the
Court of Appeals’ approach below—i.e., that “post-sentence
rehabilitation is not relevant . . . because the district court
could not have considered that evidence at the time of the
original sentencing,” 570 F. 3d, at 965 (internal quotation
marks omitted)—would require sentencing courts cate
——————
16 Indeed, some defendants will have a longer period of time between
initial custody and trial, or between trial and sentencing, and those
defendants—particularly if they are released on bail—will have a
greater opportunity to demonstrate postoffense, presentencing rehabili
tation. Even before Booker, the lower courts uniformly held that
evidence of such rehabilitation could provide a basis for departing from
the applicable Guidelines. See USSG App. C, Amdt. 602, comment.,
p. 74 (Nov. 2003) (“[D]epartures based on extraordinary post-offense
rehabilitative efforts prior to sentencing . . . have been allowed by every
circuit that has ruled on the matter”).
