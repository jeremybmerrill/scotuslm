JASON PEPPER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT

[March 2, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part, concurring in the
judgment in part, and dissenting in part.
I join Part III of the opinion of the Court. I agree with
the Court that the decision below cannot be affirmed on
the basis of 18 U. S. C. §3742(g), as amicus suggests. This
provision was designed to function as part of the manda
tory Guidelines scheme that the Court struck down in
United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265 (2005).
Although amicus’ argument is ingenious, even the sort of
surgery sanctioned in Booker cannot transform this provi
sion into one that can survive in the post-Booker world.
I also concur in the judgment to the extent that it holds
that the decision below regarding evidence of postsentenc
ing rehabilitation must be reversed. That decision, which
entirely precluded consideration of such evidence, was
consistent with the policy statement in §5K2.19 of the
United States Sentencing Guidelines, but “[t]he Booker
remedial decision . . . does not permit a court of appeals
to treat the Guidelines’ policy decisions as binding.”
Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 116 (2007)
(ALITO, J., dissenting).
Under Booker, however, district judges are still required
in almost all cases to give significant weight to the policy
decisions embodied in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.

61–67 (2007) (ALITO, J., dissenting). Congress delegated
