Opinion of the Court

on appeal. District courts post-Booker may consider evi
dence of a defendant’s postsentencing rehabilitation at
resentencing and such evidence may, in appropriate cases,
support a downward variance from the advisory Guide
lines range.17
The Government informs us that, in granting Pepper’s
motion for release pending disposition of this appeal, see
n. 5, supra, the District Court stated that it would not
have exercised its discretion to grant Pepper a downward
variance based on postsentencing rehabilitation. That
statement, however, was made in light of the Court of
Appeals’ erroneous views regarding postsentencing reha
bilitation evidence. Because we expressly reject those
views today, it is unclear from the record whether the
District Court would have imposed the same sentence had
it properly considered the extensive evidence of Pepper’s
postsentencing rehabilitation. On remand, the District
Court should consider and give appropriate weight to that
evidence, as well as any additional evidence concerning
Pepper’s conduct since his last sentencing in January
2009. Accordingly, we vacate the Eighth Circuit’s judg
ment in respect to Pepper’s sentence and remand the case
for resentencing consistent with this opinion.

The second question presented in this case merits only a
brief discussion. As noted above, the original sentencing
judge in this case granted Pepper a 40 percent downward
departure pursuant to USSG §5K1.1 based on Pepper’s

17 Of course, we do not mean to imply that a district court must re
duce a defendant’s sentence upon any showing of postsentencing
rehabilitation. Nor do we mean to preclude courts of appeals from
issuing limited remand orders, in appropriate cases, that may render
evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation irrelevant in light of the
narrow purposes of the remand proceeding. See, e.g., United States v.
Bernardo Sanchez, 569 F. 3d 995, 1000 (CA9 2009).
