Opinion of the Court

F. 3d, at 1313. We disagree.
As we have discussed, the Government exercises its
carefully delimited trust responsibilities in a sovereign
capacity to implement national policy respecting the In
dian tribes. The two features justifying the fiduciary
exception—the beneficiary’s status as the “real client” and
the trustee’s common-law duty to disclose information
about the trust—are notably absent in the trust relation
ship Congress has established between the United States
and the Tribe.

The Court of Appeals applied the fiduciary exception
based on its determination that the Tribe rather than
the Government was the “real client” with respect to the
Government attorneys’ advice. Ibid. In cases applying the
fiduciary exception, courts identify the “real client” based
on whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus,
whether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a per
sonal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the
advice could have been intended for any purpose other
than to benefit the trust. Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 711–712.
Applying these factors, we conclude that the United States
does not obtain legal advice as a “mere representative” of
the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the “real client” for whom that
advice is intended. See ibid.
Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of con
gressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe. Courts
look to the source of funds as a “strong indicator of pre
cisely who the real clients were” and a “significant factor”
in determining who ought to have access to the legal
advice. Id., at 712. We similarly find it significant that
the attorneys were paid by the Government for advice
regarding the Government’s statutory obligations.
The payment structure confirms our view that the Gov
ernment seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather
