Opinion of the Court

The fiduciary exception quickly became an established
feature of English common law, see, e.g., In re Mason, 22
Ch. D. 609 (1883), but it did not appear in this country
until the following century. American courts seem first
to have expressed skepticism. See In re Prudence-Bonds
Corp., 76 F. Supp. 643, 647 (EDNY 1948) (declining to
apply the fiduciary exception to the trustee of a bondhold
ing corporation because of the “important right of such a
corporate trustee . . . to seek legal advice and nevertheless
act in accordance with its own judgment”). By the 1970’s,
however, American courts began to adopt the English
common-law rule. See Garner v. Wolfinbarger, 430 F. 2d
1093, 1103–1104 (CA5 1970) (allowing shareholders, upon
a showing of “good cause,” to discover legal advice given to
corporate management).3
The leading American case on the fiduciary exception is
Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d
709 (Del. Ch. 1976). In that case, the beneficiaries of a
trust estate sought to compel the trustees to reimburse the

G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees §962, p. 68 (3d ed. 2010) (here
inafter Bogert). Some state courts have altogether rejected the notion
that the attorney-client privilege is subject to a fiduciary exception.
See, e.g., Huie v. DeShazo, 922 S. W. 2d 920, 924 (Tex. 1996) (“The
attorney-client privilege serves the same important purpose in the
trustee-attorney relationship as it does in other attorney-client rela
tionships”); Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Ct., 22 Cal. 4th 201, 208–209,
990 P. 2d 591, 595 (2000) (“[T]he attorney for the trustee of a trust is
not, by virtue of this relationship, also the attorney for the beneficiaries
of the trust” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Neither party before
this Court disputes the existence of a common-law fiduciary exception,
however, so in deciding this case we assume such an exception exists.
