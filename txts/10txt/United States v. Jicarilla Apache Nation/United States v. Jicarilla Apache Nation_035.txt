management is crucial.” Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 712. Courts
justifying the fiduciary exception under this rationale
have thus concluded that “[t]he policy of preserving the
full disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary rela
tionship is . . . ultimately more important than the pro
tection of the trustees’ confidence in the attorney for the
trust.” Id., at 714; see Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063 (under this
rationale, “the fiduciary exception can be understood as an
instance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the
face of a competing legal principle”). The majority fails to
appreciate the important oversight and accountability
interests that underlie this rationale for the fiduciary ex
ception, or explain why they operate with any less force in
the Indian trust context.

The question in this case is whether the fiduciary excep
tion applies in the Indian trust context such that the
Government may not rely on the attorney-client privilege
to withhold from the Nation communications between the
Government and its attorneys relating to the administra
tion of the Nation’s trust fund accounts. Answering that
question requires a proper understanding of the nature of
the Government’s trust relationship with Indian tribes,
particularly with regard to its management of Indian trust
funds.
Since 1831, this Court has recognized the existence of a
general trust relationship between the United States and
Indian tribes. See Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17
(1831) (Marshall, C. J.). Our decisions over the past cen
tury have repeatedly reaffirmed this “distinctive obliga
tion of trust incumbent upon the Government” in its deal
ings with Indians. Seminole Nation v. United States, 316
U. S. 286, 296 (1942); see United States v. Mitchell, 463
U. S. 206, 225–226 (1983) (Mitchell II) (collecting cases
and noting “the undisputed existence of a general trust
