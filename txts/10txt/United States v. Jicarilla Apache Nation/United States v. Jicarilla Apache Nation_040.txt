UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

policy); see generally Cobell v. Norton, 240 F. 3d 1081,
1086–1088 (CADC 2001) (same, and describing that his
tory as “contentious and tragic”).
In the specific context of Indian trust fund management,
however, federal Indian policy entirely aligns the interests
of the Government as trustee and the Indian tribe as
beneficiary. As explained above, Congress has enacted an
extensive network of statutes regulating the Government’s
management of Indian trust fund accounts. That statu
tory framework establishes a “conventional fiduciary re
lationship” in the context of Indian trust fund admini
stration. Navajo Nation II, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
14) (internal quotation marks omitted); see supra, at 7–9.
As a conventional fiduciary, the Government’s manage
ment of Indian trust funds must “be judged by the most
exacting fiduciary standards.” Seminole Nation, 316 U. S.,
at 296–297. Among the most fundamental fiduciary obli
gations of a trustee is “to administer the trust solely in the
interest of the beneficiaries.” 2A A. Scott & W. Fratcher,
Law of Trusts §170, p. 311 (4th ed. 1987); see Meinhard v.
Salmon, 249 N. Y. 458, 464, 164 N. E. 545, 546 (1928)
(Cardozo, C. J.) (“Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of
an honor the most sensitive,” is “the standard of behavior”
for trustees “bound by fiduciary ties”). Although Indian
trust funds are deposited in the United States Treasury,
“they are not part of the federal government’s general
funds and can be used only for the benefit of the tribe.”
Cohen §5.03[3][b], at 408, and n. 140 (citing Quick Bear v.
Leupp, 210 U. S. 50, 80–81 (1908)).
Because federal Indian policy requires the Government
to act strictly as a conventional fiduciary in managing the
Nation’s trust funds, the Government acts in a “represen
tative” rather than “persona[l]” capacity when managing
the Nation’s trust funds. Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 713. By law,
the Government cannot pursue any “independent” inter
