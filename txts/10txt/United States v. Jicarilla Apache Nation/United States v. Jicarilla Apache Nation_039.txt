In light of Federal Rule of Evidence 501 and the Gov
ernment’s role as a conventional fiduciary in managing
Indian trust fund accounts, I would hold as a matter of

Indian policy” that diverges from the interest of the Na

(1926). Throughout the history of the Federal Govern
ment’s dealings with Indian tribes, Congress has altered
and administered the trust relationship “as an instrument
of federal policy.” Ante, at 17, n. 8 (detailing shifts in
