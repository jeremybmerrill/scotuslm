the privilege narrowly. Fisher v. United States, 425 U. S.
391, 403 (1976). It applies “only where necessary to
achieve its purpose,” ibid.; “[w]here this purpose ends, so
too does the protection of the privilege,” Wachtel v. Health
Net, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 231 (CA3 2007).
The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege
has its roots in 19th-century English common-law cases
holding that, “when a trustee obtained legal advice relat
ing to his administration of the trust, and not in antici
pation of adversarial legal proceedings against him, the
beneficiaries of the trust had the right to the production of
that advice.” Ibid. (collecting cases). The fiduciary excep
tion is now well recognized in the jurisprudence of both
federal and state courts,1 and has been applied in a wide
variety of contexts, including in litigation involving com
mon-law trusts, see, e.g., Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington,
D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976), disputes
between corporations and shareholders, see, e.g., Garner v.
Wolfinbarger, 430 F. 2d 1093 (CA5 1970), and ERISA
enforcement actions, see, e.g., United States v. Doe, 162
F. 3d 554 (CA9 1999).
The majority correctly identifies the two rationales
courts have articulated for applying the fiduciary excep
tion, ante, at 8–9, but its description of those rationales
omits a number of important points. With regard to the
first rationale, courts have characterized the trust benefi
ciary as the “real client” of legal advice relating to trust
