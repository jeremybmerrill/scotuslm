Opinion of the Court

rights” between private parties is well established. The
Government consents to be liable to private parties “and
may yield this consent upon such terms and under such
restrictions as it may think just.” Murray’s Lessee v.
Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 283
(1856). This creates an important distinction “between
cases of private right and those which arise between the
Government and persons subject to its authority in con
nection with the performance of the constitutional func
tions of the executive or legislative departments.” Crowell
v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50 (1932).
Throughout the history of the Indian trust relationship,
we have recognized that the organization and manage
ment of the trust is a sovereign function subject to the
plenary authority of Congress. See Merrion v. Jicarilla
Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 169, n. 18 (1982) (“The
United States retains plenary authority to divest the
tribes of any attributes of sovereignty”); United States v.
Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 319 (1978) (“Congress has plenary
authority to legislate for the Indian tribes in all matters,
including their form of government”); Winton v. Amos, 255
U. S. 373, 391 (1921) (“Congress has plenary authority
over the Indians and all their tribal relations, and full
power to legislate concerning their tribal property”); Lone
Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 553, 565 (1903) (“Plenary
authority over the tribal relations of the Indians has been
exercised by Congress from the beginning, and the power
has always been deemed a political one, not subject to be
controlled by the judicial department of the government”);
Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 294, 308 (1902)
(“The power existing in Congress to administer upon and
guard the tribal property, and the power being political
and administrative in its nature, the manner of its exer
cise is a question within the province of the legislative
branch to determine, and is not one for the courts”); see
also United States v. Candelaria, 271 U. S. 432, 439
