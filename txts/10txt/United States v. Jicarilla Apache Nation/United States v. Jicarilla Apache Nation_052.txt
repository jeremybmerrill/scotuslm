UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

context. The majority’s refusal to apply the fiduciary
exception in this case deprives the Nation—as well as the
Indian tribes in the more than 90 cases currently pending
in the federal courts involving claims of tribal trust mis
management, App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a–138a—of highly
relevant information going directly to the merits of
whether the Government properly fulfilled its fiduciary
duties. Its holding only further exacerbates the concerns
expressed by many about the lack of adequate oversight
and accountability that has marked the Government’s
handling of Indian trust fund accounts for decades.
But perhaps even more troubling than the majority’s
refusal to apply the fiduciary exception in this case is its
disregard of our established precedents that affirm the
central role that common-law trust principles play in
defining the Government’s fiduciary obligations to Indian
tribes. By rejecting the Nation’s claim on the ground that
it fails to identify a specific statutory right to the commu
nications at issue, the majority effectively embraces an
approach espoused by prior dissents that rejects the role of
common-law principles altogether in the Indian trust
context. Its decision to do so in a case involving only a
narrow evidentiary issue is wholly unnecessary and, worse
yet, risks further diluting the Government’s fiduciary
obligations in a manner that Congress clearly did not
intend and that would inflict serious harm on the already
frayed relationship between the United States and Indian
tribes. Because there is no warrant in precedent or reason
for reaching that result, I respectfully dissent.
