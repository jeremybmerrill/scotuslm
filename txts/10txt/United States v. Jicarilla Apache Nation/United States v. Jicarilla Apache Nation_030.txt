UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION
GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment

fore concludes that the trust relationship described by 25
U. S. C. §162a does not include the usual “common-law
disclosure obligations.” Ante, at 21. Because it is unnec
essary to decide what information other than attorney
client communications the Government may withhold
from the beneficiaries of tribal trusts, I concur only in the
Court’s judgment.
