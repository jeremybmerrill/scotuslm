UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION
Opinion of the Court

than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Undoubt
edly, Congress intends the Indian tribes to benefit from
the Government’s management of tribal trusts. That
intention represents “a humane and self imposed policy”
based on felt “moral obligations.” Seminole Nation, 316
U. S., at 296–297. This statutory purpose does not imply a
full common-law trust, however. Cf. Restatement 2d, §25,
Comment b (“No trust is created if the settlor manifests an
intention to impose merely a moral obligation”). Congress
makes such policy judgments pursuant to its sovereign
governing authority, and the implementation of federal
policy remains “distinctly an interest of the United
States.” Heckman, 224 U. S., at 437.7 We have said that
“the United States continue[s] as trustee to have an active
interest” in the disposition of Indian assets because the
terms of the trust relationship embody policy goals of the
United States. McKay v. Kalyton, 204 U. S. 458, 469
(1907).
In some prior cases, we have found that the Government
had established the trust relationship in order to impose
its own policy on Indian lands. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S.,
at 544 (Congress “intended that the United States ‘hold
the land . . . in trust’ . . . because it wished to prevent
alienation of the land”). In other cases, the Government
has invoked its trust relationship to prevent state inter
ference with its policy toward the Indian tribes. See Min
nesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382, 386 (1939); Cande
laria, 271 U. S., at 442–444; United States v. Kagama, 118
U. S. 375, 382–384 (1886). And the exercise of federal
authority thereby established has often been “left under
the acts of Congress to the discretion of the Executive
——————
7 Chief Justice Hughes, writing for a unanimous Court, insisted that
the “national interest” in the management of Indian affairs “is not to be
expressed in terms of property, or to be limited to the assertion of rights
incident to the ownership of a reversion or to the holding of a technical
title in trust.” Heckman, 224 U. S., at 437.
