Opinion of the Court

Department.” Heckman, supra, at 446. In this way, Con
gress has designed the trust relationship to serve the
interests of the United States as well as to benefit the
Indian tribes. See United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432,
443 (1903) (trust relationship “ ‘authorizes the adoption on
the part of the United States of such policy as their own
public interests may dictate’ ” (quoting Choctaw Nation v.
United States, 119 U. S. 1, 28 (1886))).8
We cannot agree with the Tribe and its amici that “[t]he
government and its officials who obtained the advice have
no stake in [the] substance of the advice, beyond their
trustee role,” Brief for Respondent 9, or that “the United
States’ interests in trust administration were identical to
——————
8 Congress has structured the trust relationship to reflect its consid
ered judgment about how the Indians ought to be governed. For
example, the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was
“a comprehensive congressional attempt to change the role of Indians in
American society.” F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law §1.04,
p. 77 (2005) (hereinafter Cohen). Congress aimed to promote the
assimilation of Indians by dividing Indian lands into individually
owned allotments. The federal policy aimed “to substitute a new in
dividual way of life for the older Indian communal way.” Id., at 79.
The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, marked a shift
away “from assimilation policies and toward more tolerance and respect
for traditional aspects of Indian culture.” Cohen §1.05, at 84. The Act
prohibited further allotment and restored tribal ownership. Id., at 86.
The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975,
88 Stat. 2203, and the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, 108 Stat.
4270, enabled tribes to run health, education, economic development,
and social programs for themselves. Cohen §1.07, at 103. This
strengthened self-government supported Congress’ decision to author
ize tribes to withdraw trust funds from Federal Government control
and place the funds under tribal control. American Indian Trust Fund
Management Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, 4242–4244; see 25
U. S. C. §§4021–4029 (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The control over the
Indian tribes that has been exercised by the United States pursuant to
the trust relationship—forcing the division of tribal lands, restraining
alienation—does not correspond to the fiduciary duties of a common
law trustee. Rather, the trust relationship has been altered and
administered as an instrument of federal policy.
