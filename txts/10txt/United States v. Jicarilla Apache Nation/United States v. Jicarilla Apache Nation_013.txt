Opinion of the Court

trustees could not withhold those attorney-client commu
nications from the beneficiaries.
Second, the court concluded that the trustees’ fiduciary
duty to furnish trust-related information to the benefi
ciaries outweighed their interest in the attorney-client
privilege. “The policy of preserving the full disclosure
necessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship,” the court
explained, “is here ultimately more important than the
protection of the trustees’ confidence in the attorney for
the trust.” Id., at 714. Because more information helped
the beneficiaries to police the trustees’ management of the
trust, disclosure was, in the court’s judgment, “a weight
ier public policy than the preservation of confidential
attorney-client communications.” Ibid.
The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary ex
ception based on the same two criteria. See, e.g., In re
Long Island Lighting Co., 129 F. 3d 268, 272 (CA2 1997);
Wachtel v. Health Net, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 233–234 (CA3
2007); Solis v. Food Employers Labor Relations Assn.,
2011 U. S. App. LEXIS 9110, *12 (CA4, May 4, 2011);
Wildbur v. Arco Chemical Co., 974 F. 2d 631, 645 (CA5
1992); United States v. Evans, 796 F. 2d 264, 265–266
(CA9 1986) (per curiam). Not until the decision below had
a federal appellate court held the exception to apply to the
United States as trustee for the Indian tribes.
B
In order to apply the fiduciary exception in this case, the
Court of Appeals analogized the Government to a private
trustee. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. We have applied that analogy
in limited contexts, see, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 463
U. S. 206, 226 (1983) (Mitchell II), but that does not mean
the Government resembles a private trustee in every
respect. On the contrary, this Court has previously noted
that the relationship between the United States and the
Indian tribes is distinctive, “different from that existing
