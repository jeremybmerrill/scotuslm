UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION
Opinion of the Court

est in trust administration, and that the trustee is subject
to a general common-law duty of disclosure—do not apply

The Jicarilla Apache Nation (Tribe) occupies a 900,000

various laws, including 25 U. S. C. §§161a and 162a, that

and the Tribe participated in alternative dispute resolu
