Opinion of the Court

has charged itself with moral obligations of the highest
responsibility and trust,” Seminole Nation v. United
States, 316 U. S. 286, 296–297 (1942), obligations “to the
fulfillment of which the national honor has been commit
ted,” Heckman, supra, at 437. Congress has expressed
this policy in a series of statutes that have defined and
redefined the trust relationship between the United States
and the Indian tribes. In some cases, Congress estab
lished only a limited trust relationship to serve a narrow
purpose. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 544 (Congress in
tended the United States to hold land “ ‘in trust’ ” under
the General Allotment Act “simply because it wished to
prevent alienation of the land and to ensure that allottees
would be immune from state taxation”); Navajo I, 537
U. S., at 507–508 (Indian Mineral Leasing Act imposes no
“detailed fiduciary responsibilities” nor is the Government
“expressly invested with responsibility to secure ‘the needs
and best interests of the Indian owner’ ”).
In other cases, we have found that particular “statutes
and regulations . . . clearly establish fiduciary obligations
of the Government” in some areas. Mitchell II, supra, at
226; see also United States v. White Mountain Apache
Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475 (2003). Once federal law imposes
such duties, the common law “could play a role.” United
States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (Navajo
II) (slip op., at 14). We have looked to common-law princi
ples to inform our interpretation of statutes and to deter
mine the scope of liability that Congress has imposed. See
White Mountain Apache Tribe, supra, at 475–476. But the
applicable statutes and regulations “establish [the] fiduci
ary relationship and define the contours of the United
States’ fiduciary responsibilities.” Mitchell II, supra, at
224. When “the Tribe cannot identify a specific, applica
ble, trust-creating statute or regulation that the Govern
ment violated, . . . neither the Government’s ‘control’ over
[Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.”
