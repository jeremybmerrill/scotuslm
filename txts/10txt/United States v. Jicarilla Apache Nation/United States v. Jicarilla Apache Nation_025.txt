Opinion of the Court

this duty of disclosure overrides the attorney-client privi
lege. United States v. Mett, 178 F. 3d 1058, 1063 (CA9
1999) (“[T]he fiduciary exception can be understood as an
instance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the
face of a competing legal principle”).
The United States, however, does not have the same
common-law disclosure obligations as a private trustee.
As we have previously said, common-law principles are
relevant only when applied to a “specific, applicable, trust
creating statute or regulation.” Navajo II, 556 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 14). The relevant statute in this case is 25
U. S. C. §162a(d), which delineates “trust responsibilities
of the United States” that the Secretary of the Interior
must discharge. The enumerated responsibilities include
a provision identifying the Secretary’s obligation to pro
vide specific information to tribal account holders: The
Secretary must “suppl[y] account holders with periodic
statements of their account performance” and must make
“available on a daily basis” the “balances of their account.”
§162a(d)(5). The Secretary has complied with these re
quirements by adopting regulations that instruct the
Office of Trust Fund Management to provide each tribe
with a quarterly statement of performance, 25 CFR
§115.801 (2010), that identifies “the source, type, and
status of the trust funds deposited and held in a trust
account; the beginning balance; the gains and losses;
receipts and disbursements; and the ending account bal
ance of the quarterly statement period,” §115.803. Tribes
may request more frequent statements or further “infor
——————
alter the terms of the trust by statute, even in derogation of tribal
property interests. See Winton v. Amos, 255 U. S. 373, 391 (1921) (“It is
thoroughly established that Congress has plenary authority over the
Indians . . . and full power to legislate concerning their tribal prop
erty”); Cohen §5.02[4], at 401–403. The Government has not advanced
the argument that the relationship here is similar to a revocable trust,
and the point need not be addressed to resolve this case.
