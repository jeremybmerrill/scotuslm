Opinion of the Court

between individuals whether dealing at arm’s length, as
trustees and beneficiaries, or otherwise.” Klamath and
Moadoc Tribes v. United States, 296 U. S. 244, 254 (1935)
(emphasis added). “The general relationship between the
United States and the Indian tribes is not comparable to a
private trust relationship.” Cherokee Nation of Okla. v.
United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 565, 573 (1990) (emphasis added).
The Government, of course, is not a private trustee.
Though the relevant statutes denominate the relationship
between the Government and the Indians a “trust,” see,
e.g., 25 U. S. C. §162a, that trust is defined and governed
by statutes rather than the common law. See United
States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 506 (2003)
(Navajo I) (“[T]he analysis must train on specific rights
creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory pre

gress may style its relations with the Indians a “trust”

The difference between a private common-law trust and
the statutory Indian trust follows from the unique position
of the Government as sovereign. The distinction between

‘trust’ is sometimes used loosely to cover such relationships. It is
important to differentiate trusts from these other relationships, since
many of the rules applicable to trusts are not applicable to them.”
Restatement (Second) of Trusts §4, Introductory Note, p. 15 (1957)
(hereinafter Restatement 2d); see also Begay v. United States, 16 Cl. Ct.
107, 127, n. 17 (1987) (“[T]he provisions relating to private trustees and
fiduciaries, while useful as analogies, cannot be regarded as finally
dispositive in a government-Indian trustee-fiduciary relationship”).
