SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Accordingly, although the “general ‘contours’ of the
government’s obligations” are defined by statute, the “in
terstices must be filled in through reference to general
trust law.” Cobell, 240 F. 3d, at 1101 (quoting Mitchell II,
463 U. S., at 224). This approach accords with our recog
nition in other trust contexts that “the primary function of
the fiduciary duty is to constrain the exercise of discre
tionary powers which are controlled by no other specific
duty imposed by the trust instrument or the legal regime.”
Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 504 (1996) (emphasis
deleted); cf. Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas
Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559,
570 (1985) (“[R]ather than explicitly enumerating all of
the powers and duties of trustees and other fiduciaries,
Congress invoked the common law of trusts to define the
general scope of their authority and responsibility”).
Indeed, “[i]f the fiduciary duty applied to nothing more
than activities already controlled by other specific legal
duties, it would serve no purpose.” Howe, 516 U. S., at
504.
The majority pays lip service to these precedents, ac
knowledging that “[w]e have looked to common-law prin
ciples to inform our interpretation of statutes and to de
termine the scope of liability that Congress has imposed.”
Ante, at 13. But despite its assurance that it “will apply
common-law trust principles where Congress has indi
cated it is appropriate to do so,” ante, at 14, the majority
inexplicably rejects the application of common-law trust
principles in this case. In doing so, the majority states
that “[t]he common law of trusts does not override the
specific trust-creating statute and regulations that apply
here.” Ante, at 21–22 (referring to §162a(d)(5) and 25 CFR
§§115.801–115.803). That statement evidences the major
ity’s fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which
common-law principles operate in the context of a conven
tional fiduciary relationship.
