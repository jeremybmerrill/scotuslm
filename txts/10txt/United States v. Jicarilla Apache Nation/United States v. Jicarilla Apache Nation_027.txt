Opinion of the Court

By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at
issue in this case are classed “the property of the United
States” while other records are “the property of the tribe.”
25 CFR §115.1000 (2010); see also §§15.502, 162.111,
166.1000. Just as the source of the funds used to pay for
legal advice is highly relevant in identifying the “real
client” for purposes of the fiduciary exception, we consider
ownership of the resulting records to be a significant
factor in deciding who “ought to have access to the docu
ment.” See Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 712. In this case, that
privilege belongs to the United States.11

Courts and commentators have long recognized that
“[n]ot every aspect of private trust law can properly govern
the unique relationship of tribes and the federal govern
ment.” Cohen §5.02[2], at 434–435. The fiduciary excep
tion to the attorney-client privilege ranks among those
aspects inapplicable to the Government’s administration
of Indian trusts. The Court of Appeals denied the Gov
ernment’s petition for a writ of mandamus based on its
erroneous view to the contrary. We leave it for that court
to determine whether the standards for granting the writ

claim.” Id., at 1978. That Congress authorized the withholding of
information on grounds of privilege makes us doubt that Congress
understood the Government’s trust obligations to override so basic a
privilege as that between attorney and client.
11 The dissent tells us that applying the fiduciary exception is even
more important against the Government than against a private trustee
because of a “history of governmental mismanagement.” Post, at 21.
While it is not necessary to our decision, we note that the Indian tribes
are not required to keep their funds in federal trust. See 25 U. S. C.
§4022 (authorizing tribes to withdraw funds held in trust by the United
States); 25 CFR pt. 1200(B). If the Tribe wishes to have its funds
managed by a “conventional fiduciary,” post, at 10, it may seek to do so.
