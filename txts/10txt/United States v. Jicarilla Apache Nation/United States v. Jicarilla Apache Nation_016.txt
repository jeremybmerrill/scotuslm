UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION
Opinion of the Court

(1926); Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 315
(1911).
Because the Indian trust relationship represents an
exercise of that authority, we have explained that the
Government “has a real and direct interest” in the guardi
anship it exercises over the Indian tribes; “the interest is
one which is vested in it as a sovereign.” United States v.
Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194 (1926). This is especially so
because the Government has often structured the trust
relationship to pursue its own policy goals. Thus, while
trust administration “relat[es] to the welfare of the Indi
ans, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress
has prescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is dis
tinctly an interest of the United States.” Heckman v.
United States, 224 U. S. 413, 437 (1912); see also Cande
laria, supra, at 443–444.
In Heckman, the Government brought suit to cancel
certain conveyances of allotted lands by members of an
Indian tribe because the conveyances violated restrictions
on alienation imposed by Congress. This Court explained
that the Government brought suit as the representative of
the very Indian grantors whose conveyances it sought to
cancel, and those Indians were thereby bound by the
judgment. 224 U. S., at 445–446. But while it was for
mally acting as a trustee, the Government was in fact
asserting its own sovereign interest in the disposition of
Indian lands, and the Indians were precluded from inter
vening in the litigation to advance a position contrary to
that of the Government. Id., at 445. Such a result was
possible because the Government assumed a fiduciary role
over the Indians not as a common-law trustee but as the
governing authority enforcing statutory law.
We do not question “the undisputed existence of a gen
eral trust relationship between the United States and the
Indian people.” Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 225. The Gov
ernment, following “a humane and self imposed policy . . .
