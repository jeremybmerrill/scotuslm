Opinion of the Court

administers a tribal trust. 590 F. 3d, at 1315. The Gov
ernment may need to comply with other statutory duties,
such as the environmental and conservation obligations
that the Court of Appeals discussed. See id., at 1314–
1315. The Government may also face conflicting obliga
tions to different tribes or individual Indians. See, e.g.,
Nance v. EPA, 645 F. 2d 701, 711 (CA9 1981) (Federal
Government has “conflicting fiduciary responsibilities” to
the Northern Cheyenne and Crow Tribes); Hoopa Valley
Tribe v. Christie, 812 F. 2d 1097, 1102 (CA9 1986) (“No
trust relation exists which can be discharged to the plain
tiff here at the expense of other Indians”). Within the
bounds of its “general trust relationship” with the Indian
people, we have recognized that the Government has
“discretion to reorder its priorities from serving a sub
group of beneficiaries to serving the broader class of all
Indians nationwide.” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 195
(1993); see also ibid. (“Federal Government ‘does have a
fiduciary obligation to the Indians; but it is a fiduciary
obligation that is owed to all Indian tribes’ ” (quoting
Hoopa Valley Tribe, supra, at 1102)). And sometimes, we
have seen, the Government has enforced the trust statutes
to dispose of Indian property contrary to the wishes of
those for whom it was nominally kept in trust. The Gov
ernment may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in
balancing these competing interests. Indeed, the point of
consulting counsel may be to determine whether conflict
ing interests are at stake.
The Court of Appeals sought to accommodate the Gov
ernment’s multiple obligations by suggesting that the
Government may invoke the attorney-client privilege if it
identifies “a specific competing interest” that was consid
ered in the particular communications it seeks to with
hold. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. But the conflicting interests the
Government must consider are too pervasive for such a
case-by-case approach to be workable.
