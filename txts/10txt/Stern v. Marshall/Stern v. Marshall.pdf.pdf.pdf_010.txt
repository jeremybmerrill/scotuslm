STERN v. MARSHALL
Opinion of the Court

Howard. As she had in state court, Vickie alleged that
Pierce had wrongfully prevented J. Howard from taking
the legal steps necessary to provide her with half his
property. 547 U. S., at 301.
On November 5, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued
an order granting Vickie summary judgment on Pierce’s
claim for defamation. On September 27, 2000, after a
bench trial, the Bankruptcy Court issued a judgment
on Vickie’s counterclaim in her favor. The court later
awarded Vickie over $400 million in compensatory dam­
ages and $25 million in punitive damages. 600 F. 3d, at
1045; see 253 B. R. 550, 561–562 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.
2000); 257 B. R. 35, 39–40 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2000).
In post-trial proceedings, Pierce argued that the Bank­
ruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over Vickie’s counter­
claim. In particular, Pierce renewed a claim he had made
earlier in the litigation, asserting that the Bankruptcy
Court’s authority over the counterclaim was limited be­
cause Vickie’s counterclaim was not a “core proceeding”
under 28 U. S. C. §157(b)(2)(C). See 257 B. R., at 39. As
explained below, bankruptcy courts may hear and enter final judgments in “core proceedings” in a bankruptcy
case. In non-core proceedings, the bankruptcy courts
instead submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of
law to the district court, for that court’s review and issu­
ance of final judgment. The Bankruptcy Court in this case
concluded that Vickie’s counterclaim was “a core proceed­
ing” under §157(b)(2)(C), and the court therefore had
the “power to enter judgment” on the counterclaim under
§157(b)(1). Id., at 40.
The District Court disagreed.
It recognized that
“Vickie’s counterclaim for tortious interference falls within
the literal language” of the statute designating certain
proceedings as “core,” see §157(b)(2)(C), but understood
this Court’s precedent to “suggest[ ] that it would be un­
constitutional to hold that any and all counterclaims are
