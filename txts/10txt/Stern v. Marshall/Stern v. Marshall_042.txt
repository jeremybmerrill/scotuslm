officials.” Post, at 11. And even were we wrong in this
regard, that would only confirm that such judges should
not be in the business of entering final judgments in the
first place.
It does not affect our analysis that, as Vickie notes,
bankruptcy judges under the current Act are appointed by
the Article III courts, rather than the President. See Brief
for Petitioner 59. If—as we have concluded—the bank­
ruptcy court itself exercises “the essential attributes of
judicial power [that] are reserved to Article III courts,”
Schor, 478 U. S., at 851 (internal quotation marks omit­
ted), it does not matter who appointed the bankruptcy
judge or authorized the judge to render final judgments in
such proceedings. The constitutional bar remains. See The
Federalist No. 78, at 471 (“Periodical appointments, however
regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or
other, be fatal to [a judge’s] necessary independence”).

Finally, Vickie and her amici predict as a practical
matter that restrictions on a bankruptcy court’s ability to
hear and finally resolve compulsory counterclaims will
create significant delays and impose additional costs on
the bankruptcy process. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 34–
36, 57–58; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29–
30. It goes without saying that “the fact that a given law
or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facili­
tating functions of government, standing alone, will not
save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.” INS v.
Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944 (1983).
In addition, we are not convinced that the practical
consequences of such limitations on the authority of bank­
ruptcy courts to enter final judgments are as significant as
Vickie and the dissent suggest. See post, at 16–17. The
dissent asserts that it is important that counterclaims
such as Vickie’s be resolved “in a bankruptcy court,” and
