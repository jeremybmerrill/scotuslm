STERN v. MARSHALL
BREYER, J., dissenting

(noting the importance of consent to bankruptcy juris­
diction). See also Schor, 478 U. S., at 849 (“[A]bsence of
consent to an initial adjudication before a non-Article III
tribunal was relied on [in Northern Pipeline] as a signifi­
cant factor in determining that Article III forbade such
adjudication”). The majority argues that Pierce Marshall
“did not truly consent” to bankruptcy jurisdiction, ante, at
27–28, but filing a proof of claim was sufficient in Lan

distinction between the claims filed in those cases and the

over counterclaims asserted against bankruptcy claimants
constitutes an important means of securing a constitu­
tionally authorized end. Article I, §8, of the Constitution
explicitly grants Congress the “Power To . . . establish . . .
uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout
the United States.” James Madison wrote in the Federal­
ist Papers that the
“power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is
so intimately connected with the regulation of com­
merce, and will prevent so many frauds where the
parties or their property may lie or be removed into
different States, that the expediency of it seems not
likely to be drawn into question.” The Federalist No.

Congress established the first Bankruptcy Act in 1800.

creditor relations.” Northern Pipeline, supra, at 71 (plu­
rality opinion). And, to be effective, a single tribunal must
have broad authority to restructure those relations, “hav­
