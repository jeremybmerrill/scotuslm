STERN v. MARSHALL
Opinion of the Court

dismissed as mere adjuncts of Article III courts, any more
than could the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act. The
judicial powers the courts exercise in cases such as this
remain the same, and a court exercising such broad pow­
ers is no mere adjunct of anyone.

Vickie’s counterclaim cannot be deemed a matter of
“public right” that can be decided outside the Judicial
Branch. As explained above, in Northern Pipeline we
rejected the argument that the public rights doctrine
permitted a bankruptcy court to adjudicate a state law
suit brought by a debtor against a company that had not
filed a claim against the estate. See 458 U. S., at 69–72
(plurality opinion); id., at 90–91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring
in judgment). Although our discussion of the public rights
exception since that time has not been entirely consistent,
and the exception has been the subject of some debate,
this case does not fall within any of the various formula­
tions of the concept that appear in this Court’s opinions.
We first recognized the category of public rights in Mur

How. 272 (1856). That case involved the Treasury De­
partment’s sale of property belonging to a customs collec­
tor who had failed to transfer payments to the Federal
Government that he had collected on its behalf. Id., at
274, 275. The plaintiff, who claimed title to the same land
through a different transfer, objected that the Treasury
Department’s calculation of the deficiency and sale of the
property was void, because it was a judicial act that could
not be assigned to the Executive under Article III. Id., at
274–275, 282–283.
“To avoid misconstruction upon so grave a subject,” the
Court laid out the principles guiding its analysis. Id., at
284. It confirmed that Congress cannot “withdraw from
judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is
