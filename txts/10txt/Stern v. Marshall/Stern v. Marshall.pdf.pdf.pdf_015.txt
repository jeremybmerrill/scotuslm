Opinion of the Court

final judgment in the proceeding. See, e.g., Granfinanci
era, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 50 (1989) (explaining
that Congress had designated certain actions as “ ‘core
proceedings,’ which bankruptcy judges may adjudicate and
in which they may issue final judgments, if a district court
has referred the matter to them” (citations omitted)). We
have not directly addressed the question, however, and
Pierce argues that a bankruptcy judge may enter final
judgment on a core proceeding only if that proceeding also
“aris[es] in” a Title 11 case or “aris[es] under” Title 11
itself. Brief for Respondent 51 (internal quotation marks

Section 157(b)(1) authorizes bankruptcy courts to “hear
and determine all cases under title 11 and all core pro­
ceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under
title 11.” As written, §157(b)(1) is ambiguous. The “aris­
ing under” and “arising in” phrases might, as Pierce sug­
gests, be read as referring to a limited category of those
core proceedings that are addressed in that section. On
the other hand, the phrases might be read as simply de­

Title 11 or in a Title 11 case. In this case the structure
and context of §157 contradict Pierce’s interpretation of
§157(b)(1).
As an initial matter, Pierce’s reading of the statute
necessarily assumes that there is a category of core pro­
ceedings that neither arise under Title 11 nor arise in a
Title 11 case. The manner in which the statute delineates
the bankruptcy courts’ authority, however, makes plain
that no such category exists. Section 157(b)(1) authorizes
bankruptcy judges to enter final judgments in “core pro­
ceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under
title 11.” Section 157(c)(1) instructs bankruptcy judges to
instead submit proposed findings in “a proceeding that is
not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a
case under title 11.” Nowhere does §157 specify what
