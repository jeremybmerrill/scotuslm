STERN v. MARSHALL
Opinion of the Court

trustee under §60 to recover the preference”); 11 U. S. C.
§96(b) (1964 ed.) (§60(b) of the then-applicable Bankruptcy
Act) (“preference may be avoided by the trustee if the
creditor receiving it or to be benefited thereby . . . has, at
the time when the transfer is made, reasonable cause to
believe that the debtor is insolvent”). Vickie’s claim, in
contrast, is in no way derived from or dependent upon
bankruptcy law; it is a state tort action that exists without
regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.
In light of all the foregoing, we disagree with the dissent
that there are no “relevant distinction[s]” between Pierce’s
claim in this case and the claim at issue in Langenkamp.
Post, at 14. We see no reason to treat Vickie’s counter­
claim any differently from the fraudulent conveyance
action in Granfinanciera. 492 U. S., at 56. Granfinanci
era’s distinction between actions that seek “to augment
the bankruptcy estate” and those that seek “a pro rata
share of the bankruptcy res,” ibid., reaffirms that Con­
gress may not bypass Article III simply because a proceed­
ing may have some bearing on a bankruptcy case; the
question is whether the action at issue stems from the bank­
ruptcy itself or would necessarily be resolved in the
claims allowance process. Vickie has failed to demon­
strate that her counterclaim falls within one of the “lim­
ited circumstances” covered by the public rights exception,
particularly given our conclusion that, “even with respect
to matters that arguably fall within the scope of the ‘public
rights’ doctrine, the presumption is in favor of Art. III
courts.” Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 69, n. 23, 77,
n. 29 (plurality opinion).

Vickie additionally argues that the Bankruptcy Court’s
final judgment was constitutional because bankruptcy
courts under the 1984 Act are properly deemed “adjuncts”
of the district courts. Brief for Petitioner 61–64. We
