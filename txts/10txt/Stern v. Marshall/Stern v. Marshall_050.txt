STERN v. MARSHALL
BREYER, J., dissenting

(1929) (Court of Customs Appeals); Williams v. United
States, 289 U. S. 553, 579–580 (1933) (Court of Claims).
The one exception is Northern Pipeline, where the Court
struck down the Bankruptcy Act of 1978. But in that case
there was no majority. And a plurality, not a majority,
read the statement roughly in the way the Court does
today. See 458 U. S., at 67–70.
B
At the same time, I believe the majority places insuf­
ficient weight on Crowell, a seminal case that clarified the
scope of the dictum in Murray’s Lessee. In that case,
the Court considered whether Congress could grant to an
Article I administrative agency the power to adjudicate an
employee’s workers’ compensation claim against his em­
ployer. The Court assumed that an Article III court would
review the agency’s decision de novo in respect to ques­
tions of law but it would conduct a less searching review
(looking to see only if the agency’s award was “supported
by evidence in the record”) in respect to questions of fact.
Crowell, 285 U. S., at 48–50. The Court pointed out that
the case involved a dispute between private persons (a
matter of “private rights”) and (with one exception not
relevant here) it upheld Congress’ delegation of primary
factfinding authority to the agency.
Justice Brandeis, dissenting (from a here-irrelvant por­
tion of the Court’s holding), wrote that the adjudicatory
scheme raised only a due process question: When does due
process require decision by an Article III judge? He an­
swered that question by finding constitutional the stat­
ute’s delegation of adjudicatory authority to an agency.
Id., at 87.
Crowell has been hailed as “the greatest of the cases
validating administrative adjudication.” Bator, The Con­
stitution as Architecture: Legislative and Administrative
