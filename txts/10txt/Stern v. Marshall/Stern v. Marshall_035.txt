view.’ ” Post, at 6 (quoting Thomas, supra, at 584). Just
so: Substitute “tort” for “contract,” and that statement
directly covers this case.
We recognize that there may be instances in which the
distinction between public and private rights—at least as
framed by some of our recent cases—fails to provide con­
crete guidance as to whether, for example, a particular
agency can adjudicate legal issues under a substantive
regulatory scheme. Given the extent to which this case is
so markedly distinct from the agency cases discussing the
public rights exception in the context of such a regime,
however, we do not in this opinion express any view on
how the doctrine might apply in that different context.
What is plain here is that this case involves the most
prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final,
binding judgment by a court with broad substantive juris­
diction, on a common law cause of action, when the action
neither derives from nor depends upon any agency regula­
tory regime. If such an exercise of judicial power may
nonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply
by deeming it part of some amorphous “public right,” then
Article III would be transformed from the guardian of
individual liberty and separation of powers we have long
recognized into mere wishful thinking.

Vickie and the dissent next attempt to distinguish
Northern Pipeline and Granfinanciera on the ground that
Pierce, unlike the defendants in those cases, had filed a
proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. Given
Pierce’s participation in those proceedings, Vickie argues,
the Bankruptcy Court had the authority to adjudicate her
counterclaim under our decisions in Katchen v. Landy, 382
U. S. 323 (1966), and Langenkamp v. Culp, 498 U. S. 42
(1990) (per curiam).
