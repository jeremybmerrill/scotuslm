Opinion of the Court

it lacked the authority to adjudicate his proof of claim be­
cause the claim sought recompense for a personal injury tort.
Indeed, Pierce apparently did not object to any court
that §157(b)(5) prohibited the Bankruptcy Court from
resolving his defamation claim until over two years—and
several adverse discovery rulings—after he filed that
claim in June 1996. The first filing Pierce cites as raising that objection is his September 22, 1998 motion to the
District Court to withdraw the reference of the case to the
Bankruptcy Court. See Brief for Respondent 26–27. The
District Court did initially withdraw the reference as
requested, but it then returned the proceeding to the
Bankruptcy Court, observing that Pierce “implicated the
jurisdiction of that bankruptcy court. He chose to be a
party to that litigation.” App. 129. Although Pierce had
objected in July 1996 to the Bankruptcy Court’s exercise of
jurisdiction over Vickie’s counterclaim, he advised the
court at that time that he was “happy to litigate [his]
claim” there. 29 Supplemental Record 6101. Counsel
stated that even though Pierce thought it was “probably
cheaper for th[e] estate if [Pierce’s claim] were sent back
or joined back with the State Court litigation,” Pierce “did
choose” the Bankruptcy Court forum and “would be more
than pleased to do it [t]here.” Id., at 6101–6102; see also
App. to Pet. for Cert. 266, n. 17 (District Court referring to
these statements).
Given Pierce’s course of conduct before the Bankruptcy
Court, we conclude that he consented to that court’s reso­
lution of his defamation claim (and forfeited any argument
to the contrary). We have recognized “the value of waiver
and forfeiture rules” in “complex” cases, Exxon Shipping
Co. v. Baker, 554 U. S. 471, 487–488, n. 6 (2008), and
this case is no exception. In such cases, as here, the
consequences of “a litigant . . . ‘sandbagging’ the court—
remaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising
the error only if the case does not conclude in his favor,”
