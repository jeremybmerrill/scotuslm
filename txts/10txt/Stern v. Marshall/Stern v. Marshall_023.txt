scheme of a tripartite government” adopted in the Consti­
tution, “the ‘judicial Power of the United States’ . . . can no
more be shared” with another branch than “the Chief
Executive, for example, can share with the Judiciary the
veto power, or the Congress share with the Judiciary the
power to override a Presidential veto.” United States v.
Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 704 (1974) (quoting U. S. Const.,

In establishing the system of divided power in the Con­
stitution, the Framers considered it essential that “the

Article III protects liberty not only through its role in
implementing the separation of powers, but also by speci­
fying the defining characteristics of Article III judges. The
colonists had been subjected to judicial abuses at the hand
of the Crown, and the Framers knew the main reasons
why: because the King of Great Britain “made Judges
