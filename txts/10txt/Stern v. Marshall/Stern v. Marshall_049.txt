BREYER, J., dissenting

A
In Murray’s Lessee, the Court held that the Constitution
permitted an executive official, through summary, nonju­
dicial proceedings, to attach the assets of a customs col­
lector whose account was deficient. The Court found
evidence in common law of “summary method[s] for the
recovery of debts due to the crown, and especially those
due from receivers of the revenues,” 18 How., at 277, and
it analogized the Government’s summary attachment
process to the kind of self-help remedies available to pri­
vate parties, id., at 283. In the course of its opinion, the
Court wrote:
“[W]e do not consider congress can either withdraw
from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or
in equity, or admiralty; nor, on the other hand, can it
bring under the judicial power a matter which, from
its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination.
At the same time there are matters, involving public
rights, which may be presented in such form that the
judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which
are susceptible of judicial determination, but which
congress may or may not bring within the cognizance
of the courts of the United States, as it may deem
proper.” Id., at 284.
The majority reads the first part of the statement’s first
sentence as authoritatively defining the boundaries of
Article III. Ante, at 18. I would read the statement in a
less absolute way. For one thing, the statement is in effect
dictum. For another, it is the remainder of the statement,
announcing a distinction between “public rights” and
“private rights,” that has had the more lasting impact.
Later Courts have seized on that distinction when uphold
ing non-Article III adjudication, not when striking it
down. See Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451–452
