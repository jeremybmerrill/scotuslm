STERN v. MARSHALL
Opinion of the Court

reasoned that allowing a bankruptcy judge to enter final
judgments on all counterclaims raised in bankruptcy
proceedings “would certainly run afoul” of this Court’s
decision in Northern Pipeline. 600 F. 3d, at 1057. With
those concerns in mind, the court concluded that “a coun­
terclaim under §157(b)(2)(C) is properly a ‘core’ proceeding
‘arising in a case under’ the [Bankruptcy] Code only if the
counterclaim is so closely related to [a creditor’s] proof of
claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary
to resolve the allowance or disallowance of the claim it­
self.” Id., at 1058 (internal quotation marks omitted;
second brackets added). The court ruled that Vickie’s
counterclaim did not meet that test. Id., at 1059. That
holding made “the Texas probate court’s judgment . . . the
earliest final judgment entered on matters relevant to this
proceeding,” and therefore the Court of Appeals concluded
that the District Court should have “afford[ed] preclusive
effect” to the Texas “court’s determination of relevant legal
and factual issues.” Id., at 1064–1065.2
We again granted certiorari. 561 U. S. __ (2010).

With certain exceptions not relevant here, the district
courts of the United States have “original and exclusive
jurisdiction of all cases under title 11.” 28 U. S. C.
§1334(a). Congress has divided bankruptcy proceedings
into three categories: those that “aris[e] under title 11”;
those that “aris[e] in” a Title 11 case; and those that are

2 One judge wrote a separate concurring opinion. He concluded that
“Vickie’s counterclaim . . . [wa]s not a core proceeding, so the Texas
probate court judgment preceded the district court judgment and
controls.” 600 F. 3d, at 1065 (Kleinfeld, J.). The concurring judge
also “offer[ed] additional grounds” that he believed required judgment
in Pierce’s favor. Ibid. Pierce presses only one of those additional
grounds here; it is discussed below, in Part II–C.
