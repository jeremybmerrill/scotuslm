BREYER, J., dissenting

“reparations procedure,” which constitutes an important
part of a congressionally enacted “regulatory scheme.” Id.,
at 852–856. The Court concluded that for these and other
reasons “the magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial
Branch can only be termed de minimis.” Id., at 856.

A

This case law, as applied in Thomas and Schor, requires
us to determine pragmatically whether a congressional
delegation of adjudicatory authority to a non-Article III
judge violates the separation-of-powers principles inherent
in Article III. That is to say, we must determine through
an examination of certain relevant factors whether that
delegation constitutes a significant encroachment by the
Legislative or Executive Branches of Government upon
the realm of authority that Article III reserves for exercise
by the Judicial Branch of Government. Those factors
include (1) the nature of the claim to be adjudicated; (2)
the nature of the non-Article III tribunal; (3) the extent to
which Article III courts exercise control over the proceed­
ing; (4) the presence or absence of the parties’ consent; and
(5) the nature and importance of the legislative purpose
served by the grant of adjudicatory authority to a tribunal
with judges who lack Article III’s tenure and compensa­
tion protections. The presence of “private rights” does not
automatically determine the outcome of the question but
requires a more “searching” examination of the relevant
factors. Schor, supra, at 854.
Insofar as the majority would apply more formal stan­
dards, it simply disregards recent, controlling precedent.
Thomas, supra, at 587 (“[P]ractical attention to substance
rather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories
should inform application of Article III”); Schor, supra, at
851 (“[T]he Court has declined to adopt formalistic and
unbending rules” for deciding Article III cases).
