Opinion of the Court

ruled on the questions whether Texas recognized tortious
interference with an expected gift as a valid cause of
action, what the elements of that action were, and
whether those elements were met in this case. 275 B. R.,
at 50–53. Assuming Texas accepted the elements adopted
by other jurisdictions, that meant Vickie would need to
prove, above and beyond Pierce’s tortious interference, (1)
the existence of an expectancy of a gift; (2) a reasonable
certainty that the expectancy would have been realized
but for the interference; and (3) damages. Id., at 51; see
253 B. R., at 558–561. Also, because Vickie sought puni­
tive damages in connection with her counterclaim, the
Bankruptcy Court could not finally dispose of the case in
Vickie’s favor without determining whether to subject
Pierce to the sort of “retribution,” “punishment[,] and
deterrence,” Exxon Shipping Co., 554 U. S., at 492, 504
(internal quotation marks omitted), those damages are
designed to impose. There thus was never reason to
believe that the process of ruling on Pierce’s proof of
claim would necessarily result in the resolution of Vickie’s
counterclaim.
In both Katchen and Langenkamp, moreover, the trus­
tee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of
recovery created by federal bankruptcy law. In Langen
kamp, we noted that “the trustee instituted adversary
proceedings under 11 U. S. C. §547(b) to recover, as avoid­
able preferences,” payments respondents received from the
debtor before the bankruptcy filings. 498 U. S., at 43; see,
e.g., §547(b)(1) (“the trustee may avoid any transfer of an
interest of the debtor in property—(1) to or for the benefit
of a creditor”). In Katchen, “[t]he Trustee . . . [asserted]
that the payments made [to the creditor] were preferences
inhibited by Section 60a of the Bankruptcy Act.” Memo­
