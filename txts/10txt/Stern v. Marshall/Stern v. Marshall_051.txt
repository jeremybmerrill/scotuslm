BREYER, J., dissenting

Yet, in a footnote, the majority distinguishes Crowell as a
case in which the Court upheld the delegation of adjudica­
tory authority to an administrative agency simply because
the agency’s power to make the “specialized, narrowly
confined factual determinations” at issue arising in a
“particularized area of law,” made the agency a “true
‘adjunct’ of the District Court.” Ante, at 23, n. 6. Were
Crowell’s holding as narrow as the majority suggests,
one could question the validity of Congress’ delegation of
authority to adjudicate disputes among private parties to
other agencies such as the National Labor Relations
Board, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
Surface Transportation Board, and the Department of

§10704; 42 U. S. C. §3612(b).

Article III provides. Four Members of the Court wrote
that Congress could grant adjudicatory authority to a nonArticle III judge only where (1) the judge sits on a “territo­
rial cour[t]” (2) the judge conducts a “courts-martial,” or
(3) the case involves a “public right,” namely, a “matter”
that “at a minimum arise[s] ‘between the government and
others.’ ” 458 U. S., at 64–70 (plurality opinion) (quoting
Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 451). Two other Mem­
bers of the Court, without accepting these limitations,
agreed with the result because the case involved a breach­
of-contract claim brought by the bankruptcy trustee on
