Opinion of the Court

core.” 264 B. R. 609, 629–630 (CD Cal. 2001) (citing
Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.,
458 U. S. 50, 79, n. 31 (1982) (plurality opinion)). The
District Court accordingly concluded that a “counterclaim
should not be characterized as core” when it “is only
somewhat related to the claim against which it is asserted,
and when the unique characteristics and context of the
counterclaim place it outside of the normal type of set-off
or other counterclaims that customarily arise.” 264 B. R.,
at 632.
Because the District Court concluded that Vickie’s
counterclaim was not core, the court determined that it
was required to treat the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment as
“proposed[,] rather than final,” and engage in an “inde­
pendent review” of the record. Id., at 633; see 28 U. S. C.
§157(c)(1). Although the Texas state court had by that
time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties’
dispute and entered a judgment in Pierce’s favor, the
District Court declined to give that judgment preclusive
effect and went on to decide the matter itself. 271 B. R.
858, 862–867 (CD Cal. 2001); see 275 B. R. 5, 56–58 (CD
Cal. 2002). Like the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court
found that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie’s
expectancy of a gift from J. Howard. The District Court
awarded Vickie compensatory and punitive damages, each
in the amount of $44,292,767.33. Id., at 58.
The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court on a
different ground, 392 F. 3d, at 1137, and we—in the first
visit of the case to this Court—reversed the Court of Ap­
peals on that issue. 547 U. S., at 314–315. On remand
from this Court, the Court of Appeals held that §157 man­
dated “a two-step approach” under which a bankruptcy
judge may issue a final judgment in a proceeding only
if the matter both “meets Congress’ definition of a core
proceeding and arises under or arises in title 11,” the
Bankruptcy Code. 600 F. 3d, at 1055. The court also
