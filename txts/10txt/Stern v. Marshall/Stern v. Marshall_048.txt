STERN v. MARSHALL
BREYER, J., dissenting

majority about the statute’s constitutionality. I believe
the statute is consistent with the Constitution’s delegation
of the “judicial Power of the United States” to the Judicial
Branch of Government. Art. III, §1. Consequently, it is
constitutional.
I
My disagreement with the majority’s conclusion stems
in part from my disagreement about the way in which it
interprets, or at least emphasizes, certain precedents. In
my view, the majority overstates the current relevance of
statements this Court made in an 1856 case, Murray’s
Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272
(1856), and it overstates the importance of an analysis
that did not command a Court majority in Northern Pipe
line Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S.
50 (1982), and that was subsequently disavowed. At the
same time, I fear the Court understates the importance of
a watershed opinion widely thought to demonstrate the
constitutional basis for the current authority of adminis­
trative agencies to adjudicate private disputes, namely,
Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22 (1932). And it fails to
follow the analysis that this Court more recently has held
applicable to the evaluation of claims of a kind before
us here, namely, claims that a congressional delegation
of adjudicatory authority violates separation-of-powers
principles derived from Article III. See Thomas v. Union
Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568 (1985);
Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S.
833 (1986).
I shall describe these cases in some detail in order to
explain why I believe we should put less weight than does
the majority upon the statement in Murray’s Lessee and
the analysis followed by the Northern Pipeline plurality
and instead should apply the approach this Court has
applied in Crowell, Thomas, and Schor.
