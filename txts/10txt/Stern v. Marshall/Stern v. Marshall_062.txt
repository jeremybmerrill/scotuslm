STERN v. MARSHALL
BREYER, J., dissenting

such matters has more than “some bearing on a bank­
ruptcy case.” Ante, at 34 (emphasis deleted). It plays a
critical role in Congress’ constitutionally based effort to
create an efficient, effective federal bankruptcy system.
At the least, that is what Congress concluded. We owe
deference to that determination, which shows the absence
of any legislative or executive motive, intent, purpose, or
desire to encroach upon areas that Article III reserves
to judges to whom it grants tenure and compensation
protections.
Considering these factors together, I conclude that, as in
Schor, “the magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial
Branch can only be termed de minimis.” 478 U. S., at 856.
I would similarly find the statute before us constitutional.
III
The majority predicts that as a “practical matter” to­
day’s decision “does not change all that much.” Ante, at
36–37. But I doubt that is so. Consider a typical case:
A tenant files for bankruptcy. The landlord files a claim
for unpaid rent. The tenant asserts a counterclaim for
damages suffered by the landlord’s (1) failing to fulfill his
obligations as lessor, and (2) improperly recovering pos­
session of the premises by misrepresenting the facts in
housing court. (These are close to the facts presented in
In re Beugen, 81 B. R. 994 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Cal. 1988).)
This state-law counterclaim does not “ste[m] from the
bankruptcy itself,” ante, at 34, it would not “necessarily be
resolved in the claims allowance process,” ibid., and it
would require the debtor to prove damages suffered by the
lessor’s failures, the extent to which the landlord’s repre­
sentations to the housing court were untrue, and damages
suffered by improper recovery of possession of the prem­
ises, cf. ante, at 33-33. Thus, under the majority’s holding,
the federal district judge, not the bankruptcy judge, would
have to hear and resolve the counterclaim.
