STERN v. MARSHALL
Opinion of the Court

“Slight encroachments create new boundaries from which
legions of power can seek new territory to capture.” Reid
v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 39 (1957) (plurality opinion). Al­
though “[i]t may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its
mildest and least repulsive form,” we cannot overlook the
intrusion: “illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get
their first footing in that way, namely, by silent ap­
proaches and slight deviations from legal modes of proce­
dure.” Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 635 (1886).
We cannot compromise the integrity of the system of
separated powers and the role of the Judiciary in that
system, even with respect to challenges that may seem
innocuous at first blush.

Article III of the Constitution provides that the judicial
power of the United States may be vested only in courts
whose judges enjoy the protections set forth in that Arti­
cle. We conclude today that Congress, in one isolated
respect, exceeded that limitation in the Bankruptcy Act of
1984. The Bankruptcy Court below lacked the constitu­
tional authority to enter a final judgment on a state law
counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling
on a creditor’s proof of claim. Accordingly, the judgment of
the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
