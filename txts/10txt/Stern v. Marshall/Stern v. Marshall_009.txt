Opinion of the Court

I
Because we have already recounted the facts and proce­
dural history of this case in detail, see Marshall v. Mar
shall, 547 U. S. 293, 300–305 (2006), we do not repeat
them in full here. Of current relevance are two claims
Vickie filed in an attempt to secure half of J. Howard’s
fortune. Known to the public as Anna Nicole Smith,
Vickie was J. Howard’s third wife and married him about
a year before his death. Id., at 300; see In re Marshall,
392 F. 3d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2004). Although J. Howard
bestowed on Vickie many monetary and other gifts during
their courtship and marriage, he did not include her in
his will. 547 U. S., at 300. Before J. Howard passed away,
Vickie filed suit in Texas state probate court, asserting
that Pierce—J. Howard’s younger son—fraudulently in­
duced J. Howard to sign a living trust that did not include
her, even though J. Howard meant to give her half his
property. Pierce denied any fraudulent activity and de­
fended the validity of J. Howard’s trust and, eventually,
his will. 392 F. 3d, at 1122–1123, 1125.
After J. Howard’s death, Vickie filed a petition for bank­
ruptcy in the Central District of California. Pierce filed a
complaint in that bankruptcy proceeding, contending that
Vickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell
members of the press that he had engaged in fraud to gain
control of his father’s assets. 547 U. S., at 300–301; In re
Marshall, 600 F. 3d 1037, 1043–1044 (CA9 2010). The
complaint sought a declaration that Pierce’s defamation
claim was not dischargeable in the bankruptcy proceed­
ings. Ibid.; see 11 U. S. C. §523(a). Pierce subsequently
filed a proof of claim for the defamation action, meaning
that he sought to recover damages for it from Vickie’s
bankruptcy estate. See §501(a). Vickie responded to
Pierce’s initial complaint by asserting truth as a defense to
the alleged defamation and by filing a counterclaim for
tortious interference with the gift she expected from J.
