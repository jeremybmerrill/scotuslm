STERN v. MARSHALL
Opinion of the Court

Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,

tional courts “shall hold their Offices during good Behav­
iour” and “receive for their Services[ ] a Compensation[ ]
[that] shall not be diminished” during their tenure.
As its text and our precedent confirm, Article III is “an
inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks
and balances” that “both defines the power and protects
the independence of the Judicial Branch.” Northern Pipe
line, 458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion). Under “the basic
concept of separation of powers . . . that flow[s] from the
