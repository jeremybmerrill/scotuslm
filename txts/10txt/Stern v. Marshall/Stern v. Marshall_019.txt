Opinion of the Court

and wrongful death claims” does not include non-physical
torts such as defamation. Id., at 25–26.
We need not determine what constitutes a “personal
injury tort” in this case because we agree with Vickie that
§157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and that Pierce consented
to the Bankruptcy Court’s resolution of his defamation
claim.4 Because “[b]randing a rule as going to a court’s
subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of
our adversarial system,” Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S.
___, ___–___ (2011) (slip op., at 4–5), we are not inclined to
interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when
they are not framed as such. See generally Arbaugh v.
Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 516 (2006) (“when Congress
does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as juris­
dictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjuris­
dictional in character”).

4 Although Pierce suggests that consideration of “the 157(b)(5) issue”
would facilitate an “easy” resolution of the case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 47–48,
he is mistaken. Had Pierce preserved his argument under that provi­
sion, we would have been confronted with several questions on which
there is little consensus or precedent. Those issues include: (1) the
scope of the phrase “personal injury tort”—a question over which there
is at least a three-way divide, see In re Arnold, 407 B. R. 849, 851–853
(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2009); (2) whether, as Vickie argued in the Court of
Appeals, the requirement that a personal injury tort claim be “tried” in
the district court nonetheless permits the bankruptcy court to resolve
the claim short of trial, see Appellee’s/Cross-Appellant’s Supplemental
Brief in No. 02–56002 etc. (CA9), p. 24; see also In re Dow Corning
Corp., 215 B. R. 346, 349–351 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Mich. 1997) (noting
divide over whether, and on what grounds, a bankruptcy court may
resolve a claim pretrial); and (3) even if Pierce’s defamation claim
could be considered only by the District Court, whether the Bankruptcy
Court might retain jurisdiction over the counterclaim, cf. Arbaugh v.
Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006) (“when a court grants a motion
to dismiss for failure to state a federal claim, the court generally
retains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28
U. S. C. §1367, over pendent state-law claims”). We express no opinion
on any of these issues and simply note that the §157(b)(5) question is
not as straightforward as Pierce would have it.
