STERN v. MARSHALL
Opinion of the Court

cases, I am satisfied that the adjudication of Northern’s
lawsuit cannot be so sustained”).5
A full majority of Justices in Northern Pipeline also
rejected the debtor’s argument that the bankruptcy court’s
exercise of jurisdiction was constitutional because the
bankruptcy judge was acting merely as an adjunct of the
district court or court of appeals. Id., at 71–72, 81–86
(plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in
judgment) (“the bankruptcy court is not an ‘adjunct’ of
either the district court or the court of appeals”).
After our decision in Northern Pipeline, Congress re­
vised the statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and
bankruptcy judges. In the 1984 Act, Congress provided
that the judges of the new bankruptcy courts would be
appointed by the courts of appeals for the circuits in which
their districts are located. 28 U. S. C. §152(a). And, as we
have explained, Congress permitted the newly constituted
bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments only in “core”
proceedings. See supra, at 7–8.
With respect to such “core” matters, however, the bank­
ruptcy courts under the 1984 Act exercise the same pow­
ers they wielded under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (1978
Act), 92 Stat. 2549. As in Northern Pipeline, for example,
the newly constituted bankruptcy courts are charged
under §157(b)(2)(C) with resolving “[a]ll matters of fact
and law in whatever domains of the law to which” a coun­
terclaim may lead. 458 U. S., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concur­
ring in judgment); see, e.g., 275 B. R., at 50–51 (noting
that Vickie’s counterclaim required the bankruptcy court
to determine whether Texas recognized a cause of action for tortious interference with an inter vivos gift—
something the Supreme Court of Texas had yet to do). As

agreed on the points pertinent to this case. Post, at 2 (opinion of
