BREYER, J., dissenting

Pierce Marshall likely had “an alternative forum to the
bankruptcy court in which to pursue [his] clai[m].” Gran
financiera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 59, n. 14
(1989).
The Court has held, in a highly analogous context, that
this type of consent argues strongly in favor of using ordi­
nary bankruptcy court proceedings. In Granfinanciera,
the Court held that when a bankruptcy trustee seeks to
void a transfer of assets from the debtor to an individual
on the ground that the transfer to that individual consti­
tutes an unlawful “preference,” the question of whether
the individual has a right to a jury trial “depends upon
whether the creditor has submitted a claim against the
estate.” Id., at 58. The following year, in Langenkamp v.
Culp, 498 U. S. 42 (1990) (per curiam), the Court empha­
sized that when the individual files a claim against the
estate, that individual has
“trigger[ed] the process of ‘allowance and disallowance
of claims,’ thereby subjecting himself to the bank­
ruptcy court’s equitable power. If the creditor is met,
in turn, with a preference action from the trustee,
that action becomes part of the claims-allowance proc­
ess which is triable only in equity. In other words, the
creditor’s claim and the ensuing preference action by
the trustee become integral to the restructuring of the
debtor-creditor relationship through the bankruptcy
court’s equity jurisdiction.” Id., at 44 (quoting Granfi
nanciera, 492 U. S., at 58; citations omitted).
As we have recognized, the jury trial question and the
Article III question are highly analogous. See id., at 52–
53. And to that extent, Granfinanciera’s and Langen
kamp’s basic reasoning and conclusion apply here: Even
when private rights are at issue, non-Article III adjudica­
tion may be appropriate when both parties consent. Cf.
Northern Pipeline, supra, at 80, n. 31 (plurality opinion)
