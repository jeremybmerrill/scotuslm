Opinion of the Court

in Northern Pipeline, the new courts in core proceedings
“issue final judgments, which are binding and enforceable
even in the absence of an appeal.” 458 U. S., at 85–86
(plurality opinion). And, as in Northern Pipeline, the
district courts review the judgments of the bankruptcy
courts in core proceedings only under the usual limited
appellate standards. That requires marked deference to,
among other things, the bankruptcy judges’ findings of
fact. See §158(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013 (findings of

Court’s entry of final judgment on her state common law
counterclaim was constitutional, despite the similarities
between the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act and
those exercising core jurisdiction under the 1984 Act. We
disagree. It is clear that the Bankruptcy Court in this
case exercised the “judicial Power of the United States” in
purporting to resolve and enter final judgment on a state
common law claim, just as the court did in Northern Pipe

comply with Article III in doing so, any more than in
Northern Pipeline. Vickie argues that this case is different
because the defendant is a creditor in the bankruptcy.
But the debtors’ claims in the cases on which she relies
were themselves federal claims under bankruptcy law,
which would be completely resolved in the bankruptcy
process of allowing or disallowing claims. Here Vickie’s
claim is a state law action independent of the federal
bankruptcy law and not necessarily resolvable by a ruling
on the creditor’s proof of claim in bankruptcy. Northern
Pipeline and our subsequent decision in Granfinanciera,
492 U. S. 33, rejected the application of the “public rights”
exception in such cases.
Nor can the bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act be
