Opinion of the Court

at 71 (plurality opinion) (distinguishing “the restructuring
of debtor-creditor relations, which is at the core of the
federal bankruptcy power, . . . from the adjudication of
state-created private rights”); Collier on Bankruptcy
¶3.02[2], p. 3–26, n. 5 (16th ed. 2010) (“The terms ‘non­
core’ and ‘related’ are synonymous”); see also id., at 3–26,
(“The phraseology of section 157 leads to the conclusion
that there is no such thing as a core matter that is ‘related
to’ a case under title 11. Core proceedings are, at most,
those that arise in title 11 cases or arise under title 11”
(footnote omitted)). And, as already discussed, the statute
simply does not provide for a proceeding that is simulta­
neously core and yet only related to the bankruptcy case.
See §157(c)(1) (providing only for “a proceeding that is
not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case
under title 11”).
As we explain in Part III, we agree with Pierce that
designating all counterclaims as “core” proceedings raises
serious constitutional concerns. Pierce is also correct that
we will, where possible, construe federal statutes so as “to
avoid serious doubt of their constitutionality.” Commod
ity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833,
841 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). But that
“canon of construction does not give [us] the prerogative to
ignore the legislative will in order to avoid constitutional
adjudication.” Ibid. In this case, we do not think the plain
text of §157(b)(2)(C) leaves any room for the canon of
avoidance. We would have to “rewrit[e]” the statute,
not interpret it, to bypass the constitutional issue
§157(b)(2)(C) presents. Id., at 841 (internal quotation
marks omitted). That we may not do. We agree with
Vickie that §157(b)(2)(C) permits the bankruptcy court
to enter a final judgment on her tortious interference
counterclaim.
