STERN v. MARSHALL
Opinion of the Court

dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices,
and the amount and payment of their salaries.” The
Declaration of Independence ¶11. The Framers undertook
in Article III to protect citizens subject to the judicial
power of the new Federal Government from a repeat of
those abuses. By appointing judges to serve without term
limits, and restricting the ability of the other branches to
remove judges or diminish their salaries, the Framers
sought to ensure that each judicial decision would be
rendered, not with an eye toward currying favor with
Congress or the Executive, but rather with the “[c]lear
heads . . . and honest hearts” deemed “essential to good
judges.” 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed.
1896).
Article III could neither serve its purpose in the system
of checks and balances nor preserve the integrity of judi­
cial decisionmaking if the other branches of the Federal
Government could confer the Government’s “judicial
Power” on entities outside Article III. That is why we
have long recognized that, in general, Congress may not
“withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which,
from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law,
or in equity, or admiralty.” Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken
Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284 (1856). When
a suit is made of “the stuff of the traditional actions at
common law tried by the courts at Westminster in 1789,”
Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 90 (Rehnquist, J., concur­
ring in judgment), and is brought within the bounds of
federal jurisdiction, the responsibility for deciding that
suit rests with Article III judges in Article III courts. The
Constitution assigns that job—resolution of “the mundane
as well as the glamorous, matters of common law and
statute as well as constitutional law, issues of fact as well
as issues of law”—to the Judiciary. Id., at 86–87, n. 39
(plurality opinion).
