CHARLES ANDREW FOWLER, AKA MAN, PETITIONER
v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[May 26, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The federal witness tampering statute makes it a crime
“to kill another person, with intent to . . . prevent the
communication by any person to a law enforcement officer
. . . of the United States” of “information relating to the . . .
possible commission of a Federal offense.” 18 U. S. C.
§1512(a)(1)(C). We focus on instances where a defendant
killed a person with an intent to prevent that person from
communicating with law enforcement officers in general
but where the defendant did not have federal law en
forcement officers (or any specific individuals) particularly
in mind. The question before us concerns what, if any
thing, the Government must show beyond this broad in
definite intent in order to show that the defendant more
particularly intended to prevent communication with
federal officers as well. We hold that, in such circum
stances, the Government must show that there was a
reasonable likelihood that a relevant communication
would have been made to a federal officer.
