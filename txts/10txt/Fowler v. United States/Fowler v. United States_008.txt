FOWLER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

that any hurricane will actually occur. One can drive to
Fenway Park with the intent of seeing the Red Sox play
that afternoon even if a mistake about the date means the
stadium is empty. One can blow up a bridge with the
intent of stopping an advancing army, even if the army
advances regardless, along a different route. And, simi
larly, a defendant can kill a victim with an intent to
prevent the victim from communicating with federal law
enforcement officers even if there is some considerable
doubt that any such communication would otherwise have
taken place.
But, second, the Government must show more than
the broad indefinite intent we have described, the intent

that could not possibly have taken place regardless. We
can speak of a Colorado trout fisherman who tries to
prevent his trout stream from being invaded by pike or
carp, but in ordinary circumstances we cannot speak
about trying to prevent the stream’s invasion by whales.

intended, possible, or likely action or event) impractical
or impossible by anticipatory action.” OED Online (Mar.

For another thing, to allow the Government to show no
more than the broad indefinite intent we have described
(the intent to prevent communications to law enforcement
officers in general) would bring within the scope of this
statute many instances of witness tampering in purely
state investigations and proceedings, thus extending the
