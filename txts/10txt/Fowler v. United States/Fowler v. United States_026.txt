FOWLER v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

§1512(a)(1)(C).
JUSTICE SCALIA’s principal criticism of my interpreta

prevent the communication of information about a federal
crime (including a federal crime that is also a state crime)
it will necessarily have proved that [the set of officers
whom the defendant had in mind] ‘included law enforce
ment officers who were employed by the United States.’ ”

It is true that evidence regarding the federal character
of an offense may lead a rational jury to infer that the
officers whom the defendant had in mind included federal
officers.2 But those two elements remain distinct; both
