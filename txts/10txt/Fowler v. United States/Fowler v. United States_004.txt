FOWLER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Fowler and several other men prepared to rob a Florida
bank. They met in a cemetery, put on black clothes and
gloves, began to drink and use drugs, and discussed the
proposed crime. Shortly before daybreak a local police
officer, Todd Horner, came upon the group. He pulled out
his gun and asked the men to identify themselves. Fowler
and some of the others managed to overcome Horner and
take his gun. After Horner spoke to one of the men by
name, Fowler said, “Now we can’t walk away from this
thing.” App. 38 (internal quotation marks omitted). And
he shot and killed Horner.
Federal authorities charged Fowler with violating the
federal witness tampering statute. He was convicted. On
appeal, Fowler argued that the evidence was insufficient
to show that he had killed Horner intending to prevent
Horner from communicating with a federal officer. The
Eleventh Circuit disagreed. It held that a showing of a
“possible or potential communication to federal authori
ties” was sufficient. 603 F. 3d 883, 888 (2010).
Fowler sought certiorari. And because the Circuits have
disagreed about this last-mentioned matter, we granted
Fowler’s petition for certiorari. Compare United States v.
Harris, 498 F. 3d 278, 286 (CA4 2007) (“So long as the
information the defendant seeks to suppress actually
relates to the commission or possible commission of a
federal offense, the federal nexus requirement is estab
lished”), with United States v. Lopez, 372 F. 3d 86, 91–92
(CA2 2004), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 544
U. S. 902 (2005) (requiring Government to show federal
crime along with “ ‘additional appropriate evidence’ ” that
“the victim plausibly might have turned to federal offi
cials”); see also United States v. Bell, 113 F. 3d 1345, 1349
(CA3 1997); United States v. Causey, 185 F. 3d 407, 422–
423 (CA5 1999); United States v. Wright, 536 F. 3d 819,
824–825 (CA8 2008).
