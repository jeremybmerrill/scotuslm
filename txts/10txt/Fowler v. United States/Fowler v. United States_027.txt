ALITO, J., dissenting

must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; and it is en
tirely possible for a defendant to satisfy one without also
satisfying the other. For example, if a uniformed federal
officer came upon a defendant during the commission of a
purely state offense (for example, a murder, assault, or
rape not committed in a federal enclave), the defendant
might kill or attempt to kill the officer to prevent the
officer from radioing in that information to the officer’s
superiors. This defendant would have the intent to pre
vent a communication to a federal officer, but there would
be no violation of the statute because the information
would not concern a federal crime. Thus, contrary to
JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion, under my interpretation,
the two intent elements—relating to the substance of the
feared communication and the identity of the feared re
cipient—are not redundant.
JUSTICE SCALIA invokes a rule that disfavors the inter
pretation of a federal criminal statute in a way that
“ ‘significantly change[s] the federal-state balance in the
prosecution of crimes.’ ”3 Ante, at 7 (quoting Jones v.
United States, 529 U. S. 848, 858 (2000)). This rule, how
ever, does not justify ignoring the plain terms of the
statute.

The Court has effectively amended §1512(a)(1)(C) by
adding an element that is nowhere to be found in the text
of the statute. And the Court’s new element makes little
sense and will create confusion for trial judges and juries.
——————
element of a crime may provide a sufficient basis for inferring that
another element may be satisfied. To take a common example, overt
acts committed in furtherance of a conspiracy may be sufficient to
permit a jury to infer that a conspiratorial agreement was reached. But
that does not alter the need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
such an agreement was reached.
3 The Court again makes a related argument. See ante, at 8–9.
