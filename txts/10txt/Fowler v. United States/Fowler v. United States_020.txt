FOWLER v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

*
*
*
Because the Government did not establish that Fowler
intended to prevent a communication that, if made, would
have been made to a federal law enforcement officer, there
was insufficient evidence to convict him of violating
§1512(a)(1)(C). Since there remains, however, the ques
tion whether Fowler preserved this issue at trial or
whether the inadequacy of the evidence constituted plain
error, I concur in the Court’s order vacating the judgment
and remanding for resolution of that question.
