Opinion of the Court

II
The federal witness tampering statute in relevant part
forbids the “kill[ing] or attempt[ed] kill[ing]” of “another
person” with a certain “intent,” namely, an
“intent to . . . prevent the communication by any per
son to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United
States of information relating to the commission or
possible commission of a Federal offense . . . .” 18
U. S. C. §1512(a)(1)(C).
A related subsection says that in a prosecution for this
offense
“no state of mind need be proved with respect to
the circumstance . . . that the judge is a judge of the
United States or that the law enforcement officer is an
officer or employee of the Federal Government . . . .”
§1512(g)(2).
This language makes clear that in a prosecution the Gov
ernment must prove (1) a killing or attempted killing, (2)
committed with a particular intent, namely, an intent (a)
to “prevent” a “communication” (b) about “the commission
or possible commission of a Federal offense” (c) to a federal
“law enforcement officer or judge.”
The question here is how this language applies when a
defendant (1) kills a victim, (2) with an intent (a) to pre
vent a communication (b) about the commission or possi
ble commission of a federal offense but (c) to law enforce
ment officers in general rather than to some specific law
enforcement officer or set of officers which the defendant
has in mind. This kind of circumstance is not necessarily
rare, as the facts here illustrate. Fowler (we here assume)
was not thinking specifically about federal officers, but he
would nonetheless have wanted to prevent communication
with federal officers from taking place (had he considered
the matter).
