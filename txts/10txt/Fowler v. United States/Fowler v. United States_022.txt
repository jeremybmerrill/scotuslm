FOWLER v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

Fowler) was a federal law enforcement officer,
(4) information concerning the possible commission of a
federal crime.
The question before us is whether there was sufficient
evidence to support Fowler’s conviction, and thus we must
ask whether any rational jury could find that all of the
elements noted above were adequately established. See
United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, 67 (1984).
There can be no dispute that there was sufficient evi
dence to establish elements (1), (2), and (4). That is, there
was ample evidence to show (1) that Fowler killed Officer
Horner, (2) that he did so with the intent to prevent the
communication of information about what Officer Horner
had seen, and (4) that this information concerned the
possible commission of at least one federal crime—for
example, conspiracy to rob a bank in violation of 18
U. S. C. §§371, 2113.
Thus, the only remaining question is whether there was
enough evidence to permit a rational jury to infer that
element (3) had been satisfied. And in connection with
this question, it is important to keep in mind three things
that element (3) does not require.
First, element (3) does not demand proof that Officer
Horner, had he not been killed, would have reported—or
even might have reported—what he saw to anyone, much
less to a federal officer. Element (3) is solely concerned
with a defendant’s intent.
Second, while element (3) requires proof that Fowler
intended to prevent some law enforcement officer from
learning what Officer Horner had seen, element (3) does
not require proof that Fowler had any particular law
enforcement officer in mind. Section 1512(a)(1)(C) simply
demands that the recipient of the information be “a law
enforcement officer.” Thus, it would be enough if Fowler’s
intent was to prevent Officer Horner’s information from
reaching any federal law enforcement officer.
