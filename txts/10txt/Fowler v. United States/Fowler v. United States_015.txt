SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

to prevent him from communicating information about
Fowler’s criminal activities. But the only evidence prof
fered by the Government to establish that the communica
tion would have been to a federal law enforcement agent
was the fact that a different state police officer, four years
later, contacted federal law enforcement about a robbery
by Fowler’s confederate—and that only because the state
law statute of limitations for the robbery had expired.
That is not nearly enough to demonstrate Fowler’s guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt.
II
The Court gives the statute a broader reading than the
one I ascribe. The Government can obtain a conviction, it
says, so long as it can prove a “reasonable likelihood” that
the communication would have been made to a federal
law enforcement officer. I know of no precedent for using
a “likelihood” standard rather than the “beyond a rea
sonable doubt” standard for a finding of fact essential
to a criminal conviction; and the justifications the Court
presents for that course in the present case are not
convincing.
The Court maintains that the Government need not
show beyond a reasonable doubt that the communication
would have been to a federal officer because “[t]he relevant
question concerns the defendant’s intent.” Ante, at 5. But
that reasoning is directly contrary to §1512(g)(2), which
expressly states that the defendant’s intent is not the
relevant question with respect to the federal character of
law enforcement officer meant to be deprived of the infor
mation. The Court’s observation that “a defendant can kill
a victim with an intent to prevent the victim from commu
nicating with federal law enforcement officers even if
there is some considerable doubt that any such communi
cation would otherwise have taken place,” ante, at 6, is
completely irrelevant to the question presented.
