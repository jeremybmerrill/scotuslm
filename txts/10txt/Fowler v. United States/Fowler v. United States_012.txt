FOWLER v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

reasonable doubt (or even more likely than not) that the
event would otherwise occur. (Recall the homeowner who
closes his shutters in order to prevent damage from a
hurricane that may not happen. Supra, at 5–6.) But the
Government must show that the likelihood of communica
tion to a federal officer was more than remote, outlandish,
or simply hypothetical. Jones, who kills Smith to prevent
his communicating with law enforcement officers in gen
eral, does not kill Smith to prevent his communicating
with Lithuanian law enforcement officers, for there is no
reasonable likelihood that any Lithuanian officers would
become involved.
V
Fowler argues that the evidence in this case is insuf
ficient to satisfy a “reasonable likelihood” standard. He
concedes, however, that he did not raise this question
specifically at trial. Tr. of Oral Arg. 21–22. We leave it to
the lower courts to determine whether, and how, the
standard applies in this particular case.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
