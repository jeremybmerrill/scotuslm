FOWLER v. UNITED STATES
ALITO, J., dissenting

of the word “prevent.” See ante, at 6–10. The Court starts
with the proposition that “apart from mistakes . . . one
cannot act with an ‘intent to prevent’ something that could
not possibly have taken place regardless.” Ante, at 6
(emphasis in original). I understand this to mean that a
rational person will not take action to prevent something
that the person knows is not possible. This is true, but it
does not follow that a rational person will not take action
to prevent an undesirable event unless the event is “rea
sonably likely.” Risk-averse people do this all the time.
They refrain from flying to avoid dying in a plane crash.
They shun rooms on the upper floors of hotels to prevent
being trapped in the event of a fire.
What matters under §1512(a)(1)(C) is not the likelihood
that information about a possible federal crime will be
conveyed to a federal officer. What matters is the intent
of the person who kills or attempts to kill in order to pre
vent that information from reaching such an officer. The
Court’s “reasonable likelihood” test has no basis in the text
of §1512(a)(1)(C).
The Court’s test also makes little sense. Under this test,
the application of §1512(a)(1)(C) depends on a witness
killer’s toleration of risk.
According to the Court,
§1512(a)(1)(C) does not reach a killer who has so little
regard for human life that he or she is willing to murder in
order to prevent even a remote possibility that a witness
will inform the authorities. It is hard to imagine why
Congress would have wanted to draw this line.

JUSTICE SCALIA’s interpretation of §1512(a)(1)(C) also
has no grounding in the language of the statute. He
makes the fundamental mistake of confusing §1512(a)
(1)(C)’s mens rea and actus reus elements. JUSTICE
SCALIA states that what he terms “the ‘federal officer’
requirement” is “an element of the actus reus,” ante, at 2
