Opinion of the Court

scope of this federal statute well beyond the primarily
federal area that Congress had in mind. See infra, at 8–9.
For both these reasons, unlike the dissent, we cannot read
the statute as intending to excuse the Government from
proving something about the hypothetical communication
with federal officers. The question remains, what is that
something?
IV
We find possible answers to this question in the diction
ary definition of the word “prevent.” As we have said, that
word applies where a defendant, by “anticipatory action,”
(here, killing a victim) intended “to render . . . impractical
or impossible” an “action or event” (here, the victim’s
communication with a federal law enforcement officer)
which (1) was “intended,” (2) was “possible,” or (3) was
“likely” to have otherwise occurred.
No one suggests that the first word, the word “in
tended,” sets forth the appropriate standard. That word in
this context refers to the victim’s intent. That intent is
often difficult to discern. Moreover, to require the Gov
ernment to prove it would prevent the statute from apply
ing where it is plain that federal officers would have
been involved in investigating and prosecuting the offense
(for instance, robbing the United States Bullion Depository
at Fort Knox), but where the defendant killed the victim
before the victim had decided to communicate to law
enforcement officers. Congress, however, intended the
statute to apply in these last-mentioned circumstances.
See supra, at 4.
The Government (and the Eleventh Circuit) would rest
their standard on the second word, the word “possible.”
See Brief for United States 10 (standard is “whether it
was reasonably possible that at least one of the communi
cations that the murder . . . was intended to prevent would
have been with a federal law enforcement official”); 603
