ALITO, J., dissenting

Third, element (3) does not demand proof that Fowler
knew that the generic officer noted above was a federal,
as opposed to a state or local, law enforcement officer. Sec
tion 1512(g)(2) specifically rules out any such requirement.
It is enough that our generic officer was in fact a federal
officer.
When the meaning of element (3) is understood, it is
clear that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case
must be affirmed. A rational jury could infer that Fowler’s
intent was to prevent information about what Officer
Horner had seen from reaching any person who could
bring about his arrest and conviction. In other words, a
rational jury could infer that Fowler, in effect, had in mind
a set of law enforcement officers (whose identities were
unknown to him) who could set in motion a chain of events
that would land him in prison. And since the information
that Officer Horner possessed related to, among other
things, the possible commission of a federal crime, a ra
tional jury could infer that this group included law en
forcement officers who were employed by the United
States. The question presented in this case is as simple as
that.
II
The Court begins on the right track, observing that the
“relevant question concerns the defendant’s intent” and
that therefore “the Government need not show beyond a
reasonable doubt (or even that it is more likely than not)
that the hypothetical communication would have been to a
federal officer.” Ante, at 5 (emphasis in original). But the
Court veers off course when it goes on to hold that the
prosecution was required to show that, if Officer Horner
had not been killed, there was a “reasonable likelihood”
that his information would have reached a federal officer.
Ante, at 9 (emphasis in original).
The Court reaches this conclusion based on the meaning
