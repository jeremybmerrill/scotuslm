the statute is so clear that “there is no ambiguity for the
rule of lenity to resolve.” Burgess v. United States, 553
U. S. 124, 136 (2008).
To make matters worse, the Court’s standard is hope
lessly indeterminate. The Government must show that a
communication to a federal officer is “reasonably likely,”

specific intent regarding the federal status of the officer,
nor even any likelihood that a communication to a federal
