II 

A

Congress has the authority “[t]o promote the Progress of
Science and useful Arts, by securing . . . to Authors and
Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings
and Discoveries.” U. S. Const. Art. I, §8, cl. 8. The first
Congress put that power to use by enacting the Patent Act
of 1790. That Act provided “[t]hat upon the petition of any
person or persons . . . setting forth, that he, she, or they,
hath or have invented or discovered” an invention, a pat
ent could be granted to “such petitioner or petitioners” or
“their heirs, administrators or assigns.” Act of Apr. 10,
1790, §1, 1 Stat. 109–110. Under that law, the first patent
was granted in 1790 to Samuel Hopkins, who had devised
an improved method for making potash, America’s first
industrial chemical. U. S. Patent No. 1 (issued July 31,
1790).3
Although much in intellectual property law has changed
in the 220 years since the first Patent Act, the basic idea
that inventors have the right to patent their inventions
has not. Under the law in its current form, “[w]hoever
invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,
manufacture, or composition of matter . . . may obtain a
patent therefor.” 35 U. S. C. §101. The inventor must
attest that “he believes himself to be the original and first
inventor of the [invention] for which he solicits a patent.”
