UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. 

BREYER, J., dissenting 


the Government’s reading) of the Act because it believes
that it is inconsistent with certain background norms of
patent law, norms that ordinarily provide an individual
inventor with full patent rights. Ante, at 10. But in my
view, the competing norms governing rights in inventions
for which the public has already paid, along with the
Bayh-Dole Act’s objectives, suggest a different result.
III
There are two different legal routes to what I consider
an interpretation more consistent with the statute’s objec
tives. First, we could set aside the Federal Circuit’s inter
pretation of the licensing agreements and its related
licensing doctrine. That doctrine governs interpretation of
licensing agreements made before an invention is con
ceived or reduced to practice. Here, there are two such
agreements. In the earlier agreement—that between Dr.
Holodniy and Stanford University—Dr. Holodniy said, “I
agree to assign . . . to Stanford . . . that right, title and
interest in and to . . . such inventions as required by Con
tracts and Grants.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a (emphasis
added). In the later agreement—that between Dr. Holod
niy and the private research firm Cetus—Dr. Holodniy
said, “I will assign and do hereby assign to Cetus, my
right, title, and interest in” here relevant “ideas” and
“inventions.” Id., at 123a (emphasis added; capitalization
omitted).
The Federal Circuit held that the earlier Stanford agree
ment’s use of the words “agree to assign,” when compared
with the later Cetus agreement’s use of the words “do
hereby assign,” made all the difference. It concluded that,
once the invention came into existence, the latter words
meant that the Cetus agreement trumped the earlier,
Stanford agreement. 583 F. 3d 832, 841–842 (CA Fed.
2009). That, in the Circuit’s view, is because the latter
words operated upon the invention automatically, while
