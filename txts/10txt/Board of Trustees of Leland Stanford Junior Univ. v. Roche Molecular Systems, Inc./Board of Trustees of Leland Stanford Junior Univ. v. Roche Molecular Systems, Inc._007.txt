the utilization of inventions arising from federally sup

invention[s]” between the Federal Government and federal
contractors (“any person, small business firm, or nonprofit
organization that is a party to a funding agreement”).
§§201(e), (c), 202(a). The Act defines “subject invention”
as “any invention of the contractor conceived or first actu

a funding agreement.” §201(e).
The Bayh-Dole Act provides that contractors may “elect

the contractor opts to retain title to the invention; and the
contractor must “file a patent application prior to any
statutory bar date.” §§202(c)(1)–(3). The “Federal Gov

contractor fails to comply with any of these obligations.
