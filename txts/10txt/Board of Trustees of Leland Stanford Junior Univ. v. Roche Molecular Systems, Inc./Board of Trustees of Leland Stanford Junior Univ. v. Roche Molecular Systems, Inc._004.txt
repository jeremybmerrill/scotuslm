BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR 

UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. 

Syllabus 

inventor and third-party rights.
Stanford’s contrary construction would permit title to an em
ployee’s inventions to vest in the University even if the invention was
conceived before the inventor became an employee, so long as the in
vention’s reduction to practice was supported by federal funding. It
also suggests that the school would obtain title were even one dollar
of federal funding applied toward an invention’s conception or reduc
tion to practice. It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to sup
plant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive in
ventors of rights in their own inventions. To do so under such
unusual terms would be truly surprising. Had Congress intended
such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so
clearly—not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of “subject
invention” and an idiosyncratic use of the word “retain.”
The Court’s construction of the Act is also reflected in the common
practice of contractors, who generally obtain assignments from their
employees, and of agencies that fund federal contractors, who typi
cally expect those contractors to obtain assignments. With effective
assignments, federally funded inventions become “subject inventions”
and the Act as a practical matter works pretty much the way Stan
ford says it should. The only significant difference is that it does so
without violence to the basic patent law principle that inventors own
their inventions. Pp. 8–15.
