Opinion of the Court

and obligations of employer and employee, touching an
invention conceived by the latter, spring from the contract
of employment”).
B
Stanford and the United States as amicus curiae con
tend that the Bayh-Dole Act reorders the normal priority
of rights in an invention when the invention is conceived
or first reduced to practice with the support of federal
funds. In their view, the Act moves inventors from the
front of the line to the back by vesting title to federally
funded inventions in the inventor’s employer—the federal
contractor. See Brief for Petitioner 26–27; Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 6.
Congress has in the past divested inventors of their
rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that
inventions created pursuant to specified federal contracts

material and atomic energy, Congress provided that title
to such inventions “shall be vested in, and be the property
of, the [Atomic Energy] Commission.” 42 U. S. C. §2182.
Congress has also enacted laws requiring that title to
certain inventions made pursuant to contracts with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration “shall be
the exclusive property of the United States,” Pub. L. 111–
314, §3, 124 Stat. 3339, 51 U. S. C. §20135(b)(1), and that
title to certain inventions under contracts with the De

U. S. C. §5908.

Act. Nowhere in the Act is title expressly vested in con
tractors or anyone else; nowhere in the Act are inventors
expressly deprived of their interest in federally funded
inventions. Instead, the Act provides that contractors may
