Opinion of the Court

§115. In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an
applying inventor, or—because an inventor’s interest in
his invention is “assignable in law by an instrument in
writing”—an inventor’s assignee. §§151, 152, 261.
Our precedents confirm the general rule that rights in
an invention belong to the inventor. See, e.g., Gayler v.
Wilder, 10 How. 477, 493 (1851) (“the discoverer of a new
and useful improvement is vested by law with an inchoate
right to its exclusive use, which he may perfect and make
absolute by proceeding in the manner which the law re
quires”); Solomons v. United States, 137 U. S. 342, 346
(1890) (“whatever invention [an inventor] may thus con
ceive and perfect is his individual property”); United
States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178, 188
(1933) (an inventor owns “the product of [his] original
thought”). The treatises are to the same effect. See, e.g., 8
Chisum on Patents §22.01, p. 22–2 (2011) (“The presump
tive owner of the property right in a patentable invention
is the single human inventor”).
It is equally well established that an inventor can assign
his rights in an invention to a third party. See Dubilier
Condenser Corp., supra, at 187 (“A patent is property and
title to it can pass only by assignment”); 8 Chisum on
Patents, supra, §22.01, at 22–2 (“The inventor . . . [may]
transfer ownership interests by written assignment to
anyone”). Thus, although others may acquire an interest
in an invention, any such interest—as a general rule—
must trace back to the inventor.
In accordance with these principles, we have recognized
that unless there is an agreement to the contrary, an
employer does not have rights in an invention “which is
the original conception of the employee alone.” Dubilier
Condenser Corp., 289 U. S., at 189. Such an invention
“remains the property of him who conceived it.” Ibid. In
most circumstances, an inventor must expressly grant his
rights in an invention to his employer if the employer is to
