BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR 

UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. 

Opinion of the Court 


Stanford University’s Department of Infectious Diseases
to test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs. Dr. Mark Holodniy
joined Stanford as a research fellow in the department
around that time. When he did so, he signed a Copyright
and Patent Agreement (CPA) stating that he “agree[d] to
assign” to Stanford his “right, title and interest in” inven
tions resulting from his employment at the University.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a–119a.
At Stanford Holodniy undertook to develop an improved
method for quantifying HIV levels in patient blood sam
ples, using PCR. Because Holodniy was largely unfamiliar
with PCR, his supervisor arranged for him to conduct
research at Cetus. As a condition of gaining access to
Cetus, Holodniy signed a Visitor’s Confidentiality Agree
ment (VCA). That agreement stated that Holodniy “will
assign and do[es] hereby assign” to Cetus his “right, title
and interest in each of the ideas, inventions and improve
ments” made “as a consequence of [his] access” to Cetus.
Id., at 122a–124a.
For the next nine months, Holodniy conducted research
at Cetus. Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy de
vised a PCR-based procedure for calculating the amount of
HIV in a patient’s blood. That technique allowed doctors
to determine whether a patient was benefiting from HIV
therapy.
Holodniy then returned to Stanford where he and other
University employees tested the HIV measurement tech
nique. Over the next few years, Stanford obtained written
assignments of rights from the Stanford employees in
volved in refinement of the technique, including Holodniy,
and filed several patent applications related to the proce
dure. Stanford secured three patents to the HIV meas
urement process.
In 1991, Roche Molecular Systems, a company that
specializes in diagnostic blood screening, acquired Cetus’s
PCR-related assets, including all rights Cetus had ob
