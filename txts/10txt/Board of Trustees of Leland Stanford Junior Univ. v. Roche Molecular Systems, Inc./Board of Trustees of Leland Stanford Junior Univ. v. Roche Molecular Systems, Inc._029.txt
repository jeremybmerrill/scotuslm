BREYER, J., dissenting

to-employer assignments as follows: First, a person who is
“employed to make an invention, who succeeds, dur
ing his term of service, in accomplishing that task, is
bound to assign to his employer any patent obtained.”
Ibid.
But, second,
“if the employment be general, albeit it cover a field of
labor and effort in the performance of which the em
ployee conceived the invention for which he obtained a
patent, the contract is not so broadly construed as to
require an assignment of the patent.” Ibid.
The Court added that, because of “the peculiar nature of
the act of invention,” courts are “reluctan[t] . . . to imply or
infer an agreement by the employee to assign his patent.”
Id., at 188. And it applied these same principles govern
ing assignment to inventions made by employees of the
United States. Id., at 189–190.
Subsequently, however, the President promulgated
Executive Order 10096. Courts have since found that this
Executive Order, not Dubilier, governs Federal Govern
ment employee-to-employer patent right assignments.
See, e.g., Kaplan v. Corcoran, 545 F. 2d 1073, 1076–1077
(CA7 1976); Heinemann, 796 F. 2d, at 455–456; Wright v.
United States, 164 F. 3d 267, 269 (CA5 1999); Halas v.
United States, 28 Fed. Cl. 354, 364 (1993). The Bayh-Dole
Act seeks objectives roughly analogous to the objectives of
the Executive Order. At least one agency has promulgated
regulations that require Bayh-Dole contractors to insist
upon similar assignments. See NIH Policies, Procedures,
and Forms, A “20–20” View of Invention Reporting to the
National Institutes of Health (Sept. 22, 1995) (available in
the Clerk of Court’s case file) (requiring a Government
contractor, such as Stanford University, to “have in place
employee agreements requiring an inventor to ‘assign’ or
