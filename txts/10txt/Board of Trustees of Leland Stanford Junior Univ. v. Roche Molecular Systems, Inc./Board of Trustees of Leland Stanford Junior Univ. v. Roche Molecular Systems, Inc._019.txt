Opinion of the Court

Policies, Procedures, and Forms, A “20–20” View of Inven
tion Reporting to the National Institutes of Health (Sept.
22, 1995). Such guidance would be unnecessary if Stan
ford’s reading of the statute were correct.
Stanford contends that reading the Bayh-Dole Act as
not vesting title to federally funded inventions in federal
contractors “fundamentally undermin[es]” the Act’s frame
work and severely threatens its continued “successful
application.” Brief for Petitioner 45. We do not agree. As
just noted, universities typically enter into agreements
with their employees requiring the assignment to the
university of rights in inventions. With an effective as
signment, those inventions—if federally funded—become
“subject inventions” under the Act, and the statute as a
practical matter works pretty much the way Stanford says
it should. The only significant difference is that it does so
without violence to the basic principle of patent law that
inventors own their inventions.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
