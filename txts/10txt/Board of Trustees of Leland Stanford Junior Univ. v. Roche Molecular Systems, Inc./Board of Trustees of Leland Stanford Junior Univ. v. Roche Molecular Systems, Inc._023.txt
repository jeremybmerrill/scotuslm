Thus, Thomas Jefferson wrote of “the difficulty of draw
ing a line between the things which are worth to the pub
lic the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those
which are not.” Letter to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13,
1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washing
ton ed. 1854). And James Madison favored the patent
monopoly because it amounted to “compensation for” a
community “benefit.” Monopolies. Perpetuities. Corpora
tions. Ecclesiastical Endowments., in J. Madison, Writings
756 (J. Rakove ed. 1999).
The importance of assuring this community “benefit” is
reflected in legal rules that may deny or limit the award of
patent rights where the public has already paid to produce
an invention, lest the public bear the potential costs of
patent protection where there is no offsetting need for
such protection to elicit that invention. Why should the
public have to pay twice for the same invention?
Legal rules of this kind include an Executive Order that
ordinarily gives to the Government “the entire right, title
and interest” to inventions made by Government employ
ees who “conduct or perform research, development work,
or both.” 37 CFR §501.6 (2010) (codifying, as amended,
Exec. Order 10096, 3 CFR 292 (1949–1953 Comp.)). See
also Heinemann v. United States, 796 F. 2d 451, 455–456
(CA Fed. 1986) (holding Executive Order constitutional
and finding “no ‘taking’ because the invention was not the
property of Heinemann”). They also include statutes,
which, in specific research areas, give the Government
title to inventions made pursuant to Government con
tracts. See Atomic Energy Act of 1954, §152, 68 Stat. 944
(codified as amended at 42 U. S. C. §2182); National Aero
nautics and Space Act of 1958, §305, 72 Stat. 435 (codified
