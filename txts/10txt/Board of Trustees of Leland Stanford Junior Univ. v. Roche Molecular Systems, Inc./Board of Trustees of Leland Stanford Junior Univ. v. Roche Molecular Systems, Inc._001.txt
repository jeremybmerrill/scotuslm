JUNIOR UNIVERSITY v. ROCHE MOLECULAR 

SYSTEMS, INC., ET AL. 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
No. 09–1159. Argued February 28, 2011—Decided June 6, 2011
In 1985, a small California research company called Cetus began to
develop methods for quantifying blood-borne levels of human immu
nodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. A Nobel Prize
winning technique developed at Cetus known as PCR was an integral
part of these efforts.
In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at Stanford
University’s Department of Infectious Diseases to test the efficacy of
new AIDS drugs. Dr. Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow
in the department around that time. When he did so, he signed an
agreement stating that he “agree[d] to assign” to Stanford his “right,
title and interest in” inventions resulting from his employment there.
Holodniy’s supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus
to learn about PCR. As a condition of gaining access to Cetus,
Holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he “will as
sign and do[es] hereby assign” to Cetus his “right, title and interest
in . . . the ideas, inventions, and improvements” made “as a conse
quence of [his] access” to Cetus. Working with Cetus employees,
Holodniy devised a PCR-based procedure for measuring the amount
of HIV in a patient’s blood. Upon returning to Stanford, he and other
Stanford employees tested the procedure. Stanford secured three
patents to the measurement process.
Roche Molecular Systems acquired Cetus’s PCR-related assets.
After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantification method de
veloped at Cetus, Roche commercialized the procedure. Today, its
HIV test kits are used worldwide.
