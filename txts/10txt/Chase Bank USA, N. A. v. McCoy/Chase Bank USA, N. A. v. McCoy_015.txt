CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY
Opinion of the Court

ple, when an increase may occur under the creditor’s
contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate)”).
In short, Regulation Z is unclear with respect to the
crucial interpretive question: whether the interest-rate
increase at issue in this case constitutes a “change in
terms” requiring notice. We need not decide which party’s
interpretation is more persuasive, however; both are
plausible, and the text alone does not permit a more de­
finitive reading. Accordingly, we find Regulation Z to be
ambiguous as to the question presented, and must there­
fore look to the Board’s own interpretation of the regula­
tion for guidance in deciding this case. See Coeur Alaska,
Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, 557 U. S.
___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14) (stating that when an
agency’s regulations construing a statute “are ambiguous
. . . we next turn to the agencies’ subsequent interpreta­
tion of those regulations” for guidance); Ford Motor Credit
Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 560 (1980) (stating that
when the question presented “is not governed by clear
expression in the . . . regulation . . . it is appropriate to
defer to the Federal Reserve Board and staff in determin­
ing what resolution of that issue” is appropriate).
B
The Board has made clear in the amicus brief it has
submitted to this Court that, in the Board’s view, Chase
was not required to give McCoy notice of the interest rate
increase under the version of Regulation Z applicable at
the time. Under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997), we
defer to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulation,
advanced in a legal brief, unless that interpretation is
“plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.”
Id., at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because
the interpretation the Board presents in its brief is consis­
tent with the regulatory text, we need look no further in
