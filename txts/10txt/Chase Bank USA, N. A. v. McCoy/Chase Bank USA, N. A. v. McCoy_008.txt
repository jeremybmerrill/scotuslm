Opinion of the Court

ently, the Board included a new provision, §226.9(g),
which requires 45 days’ advance notice of increases in
rates due to cardholder delinquency or default, or as a
penalty, including penalties for “events specified in the
account agreement, such as making a late payment . . . .”
12 CFR §226.9(g) (2010). In May 2009, Congress en­
acted the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and
Disclosure Act (Credit CARD Act or Act), 123 Stat. 1734.
The Act amended TILA, in relevant part, to require 45
days’ advance notice of most increases in credit card an­
nual percentage rates. 15 U. S. C. §1637(i) (2006 ed.,
Supp. III). Because the Credit CARD Act’s notice re­
quirements with respect to interest-rate increases largely
mirror the requirements in the new version of the regulation, the Board changed the effective date of those
requirements to August 20, 2009, to coincide with the
statutory schedule. See 74 Fed. Reg. 36077–36079. The
transactions giving rise to the dispute at issue in this case,
however, arose prior to enactment of the Act and the
promulgation of the new regulatory provisions.

United States District Court for the Central District of
California under 28 U. S. C. §1441. At the time of the
transactions at issue, McCoy was the holder of a credit
card issued by Chase. The cardholder agreement between
the parties (Agreement) provides, in relevant part, that
McCoy is eligible for “Preferred rates,” but that to keep
such rates he has to meet certain conditions, including
making “at least the required minimum payments when
due on [his] Account and on all other loans or accounts
with [Chase] and [his] other creditors.” Brief for Respon­
