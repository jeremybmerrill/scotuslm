Opinion of the Court

§226.6 is changed or the required minimum periodic
payment is increased, the creditor shall mail or de­
liver written notice of the change to each consumer
who may be affected. The notice shall be mailed or
delivered at least 15 days prior to the effective date of
the change. The 15-day timing requirement does not
apply if the change has been agreed to by the con­
sumer, or if a periodic rate or other finance charge is
increased because of the consumer’s delinquency or
default; the notice shall be given, however, before the
effective date of the change.
“(2) Notice not required. No notice under this sec­
tion is required when the change . . . results from . . .
the consumer’s default or delinquency (other than an
increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge).”
The question is whether the increase in McCoy’s inter­
est rate constitutes a change to a “term required to be
disclosed under §226.6,” requiring a subsequent disclosure
under §226.9(c)(1). One of the initial terms that must be
disclosed under §226.6 is “each periodic rate that may be
used to compute the finance charge . . . and the corre­
sponding annual percentage rate.” §226.6(a)(2). McCoy
argues that, because an increase in the interest rate in­
creases the “periodic rate” applicable to his account, such
an increase constitutes a change in terms within the
meaning of §226.9(c)(1). As further support, McCoy points
to two provisions in §226.9(c): first, that notice of an in­
crease in the interest rate must be provided “before the
effective date of the change” when the increase is due to
“the consumer’s delinquency or default,” §226.9(c)(1); and
second, that no notice is required of a change resulting
“from the consumer’s default or delinquency (other than
an increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge),”
§226.9(c)(2).
Accordingly, because §226.9(c) includes
interest-rate increases due to delinquency or default,
