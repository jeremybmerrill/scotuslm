Opinion of the Court

tent with its past views. The 2004 notice of rulemaking
and the 2007 proposed amendments to Regulation Z make
clear that, prior to 2009, the Board’s fair and considered
judgment was that “no change-in-terms notice is required
if the creditor specifies in advance the circumstances
under which an increase . . . will occur,” 69 Fed. Reg.
70931, and “immediate application of penalty pricing upon
the occurrence of certain events specified in the contract”
was permissible, 72 Fed. Reg. 33012.
Under Auer, therefore, it is clear that deference to the
interpretation in the Board’s amicus brief is warranted.
The cases McCoy cites in which we declined to apply Auer
do not suggest that deference is unwarranted here. In
Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006), we declined to
defer because—in sharp contrast to the present case—
the regulation in question did “little more than restate the
terms of the statute” pursuant to which the regulation was
promulgated. Id., at 257. Accordingly, no deference was
warranted to an agency interpretation of what were, in
fact, Congress’ words. Ibid. In contrast, at the time of the
transactions in this case, TILA itself included no require­
ments with respect to the disclosure of a change in credit
terms. In Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576
(2000), we declined to apply Auer deference because the
regulation in question was unambiguous, and adopting the
agency’s contrary interpretation would “permit the agency,
under the guise of interpreting a regulation, to create de
facto a new regulation.” 529 U. S., at 588. In light of
Regulation Z’s ambiguity, there is no such danger here.
And our statement in Christensen that “deference is war­
ranted only when the language of the regulation is am­
biguous,” ibid., is perfectly consonant with Auer itself; if
the text of a regulation is unambiguous, a conflicting
agency interpretation advanced in an amicus brief will
necessarily be “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the
regulation” in question. Auer, 519 U. S., at 461 (internal
