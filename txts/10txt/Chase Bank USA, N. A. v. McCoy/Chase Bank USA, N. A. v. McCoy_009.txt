CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY
Opinion of the Court

dent 8, n. 2; see also 559 F. 3d 963, 972, n. 1 (CA9 2009)
(Cudahy, J., dissenting). If any of the conditions in the
Agreement are not met, Chase reserves the right to
“change [McCoy’s] interest rate and impose a NonPreferred rate up to the maximum Non-Preferred rate

37a–47a.

interest-rate increase prior to its effective date. See 559
F. 3d, at 969. Concluding that the text of Regulation Z is
ambiguous and that the agency commentary accompany­
ing the 2004 request for comments and the 2007 proposed
amendments favors neither party’s interpretation, the
court relied primarily on the Official Staff Commentary; in
particular, the court noted that Comment 9(c)–1 requires
no notice of a change in terms if the “specific change” at

We note that McCoy’s complaint provides little detail regarding the
transactions at issue in this case. The parties, however, are in agree­
ment as to the essential facts alleged.
