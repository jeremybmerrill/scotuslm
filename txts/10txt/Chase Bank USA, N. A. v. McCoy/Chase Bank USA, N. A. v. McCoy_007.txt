CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY
Opinion of the Court

notice is required, but need not be given in advance.
12 CFR 226.9(c)(1); comment 9(c)(1)–3.
And no
change-in-terms notice is required if the creditor
specifies in advance the circumstances under which
an increase to the finance charge or an annual fee will
occur. Comment 9(c)–1. For example, some credit
card account agreements permit the card issuer to in­
crease the interest rate if the consumer pays late . . . .
Under Regulation Z, because the circumstances are
specified in advance in the account agreement, the
creditor need not provide a change-in-terms notice 15
days in advance of the increase; the new rate will ap­
pear on the periodic statement for the cycle in which
the increase occurs.” Id., at 70931–70932.
The Board asked for public comment on whether these
“existing disclosure rules” were “adequate to enable con­
sumers to make timely decisions about how to manage
their accounts.” Id., at 70932.
Subsequently, in 2007, the Board published proposed
amendments to Regulation Z and the Commentary. 72
Fed. Reg. 32948. One amendment would have required 45
days’ advance written notice when “(i) [a] rate is increased
due to the consumer’s delinquency or default; or (ii) [a]
rate is increased as a penalty for one or more events spec­
ified in the account agreement, such as making a late
payment or obtaining an extension of credit that exceeds
the credit limit.”
Id., at 33058 (proposed 12 CFR
§226.9(g)). The Board explained that, under the amend­
ments, “creditors would no longer be permitted to provide
for the immediate application of penalty pricing upon the
occurrence of certain events specified in the contract.” 72
Fed. Reg. 33012.
In January 2009, the Board promulgated a final rule
implementing many of the proposed changes, scheduled to
be effective July 1, 2010. 74 Fed. Reg. 5244. Most sali­
