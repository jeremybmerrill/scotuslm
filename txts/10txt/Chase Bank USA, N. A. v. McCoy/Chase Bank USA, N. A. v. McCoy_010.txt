Opinion of the Court

issue is set forth in the initial agreement. See id., at 965–
967. The court found, however, that because the Agree­
ment vests Chase with discretion to impose any NonPreferred rate it chooses (up to the specified maximum)
upon McCoy’s default, the Agreement “provides McCoy
with no basis for predicting in advance what retroactive
interest rate Chase will choose to charge him if he de­

of Appeals for the First Circuit decided the same question
in Chase’s favor. See Shaner v. Chase Bank USA, N. A.,
587 F. 3d 488 (2009). The First Circuit relied in part on

an interest-rate increase constitutes a “change in terms”

rejected the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, though on a different
question than the one presented in this case. See Swanson v. Bank of
America, N. A., 559 F. 3d 653, reh’g denied, 563 F. 3d 634 (2009)
(disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of Regulation Z).
