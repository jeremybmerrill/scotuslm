CHASE BANK USA, N. A., PETITIONER v. JAMES A. 

MCCOY, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL 

OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 24, 2011] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
As applicable to this case, Regulation Z—promulgated
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(Board) pursuant to its authority under the Truth in
Lending Act (TILA), 82 Stat. 146, 15 U. S. C. §1601 et
seq.—requires that issuers of credit cards provide card­
holders with an “[i]nitial disclosure statement” specifying,
inter alia, “each periodic rate” associated with the account.
12 CFR §226.6(a)(2) (2008). The regulation also imposes
“[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,” including notice to
cardholders “[w]henever any term required to be disclosed
under §226.6 is changed.” §226.9(c)(1). This case presents
the question whether Regulation Z requires an issuer to
notify a cardholder of an interest-rate increase instituted
pursuant to a provision of the cardholder agreement giv­
ing the issuer discretion to increase the rate, up to a
stated maximum, in the event of the cardholder’s delin­
quency or default. We conclude that the version of Regulation Z applicable in this case does not require such
notice.
