CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY
Opinion of the Court

I

A

Congress passed TILA to promote consumers’ “informed
use of credit” by requiring “meaningful disclosure of credit
terms,” 15 U. S. C. §1601(a), and granted the Board the
authority to issue regulations to achieve TILA’s purposes,
§1604(a). Pursuant to this authority, the Board promul­
gated Regulation Z, which requires credit card issuers to
disclose certain information to consumers.1 Two provi­
sions of Regulation Z are at issue in this case. The first,
12 CFR §226.6, explains what information credit card
issuers are obliged to provide to cardholders in the
“[i]nitial disclosure statement,” including “each periodic
rate that may be used to compute the finance charge.”
§226.6(a)(2). The second, §226.9, imposes upon issuers
certain “[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,” including
a requirement to provide notice “[w]henever any term
required to be disclosed under §226.6 is changed.”
§226.9(c)(1). As a general matter, notice of a change in
terms has to be provided 15 days in advance of the effec­
tive date of the change. Ibid. When “a periodic rate or
other finance charge is increased because of the con­
sumer’s delinquency or default,” however, notice only need
be given “before the effective date of the change.” Ibid.
Regulation Z also explains that no notice is required under
§226.9 when the change in terms “results from . . . the
consumer’s default or delinquency (other than an increase
in the periodic rate or other finance charge).” §226.9(c)(2).

1 As discussed more fully below, see infra, at 4–5, in 2009 the Board
amended Regulation Z, such that the provisions discussed in this
opinion are no longer in effect. However, because the pre-2009 provi­
sions are the ones applicable to the case before us, we will refer to them
in the present tense.
