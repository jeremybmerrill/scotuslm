Opinion of the Court

explains these requirements further: Section 226.9(c)(1)’s
notice-of-change requirement does not apply “if the spe­
cific change is set forth initially, such as . . . an increase
that occurs when the consumer has been under an agree­
ment to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in
order to keep a particular rate and the account balance
falls below the specified minimum.” 12 CFR pt. 226, Supp.
I, Comment 9(c)–1, p. 506 (2008) (hereinafter Comment

increase the rate at its discretion but does not include
specific terms for an increase (for example, when an in­

change in terms is required, but it may be mailed or deliv­

there is an increased periodic rate or any other finance
charge attributable to the consumer’s delinquency or
default.” Id., Comment 9(c)(1)–3, at 507 (hereinafter
Comment 9(c)(1)–3).

revisions to Regulation Z. The new regulations the Board
eventually issued do not apply to the present case, but the
details of their promulgation provide useful background

version of Regulation Z we address here. In 2004 the
Board issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking
announcing its intent to consider revisions. 69 Fed. Reg.
70925 (2004). In so doing, the Board described how it
understood the notice requirements to function at that
time:
“[A]dvance notice is not required in all cases. For ex­
ample, if the interest rate or other finance charge in­
creases due to a consumer’s default or delinquency,
