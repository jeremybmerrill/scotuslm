PITRE v. CAIN
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

2:08–CV–1894 (WD La., May 27, 2009), App. C to Pet. for
Cert. The Fifth Circuit summarily affirmed, concluding,
“Mr. Pitre has been given medical care, but he refuses to
take medication which results at times in physical prob
lems. Evidence of conscious indifference is not presented.”
354 Fed. Appx. 142, 143 (2009) (per curiam).
The Fifth Circuit’s error in requiring Pitre to produce
“evidence” in support of his allegations before a responsive
pleading was filed, in and of itself, is sufficient reason to
reverse the judgment below. See Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 564, n. 8 (2007) (“[W]hen a com
plaint adequately states a claim, it may not be dismissed
based on a district court’s assessment that the plaintiff
will fail to find evidentiary support for his allegations”).
More fundamentally, however, in focusing on Pitre’s own
contribution to his health problems, the courts appear to
have misunderstood the nature of Pitre’s Eighth Amend
ment claim. His pro se complaint and attachments
thereto, “liberally construed,” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S.
97, 106 (1976), allege not that respondents denied him
medical care but that they punished him for refusing to
take medication, or attempted to coerce him to take medi
cation, by subjecting him to hard labor that they knew
exceeded his medical limitations.
“The principle that a competent person has a constitu
tionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted
medical treatment may be inferred from our prior deci
sions.”* Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S.
261, 278 (1990). A prison regulation infringing an interest
——————
* In the District Court, Pitre also claimed a liberty interest created by
state law. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §15:860 (West 2005) (“Except as to
compliance with the sanitary laws and all reasonable regulations
relating to contagious and infectious diseases, any sane patient or sane
inmate of the Louisiana State Penitentiary may decline any medical
care or treatment offered or provided by the institution and provide
other care for himself at his own expense”).
