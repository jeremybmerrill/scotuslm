SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

in avoiding unwanted medication is valid if it is “ ‘reasona
bly related to legitimate penological interests.’ ” Washing
ton v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 223 (1990) (quoting Turner v.
Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987)). We have thus held that
prison officials may forcibly treat a mentally ill inmate
with antipsychotic drugs “if the inmate is dangerous to
himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate’s
medical interest.” Harper, 494 U. S., at 227. We have not
considered, however, whether prison officials may require
inmates with HIV to take medication, such that the re
fusal to do so might justify the imposition of sanctions by
such officials.
Even assuming respondents had a legitimate penologi
cal interest that outweighed a right to refuse HIV medica

Pitre, or to attempt to coerce him to take medication, by
subjecting him to hard labor that they knew posed “a
substantial risk of serious harm.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511
U. S. 825, 837 (1994); see also Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S.
730, 738 (2002). To determine whether prison officials’
conduct violates the Eighth Amendment in the context of
prison conditions, we ask whether “the officials involved
acted with ‘deliberate indifference’ to the inmates’ health
or safety.” Ibid. (quoting Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S.
1, 8 (1992)). Pitre’s complaint alleges that respondents
subjected him to labor that they knew posed “a substantial
risk of serious harm” to his health notwithstanding his
pleas for a more appropriate assignment, Farmer, 511
U. S., at 837, and he even attaches a letter from a prison
official implying as much. This is more than sufficient to
state a claim of deliberate indifference. See ibid. (holding
that a prison official violates the Eighth Amendment if he
denies “an inmate humane conditions of confinement [if]
the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to
inmate health or safety”).
To be sure, Pitre’s decision to refuse medication may
