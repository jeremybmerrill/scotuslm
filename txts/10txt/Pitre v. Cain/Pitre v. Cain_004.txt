PITRE v. CAIN
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

have been foolish and likely caused a significant part of
his pain. But that decision does not give prison officials
license to exacerbate Pitre’s condition further as a means
of punishing or coercing him—just as a prisoner’s disrup
tive conduct does not permit prison officials to punish the
prisoner by handcuffing him to a hitching post, see Hope,
536 U. S., at 738. Pitre’s allegations, if true, describe
“punitive treatment [that] amounts to gratuitous infliction
of ‘wanton and unnecessary’ pain that our precedent
clearly prohibits.” Ibid. I cannot comprehend how a court
could deem such allegations “frivolous.” Because I believe
that Pitre’s complaint states an Eighth Amendment viola
tion, I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and
reverse the judgment below.
