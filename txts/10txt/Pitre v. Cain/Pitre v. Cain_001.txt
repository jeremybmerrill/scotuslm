SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
ANTHONY C. PITRE v. NATHAN CAIN ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 09–9515. Decided October 18, 2010 


The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
Petitioner Anthony Pitre, a Louisiana state prisoner,
stopped taking his HIV medication to protest his transfer
to a prison facility. He alleges that respondents at the
facility punished him for this decision by subjecting him to
hard labor in 100-degree heat. According to Pitre, respon
dents repeatedly denied his requests for lighter duty more
appropriate to his medical condition, even after prison
officials twice thought his condition sufficiently serious to
rush him to an emergency room. In response to one such
request, respondent Cain expressly acknowledged in a
letter attached to Pitre’s complaint that Pitre was “dealing
with unnecessary pain and suffering, as well as cruel and
unusual punishment,” but he accused Pitre of “bringing it
on himself” by refusing to take his medication. App. F to
Pet. for Cert. (Exh. A-2). Cain concluded, “If you are
suffering because of your own choices, so be it.” Ibid. As a
result of respondents’ actions, Pitre alleges, his already
fragile medical condition deteriorated even further.
The courts below deemed these allegations insufficient
to state an Eighth Amendment violation. The Magistrate
Judge concluded that Pitre had been “ ‘hoist by his own
petard,’ ” Report and Recommendation in No. 2:08–CV–
1894 (WD La., Apr. 29, 2009), p. 9, App. C to Pet. for Cert.,
and sua sponte recommended dismissing the complaint as
“frivolous,” see 28 U. S. C. §1915(e)(2)(B)(i). The District
Judge adopted this recommendation. Judgment in No.
