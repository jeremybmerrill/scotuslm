HENRY W. SKINNER, PETITIONER v. LYNN
SWITZER, DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE
31ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[March 7, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
We granted review in this case to decide a question
presented, but left unresolved, in District Attorney’s Office
for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 12–13): May a convicted state prisoner

2006) (same); Bradley v. Pryor, 305 F. 3d 1287, 1290–1291
(CA11 2002) (same), with Harvey v. Horan, 278 F. 3d 370,
375 (CA4 2002) (claim is not cognizable under §1983) and
Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339, 341 (CA5
2002) (per curiam) (same).
