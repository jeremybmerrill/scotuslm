SKINNER v. SWITZER
THOMAS, J., dissenting

now hold that these claims are not cognizable under
§1983.
I
The Court has recognized that §1983 does not reach to
the full extent of its “broad language.” Preiser v. Rodri
guez, 411 U. S. 475, 489 (1973); see, e.g., Heck v. Hum
phrey, 512 U. S. 477, 485 (1994) (§1983 should not “expand
opportunities for collateral attack”). But this Court has
never purported to fully circumscribe the boundaries of
§1983. Cf. id., at 482. Rather, we have evaluated each
claim as it has come before us, reasoning from first princi
ples and our prior decisions.
In Preiser v. Rodriguez, the Court began with the undis
puted proposition that a state prisoner may not use §1983
to “challeng[e] his underlying conviction and sentence on
federal constitutional grounds.” 411 U. S., at 489. This
included attacks on the trial procedures. See id., at 486
(“den[ial] [of] constitutional rights at trial”). From there,
the Court reasoned that “immediate release from [physi
——————
postconviction discovery of DNA evidence that can then be used in a
state habeas proceeding to challenge the validity of a conviction. See
Ard v. State, 191 S. W. 3d 342, 344 (Tex. App. 2006). Article 64 does
not itself “provide a vehicle for obtaining relief,” Ex parte Tuley, 109
S. W. 3d 388, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002), but rather is by design and
by nature part of Texas’ collateral review procedures. See Reply Brief
for Petitioner 8 (“Because [Article 64] does not give the convicting court
authority to overturn a conviction, the prisoner still must bring a
habeas proceeding to challenge the conviction”).
Although Article 64 is, for the purposes of Skinner’s due process chal
lenge, part of the state collateral review process, I do not suggest that a
motion under Article 64 is an “application for . . . collateral review”
under 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(2). See Wall v. Kholi, post, at 10, n. 4
(noting that an application for review must “provide a state court with
authority to order relief from a judgment”). Texas has divided postcon
viction discovery of DNA evidence and the application for state habeas
into separate proceedings, but both remain parts of the State’s collat
eral review process.
