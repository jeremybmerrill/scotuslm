Opinion of the Court

Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462 (1983). Both
cases fit this pattern: The losing party in state court9 filed
suit in a U. S. District Court after the state proceedings
ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court
judgment and seeking federal-court review and rejection of
that judgment. Alleging federal-question jurisdiction, the
plaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman asked the District Court
to overturn the injurious state-court judgment. We held,
in both cases, that the District Courts lacked subject­
matter jurisdiction over such claims, for 28 U. S. C. §1257
“vests authority to review a state court’s judgment solely
in this Court.” See Exxon, 544 U. S., at 292.
We observed in Exxon that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine
had been construed by some federal courts “to extend far
beyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases.”
Id., at 283. Emphasizing “the narrow ground” occupied by
the doctrine, id., at 284, we clarified in Exxon that RookerFeldman “is confined to cases of the kind from which the
doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court
losers . . . inviting district court review and rejection of
[the state court’s] judgments.” Ibid.
Skinner’s litigation, in light of Exxon, encounters no
Rooker-Feldman shoal. “If a federal plaintiff ‘present[s]
[an] independent claim,’ ” it is not an impediment to the
exercise of federal jurisdiction that the “same or a related
question” was earlier aired between the parties in state
court. id., at 292–293 (quoting GASH Assocs. v. Rosemont,
995 F. 2d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); first alteration in original);
see In re Smith, 349 Fed. Appx. 12, 18 (CA6 2009) (Sutton,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (a defen­

Columbia Court of Appeals, equivalent for this purpose to a state’s
highest court.
