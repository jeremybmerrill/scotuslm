SKINNER v. SWITZER
THOMAS, J., dissenting

establish and review the validity of a conviction. This has
long been recognized for direct appellate review:
“And while the Fourteenth Amendment does not re
quire that a State shall provide for an appellate re
view in criminal cases, it is perfectly obvious that
where such an appeal is provided for, and the prisoner
has had the benefit of it, the proceedings in the appel
late tribunal are to be regarded as part of the process
of law under which he is held in custody by the State,
and to be considered in determining any question of
alleged deprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the
Fourteenth Amendment.” Frank v. Mangum, 237
U. S. 309, 327 (1915) (citations omitted).
Similarly, although a State is not required to provide
procedures for postconviction review, it seems clear that
when state collateral review procedures are provided for,
they too are part of the “process of law under which [a
prisoner] is held in custody by the State.” Ibid. As this
Court has explained, when considering whether the State
has provided all the process that is due in depriving an
individual of life, liberty, or property, we must look at both
pre- and post-deprivation process. See Cleveland Bd. of
Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, 547, n. 12 (1985) (“[T]he
existence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the
necessary scope of pretermination procedures”); see also
National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax
Comm’n, 515 U. S. 582, 587 (1995); Mathews v. Eldridge,
424 U. S. 319, 349 (1976). There is no principled reason
this Court should refuse to allow §1983 suits to challenge
part of this process—the trial proceedings—but bless the
use of §1983 to challenge other parts.
Collateral review procedures are, of course, “not part of
the criminal proceeding itself.” Pennsylvania v. Finley,
481 U. S. 551, 557 (1987). But like trial and direct appel
late procedures, they concern the validity of the conviction.
