Opinion of the Court

ity of his conviction. See id., at 487. When “a judgment in
favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity
of his conviction or sentence,” the Court held, §1983 is not
an available remedy. Ibid. “But if . . . the plaintiff’s ac­
tion, even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity
of [his conviction or sentence], the [§1983] action should be
allowed to proceed . . . .” Ibid.
We summarized the relevant case law most recently in
Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). That case in­
volved prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of
administrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.
They could proceed under §1983, the Court held, for they
sought no “injunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier
release into the community,” id., at 82, and “a favorable
judgment [would] not ‘necessarily imply the invalidity of
[their] conviction[s] or sentence[s],’ ” ibid. (quoting Heck,
512 U. S., at 487; first alteration added).
Measured against our prior holdings, Skinner has prop­
erly invoked §1983. Success in his suit for DNA testing
would not “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his convic­
tion. While test results might prove exculpatory, that
outcome is hardly inevitable; as earlier observed, see
supra, at 2, results might prove inconclusive or they might
further incriminate Skinner. See Nelson v. Campbell, 541
U. S. 637, 647 (2004) (“[W]e were careful in Heck to stress
the importance of the term ‘necessarily.’ ”).12
Respondent Switzer nevertheless argues, in line with
Fifth Circuit precedent, see Kutzner, 303 F. 3d, at 341,
that Skinner’s request for DNA testing must be pursued, if
at all, in an application for habeas corpus, not in a §1983
action. The dissent echoes Switzer’s argument. See post,
at 3. Although Skinner’s immediate plea is simply for an

12 The dissent would muddle the clear line Heck and Dotson drew, and
instead would instruct district courts to resort to “first principles” each
time a state prisoner files a §1983 claim in federal court. Post, at 2, 7.
