SKINNER v. SWITZER
Opinion of the Court

ing postconviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial coun­
sel testified that he had not “ask[ed] for testing because he
was afraid the DNA would turn out to be [Skinner’s].” Id.,
at 202. That decision, the CCA concluded, constituted “a
reasonable trial strategy” that the court had no cause to
second-guess. Id., at 209.
Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunc­
tive relief under §1983, naming as defendant respondent
Lynn Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prose­
cuted Skinner and has custody of the evidence Skinner
would like to have DNA tested. Skinner’s federal-court
complaint alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth
Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for
the DNA testing he requested. Complaint ¶33, App. 20–
21. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the
complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can
be granted. App. 24–41. Under the governing Circuit
precedent, Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339,
the Magistrate Judge observed, postconviction requests for
DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not
under §1983. App. 39. Adopting the Magistrate Judge’s
recommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinner’s
suit. Id., at 44–45.
On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit affirmed, 363 Fed. Appx. 302 (2010) (per
curiam), reiterating that “an action by a prisoner for post­
conviction DNA testing is not cognizable under §1983 and
must instead be brought as a petition for writ of habeas
corpus,” id., at 303. On Skinner’s petition,6 we granted
——————
mation, knowledge, and belief, the items sought to be tested are still
available for testing, the chain of custody is intact, and the items are in
a condition to be tested although the State has not sought expert
opinion in that regard.” Record 202. See also Complaint ¶29, App. 19.
6 The State of Texas scheduled Skinner’s execution for March 24,
2010. We granted Skinner’s application to stay his execution until
further action of this Court. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).
