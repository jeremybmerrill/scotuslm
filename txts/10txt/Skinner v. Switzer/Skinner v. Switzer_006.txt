SKINNER v. SWITZER
Opinion of the Court

provinces of §1983 civil rights actions and §2254 federal
habeas petitions. Habeas is the exclusive remedy, we
reaffirmed, for the prisoner who seeks “immediate or
speedier release” from confinement. Id., at 82. Where the
prisoner’s claim would not “necessarily spell speedier
release,” however, suit may be brought under §1983. Ibid.
Adhering to our opinion in Dotson, we hold that a postcon­
viction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a
§1983 action. Success in the suit gains for the prisoner
only access to the DNA evidence, which may prove excul­
patory, inculpatory, or inconclusive. In no event will a
judgment that simply orders DNA tests “necessarily
impl[y] the unlawfulness of the State’s custody.” Id., at
81. We note, however, that the Court’s decision in Os
borne severely limits the federal action a state prisoner
may bring for DNA testing. Osborne rejected the exten­
sion of substantive due process to this area, 557 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 19), and left slim room for the prisoner to
show that the governing state law denies him procedural
due process, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).

house Busby shared with Skinner.
Skinner never denied his presence in the house when
the killings occurred. He claimed, however, that he was
incapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine.
The potent alcohol and drug mix, Skinner maintained at
trial, rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal
murders charged against him. Skinner identified, as a
likely perpetrator, Busby’s uncle, Robert Donnell (now
deceased), an ex-convict with a history of physical and
