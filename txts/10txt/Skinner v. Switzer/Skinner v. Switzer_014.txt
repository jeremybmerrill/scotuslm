SKINNER v. SWITZER
Opinion of the Court

“limited grasp” of Rooker-Feldman).
As earlier noted, see supra, at 7–8, Skinner does not
challenge the adverse CCA decisions themselves; instead,
he targets as unconstitutional the Texas statute they
authoritatively construed. As the Court explained in
Feldman, 460 U. S., at 487, and reiterated in Exxon, 544
U. S., at 286, a state-court decision is not reviewable by
lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the
decision may be challenged in a federal action.10 Skinner’s
federal case falls within the latter category. There was,
therefore, no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skin­
ner’s federal suit.11

When may a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitu­
tional state action, pursue a civil rights claim under
§1983, and when is habeas corpus the prisoner’s sole
remedy? This Court has several times considered that
question. Pathmarking here is Heck v. Humphrey, 512
U. S. 477 (1994). Plaintiff in that litigation was a state
prisoner serving time for manslaughter. He brought a
§1983 action for damages, alleging that he had been
unlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.
Although the complaint in Heck sought monetary damages
only, not release from confinement, we ruled that the
plaintiff could not proceed under §1983. Any award in his
favor, we observed, would “necessarily imply” the invalid­

10 The Court further observed in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic
Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 292–293 (2005), that “[w]hen there is
parallel state and federal litigation,” state preclusion law may become
decisive, but “[p]reclusion . . . is not a jurisdictional matter.”
11 Switzer asserts that Skinner could have raised his federal claim in
the Article 64 proceeding. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Even if that were so,
“Rooker-Feldman is not simply preclusion by another name,” Lance v.
Dennis, 546 U. S. 459, 466 (2006) (per curiam), and questions of preclu­
sion unresolved below are “best left for full airing and decision on
remand,” id., at 467 (GINSBURG, J., concurring).
