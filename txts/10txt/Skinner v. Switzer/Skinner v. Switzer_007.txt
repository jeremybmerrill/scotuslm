Opinion of the Court

sexual abuse.1 On direct appeal, the Texas Court of Crimi­
nal Appeals (CCA) affirmed Skinner’s conviction and
sentence. Skinner v. State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 546 (1997).
The CCA’s opinion described the crime-scene evidence in
detail:
“As they approached the house . . . , the police noticed
a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the
front porch to the fence line. There was a blood smear
on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch.
Upon entering the residence, the police found Twila’s
dead body on the living room floor. . . . An ax handle
stained with blood and hair was leaning against the
couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag con­
taining a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains
on it was laying between the couch and the coffee
table.
“[One officer] proceeded to the bedroom where
[Busby’s two sons] usually slept in bunk beds. [The
officer] found [one] dead body laying face down on the
upper bunk, covered by a blood spotted blanket. . . . A
door leading out of the bedroom and into a utility
room yielded further evidence. [He] noticed a bloody
handprint located about 24 inches off the floor on the
frame of this door. He also noted a bloody handprint
on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen
to the utility room and a handprint on the knob of the
door exiting from the utility room into the backyard.
“[When] police arrested [Skinner] . . . [t]hey found
him standing in a closet wearing blood-stained socks

1 At trial, a defense witness testified that, on the evening of the kill­
ings, Busby had spurned Donnell’s “rude sexual advances.” Skinner v.
State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 535 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). A neighbor related
at a federal postconviction hearing that she observed Donnell, a day or
two after the murders, thoroughly cleaning the carpets and inside of his
pickup truck. See Skinner v. Quarterman, 528 F. 3d 336, 345 (CA5
2008).
