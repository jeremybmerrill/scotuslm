Opinion of the Court

projected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible
regarding DNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected
substantive due process as a basis for such claims. See
supra, at 2.
More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of
1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321–66, Congress has placed a
series of controls on prisoner suits, constraints designed to
prevent sportive filings in federal court. See, e.g., PLRA
§803(d) (adding 42 U. S. C. §1997e to create new proce­
dures and penalties for prisoner lawsuits under §1983);
PLRA §804(a)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(b)(1) to require
any prisoner proceeding in forma pauperis to pay the full
filing fee out of a percentage of his prison trust account);
PLRA §804(c)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(f) to require
prisoners to pay the full amount of any cost assessed
against them out of their prison trust account); PLRA
§804(d) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(g) to revoke, with lim­
ited exception, in forma pauperis privileges for any pris­
oner who has filed three or more lawsuits that fail to state
a claim, or are malicious or frivolous). See also CrawfordEl v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 596–597 (1998) (PLRA aims to
“discourage prisoners from filing claims that are unlikely
to succeed,” and statistics suggest that the Act is “having
its intended effect”).
Nor do we see any cause for concern that today’s ruling
will spill over to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373
U. S. 83 (1963); indeed, Switzer makes no such assertion.
Brady announced a constitutional requirement addressed
first and foremost to the prosecution’s conduct pretrial.
Brady proscribes withholding evidence “favorable to an
accused” and “material to [his] guilt or to punishment.”
Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1). To
establish that a Brady violation undermines a conviction,
a convicted defendant must make each of three showings:
(1) the evidence at issue is “favorable to the accused,
either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeach­
