SKINNER v. SWITZER
Opinion of the Court

ing”; (2) the State suppressed the evidence, “either will­
fully or inadvertently”; and (3) “prejudice . . . ensued.”
Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281–282 (1999); see
Banks v. Dretke, 540 U. S. 668, 691 (2004).
Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory,
incriminating, or inconclusive results, a Brady claim,
when successful postconviction, necessarily yields evi­
dence undermining a conviction: Brady evidence is, by
definition, always favorable to the defendant and material
to his guilt or punishment. See Strickler, 527 U. S., at
296. And parties asserting Brady violations postconvic­
tion generally do seek a judgment qualifying them for
“immediate or speedier release” from imprisonment. See
Dotson, 544 U. S., at 82. Accordingly, Brady claims have
ranked within the traditional core of habeas corpus and
outside the province of §1983. See Heck, 512 U. S., at
479, 490 (claim that prosecutors and an investigator had
“ ‘knowingly destroyed’ evidence ‘which was exculpatory in
nature and could have proved [petitioner’s] innocence’ ”
cannot be maintained under §1983); Amaker v. Weiner,
179 F. 3d 48, 51 (CA2 1999) (“claim [that] sounds under
Brady v. Maryland . . . does indeed call into question the
validity of [the] conviction”); Beck v. Muskogee Police
Dept., 195 F. 3d 553, 560 (CA10 1999) (same).

Finally, Switzer presents several reasons why Skinner’s
complaint should fail for lack of merit. Those arguments,
unaddressed by the courts below, are ripe for considera­
tion on remand. “[M]indful that we are a court of review,
not of first view,” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718,
n. 7 (2005), we confine this opinion to the matter on which
we granted certiorari and express no opinion on the ulti­
mate disposition of Skinner’s federal action.
