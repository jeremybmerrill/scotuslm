THOMAS, J., dissenting

cal] confinement or the shortening of its duration” also
cannot be sought under §1983. Id., at 489; see also Wolff
v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974) (refusing to allow a
§1983 suit for restoration of good-time credits); Edwards v.
Balisok, 520 U. S. 641 (1997) (refusing to allow a §1983
procedural challenge to the process used to revoke good
time credits). Then, in Heck v. Humphrey, we addressed
§1983 actions seeking damages. 512 U. S., at 483. De

we returned to “the hoary principle that civil tort actions

challenges to state collateral review procedures may be

Congress’ strict limitations on federal review of state
habeas decisions. If cognizable at all, Skinner’s claim
sounds in habeas corpus.
First, for the purposes of the Due Process Clause, the
process of law for the deprivation of liberty comprises all
procedures—including collateral review procedures—that
