Opinion of the Court

certiorari, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), and now reverse the Fifth
Circuit’s judgment.
II 

A

Because this case was resolved on a motion to dismiss
for failure to state a claim, the question below was “not
whether [Skinner] will ultimately prevail” on his proce­
dural due process claim, see Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S.
232, 236 (1974), but whether his complaint was sufficient
to cross the federal court’s threshold, see Swierkiewicz v.
Sorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 514 (2002). Skinner’s com­
plaint is not a model of the careful drafter’s art, but under
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need not
pin plaintiff’s claim for relief to a precise legal theory.
Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gener­
ally requires only a plausible “short and plain” statement
of the plaintiff’s claim, not an exposition of his legal argu­
ment. See 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice &
Procedure §1219, pp. 277–278 (3d ed. 2004 and Supp.
2010).
Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph
alleging that the State’s refusal “to release the biological
evidence for testing . . . has deprived [him] of his liberty
interests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of
his conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his
sentence . . . .” Complaint ¶33, App. 20–21. As earlier
recounted, see supra, at 5–6, Skinner had twice requested
and failed to obtain DNA testing under the only state-law
procedure then available to him. See Complaint ¶¶22–31,
App. 14–20.7 At oral argument in this Court, Skinner’s
counsel clarified the gist of Skinner’s due process claim:
He does not challenge the prosecutor’s conduct or the

7 He also persistently sought the State’s voluntary testing of the ma­
terials he identified. See Complaint ¶31, App. 20.
