Opinion of the Court

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 64.01(a) (Vernon Supp.
2010). To obtain DNA testing under Article 64, a prisoner
must meet one of two threshold criteria. He may show
that, at trial, testing either was “not available” or was
“available, but not technologically capable of providing
probative results.” Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A). Alternatively, he
may show that the evidence was not previously tested
“through no fault” on his part, and that “the interests of
justice” require a postconviction order for testing. Art.
64.01(b)(1)(B). To grant a motion for postconviction test­
ing, a court must make further findings, prime among
them, the movant “would not have been convicted if excul­
patory results had been obtained through DNA testing,”
and “the [Article 64] request . . . [was] not made to unrea­
sonably delay the execution of sentence or administration
of justice.” Art. 64.03(a)(2).
Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court,
first in 2001 and again in 2007, for DNA testing of yet
untested biological evidence. See supra, at 4, n. 3. Both
motions were denied. Affirming the denial of Skinner’s
first motion, the CCA held that he had failed to demon­
strate a “reasonable probability . . . that he would not have
been . . . convicted if the DNA test results were exculpa­
tory.” Skinner v. State, 122 S. W. 3d, at 813.
Skinner’s second motion was bolstered by discovery he
had obtained in the interim.4 The CCA again affirmed the
denial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground
that Skinner failed to meet the “no fault” requirement.
See Skinner v. State, 293 S. W. 3d 196, 200 (2009).5 Dur­

4 On the basis of discovery in a federal postconviction proceeding, an
expert retained by Skinner concluded that Skinner, Busby, and her two
sons could be excluded as sources of a hair collected from Busby’s right
hand after the killings. See Record 190. See also Complaint ¶27, App.
