SKINNER v. SWITZER
THOMAS, J., dissenting

lenge in that case was not cognizable under §1983.5 See
512 U. S., at 486. Dotson does not suggest that the Heck
approach, which I would continue to follow here, was
incorrect.

This Court has struggled to limit §1983 and prevent it
from intruding into the boundaries of habeas corpus. In
crafting these limits, we have recognized that suits seek
ing “immediate or speedier release” from confinement fall
outside its scope. Dotson, supra, at 82. We found another
limit when faced with a civil action in which “a judgment
in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the inva
lidity of his conviction or sentence.” Heck, supra, at 487.
This case calls for yet another: due process challenges to
state procedures used to review the validity of a conviction
or sentence. Under that rule, Skinner’s claim is not cogni
zable under §1983, and the judgment of the Court of Ap
peals should be affirmed. I respectfully dissent.
