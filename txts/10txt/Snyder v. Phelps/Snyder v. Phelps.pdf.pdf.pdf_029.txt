ALITO, J., dissenting

and “Thank God for Dead Soldiers” reiterated the message
that God had caused Matthew’s death in retribution for
his sins. App. to Brief for Appellants in No. 08–1026
(CA4), pp. 3787, 3788 (hereinafter App.). Others, stating
“You’re Going to Hell” and “Not Blessed Just Cursed,”
conveyed the message that Matthew was “in Hell—sine
die.” Id., at 3783.
Even if those who attended the funeral were not alerted
in advance about respondents’ intentions, the meaning of
these signs would not have been missed. Since respon
dents chose to stage their protest at Matthew Snyder’s
funeral and not at any of the other countless available
venues, a reasonable person would have assumed that
there was a connection between the messages on the
placards and the deceased. Moreover, since a church
funeral is an event that naturally brings to mind thoughts
about the afterlife, some of respondents’ signs—e.g., “God
Hates You,” “Not Blessed Just Cursed,” and “You’re Going
to Hell”—would have likely been interpreted as referring
to God’s judgment of the deceased.
Other signs would most naturally have been understood
as suggesting—falsely—that Matthew was gay. Homo
sexuality was the theme of many of the signs. There were
signs reading “God Hates Fags,” “Semper Fi Fags,” “Fags
Doom Nations,” and “Fag Troops.” Id., at 3781–3787.
Another placard depicted two men engaging in anal inter
course. A reasonable bystander seeing those signs would
have likely concluded that they were meant to suggest
that the deceased was a homosexual.
After the funeral, the Westboro picketers reaffirmed the
meaning of their protest. They posted an online account
entitled “The Burden of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew A.
Snyder. The Visit of Westboro Baptist Church to Help the
Inhabitants of Maryland Connect the Dots!” Id., at 3788.15
