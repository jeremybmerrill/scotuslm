SNYDER v. PHELPS
Syllabus
tentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclu
sion—the allegedly unlawful activity Westboro conspired to accom
plish—Snyder also cannot recover for civil conspiracy based on those
torts. P. 14.
(d) Westboro addressed matters of public import on public prop
erty, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of lo
cal officials. It did not disrupt Mathew Snyder’s funeral, and its
choice to picket at that time and place did not alter the nature of its
speech. Because this Nation has chosen to protect even hurtful
speech on public issues to ensure that public debate is not stifled,
Westboro must be shielded from tort liability for its picketing in this
case. Pp. 14–15.

KENNEDY, THOMAS, GINSBURG, BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ.,
