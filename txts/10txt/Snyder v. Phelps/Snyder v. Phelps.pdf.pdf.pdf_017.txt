Opinion of the Court

chose to say it, is entitled to “special protection” under the
First Amendment, and that protection cannot be overcome
by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous.
For all these reasons, the jury verdict imposing tort
liability on Westboro for intentional infliction of emotional

The jury also found Westboro liable for the state law
torts of intrusion upon seclusion and civil conspiracy. The

that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an
essentially intolerable manner.” Cohen v. California, 403
U. S. 15, 21 (1971).
As a general matter, we have applied the captive audi
