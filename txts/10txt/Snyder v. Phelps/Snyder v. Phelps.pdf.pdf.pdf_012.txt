SNYDER v. PHELPS
Opinion of the Court

form, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it is neces
sary to evaluate all the circumstances of the speech, in
cluding what was said, where it was said, and how it was
said.
The “content” of Westboro’s signs plainly relates to
broad issues of interest to society at large, rather than
matters of “purely private concern.” Dun & Bradstreet,
supra, at 759.
The placards read “God Hates the
USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don’t
Pray for the USA,” “Thank God for IEDs,” “Fag Troops,”
“Semper Fi Fags,” “God Hates Fags,” “Maryland Taliban,”
“Fags Doom Nations,” “Not Blessed Just Cursed,” “Thank
God for Dead Soldiers,” “Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape
Boys,” “You’re Going to Hell,” and “God Hates You.” App.
3781–3787. While these messages may fall short of
refined social or political commentary, the issues they
highlight—the political and moral conduct of the United
States and its citizens, the fate of our Nation, homosexual
ity in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic
clergy—are matters of public import. The signs certainly
convey Westboro’s position on those issues, in a manner
designed, unlike the private speech in Dun & Bradstreet,
to reach as broad a public audience as possible. And even
if a few of the signs—such as “You’re Going to Hell” and
“God Hates You”—were viewed as containing messages
related to Matthew Snyder or the Snyders specifically,
that would not change the fact that the overall thrust and
dominant theme of Westboro’s demonstration spoke to
broader public issues.
Apart from the content of Westboro’s signs, Snyder
contends that the “context” of the speech—its connection
with his son’s funeral—makes the speech a matter of
private rather than public concern. The fact that West
boro spoke in connection with a funeral, however, cannot
by itself transform the nature of Westboro’s speech.
