BREYER, J., concurring

uphold the application of state law in these circumstances
would punish Westboro for seeking to communicate its
views on matters of public concern without proportionately
advancing the State’s interest in protecting its citizens
against severe emotional harm. Consequently, the First
Amendment protects Westboro. As I read the Court’s
opinion, it holds no more.
