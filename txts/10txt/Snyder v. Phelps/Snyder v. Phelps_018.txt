SNYDER v. PHELPS
Opinion of the Court

ence doctrine only sparingly to protect unwilling listeners
from protected speech. For example, we have upheld a
statute allowing a homeowner to restrict the delivery of

Westboro believes that America is morally flawed; many
Americans might feel the same about Westboro. West
boro’s funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its con

Westboro addressed matters of public import on public
property, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the
