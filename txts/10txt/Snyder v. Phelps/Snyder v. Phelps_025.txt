ALITO, J., dissenting

A plaintiff must also establish that the defendant’s
conduct was “ ‘so outrageous in character, and so extreme
in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency,
and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in
a civilized community.’ ” Id., at 567, 380 A. 2d, at 614
(quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts §46, Comment d).

to engage in such conduct. They are wrong.

infliction of emotional distress can be satisfied by speech.
Indeed, what has been described as “[t]he leading case”
recognizing this tort involved speech. Prosser and Keeton,
supra, §12, at 60 (citing Wilkinson v. Downton, [1897] 2
Q. B. 57); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts §46,
illustration 1. And although this Court has not decided
the question, I think it is clear that the First Amendment
does not entirely preclude liability for the intentional
infliction of emotional distress by means of speech.
This Court has recognized that words may “by their very
utterance inflict injury” and that the First Amendment
does not shield utterances that form “no essential part of
