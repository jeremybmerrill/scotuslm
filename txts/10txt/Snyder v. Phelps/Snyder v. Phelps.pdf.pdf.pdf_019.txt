Opinion of the Court

guidance of local officials. The speech was indeed planned
to coincide with Matthew Snyder’s funeral, but did not
itself disrupt that funeral, and Westboro’s choice to con
duct its picketing at that time and place did not alter the
nature of its speech.
Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move
them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and—as it did here—
inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react
to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we
have chosen a different course—to protect even hurtful
speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle
public debate. That choice requires that we shield West
boro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
