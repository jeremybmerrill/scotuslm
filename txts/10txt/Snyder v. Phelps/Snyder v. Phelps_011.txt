Opinion of the Court

interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value
and concern to the public,” San Diego, supra, at 83–84.
See Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,
492–494 (1975); Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 387–
388 (1967). The arguably “inappropriate or controversial
character of a statement is irrelevant to the question
whether it deals with a matter of public concern.” Rankin
v. McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 387 (1987).
Our opinion in Dun & Bradstreet, on the other hand,
provides an example of speech of only private concern. In
that case we held, as a general matter, that information
about a particular individual’s credit report “concerns no
public issue.” 472 U. S., at 762. The content of the report,
we explained, “was speech solely in the individual interest
of the speaker and its specific business audience.” Ibid.
That was confirmed by the fact that the particular report
was sent to only five subscribers to the reporting service,
who were bound not to disseminate it further. Ibid. To
cite another example, we concluded in San Diego v. Roe
that, in the context of a government employer regulating
the speech of its employees, videos of an employee engag
ing in sexually explicit acts did not address a public con
cern; the videos “did nothing to inform the public about
any aspect of the [employing agency’s] functioning or
operation.” 543 U. S., at 84.
Deciding whether speech is of public or private concern
requires us to examine the “ ‘content, form, and context’ ”
of that speech, “ ‘as revealed by the whole record.’ ” Dun &
Bradstreet, supra, at 761 (quoting Connick, supra, at 147–
148). As in other First Amendment cases, the court is
obligated “to ‘make an independent examination of the
whole record’ in order to make sure that ‘the judgment
does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of
free expression.’ ” Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of
United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 499 (1984) (quoting New
York Times, supra, at 284–286). In considering content,
