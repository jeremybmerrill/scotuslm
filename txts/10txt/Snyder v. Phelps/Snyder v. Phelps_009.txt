Opinion of the Court

We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).
II
To succeed on a claim for intentional infliction of emo
tional distress in Maryland, a plaintiff must demonstrate
that the defendant intentionally or recklessly engaged in
extreme and outrageous conduct that caused the plaintiff
to suffer severe emotional distress. See Harris v. Jones,
281 Md. 560, 565–566, 380 A. 2d 611, 614 (1977). The
Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment—“Congress
shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech”—
can serve as a defense in state tort suits, including suits
for intentional infliction of emotional distress. See, e.g.,
Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 50–51
(1988).3
Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding West
boro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on
whether that speech is of public or private concern, as
determined by all the circumstances of the case. “[S]peech
on ‘matters of public concern’ . . . is ‘at the heart of the
First Amendment’s protection.’ ” Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v.
Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 758–759 (1985)
(opinion of Powell, J.) (quoting First Nat. Bank of Boston
v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 776 (1978)). The First Amend
ment reflects “a profound national commitment to the
——————
on any of his tort claims. 580 F. 3d, at 227 (opinion of Shedd, J.). The
Court of Appeals majority determined that the picketers had “voluntar
ily waived” any such contention on appeal. Id., at 216. Like the court
below, we proceed on the unexamined premise that respondents’ speech
was tortious.
3 The dissent attempts to draw parallels between this case and hy
pothetical cases involving defamation or fighting words. Post, at 10–11
(opinion of ALITO, J.). But, as the court below noted, there is “no
suggestion that the speech at issue falls within one of the categorical
exclusions from First Amendment protection, such as those for obscen
ity or ‘fighting words.’ ” 580 F. 3d, at 218, n. 12; see United States v.
Stevens, 559 U. S. ___ , ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5).
