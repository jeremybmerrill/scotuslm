SNYDER v. PHELPS
ALITO, J., dissenting

was able to obtain free air time on the radio in exchange
for canceling its protest.13 Similarly, in 2006, the church
got air time on a talk radio show in exchange for canceling
its threatened protest at the funeral of five Amish girls
killed by a crazed gunman.14
In this case, respondents implemented the Westboro
Baptist Church’s publicity-seeking strategy. Their press
release stated that they were going “to picket the funeral
of Lance Cpl. Matthew A. Snyder” because “God Almighty
killed Lance Cpl. Snyder. He died in shame, not honor—
for a fag nation cursed by God . . . . Now in Hell—sine
die.” Supp. App. in No. 08–1026 (CA4), p. 158a. This
announcement guaranteed that Matthew’s funeral would
be transformed into a raucous media event and began the
wounding process. It is well known that anticipation may
heighten the effect of a painful event.
On the day of the funeral, respondents, true to their
word, displayed placards that conveyed the message prom
ised in their press release. Signs stating “God Hates You”
