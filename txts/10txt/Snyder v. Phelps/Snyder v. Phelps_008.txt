SNYDER v. PHELPS
Opinion of the Court

The District Court awarded Westboro summary judg
ment on Snyder’s claims for defamation and publicity
given to private life, concluding that Snyder could not
prove the necessary elements of those torts. Id., at 572–
573. A trial was held on the remaining claims. At trial,
Snyder described the severity of his emotional injuries.
He testified that he is unable to separate the thought of
his dead son from his thoughts of Westboro’s picketing,
and that he often becomes tearful, angry, and physically ill
when he thinks about it. Id., at 588–589. Expert wit
nesses testified that Snyder’s emotional anguish had
resulted in severe depression and had exacerbated pre
existing health conditions.
A jury found for Snyder on the intentional infliction of
emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil
conspiracy claims, and held Westboro liable for $2.9 mil
lion in compensatory damages and $8 million in punitive
damages. Westboro filed several post-trial motions, in
cluding a motion contending that the jury verdict was
grossly excessive and a motion seeking judgment as a
matter of law on all claims on First Amendment grounds.
The District Court remitted the punitive damages award
to $2.1 million, but left the jury verdict otherwise intact.
Id., at 597.
In the Court of Appeals, Westboro’s primary argument
was that the church was entitled to judgment as a matter
of law because the First Amendment fully protected West
boro’s speech. The Court of Appeals agreed. 580 F. 3d
206, 221 (CA4 2009). The court reviewed the picket signs
and concluded that Westboro’s statements were entitled to
First Amendment protection because those statements
were on matters of public concern, were not provably false,
and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.
Id., at 222–224.2

failed to introduce sufficient evidence at trial to support a jury verdict
