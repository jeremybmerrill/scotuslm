SNYDER v. PHELPS 

ALITO, J., dissenting 


VI 

Respondents’ outrageous conduct caused petitioner
great injury, and the Court now compounds that injury by
depriving petitioner of a judgment that acknowledges the
wrong he suffered.
In order to have a society in which public issues can be
openly and vigorously debated, it is not necessary to allow
the brutalization of innocent victims like petitioner. I
therefore respectfully dissent.

—————— 

the judgment on the claim of civil conspiracy can survive in light of the

ultimate disposition of the IIED and intrusion upon seclusion claims.
