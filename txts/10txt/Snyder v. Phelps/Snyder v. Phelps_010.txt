Opinion of the Court

principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibi
ted, robust, and wide-open.” New York Times Co. v. Sulli
van, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964). That is because “speech
concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is
the essence of self-government.” Garrison v. Louisiana,
379 U. S. 64, 74–75 (1964). Accordingly, “speech on public
issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of First
Amendment values, and is entitled to special protection.”

“ ‘[N]ot all speech is of equal First Amendment impor

significance are at issue, First Amendment protections are
often less rigorous. Hustler, supra, at 56 (quoting Dun &
Bradstreet, supra, at 758); see Connick, supra, at 145–147.
That is because restricting speech on purely private mat

the risk of “a reaction of self-censorship” on matters of
public import. Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 760 (internal
quotation marks omitted).
We noted a short time ago, in considering whether
public employee speech addressed a matter of public con
cern, that “the boundaries of the public concern test are
not well defined.” San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 83
(2004) (per curiam). Although that remains true today, we
have articulated some guiding principles, principles that
accord broad protection to speech to ensure that courts
themselves do not become inadvertent censors.
Speech deals with matters of public concern when it can
“be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community,” Connick,
supra, at 146, or when it “is a subject of legitimate news
