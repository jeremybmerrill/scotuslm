ALBERT SNYDER, PETITIONER v. FRED W. 

PHELPS, SR., ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[March 2, 2011] 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
A jury held members of the Westboro Baptist Church
liable for millions of dollars in damages for picketing near
a soldier’s funeral service. The picket signs reflected the
church’s view that the United States is overly tolerant of
sin and that God kills American soldiers as punishment.
The question presented is whether the First Amendment
shields the church members from tort liability for their
speech in this case.

A

Fred Phelps founded the Westboro Baptist Church in
Topeka, Kansas, in 1955. The church’s congregation
believes that God hates and punishes the United States
for its tolerance of homosexuality, particularly in Amer
ica’s military. The church frequently communicates its
views by picketing, often at military funerals. In the more
than 20 years that the members of Westboro Baptist have
publicized their message, they have picketed nearly 600
funerals. Brief for Rutherford Institute as Amicus Curiae
