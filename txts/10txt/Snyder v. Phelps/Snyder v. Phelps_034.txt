SNYDER v. PHELPS
ALITO, J., dissenting

vulnerable. See National Archives and Records Admin. v.
Favish, 541 U. S. 157, 168 (2004). Exploitation of a fu

trud[es] upon their . . . grief,” ibid., and may permanently

Appeals thought that this was a question for the trial
judge alone or a question on which the judge had to make
a preliminary ruling before sending it to the jury. In
either event, however, the submission of this question to
the jury was not reversible error because, as explained
above, it is clear that respondents’ statements targeted the
Snyders.
Second, the Court of Appeals held that the trial judge
went astray in allowing the jury to decide whether re
spondents’ speech was so “ ‘offensive and shocking as to
not be entitled to First Amendment protection.’ ” Ibid.
This instruction also did respondents no harm. Because
their speech did not relate to a matter of public concern, it
was not protected from liability by the First Amendment,
