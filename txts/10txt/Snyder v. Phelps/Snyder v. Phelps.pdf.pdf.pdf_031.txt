ALITO, J., dissenting

He has smoke coming from his nostrils and fire from
his mouth! How dumb was that?” Id., at 3791.
In light of this evidence, it is abundantly clear that
respondents, going far beyond commentary on matters of
public concern, specifically attacked Matthew Snyder
because (1) he was a Catholic and (2) he was a member of
the United States military. Both Matthew and petitioner
were private figures,16 and this attack was not speech on a
matter of public concern. While commentary on the Cath
olic Church or the United States military constitutes
speech on matters of public concern, speech regarding
Matthew Snyder’s purely private conduct does not.
JUSTICE BREYER provides an apt analogy to a case in
which the First Amendment would permit recovery in tort
for a verbal attack:
“[S]uppose that A were physically to assault B, know
ing that the assault (being newsworthy) would provide
A with an opportunity to transmit to the public his
views on a matter of public concern. The constitu
tionally protected nature of the end would not shield
A’s use of unlawful, unprotected means. And in some
circumstances the use of certain words as means
would be similarly unprotected.” Ante, at 1 (concur
ring opinion).
This captures what respondents did in this case. In
deed, this is the strategy that they have routinely em
ployed—and that they will now continue to employ—
inflicting severe and lasting emotional injury on an ever
growing list of innocent victims.

The Court concludes that respondents’ speech was
protected by the First Amendment for essentially three
