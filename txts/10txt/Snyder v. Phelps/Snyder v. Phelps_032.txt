SNYDER v. PHELPS
ALITO, J., dissenting

reasons, but none is sound.
First—and most important—the Court finds that “the
overall thrust and dominant theme of [their] demonstra
tion spoke to” broad public issues. Ante, at 8. As I have
attempted to show, this portrayal is quite inaccurate;
respondents’ attack on Matthew was of central impor
tance. But in any event, I fail to see why actionable
speech should be immunized simply because it is inter
spersed with speech that is protected. The First Amend
ment allows recovery for defamatory statements that are
interspersed with nondefamatory statements on matters
of public concern, and there is no good reason why respon
dents’ attack on Matthew Snyder and his family should be
treated differently.
Second, the Court suggests that respondents’ personal
attack on Matthew Snyder is entitled to First Amendment
protection because it was not motivated by a private
grudge, see ante, at 9, but I see no basis for the strange
distinction that the Court appears to draw. Respondents’
motivation—“to increase publicity for its views,” ibid.—did
not transform their statements attacking the character
of a private figure into statements that made a contri
bution to debate on matters of public concern. Nor did
their publicity-seeking motivation soften the sting of their
attack. And as far as culpability is concerned, one might
well think that wounding statements uttered in the heat
of a private feud are less, not more, blameworthy than
similar statements made as part of a cold and calculated
strategy to slash a stranger as a means of attracting pub
lic attention.
Third, the Court finds it significant that respondents’
protest occurred on a public street, but this fact alone
should not be enough to preclude IIED liability. To be
sure, statements made on a public street may be less
likely to satisfy the elements of the IIED tort than state
ments made on private property, but there is no reason
