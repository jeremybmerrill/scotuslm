SNYDER v. PHELPS
Opinion of the Court

Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in
Iraq in the line of duty. Lance Corporal Snyder’s father
selected the Catholic church in the Snyders’ hometown of
Westminster, Maryland, as the site for his son’s funeral.
Local newspapers provided notice of the time and location
of the service.
Phelps became aware of Matthew Snyder’s funeral and
decided to travel to Maryland with six other Westboro
Baptist parishioners (two of his daughters and four of
his grandchildren) to picket. On the day of the memorial
service, the Westboro congregation members picketed on
public land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland
State House, the United States Naval Academy, and
Matthew Snyder’s funeral. The Westboro picketers car
ried signs that were largely the same at all three locations.
They stated, for instance: “God Hates the USA/Thank God
for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don’t Pray for the USA,”
“Thank God for IEDs,” “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,”
“Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” “God Hates Fags,”
“You’re Going to Hell,” and “God Hates You.”
The church had notified the authorities in advance of its
intent to picket at the time of the funeral, and the picket
ers complied with police instructions in staging their
demonstration. The picketing took place within a 10- by
25-foot plot of public land adjacent to a public street,
behind a temporary fence. App. to Brief for Appellants
in No. 08–1026 (CA4), pp. 2282–2285 (hereinafter App.).
That plot was approximately 1,000 feet from the church
where the funeral was held. Several buildings separated
the picket site from the church. Id., at 3758. The West
boro picketers displayed their signs for about 30 minutes
before the funeral began and sang hymns and recited
Bible verses. None of the picketers entered church prop
erty or went to the cemetery. They did not yell or use
profanity, and there was no violence associated with the
picketing. Id., at 2168, 2371, 2286, 2293.
