SNYDER v. PHELPS
ALITO, J., dissenting

strong opinions on certain moral, religious, and political
issues, and the First Amendment ensures that they have
almost limitless opportunities to express their views.
They may write and distribute books, articles, and other
texts; they may create and disseminate video and audio
recordings; they may circulate petitions; they may speak
to individuals and groups in public forums and in any
private venue that wishes to accommodate them; they may
picket peacefully in countless locations; they may appear
on television and speak on the radio; they may post mes
sages on the Internet and send out e-mails. And they may
express their views in terms that are “uninhibited,” “ve
hement,” and “caustic.” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964).
It does not follow, however, that they may intentionally
inflict severe emotional injury on private persons at a time
of intense emotional sensitivity by launching vicious ver
bal attacks that make no contribution to public debate. To
protect against such injury, “most if not all jurisdictions”
permit recovery in tort for the intentional infliction of
emotional distress (or IIED). Hustler Magazine, Inc. v.
Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 53 (1988).
This is a very narrow tort with requirements that “are
rigorous, and difficult to satisfy.” W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.
Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts
§12, p. 61 (5th ed. 1984). To recover, a plaintiff must show
that the conduct at issue caused harm that was truly
severe. See Figueiredo-Torres v. Nickel, 321 Md. 642, 653,
584 A. 2d 69, 75 (1991) (“[R]ecovery will be meted out
sparingly, its balm reserved for those wounds that are
truly severe and incapable of healing themselves” (inter
nal quotation marks omitted)); Harris v. Jones, 281 Md.
560, 571, 380 A. 2d 611, 616 (1977) (the distress must be
“ ‘so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to
endure it’ ” (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts §46,
Comment j (1963–1964))).
