TAPIA v. UNITED STATES
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

§3553(a)(2)(A). Fourth, he considered the need “to deter
criminal conduct” and “to protect the public from further
crimes of the defendant,” which he characterized as a “big
factor here, given [Tapia’s] failure to appear and what she
did out on bail.” App. 26; see §§3553(a)(2)(B), (C). Fifth,
he took account of the need “to provide needed correctional
treatment,” in this case, the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) “500
Hour Drug Program,” more officially called the Residential
Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP). App. 27; see
§3553(a)(2)(D). And, finally, he noted the need “to avoid
unwarranted sentencing disparities” and the need for the
sentence “to be sufficient to effect the purposes of 3553(a)
but not greater.” App. 27; see §§3553(a), (a)(6).
Tapia faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 36
months’ incarceration, App. 18, but her Guidelines range
was 41 to 51 months, id., at 13. After reviewing the
§3553(a) factors, the judge imposed a sentence of 51
months, the top of the Guidelines range. He offered two
reasons for choosing this sentence: “number one,” the need
for drug treatment; and “[n]umber two,” deterrence. Id.,
at 27. With respect to the latter reason, the judge high
lighted Tapia’s criminal history and her criminal conduct
while released on bail—which, he said, was “something
that motivates imposing a sentence that in total is at the
high end of the guideline range.” Id., at 27–28. He con
cluded, “I think that a sentence less than what I am im
posing would not deter her and provide for sufficient time
so she could begin to address these problems.” Id., at 28.
The District Judge’s comments at sentencing suggest
that he believed the need to deter Tapia from engaging in
further criminal conduct warranted a sentence of 51
months’ incarceration. Granted, the judge also mentioned
the need to provide drug treatment through the RDAP.
The 51-month sentence he selected, however, appears to
have had no connection to eligibility for the RDAP. See
