TAPIA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

correctional treatment is the 500 Hour Drug Program.

“Here I have to say that one of the factors that—I am
going to impose a 51-month sentence, . . . and one of
the factors that affects this is the need to provide
treatment. In other words, so she is in long enough to
get the 500 Hour Drug Program, number one.” App.
27.
(“Number two” was “to deter her from committing other
criminal offenses.” Ibid.) The court “strongly recom
mend[ed]” to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that Tapia
“participate in [RDAP] and that she serve her sentence at”
the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California
(FCI Dublin), where “they have the appropriate tools . . .
to help her, to start to make a recovery.” Id., at 29. Tapia
did not object to the sentence at that time. Id., at 31.
On appeal, however, Tapia argued that the District
Court had erred in lengthening her prison term to make
her eligible for RDAP. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. In Tapia’s
view, this action violated 18 U. S. C. §3582(a), which
instructs sentencing courts to “recogniz[e] that imprison
ment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction
and rehabilitation.” The United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit disagreed, 376 Fed. Appx. 707 (2010),
relying on its prior decision in United States v. Duran, 37
F. 3d 557 (1994). The Ninth Circuit had held there that
§3582(a) distinguishes between deciding to impose a term
of imprisonment and determining its length. See id., at
561. According to Duran, a sentencing court cannot im
pose a prison term to assist a defendant’s rehabilitation.
But “[o]nce imprisonment is chosen as a punishment,” the
court may consider the defendant’s need for rehabilitation
in setting the length of the sentence. Ibid.
We granted certiorari to consider whether §3582(a)
