Syllabus
(c) Amicus’ attempts to recast what the SRA says about rehabilita
tion are unavailing. Pp. 12–14.
(d) Here, the sentencing transcript suggests that Tapia’s sentence
may have been lengthened in light of her rehabilitative needs. A
court does not err by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation
within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or training pro
grams. But the record indicates that the District Court may have in
creased the length of Tapia’s sentence to ensure her completion of
RDAP, something a court may not do. The Ninth Circuit is left to
consider on remand the effect of Tapia’s failure to object to the sen
tence when imposed. Pp. 14–15.
