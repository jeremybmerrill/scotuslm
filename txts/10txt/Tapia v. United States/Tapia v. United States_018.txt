Opinion of the Court

program.
But the record indicates that the court may have done
more—that it may have selected the length of the sentence
to ensure that Tapia could complete the 500 Hour Drug
Program. “The sentence has to be sufficient,” the court
explained, “to provide needed correctional treatment, and
here I think the needed correctional treatment is the
500 Hour Drug Program.” App. 27; see supra, at 1–2. Or
again: The “number one” thing “is the need to provide
treatment. In other words, so she is in long enough to get
the 500 Hour Drug Program.” App. 27; see supra, at 2.
These statements suggest that the court may have calcu
lated the length of Tapia’s sentence to ensure that she
receive certain rehabilitative services. And that a sentenc
ing court may not do. As we have held, a court may not
impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender
to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote
rehabilitation.
For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed
ings consistent with this opinion. Consistent with our
practice, see, e.g., United States v. Marcus, 560 U. S. ___,
___ (2010) (slip op., at 8), we leave it to the Court of Ap
peals to consider the effect of Tapia’s failure to object to
the sentence when imposed. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
52(b); United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731 (1993).
It is so ordered.
