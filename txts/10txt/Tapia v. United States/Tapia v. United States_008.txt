Opinion of the Court

Congress accordingly enacted the Sentencing Reform
Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987 (SRA or Act), to overhaul fed

Sentencing Guidelines, promulgated by a new Sentencing
Commission, would provide courts with “a range of deter

to govern their consideration and imposition of sentences.
Under the SRA, a judge sentencing a federal offender
must impose at least one of the following sanctions: im
prisonment (often followed by supervised release), proba

requires the judge to consider specified factors, including:

“(B) to afford adequate deterrence to crimi

“(C) to protect the public from further
crimes of the defendant; and
“(D) to provide the defendant with needed
educational or vocational training, medical
care, or other correctional treatment in the
most effective manner.”

sentencing generally, and a court must fashion a sentence
“to achieve the[se] purposes . . . to the extent that they are
applicable” in a given case. §3551(a).
