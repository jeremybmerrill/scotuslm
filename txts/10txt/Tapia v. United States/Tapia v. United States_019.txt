ALEJANDRA TAPIA, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[June 16, 2011]

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins,
concurring.
I agree with the Court’s conclusion that 18 U. S. C.
§3582(a) “precludes federal courts from imposing or length
ening a prison term in order to promote a criminal de

proscription in this case.
At the sentencing hearing, the District Judge carefully
reviewed the sentencing factors set forth in §3553(a).
First, he considered “[t]he nature and circumstances of the
offense” committed by petitioner Alejandra Tapia—in this
case, alien smuggling. App. 25–26; see §3553(a)(1). He
emphasized that Tapia’s criminal conduct “created a sub
stantial risk of death or serious bodily injury” to the
smuggled aliens. App. 26; see also id., at 20 (noting that
the aliens were secreted in the vehicle’s gas tank com
partment). Second, he reviewed Tapia’s “history and
characteristics,” §3553(a)(1), including her history of being
abused and her associations “with the wrong people,” id.,
at 26. He noted his particular concern about Tapia’s
criminal conduct while released on bail, when she failed to
appear and was found in an apartment with meth
amphetamine, a sawed-off shotgun, and stolen mail.
Id., at 25–26. Third, he noted that the offense was
“serious,” warranting a “sufficient” sentence. Id., at 26; see
