SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

2009) (providing that, to participate in the RDAP, an
inmate must ordinarily have at least 24 months remaining
on her sentence). Even the 36-month mandatory mini
mum would have qualified Tapia for participation in the
RDAP. I thus find it questionable that the judge length
ened her term of imprisonment beyond that necessary for
deterrence in the belief that a 51-month sentence was
necessary for rehabilitation. Cf. S. Rep. No. 98–225,
p. 176 (1983) (“A term imposed for another purpose of
sentencing may . . . have a rehabilitative focus if rehabil
itation in such a case is an appropriate secondary purpose
of the sentence”).
Although I am skeptical that the thoughtful District
Judge imposed or lengthened Tapia’s sentence to promote
rehabilitation, I acknowledge that his comments at sen
tencing were not perfectly clear. Given that Ninth Circuit
precedent incorrectly permitted sentencing courts to con
sider rehabilitation in setting the length of a sentence, see
ante, at 2, and that the judge stated that the sentence
needed to be “long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug
Program,” App. 27, I cannot be certain that he did not
lengthen Tapia’s sentence to promote rehabilitation in
violation of §3582(a). I therefore agree with the Court’s
disposition of this case and join the Court’s opinion in full.
