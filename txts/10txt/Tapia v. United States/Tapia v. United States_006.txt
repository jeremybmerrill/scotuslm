Opinion of the Court

permits a sentencing court to impose or lengthen a prison
term in order to foster a defendant’s rehabilitation. 562
U. S. ___ (2010). That question has divided the Courts of
Appeals.1 Because the United States agrees with Tapia’s
interpretation of the statute, we appointed an amicus
curiae to defend the judgment below.2 We now reverse.

We begin with statutory background—how the relevant
sentencing provisions came about and what they say.
Aficionados of our sentencing decisions will recognize
much of the story line.
“For almost a century, the Federal Government em
ployed in criminal cases a system of indeterminate sen
tencing.” Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363
(1989). Within “customarily wide” outer boundaries set by
Congress, trial judges exercised “almost unfettered discre
tion” to select prison sentences for federal offenders. Id.,
at 364. In the usual case, a judge also could reject prison
time altogether, by imposing a “suspended” sentence. If
the judge decided to impose a prison term, discretionary
authority shifted to parole officials: Once the defendant
had spent a third of his term behind bars, they could order
his release. See K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging:
Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 18–20 (1998).
This system was premised on a faith in rehabilitation.

1 Three

Circuits have held that §3582(a) allows a court to lengthen,
although not to impose, a prison term based on the need for rehabilita
tion. See United States v. Duran, 37 F. 3d 557 (CA9 1994); United
States v. Hawk Wing, 433 F. 3d 622 (CA8 2006); United States v.
Jimenez, 605 F. 3d 415 (CA6 2010). Two Courts of Appeals have ruled
that §3582(a) bars a court from either imposing or increasing a period
of confinement for rehabilitative reasons. See United States v. Man
zella, 475 F. 3d 152 (CA3 2007); In re Sealed Case, 573 F. 3d 844
(CADC 2009).
2 We appointed Stephanos Bibas to brief and argue the case, 562 U. S.
___ (2011), and he has ably discharged his responsibilities.
