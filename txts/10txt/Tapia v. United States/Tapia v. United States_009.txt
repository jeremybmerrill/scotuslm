TAPIA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

the Act’s main sentencing options—imprisonment, super
vised release, probation, and fines. See §3582(a); §3583;
§3562(a); §3572(a). These provisions make clear that a
particular purpose may apply differently, or even not at
all, depending on the kind of sentence under considera
tion. For example, a court may not take account of retri
bution (the first purpose listed in §3553(a)(2)) when impos
ing a term of supervised release. See §3583(c).
Section 3582(a), the provision at issue here, specifies the
“factors to be considered” when a court orders imprison
ment. That section provides:
“The court, in determining whether to impose a term
of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is
to be imposed, in determining the length of the term,
shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a)
to the extent that they are applicable, recognizing
that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of
promoting correction and rehabilitation.”
A similar provision addresses the Sentencing Commission
in its capacity as author of the Sentencing Guidelines.
The SRA instructs the Commission to:
“insure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriate
ness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment
for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or pro
viding the defendant with needed educational or voca
tional training, medical care, or other correctional
treatment.” 28 U. S. C. §994(k).
With this statutory background established, we turn to
the matter of interpretation.
