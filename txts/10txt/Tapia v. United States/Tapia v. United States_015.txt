TAPIA v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

that courts consider offenders’ rehabilitative needs when
imposing prison sentences.
Finally, for those who consider legislative history useful,
the key Senate Report concerning the SRA provides one
last piece of corroborating evidence. According to that
Report, decades of experience with indeterminate sentenc
ing, resulting in the release of many inmates after they
completed correctional programs, had left Congress skep
tical that “rehabilitation can be induced reliably in a
prison setting.” S. Rep., at 38. Although some critics
argued that “rehabilitation should be eliminated com
pletely as a purpose of sentencing,” Congress declined to
adopt that categorical position. Id., at 76. Instead, the
Report explains, Congress barred courts from considering
rehabilitation in imposing prison terms, ibid., and n. 165,
but not in ordering other kinds of sentences, ibid., and
n. 164. “[T]he purpose of rehabilitation,” the Report
stated, “is still important in determining whether a sanc
tion other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate in a
particular case.” See id., at 76–77 (emphasis added).
And so this is a case in which text, context, and history
point to the same bottom line: Section 3582(a) precludes
sentencing courts from imposing or lengthening a prison
term to promote an offender’s rehabilitation.

With all these sources of statutory meaning stacked
against him, amicus understandably tries to put the SRA’s
view of rehabilitation in a wholly different frame. Amicus
begins by conceding that Congress, in enacting the SRA,
rejected the old “[r]ehabilitation [m]odel.” Amicus Brief 1.
But according to amicus, that model had a very limited
focus: It was the belief that “isolation and prison routine”
could alone produce “penitence and spiritual renewal.”
Id., at 1, 11. What the rehabilitation model did not in
clude—and the SRA therefore did not reject—was prison
