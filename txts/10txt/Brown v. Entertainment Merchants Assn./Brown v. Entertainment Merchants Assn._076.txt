BREYER, J., dissenting

State cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most vio­
lent interactive video games. But what sense does it make
to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an
image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13­
year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively,
but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures
and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would
permit the government to protect children by restricting sales of that extremely violent video game only when
the woman—bound, gagged, tortured, and killed—is also
topless?
This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment.
It disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence,
where interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar
justification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to
children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is
more than adequate to support such a view. That is why I
believe that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori.
And it is why I believe California’s law is constitutional on
its face.
This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is
about education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in
securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can
raise future generations committed cooperatively to mak­
ing our system of government work. Education, however,
is about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by
making choices for themselves. Other times, choices are
made for children—by their parents, by their teachers,
and by the people acting democratically through their
governments. In my view, the First Amendment does not
disable government from helping parents make such a
choice here—a choice not to have their children buy ex­
tremely violent, interactive video games, which they more
than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those
children.
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
