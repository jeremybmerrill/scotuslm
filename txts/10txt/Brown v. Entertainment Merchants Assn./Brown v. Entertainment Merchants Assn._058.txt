ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 27, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.
California imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon any
person who distributes a violent video game in California
without labeling it “18,” or who sells or rents a labeled
violent video game to a person under the age of 18. Representatives of the video game and software industries,
claiming that the statute violates the First Amendment on
its face, seek an injunction against its enforcement. Ap­
plying traditional First Amendment analysis, I would
uphold the statute as constitutional on its face and would
consequently reject the industries’ facial challenge.

A

California’s statute defines a violent video game as: A
game in which a player “kill[s], maim[s], dismember[s], or
sexually assault[s] an image of a human being,”
and
“[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a
whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or
morbid interest of minors,”
and
“[the game] is patently offensive to prevailing standards
in the community as to what is suitable for minors,”
