ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

of the State. Ibid. (quoting Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U. S.
157, 174 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment)).
In this case, California has not provided any evidence
that the California Legislature intended the law to be
limited in this way, or cited any decisions from its courts
that would support an “oldest minors” construction.5
For these reasons, I conclude that the California violent
video game law fails to provide the fair notice that the
Constitution requires. And I would go no further. I would
not express any view on whether a properly drawn statute
would or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.
We should address that question only if and when it is
necessary to do so.

Having outlined how I would decide this case, I will now
briefly elaborate on my reasons for questioning the wis
dom of the Court’s approach. Some of these reasons are
touched upon by the dissents, and while I am not prepared
at this time to go as far as either JUSTICE THOMAS or
JUSTICE BREYER, they raise valid concerns.
A
The Court is wrong in saying that the holding in United
States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), “controls this case.”
Ante, at 4. First, the statute in Stevens differed sharply
from the statute at issue here. Stevens struck down a law
that broadly prohibited any person from creating, selling,
or possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial
gain. The California law involved here, by contrast, is
——————
5 At oral argument, California also proposed that the term “minors”
could be interpreted as referring to the “typical age group of minors”
who play video games. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But nothing in the law’s
text supports such a limitation. Nor has California cited any decisions
indicating that its courts would restrict the law in this way. And there
is nothing in the record indicating what this age group might be.
