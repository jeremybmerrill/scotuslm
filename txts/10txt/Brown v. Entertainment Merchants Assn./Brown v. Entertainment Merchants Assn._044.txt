THOMAS, J., dissenting

4 Papers of John Adams 210 (R. Taylor ed. 1979); see also
Vol. 1 1787: Drafting the Constitution, p. 229 (W. Benton
ed. 1986) (quoting Gouvernor Morris in James Madison’s
notes from the Constitutional Convention explaining that
children do not vote because they “want prudence” and
“have no will of their own”). Children’s “utter incapacity”
rendered them “almost wholly at the mercy of their Par
ents or Instructors for a set of habits to regulate their
whole conduct through life.” J. Burgh, Thoughts on Edu
cation 7 (1749) (hereinafter Burgh).
This conception of childhood led to great concern about
influences on children. “Youth are ever learning to do
what they see others around them doing, and these imita
tions grow into habits.” Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also
B. Rush, A Plan for the Establishment of Public Schools
(1786) (hereinafter Rush), in Rudolph 16 (“The vices of
young people are generally learned from each other”);
Webster, in Rudolph 58 (“[C]hildren, artless and unsus
pecting, resign their hearts to any person whose manners
are agreeable and whose conduct is respectable”). Books
therefore advised parents “not to put children in the way
of those whom you dare not trust.” L. Child, The Mother’s
Book 149 (1831) (hereinafter Child); see also S. Coontz,
The Social Origins of Private Life 149–150 (1988) (noting
that it was “considered dangerous to leave children to the
supervision of servants or apprentices”).
As a result, it was widely accepted that children needed
close monitoring and carefully planned development. See
B. Wishy, The Child and the Republic 24–25, 32 (1968)
(hereinafter Wishy); Grossberg 8. Managing the young
mind was considered “infinitely important.” Doggett, in
Rudolph 151; see also A. MacLeod, A Moral Tale 72–73
(1975) (hereinafter MacLeod). In an essay on the educa
tion of youth in America, Noah Webster described the
human mind as “a rich field, which, without constant care,
will ever be covered with a luxuriant growth of weeds.”
