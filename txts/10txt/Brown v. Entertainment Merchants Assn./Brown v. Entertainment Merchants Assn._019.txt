California’s effort to regulate violent video games is the
latest episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor
violent entertainment for minors. While we have pointed
out above that some of the evidence brought forward to
support the harmfulness of video games is unpersuasive,
we do not mean to demean or disparage the concerns that
underlie the attempt to regulate them—concerns that may
and doubtless do prompt a good deal of parental oversight.
We have no business passing judgment on the view of the
California Legislature that violent video games (or, for
that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the young
or harm their moral development. Our task is only to say
whether or not such works constitute a “well-defined and
narrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the prevention and
punishment of which have never been thought to raise any
Constitutional problem,” Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 571–
572 (the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the
regulation of such works is justified by that high degree of
necessity we have described as a compelling state interest
(it is not). Even where the protection of children is the
object, the constitutional limits on governmental action
apply.
California’s legislation straddles the fence between (1)
addressing a serious social problem and (2) helping con
cerned parents control their children. Both ends are
legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights
they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously
underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive. See Church of
Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 546
(1993). As a means of protecting children from portrayals
of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not
only because it excludes portrayals other than video
games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular
