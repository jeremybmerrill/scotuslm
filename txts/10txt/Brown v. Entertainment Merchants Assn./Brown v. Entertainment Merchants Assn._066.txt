BREYER, J., dissenting

Like the majority, I believe that the California law must
be “narrowly tailored” to further a “compelling interest,”
without there being a “less restrictive” alternative that
would be “at least as effective.” Reno v. American Civil
Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 874, 875, 879 (1997). I
would not apply this strict standard “mechanically.”
United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529
U. S. 803, 841 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist,
C. J., and O’Connor and SCALIA, JJ., dissenting). Rather,
in applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the
statute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the
potentially-justifying “compelling interests,” the degree to
which the statute furthers that interest, the nature and
effectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this
evaluation, whether, overall, “the statute works speech­
related harm . . . out of proportion to the benefits that the
statute seeks to provide.” Ibid. See also Burson v. Free
man, 504 U. S. 191, 210 (1992) (plurality opinion) (apply­
ing strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a
“significant impingement” on speech).
First Amendment standards applied in this way are
difficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying “strict
scrutiny” the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that,
for example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolu­
tion to a group on the State Department’s list of terrorist
organizations, Holder, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22–34);
but cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 1 ) (BREYER, J., dissenting),
and limit speech near polling places, Burson, supra, at
210–211 (plurality opinion). And applying less clearly
defined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed
States to require disclosure of petition signers, Doe v.
Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and to impose campaign con­
tribution limits that were “ ‘closely drawn’ to match a
‘sufficiently important interest,’ ” Nixon v. Shrink Missouri
Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 387–388 (2000).
Moreover, although the Court did not specify the “level
