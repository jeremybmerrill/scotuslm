THOMAS, J., dissenting

Youth’s Companion) (“Let [children’s] minds be formed,
their hearts prepared, and their characters moulded for
the scenes and the duties of a brighter day”). In short,
“[h]ome and family bore the major responsibility for the
moral training of children and thus, by implication, for the
moral health of the nation.” MacLeod 29; see also Intro
duction, in Marten 6; Reinier, p. xi; Smith, Autonomy and
Affection: Parents and Children in Eighteenth-Century
Chesapeake Families, in Growing up in America 54
(N. Hiner & J. Hawes eds. 1985).
This conception of parental rights and duties was exem
plified by Thomas Jefferson’s approach to raising children.
He wrote letters to his daughters constantly and often
gave specific instructions about what the children should

1783), in id., at 44. He took the same approach with his
nephew, Peter Carr, after Carr’s father died. See Letter
(Aug. 19, 1785), in 8 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 405–
408 (J. Boyd ed. 1953) (detailing a course of reading and
exercise, and asking for monthly progress reports describ

Jefferson’s rigorous management of his charges was not

stressing continued subjection to the parental will.” Nor
