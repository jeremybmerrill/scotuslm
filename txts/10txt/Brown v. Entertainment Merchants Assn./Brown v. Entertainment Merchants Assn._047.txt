BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
THOMAS, J., dissenting

ton 96. Two parenting books published in the 1830’s gave
prototypical advice. In The Mother’s Book, Lydia Child
advised that “[t]he first and most important step in man
agement is, that whatever a mother says, always must be
done.” Child 26. John Abbott, the author of The Mother
at Home, likewise advised that “[o]bedience is absolutely
essential to proper family government.” Abbott 18. Echo
ing Locke, Abbott warned that parents who indulged a
child’s “foolish and unreasonable wishes” would doom that
child to be indulgent in adulthood. Id., at 16.
The concept of total parental control over children’s lives
extended into the schools. “The government both of fami
lies and schools should be absolute,” declared Noah Web
ster. Rudolph 57–58. Dr. Benjamin Rush concurred: “In
the education of youth, let the authority of our masters be
as absolute as possible.” Id., at 16. Through the doctrine
of in loco parentis, teachers assumed the “ ‘sacred dut[y] of
parents . . . to train up and qualify their children’ ” and
exercised the same authority “ ‘to command obedience, to
control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform
bad habits.’ ” Morse v. Frederick, 551 U. S. 393, 413–414
(2007) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (quoting State v. Pender
grass, 19 N. C. 365, 365–366 (1837)); see also Wishy 73.
Thus, the quality of teachers and schools had to “be
watched with the most scrupulous attention.” Webster, in
Rudolph 64.
For their part, children were expected to be dutiful and
obedient. Mintz & Kellogg 53; Wishy 31; cf. J. Kett, Rites
of Passage 45 (1977). Schoolbooks instructed children to
do so and frequently featured vignettes illustrating the
consequences of disobedience. See Adams, “Pictures of the
Vicious ultimately overcome by misery and shame”: The
Cultural Work of Early National Schoolbooks (hereinafter
Adams), in Marten 156. One oft-related example was the
hangings of 19 alleged witches in 1692, which, the school
books noted, likely began with false complaints by two
