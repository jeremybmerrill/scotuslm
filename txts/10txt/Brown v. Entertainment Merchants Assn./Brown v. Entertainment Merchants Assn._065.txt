BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
BREYER, J., dissenting

throughout the ages.” Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,
535 U. S. 234, 246 (2002). For every Homer, there is a
Titian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the
teenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm’s
Fairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story
of Lady Godiva.
Thus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related dif­
ferences between California’s law and the New York law
upheld in Ginsberg. And if there remain any vagueness
problems, the state courts can cure them through inter­
pretation. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,
216 (1975) (“[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially
invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing
construction by the state courts”). Cf. Ginsberg, supra, at
644 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals
would read a knowledge requirement into the statute);
Berry v. Santa Barbara, 40 Cal. App. 4th 1075, 1088–
1089, 47 Cal. Rptr. 2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowl­
edge requirement into a statute). Consequently, for pur­
poses of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute
unconstitutionally vague.

Video games combine physical action with expression.
Were physical activity to predominate in a game, govern­
ment could appropriately intervene, say by requiring
parents to accompany children when playing a game in­
volving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of
toys presenting physical dangers to children. See gener­
ally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008,
122 Stat. 3016 (“Title I—Children’s Product Safety”). But
because video games also embody important expressive
and artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First
Amendment significantly limits the State’s power to regu­
late. And I would determine whether the State has ex­
ceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.
