BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
BREYER, J., dissenting

and
“the game, as a whole, . . . lack[s] serious literary, ar­
tistic, political, or scientific value for minors.” Cal.
Civ. Code Ann. §1746(d)(1) (West 2009).
The statute in effect forbids the sale of such a game to
minors unless they are accompanied by a parent; it re­
quires the makers of the game to affix a label identifying
it as a game suitable only for those aged 18 and over; it
exempts retailers from liability unless such a label is
properly affixed to the game; and it imposes a civil fine of
up to $1,000 upon a violator. See §§1746.1–1746.3.
B
A facial challenge to this statute based on the First
Amendment can succeed only if “a substantial number of
its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to
the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” United States v.
Stevens, 559 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 10) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Moreover, it is more difficult to
mount a facial First Amendment attack on a statute that
seeks to regulate activity that involves action as well as
speech. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 614–
615 (1973). Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within
which I believe the State can legitimately apply its stat­
ute, namely sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age
cutoff used by the industry’s own ratings system), of
highly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable
game maker would know meet the Act’s criteria. That
area lies at the heart of the statute. I shall assume that
the number of instances in which the State will enforce
the statute within that area is comparatively large, and
that the number outside that area (for example, sales to
17-year-olds) is comparatively small. And the activity the
statute regulates combines speech with action (a virtual
form of target practice).
