BREYER, J., dissenting

The interest that California advances in support of the
statute is compelling. As this Court has previously de­
scribed that interest, it consists of both (1) the “basic”
parental claim “to authority in their own household to
direct the rearing of their children,” which makes it proper
to enact “laws designed to aid discharge of [parental]
responsibility,” and (2) the State’s “independent interest in
the well-being of its youth.” Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 639–
640. Cf. id., at 639, n. 7 (“ ‘[O]ne can well distinguish laws

school-age children of working parents are routinely
home alone. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau,

if anything, become more important to supplement par­
ents’ authority to guide their children’s development.
As to the State’s independent interest, we have pointed
out that juveniles are more likely to show a “ ‘lack of ma­
