SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus

BROWN, GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, ET AL. v.
ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 08–1448. Argued November 2, 2010—Decided June 27, 2011
Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries,
filed a preenforcement challenge to a California law that restricts the
sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The Federal District
Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and
permanently enjoined its enforcement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held: The Act does not comport with the First Amendment. Pp. 2–18.
(a) Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like pro
tected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through fa

“the basic principles of freedom of speech . . . do not vary” with a new
and different communication medium. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wil

lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas,
subject matter, or content, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Un
ion, 535 U. S. 564, 573—is subject to a few limited exceptions for his
torically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fight
ing words. But a legislature cannot create new categories of
unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular
category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the
test. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike the
New York law upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, Cali
fornia’s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of
unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is
not uncritically applied to children. Instead, the State wishes to cre
ate a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permis
sible only for speech directed at children. That is unprecedented and
