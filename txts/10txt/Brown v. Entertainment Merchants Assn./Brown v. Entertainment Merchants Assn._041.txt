BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Romances, . . . fabulous Histories of Giants, the bombast Achievements of Knight Errantry, and the like.” The
History of Genesis, pp. vi–vii (3d ed. corrected 1708).
This conception of parental authority was reflected in
laws at that time. In the Massachusetts Colony, for
example, it was unlawful for tavern keepers (or anyone
else) to entertain children without their parents’ consent.

County, Massachusetts, p. 180 (1912); 4 id., at 237, 275
(1914); 5 id., at 143 (1916); see also Morgan 146. And a
“stubborn or rebellious son” of 16 years or more committed
a capital offense if he disobeyed “the voice of his Father, or
the voice of his Mother.” The Laws and Liberties of Mas
sachusetts 6 (1648) (reprint M. Farrand ed. 1929); see also
J. Kamensky, Governing the Tongue 102, n. 14 (1997)
(citing similar laws in the Connecticut, New Haven, Ply
mouth, and New Hampshire Colonies in the late 1600’s).

In the decades leading up to and following the Revolu
tion, attitudes towards children changed. See, e.g., J.
Reinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood,
1775–1850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier). Children
came to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank
slates requiring careful and deliberate development. But
the same overarching principles remained. Parents con
tinued to have both the right and duty to ensure the
proper development of their children. They exercised
significant authority over their children, including control
over the books that children read. And laws at the time
continued to reflect strong support for parental authority and the sense that children were not fit to govern
themselves.
