BREYER, J., dissenting

C
In determining whether the statute is unconstitutional,
I would apply both this Court’s “vagueness” precedents and
a strict form of First Amendment scrutiny. In doing so,
the special First Amendment category I find relevant is
not (as the Court claims) the category of “depictions of
violence,” ante, at 8, but rather the category of “protection
of children.” This Court has held that the “power of the
state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the
scope of its authority over adults.” Prince v. Massachu
setts, 321 U. S. 158, 170 (1944). And the “ ‘regulatio[n] of
communication addressed to [children] need not conform
to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the
same way as those applicable to adults.’ ” Ginsberg v. New
York, 390 U. S. 629, 638, n. 6 (1968) (quoting Emerson,
Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, 72
Yale L. J. 877, 939 (1963)).
The majority’s claim that the California statute, if up­
held, would create a “new categor[y] of unprotected
speech,” ante, at 3, 6, is overstated. No one here argues
that depictions of violence, even extreme violence, auto
matically fall outside the First Amendment’s protective
scope as, for example, do obscenity and depictions of child
pornography. We properly speak of categories of expres­
sion that lack protection when, like “child pornography,”
the category is broad, when it applies automatically, and
when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults,
from obtaining access to the material within it. But
where, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower
judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of
“fire” in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terror­
ist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations),
we do not normally describe the result as creating a “new
category of unprotected speech.” See Schenck v. United
States, 249 U. S. 47, 52 (1919); Holder v. Humanitarian
Law Project, 561 U. S. __ (2010).
