Opinion of the Court

literature is interactive. “[T]he better it is, the more
interactive. Literature when it is successful draws the
reader into the story, makes him identify with the charac
ters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to
experience their joys and sufferings as the reader’s own.”
American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick, 244
F. 3d 572, 577 (CA7 2001) (striking down a similar restric
tion on violent video games).
JUSTICE ALITO has done considerable independent re
search to identify, see post, at 14–15, nn. 13–18, video
games in which “the violence is astounding,” post, at 14.
“Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set
on fire, and chopped into little pieces. . . . Blood gushes,
splatters, and pools.” Ibid. JUSTICE ALITO recounts all
these disgusting video games in order to disgust us—but
disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression. And
the same is true of JUSTICE ALITO’s description, post, at
14–15, of those video games he has discovered that have a
racial or ethnic motive for their violence—“ ‘ethnic clean
sing’ [of] . . . African Americans, Latinos, or Jews.” To
what end does he relate this? Does it somehow increase
the “aggressiveness” that California wishes to suppress?
Who knows? But it does arouse the reader’s ire, and the
reader’s desire to put an end to this horrible message.
Thus, ironically, JUSTICE ALITO’s argument highlights the
precise danger posed by the California Act: that the ideas
expressed by speech—whether it be violence, or gore, or
racism—and not its objective effects, may be the real
reason for governmental proscription.
III
Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of
protected speech, it is invalid unless California can dem
onstrate that it passes strict scrutiny—that is, unless it is
justified by a compelling government interest and is nar
rowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V., 505 U. S., at
