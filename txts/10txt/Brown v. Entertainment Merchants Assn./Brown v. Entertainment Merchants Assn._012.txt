dramas were next, and then came comic books. Brief for
Cato Institute, at 10–11. Many in the late 1940’s and
early 1950’s blamed comic books for fostering a “preoccu
pation with violence and horror” among the young, leading
to a rising juvenile crime rate. See Note, Regulation of
Comic Books, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 489, 490 (1955). But efforts

comics, which he described as “particularly injurious to the ethical
development of children.” Id., at 86. Wertham’s crusade did convince
the New York Legislature to pass a ban on the sale of certain comic
books to minors, but it was vetoed by Governor Thomas Dewey on the
ground that it was unconstitutional given our opinion in Winters,
supra. See People v. Bookcase, Inc., 14 N. Y. 2d 409, 412–413, 201 N. E.
2d 14, 15–16 (1964).
