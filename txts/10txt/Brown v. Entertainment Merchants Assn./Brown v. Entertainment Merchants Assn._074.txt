BREYER, J., dissenting

an elected legislature’s conclusion that the video games in
question are particularly likely to harm children. This
Court has always thought it owed an elected legislature
some degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of
this kind, particularly when they involve technical mat­
ters that are beyond our competence, and even in First
Amendment cases. See Holder, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 28–29) (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the
Government’s national security judgments); Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180, 195–196
(1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to
the Government’s technological judgments). The majority,
in reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity
of the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference
at all. Compare ante, at 12–13 (stating that the studies do
not provide evidence that violent video games “cause”
harm (emphasis deleted)), with supra, at 12–13 (citing
longitudinal studies finding causation).

I can find no “less restrictive” alternative to California’s
law that would be “at least as effective.” See Reno, 521
U. S., at 874. The majority points to a voluntary alterna­
tive: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from
buying extremely violent games by labeling those games
with an “M” (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict
their sales to those 17 and older. See ante, at 15–16. But
this voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps.
When California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Com­
mission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unac­
companied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated
video games. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to
Children 27 (2004), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2004/

the FTC’s most recent update to Congress, 20% of those
