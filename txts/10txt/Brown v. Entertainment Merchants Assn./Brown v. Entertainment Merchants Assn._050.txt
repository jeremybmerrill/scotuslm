The law at the time reflected the founding generation’s
understanding of parent-child relations. According to Sir
William Blackstone, parents were responsible for main
taining, protecting, and education their children, and
therefore had “power” over their children. 1 Commentar
ies on the Laws of England 434, 440 (1765); cf. Washington
v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 712 (1997) (Blackstone’s
Commentaries was “a primary legal authority for 18thand 19th-century American lawyers”). Chancellor James
Kent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189–
*207. The law entitled parents to “the custody of their
[children],” “the value of th[e] [children’s] labor and ser

may be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust.”
Id., at *193, *203. Children, in turn, were charged with
“obedience and assistance during their own minority, and
gratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives.” Id.,

Thus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents

Massachusetts explained, “There is no question but that a
father, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and
for whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common
law, assign those services to others, for a consideration to
enure to himself.” Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145, 147; see

parents are under obligations to support their children,
