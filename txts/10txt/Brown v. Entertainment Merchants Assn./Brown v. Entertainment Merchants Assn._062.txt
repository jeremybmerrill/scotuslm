BREYER, J., dissenting

different, earlier case, Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U. S.
463 (1966)). The five-Justice majority, in an opinion writ­
ten by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was sufficiently clear. 390 U. S., at 643–645. No Member of the
Court voiced any vagueness objection. See id., at 648–650
(Stewart, J., concurring in result); id., at 650–671 (Doug­
las, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); id., at 671–675
(Fortas, J., dissenting).
Comparing the language of California’s statute (set
forth supra, at 1–2) with the language of New York’s
statute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find
any vagueness-related difference. Why are the words
“kill,” “maim,” and “dismember” any more difficult to
understand than the word “nudity?” JUSTICE ALITO ob­
jects that these words do “not perform the narrowing
function” that this Court has required in adult obscenity
cases, where statutes can only cover “ ‘hard core’ ” depic­
tions. Ante, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment). But
the relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but
to Ginsberg, which dealt with “nudity,” a category no more
“narrow” than killing and maiming. And in any event,
narrowness and vagueness do not necessarily have any­
thing to do with one another. All that is required for
vagueness purposes is that the terms “kill,” “maim,” and
“dismember” give fair notice as to what they cover, which
they do.
The remainder of California’s definition copies, almost
word for word, the language this Court used in Miller v.
California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), in permitting a total ban
on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with
criminal penalties). The California law’s reliance on
“community standards” adheres to Miller, and in Fort
Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, 57–58 (1989),
this Court specifically upheld the use of Miller’s language
against charges of vagueness. California only departed
from the Miller formulation in two significant respects: It
