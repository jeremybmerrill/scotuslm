BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Court has held that children are entitled to the protection
of the First Amendment, see, e.g., Erznoznik v. Jackson
ville, 422 U. S. 205, 212–213 (1975), and the government
may not unilaterally dictate what children can say or
hear, see id., at 213–214; Tinker v. Des Moines Independ
ent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 511 (1969).
But this Court has never held, until today, that “the free
dom of speech” includes a right to speak to minors (or a
right of minors to access speech) without going through
the minors’ parents. To the contrary, “[i]t is well settled
that a State or municipality can adopt more stringent
controls on communicative materials available to youths
than on those available to adults.” Erznoznik, supra, at
212; cf. post, at 3 (BREYER, J., dissenting).
The Court’s constitutional jurisprudence “historically
has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as
a unit with broad parental authority over minor children.”
Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602 (1979). Under that
case law, “legislature[s] [can] properly conclude that par
ents and others, teachers for example, who have . . . pri
mary responsibility for children’s well-being are entitled to
the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that re
sponsibility.” Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 639
(1968); see also Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 635 (1979)
(opinion of Powell, J.) (“[T]he State is entitled to adjust its
legal system to account for children’s vulnerability and
their needs for concern, . . . sympathy, and . . . paternal
attention” (internal quotation marks omitted)). This is
because “the tradition of parental authority is not incon
sistent with our tradition of individual liberty; rather, the
former is one of the basic presuppositions of the latter.”
Id., at 638; id., at 638–639 (“Legal restrictions on minors,
especially those supportive of the parental role, may be
important to the child’s chances for the full growth and
maturity that make eventual participation in a free soci
ety meaningful and rewarding”).
