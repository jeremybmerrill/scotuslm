BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
THOMAS, J., dissenting

I
When interpreting a constitutional provision, “the goal
is to discern the most likely public understanding of [that]
provision at the time it was adopted.” McDonald v. Chi
cago, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (THOMAS, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because
the Constitution is a written instrument, “its meaning
does not alter.” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514
U. S. 334, 359 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)
(internal quotation marks omitted). “That which it meant
when adopted, it means now.” Ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted).
As originally understood, the First Amendment’s protec
tion against laws “abridging the freedom of speech” did
not extend to all speech. “There are certain well-defined
and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and
punishment of which have never been thought to raise any
Constitutional problem.” Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U. S. 568, 571–572 (1942); see also United States v.
Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5–6). Laws
regulating such speech do not “abridg[e] the freedom of
speech” because such speech is understood to fall outside
“the freedom of speech.” See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coa
lition, 535 U. S. 234, 245–246 (2002).
In my view, the “practices and beliefs held by the Foun
ders” reveal another category of excluded speech: speech to
minor children bypassing their parents. McIntyre, supra,
at 360. The historical evidence shows that the founding
generation believed parents had absolute authority over
their minor children and expected parents to use that
authority to direct the proper development of their chil
dren. It would be absurd to suggest that such a society
understood “the freedom of speech” to include a right to
speak to minors (or a corresponding right of minors to
access speech) without going through the minors’ parents.
