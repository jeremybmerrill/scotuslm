Opinion of the Court

tion appears. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U. S.
495, 503 (1952).
The most basic of those principles is this: “[A]s a general
matter, . . . government has no power to restrict expres
sion because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or
its content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,
535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omit
ted). There are of course exceptions. “ ‘From 1791 to the
present,’ . . . the First Amendment has ‘permitted restric
tions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,’
and has never ‘include[d] a freedom to disregard these
traditional limitations.’ ” United States v. Stevens, 559
U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting R. A. V. v. St.
Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382–383 (1992)). These limited ar

476, 483 (1957), incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395
U. S. 444, 447–449 (1969) (per curiam), and fighting

572 (1942)—represent “well-defined and narrowly limited
classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which
have never been thought to raise any Constitutional prob

Last Term, in Stevens, we held that new categories of
unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a
legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to
be tolerated. Stevens concerned a federal statute purport
ing to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of cer
tain depictions of animal cruelty. See 18 U. S. C. §48
(amended 2010). The statute covered depictions “in which
a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tor
tured, wounded, or killed” if that harm to the animal was
illegal where the “the creation, sale, or possession t[ook]
place,” §48(c)(1). A saving clause largely borrowed from
our obscenity jurisprudence, see Miller v. California, 413
U. S. 15, 24 (1973), exempted depictions with “serious
