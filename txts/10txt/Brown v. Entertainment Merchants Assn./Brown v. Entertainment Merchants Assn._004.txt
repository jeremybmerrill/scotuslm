BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
Opinion of the Court

Respondents, representing the video-game and software
industries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act
in the United States District Court for the Northern Dis
trict of California. That court concluded that the Act
violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined
its enforcement. Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwar

Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger, 556 F. 3d 950 (CA9

through features distinctive to the medium (such as the
player’s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices
to confer First Amendment protection. Under our Consti

Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval
