BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

than we are to assess the implications of new technology.
The opinion of the Court exhibits none of this caution.
In the view of the Court, all those concerned about the
effects of violent video games—federal and state legisla
tors, educators, social scientists, and parents—are unduly
fearful, for violent video games really present no serious
problem. See ante, at 10–13, 15–16. Spending hour upon
hour controlling the actions of a character who guns down
scores of innocent victims is not different in “kind” from
reading a description of violence in a work of literature.
See ante, at 10–11.
The Court is sure of this; I am not. There are reasons to
suspect that the experience of playing violent video games
just might be very different from reading a book, listening
to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show.

Respondents in this case, representing the video-game
industry, ask us to strike down the California law on two
grounds: The broad ground adopted by the Court and the
narrower ground that the law’s definition of “violent video
game,” see Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §1746(d)(1)(A) (West 2009),
is impermissibly vague. See Brief for Respondents 23–61.
Because I agree with the latter argument, I see no need to
reach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by
the Court.1
A
Due process requires that laws give people of ordinary
intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited. Grayned v.
City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108 (1972). The lack of
such notice in a law that regulates expression “raises

is well established that a judgment may be affirmed on an alter
native ground that was properly raised but not addressed by the lower
court. Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima
Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 478, n. 20 (1979).
