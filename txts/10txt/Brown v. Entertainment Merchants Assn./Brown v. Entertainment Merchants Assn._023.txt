special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious
chilling effect on free speech.” Reno v. American Civil
Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 871–872 (1997). Vague
laws force potential speakers to “ ‘steer far wider of the
unlawful zone’ . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden
areas were clearly marked.” Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S.
360, 372 (1964) (quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513,
526 (1958)). While “perfect clarity and precise guidance
have never been required even of regulations that restrict

children. See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390 U. S.

Here, the California law does not define “violent video

game statute on the New York law that this Court upheld
in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968)—a law that
prohibited the sale of certain sexually related materials to
minors, see id., at 631–633. But the California Legisla
ture departed from the Ginsberg model in an important
respect, and the legislature overlooked important differ
ences between the materials falling within the scope of the
two statutes.
B
The law at issue in Ginsberg prohibited the sale to
minors of materials that were deemed “harmful to mi
nors,” and the law defined “harmful to minors” simply by
adding the words “for minors” to each element of the
