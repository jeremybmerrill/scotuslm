BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
THOMAS, J., dissenting

and that they are entitled to their earnings”). Similarly,
the Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted
that the right of parents to recover for the services of their
child, while a minor, “cannot be contested.” Gale v. Parrot,
1 N. H. 28, 29 (1817). And parents could bring tort suits
against those who knowingly enticed a minor away from
them. See, e.g., Kirkpatrick v. Lockhart, 2 Brev. 276 (S. C.
Constitutional Ct. 1809); Jones v. Tevis, 4 Litt. 25 (Ky.
App. 1823).
Relatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without
parental consent. Many of those who did so during the
Revolutionary War found, afterwards, that their fathers
were entitled to their military wages. See Cox, Boy Sol
diers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21–24. And
after the war, minors who enlisted without parental con
sent in violation of federal law could find themselves
returned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their
parents’ request. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 24
F. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); Commonwealth
v. Callan, 6 Binn. 255 (Pa. 1814) (per curiam).
Laws also set age limits restricting marriage without
parental consent. For example, from 1730 until at least
1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the
marriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at
Large of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell & H. Flanders eds.
1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of
Pennsylvania 82–83 (J. Dunlop 2d ed. 1849) (including the
1730 marriage law with no amendments); see also Perpet
ual Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 253
(1788), in The First Laws of the Commonwealth of Massa
chusetts (J. Cushing ed. 1981).
In general, “[p]ostRevolutionary marriage law assumed that below a certain
age, children could . . . no[t] intellectually understand its
significance.” Grossberg 105.
Indeed, the law imposed age limits on all manner of
activities that required judgment and reason. Children
