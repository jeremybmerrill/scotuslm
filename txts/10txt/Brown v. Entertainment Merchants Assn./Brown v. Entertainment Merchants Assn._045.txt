BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
THOMAS, J., dissenting

Rudolph 54. He advocated sheltering children from “every
low-bred, drunken, immoral character” and keeping their
minds “untainted till their reasoning faculties have ac
quired strength and the good principles which may be
planted in their minds have taken deep root.” Id., at 63;
see also Rush, in id., at 16 (“[T]he most useful citizens
have been formed from those youth who have never known
or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years
of age”); Burgh 7 (“[T]he souls of Youth are more immedi
ately committed to the care of Parents and Instructors
than even those of a People are to their Pastor”).
The Revolution only amplified these concerns. The Re
public would require virtuous citizens, which necessitated proper training from childhood. See Mintz 54, 71;
MacLeod 40; Saxton, French and American Childhoods, in
Children and Youth in a New Nation 69 (J. Marten ed.
2009) (hereinafter Marten); see also W. Cardell, Story of
Jack Halyard, pp. xv–xvi (30th ed. 1834) (hereinafter
Cardell) (“[T]he glory and efficacy of our institutions will
soon rest with those who are growing up to succede us”).
Children were “the pivot of the moral world,” and their
proper development was “a subject of as high interest, as
any to which the human mind ha[d] ever been called.” Id.,
at xvi.

Based on these views of childhood, the founding genera
tion understood parents to have a right and duty to govern
their children’s growth. Parents were expected to direct
the development and education of their children and en
sure that bad habits did not take root. See Calvert 58–59;
MacLeod 72; Mintz & Kellogg 23. They were responsible
for instilling “moral prohibitions, behavioral standards,
and a capacity for self-government that would prepare
a child for the outside world.” Mintz & Kellogg 58; see
also Youth’s Companion, Apr. 16, 1827, p. 1 (hereinafter
