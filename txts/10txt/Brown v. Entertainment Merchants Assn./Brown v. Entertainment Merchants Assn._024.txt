BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

definition of obscenity set out in what were then the
Court’s leading obscenity decisions, see Roth v. United
States, 354 U. S. 476 (1957), and Book Named “John Cle
land’s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure” v. Attorney Gen

Seeking to bring its violent video game law within the
protection of Ginsberg, the California Legislature began
with the obscenity test adopted in Miller v. California, 413
U. S. 15 (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests

fined by the applicable state law; and”
(3) “the work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” Id., at

Adapting these standards, the California law imposes
the following threshold limitation: “[T]he range of options
available to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming,
dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a hu

threshold test is subject to the law’s restrictions if it also
