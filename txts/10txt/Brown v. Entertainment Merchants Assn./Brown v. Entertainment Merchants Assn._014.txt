BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
Opinion of the Court

395. The State must specifically identify an “actual prob
lem” in need of solving, Playboy, 529 U. S., at 822–823,
and the curtailment of free speech must be actually neces
sary to the solution, see R. A. V., supra, at 395. That is a
demanding standard. “It is rare that a regulation restrict
ing speech because of its content will ever be permissible.”
Playboy, supra, at 818.
California cannot meet that standard. At the outset, it
acknowledges that it cannot show a direct causal link
between violent video games and harm to minors. Rather,
relying upon our decision in Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622 (1994), the State claims that it
need not produce such proof because the legislature can
make a predictive judgment that such a link exists, based
on competing psychological studies. But reliance on
Turner Broadcasting is misplaced. That decision applied
intermediate scrutiny to a content-neutral regulation. Id.,
at 661–662. California’s burden is much higher, and
because it bears the risk of uncertainty, see Playboy,
supra, at 816–817, ambiguous proof will not suffice.
The State’s evidence is not compelling. California relies
primarily on the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few
other research psychologists whose studies purport to
show a connection between exposure to violent video
games and harmful effects on children. These studies
have been rejected by every court to consider them,6 and
with good reason: They do not prove that violent video
