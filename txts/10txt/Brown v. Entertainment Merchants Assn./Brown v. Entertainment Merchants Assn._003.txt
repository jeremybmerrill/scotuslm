ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 27, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
We consider whether a California law imposing restric
tions on violent video games comports with the First
Amendment.
I
California Assembly Bill 1179 (2005), Cal. Civ. Code
Ann. §§1746–1746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale
or rental of “violent video games” to minors, and requires
their packaging to be labeled “18.” The Act covers games
“in which the range of options available to a player in
cludes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually as
saulting an image of a human being, if those acts are
depicted” in a manner that “[a] reasonable person, consid
ering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant
or morbid interest of minors,” that is “patently offensive to
prevailing standards in the community as to what is suit
able for minors,” and that “causes the game, as a whole, to
lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value
for minors.” §1746(d)(1)(A). Violation of the Act is pun
ishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. §1746.3.
