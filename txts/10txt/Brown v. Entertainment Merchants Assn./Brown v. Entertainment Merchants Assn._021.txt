ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 27, 2011]


JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,
concurring in the judgment.
The California statute that is before us in this case
represents a pioneering effort to address what the state
legislature and others regard as a potentially serious
social problem: the effect of exceptionally violent video
games on impressionable minors, who often spend count
less hours immersed in the alternative worlds that these
games create. Although the California statute is well
intentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision
that the Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with
the Court that this particular law cannot be sustained.
I disagree, however, with the approach taken in the
Court’s opinion. In considering the application of un
changing constitutional principles to new and rapidly
evolving technology, this Court should proceed with cau
tion. We should make every effort to understand the new
technology. We should take into account the possibility
that developing technology may have important societal
implications that will become apparent only with time.
We should not jump to the conclusion that new technology
is fundamentally the same as some older thing with which
we are familiar. And we should not hastily dismiss the
judgment of legislators, who may be in a better position
