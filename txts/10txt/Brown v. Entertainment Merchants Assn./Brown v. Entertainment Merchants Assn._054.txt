THOMAS, J., dissenting

McDonald, 561 U. S., at ___–___ (THOMAS, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 48–
52) (rejecting the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36
(1873), as inconsistent with the original public meaning
of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment).
This, however, is not such a case. Although much has
changed in this country since the Revolution, the notion
that parents have authority over their children and that
the law can support that authority persists today. For
example, at least some States make it a crime to lure or
entice a minor away from the minor’s parent. See, e.g.,
Cal. Penal Code Ann. §272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat.
§787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes
a minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial
consent. Cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 558 (Ap
pendix D to opinion of Court) (2005). Individuals less than
18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental
consent. 10 U. S. C. §505(a). And minors remain subject
to curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana
et al. as Amici Curiae 16, and cannot unilaterally consent
to most medical procedures, id., at 15.
Moreover, there are many things minors today cannot
do at all, whether they have parental consent or not.
State laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty.
See Roper, supra, at 581–585 (Appendixes B and C to
opinion of Court). In California (the State at issue here),
minors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal.
Veh. Code Ann. §§12515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase
tobacco, Cal. Penal Code Ann. §308(b) (West 2008), play
bingo for money, §326.5(e), or execute a will, Cal. Probate
Code Ann. §6220 (West 2009).
My understanding of “the freedom of speech” is also
consistent with this Court’s precedents. To be sure, the
