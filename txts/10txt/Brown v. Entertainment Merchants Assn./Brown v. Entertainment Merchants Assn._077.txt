BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.
BREYER, J., dissenting
Appendix A to the opinion of BREYER, J.

APPENDIXES
With the assistance of the Supreme Court Library, I
have compiled these two appendixes listing peer-reviewed
academic journal articles on the topic of psychological
harm resulting from playing violent video games. The
library conducted a search for relevant articles on the
following databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Academic
Search Premier, ArticleFirst (OCLC), and Dialog (files 1,
7, 34, 98, 121, 142, 144, 149). The following search terms
were used: “(video* or computer or arcade or online) and
(game*) and (attack* or fight* or aggress* or violen* or
hostil* or ang* or arous* or prosocial or help* or desens*
or empathy).” After eliminating irrelevant matches based
on title or abstract, I categorized these articles as either
supporting the hypothesis that violent video games are
harmful (listed in Appendix A), or not supporting/rejecting
the hypothesis that violent video games are harmful
(listed in Appendix B).
Many, but not all, of these articles were available to the
California Legislature or the parties in briefing this case.
I list them because they suggest that there is substantial
(though controverted) evidence supporting the expert
associations of public health professionals that have con­
cluded that violent video games can cause children psycho­
logical harm. See supra, at 15–16. And consequently,
these studies help to substantiate the validity of the origi­
nal judgment of the California Legislature, as well as that
judgment’s continuing validity.
