BREYER, J., dissenting

conclusions. (I list both sets of research in the appen­
dixes.) I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise
to say definitively who is right. But associations of public
health professionals who do possess that expertise have
reviewed many of these studies and found a significant
risk that violent video games, when compared with more
passive media, are particularly likely to cause children
harm.
Eleven years ago, for example, the American Academy
of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child & Adoles­
cent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association,
the American Medical Association, the American Academy
of Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Asso­
ciation released a joint statement, which said:
“[O]ver 1000 studies . . . point overwhelmingly to a
causal connection between media violence and aggres­
sive behavior in some children . . . [and, though less
research had been done at that time, preliminary
studies indicated that] the impact of violent interac­
tive entertainment (video games and other interactive
media) on young people . . . may be significantly more
severe than that wrought by television, movies, or mu­
sic.” Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment
Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online
at http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.
Five years later, after more research had been done, the
American Psychological Association adopted a resolution
that said:
“[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive
video game research suggests such exposure . . .
increases aggressive behavior, . . . increases aggres­
sive thoughts, . . . increases angry feelings, . . . de­
creases helpful behavior, and . . . increases physiological arousal.” Resolution on Violence in Video
Games and Interactive Media (2005), online at
