Locke’s and Rousseau’s writings fostered a new concep
tion of childhood. Children were increasingly viewed as
malleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an
important period of growth, development, and preparation
for adulthood. See Mintz & Kellogg 17, 21, 47; M. Gross

Smith, sister-in-law to John Adams, similarly wrote: “The
Infant Mind, I beleive[,] is a blank, that eassily receives

(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter
Norton); see also S. Doggett, A Discourse on Education

youth, . . . every power and capacity is pliable and suscep
