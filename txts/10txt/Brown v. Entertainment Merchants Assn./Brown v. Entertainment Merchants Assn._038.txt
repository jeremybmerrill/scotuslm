ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 27, 2011]


JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.
The Court’s decision today does not comport with the
original public understanding of the First Amendment.
The majority strikes down, as facially unconstitutional, a
state law that prohibits the direct sale or rental of certain
video games to minors because the law “abridg[es] the
freedom of speech.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. But I do not
think the First Amendment stretches that far. The prac
tices and beliefs of the founding generation establish that
“the freedom of speech,” as originally understood, does not
include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to
access speech) without going through the minors’ parents
or guardians. I would hold that the law at issue is not
facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and
reverse and remand for further proceedings.1

1 JUSTICE ALITO concludes that the law is too vague to satisfy due
process, but neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals ad
dressed that question. Ante, at 2–9 (opinion concurring in judgment).
As we have often said, this Court is “one of final review, ‘not of first
view.’ ” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
