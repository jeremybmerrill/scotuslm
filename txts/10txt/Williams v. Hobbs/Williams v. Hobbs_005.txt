SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

holding that it would, in any event, “exercise [its] discre
tion to review the district court’s non-compliance with
§2254(e)(2),” 576 F. 3d, at 860, the Court of Appeals seri
ously misapplied our precedent. The court assumed that
it possessed discretion to consider an objection to an evi
dentiary hearing that is asserted only after the hearing
has been conducted, the constitutional violation estab
lished, and habeas relief granted, relying on this Court’s
decision in Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006). In
that case, we held that “district courts are permitted, but
not obliged, to consider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a
state prisoner’s habeas petition.” Id., at 209. Even as
suming that same discretion applies in these circum
stances,* Day makes clear that the court must “ ‘determine
whether the interests of justice would be better served’ ” by
allowing the State’s unasserted defense to expire without
court intervention. Id., at 210 (quoting Granberry v.
Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 136 (1987)). In particular, and of
critical significance to this case, the court must evaluate
whether anything “in the record suggests that the State
‘strategically’ withheld the defense or chose to relinquish
it.” Day, 547 U. S., at 211. If so, the court “would not be
at liberty to disregard that choice.” Id., at 210, n. 11.
Thus, even assuming Day applied here, it required the
Court of Appeals to search the record for a suggestion of
strategic forfeiture. Yet, despite the record described
——————
* Although we have never decided whether the courts of appeals pos
sess discretion to consider after-the-fact objections of the kind here, we
have at least left open the possibility that a State might forfeit such an
objection if the State fails to raise it properly. See Bradshaw v. Richey,
546 U. S. 74, 79–80 (2005) (per curiam) (remanding for the Sixth
Circuit to address the argument that the State “failed to preserve its
objection to the [court’s] reliance on evidence not presented in state
court by failing to raise this argument properly”); Holland v. Jackson,
542 U. S. 649, 653, n. (2004) (per curiam) (rejecting the contention that
the State had failed to preserve its objection on the record present
there).
