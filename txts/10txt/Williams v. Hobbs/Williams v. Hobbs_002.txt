WILLIAMS v. HOBBS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

firmed the conviction and sentence on direct appeal.
Williams v. State, 338 Ark. 97, 991 S. W. 2d 565 (1999).
After the Arkansas courts denied his petition for collat
eral relief, Williams filed a federal habeas petition under
28 U. S. C. §2254. Williams alleged that he received inef
fective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washing
ton, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), due to his attorneys’ failure to
develop and present mitigating social history evidence to
the jury. As to Strickland’s performance prong, the Dis
trict Court held that the state-court decision denying
Williams’ ineffective-assistance claim was “based on an

exposure to violence in the childhood home and neighbor
hood; and a violent gang-rape while in prison as an ado
lescent. 2007 WL 1100417, *2 (Apr. 11, 2007). On the
basis of that testimony, the District Court found that
Williams had been prejudiced by counsel’s ineffective
assistance, granted habeas relief, and ordered the State to
afford Williams a new trial at the penalty phase or to
reduce his sentence to life without parole. Id., at *2–*3.
The Court of Appeals reversed, reinstating the sentence
of death by lethal injection. Williams v. Norris, 576 F. 3d
850 (CA8 2009). Concluding that Williams was not enti

entirely disregarding the evidence introduced at the hear
ing as a result, the court held that Williams had failed to
