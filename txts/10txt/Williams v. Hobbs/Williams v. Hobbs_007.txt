SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

policy against evidentiary hearings in federal habeas
promotes principles of comity and federalism. See Wil
liams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 436–437 (2000). But when
the State voluntarily participates in a federal evidentiary
hearing—without objection, with an apparent intent of
supplementing the record for its own purposes, and at a
significant cost and expenditure of judicial resources—
these interests are significantly diminished if not alto
gether absent. We have refused to adopt rules that “would
permit, and might even encourage, the State to seek a
favorable ruling on the merits in the district court while
holding [a] defense in reserve for use on appeal if neces
sary.” Granberry, 481 U. S., at 132. Because I believe the
opinion below does just that, at an unacceptable cost to the
interests of justice generally and in this particular case, I
would grant the petition for writ of certiorari and vacate
the judgment below.
