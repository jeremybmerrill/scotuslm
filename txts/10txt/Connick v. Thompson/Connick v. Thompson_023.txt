CONNICK v. THOMPSON
Opinion of the Court

narrow range of “single-incident” liability hypothesized in
Canton as a possible exception to the pattern of violations
necessary to prove deliberate indifference in §1983 actions
alleging failure to train. The District Court should have
granted Connick judgment as a matter of law on the fail
ure-to-train claim because Thompson did not prove a
pattern of similar violations that would “establish that the
‘policy of inaction’ [was] the functional equivalent of a
decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.”
Canton, supra, at 395 (opinion of O’Connor, J.).
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit is reversed.
It is so ordered.
