CONNICK v. THOMPSON
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

slim instruction, the jury learned, was notably inaccurate,
incomplete, and dated. Tr. 798–804, 911–918. But cf.
ante, at 13 (“Senior attorneys also circulated court deci
sions and instructional memoranda to keep the prose
cutors abreast of relevant legal developments.”). For
example, the manual did not acknowledge what Giglio v.
United States, 405 U. S. 150 (1972), made plain: Im

continues throughout the entirety of the trial. Failure to produce
Brady material has resulted in mistrials and reversals, as well as
extended court battles over jeopardy issues. In all cases, a review of
Brady issues, including apparently self-serving statements made by the
defendant, must be included in a pre-trial conference and each Assis
tant must be familiar with the law regarding exculpatory information
possessed by the State.” Record EX427.
16 During the relevant time period, there were many significant de
velopments in this Court’s Brady jurisprudence. Among the Brady
related decisions this Court handed down were United States v. Bagley,
473 U. S. 667, 676 (1985) (“This Court has rejected any . . . distinction
between impeachment evidence and exculpatory evidence [in the Brady
context].”); Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 559–560 (1977)
(“Brady is not implicated . . . where the only claim is that the State
should have revealed that it would present the eyewitness testimony of
a particular agent against the defendant at trial.”); and United States v.
Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 103, 104, 106–107 (1976) (Brady claim may arise
when “the undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution’s
case includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or
should have known, of the perjury,” when defense counsel makes “a
pretrial request for specific evidence” and the government fails to
accede to that request, and when defense counsel makes no request and
the government fails to disclose “obviously exculpatory” evidence).
These decisions were not referenced in the manual that compiled
circulated memoranda.
In the same period, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued dozens of
opinions discussing Brady, including State v. Sylvester, 388 So. 2d 1155,
1161 (1980) (impeachment evidence must be disclosed in response to a
specific request if it would create a “reasonable doubt that did not
otherwise exist”); State v. Brooks, 386 So. 2d 1348, 1351 (1980) (Brady
extends to any material information favorable to the accused); and
State v. Carney, 334 So. 2d 415, 418–419 (1976) (reversible error if
