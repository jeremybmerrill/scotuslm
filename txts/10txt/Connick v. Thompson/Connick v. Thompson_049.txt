CONNICK v. THOMPSON
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

what his obligations were under Brady,” id., at 448. But
cf. ante, at 4–5 (“[I]t was undisputed at trial that the
prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady re

sisted that he had discharged the prosecution’s duty to
disclose the blood evidence by mentioning, in a motion

robbery trial, Williams told one of the victims that the
results of the blood test made on the swatch had been
“inconclusive.” Id., at 962. And he testified in the §1983

I didn’t know what the blood type of Mr. Thompson was.”
Tr. 393. But see supra, at 6–7, n. 5 (District Court in
