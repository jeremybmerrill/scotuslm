CONNICK v. THOMPSON
Opinion of the Court

retried Thompson for Liuzza’s murder.2 The jury found
him not guilty.
B
Thompson then brought this action against the district
attorney’s office, Connick, Williams, and others, alleging
that their conduct caused him to be wrongfully convicted,
incarcerated for 18 years, and nearly executed. The only
claim that proceeded to trial was Thompson’s claim under
§1983 that the district attorney’s office had violated Brady
by failing to disclose the crime lab report in his armed
robbery trial. See Brady, 373 U. S. 83. Thompson alleged
liability under two theories: (1) the Brady violation was
caused by an unconstitutional policy of the district attor
ney’s office; and (2) the violation was caused by Connick’s
deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train the
prosecutors in his office in order to avoid such constitu
tional violations.
Before trial, Connick conceded that the failure to pro
duce the crime lab report constituted a Brady violation.3
See Record EX608, EX880. Accordingly, the District Court
instructed the jury that the “only issue” was whether the
nondisclosure was caused by either a policy, practice, or
custom of the district attorney’s office or a deliberately
indifferent failure to train the office’s prosecutors. Record

Although no prosecutor remembered any specific train

2 Thompson testified in his own defense at the second trial and pre
sented evidence suggesting that another man committed the murder.
That man, the government’s key witness at the first murder trial, had
died in the interval between the first and second trials.
3 Because Connick conceded that the failure to disclose the crime lab
report violated Brady, that question is not presented here, and we do
not address it.
