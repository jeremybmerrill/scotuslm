CONNICK v. THOMPSON
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Thompson failed to prove deliberate indifference.
Having weighed all the evidence, the jury in the §1983
case found for Thompson, concluding that the District
Attorney’s Office had been deliberately indifferent to
Thompson’s Brady rights and to the need for training and

the Fifth Circuit, that “ample evidence . . . adduced at

be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.”
Id., at 390. Thompson presented convincing evidence to
satisfy this standard.
A
Thompson’s §1983 suit proceeded to a jury trial on two
theories of liability: First, the Orleans Parish Office’s
official Brady policy was unconstitutional; and second,
Connick was deliberately indifferent to an obvious need to
train his prosecutors about their Brady obligations. Con
nick’s Brady policy directed prosecutors to “turn over what
was required by state and federal law, but no more.” Brief
for Petitioners 6–7. The jury thus understandably rejected
Thompson’s claim that the official policy itself was uncon
