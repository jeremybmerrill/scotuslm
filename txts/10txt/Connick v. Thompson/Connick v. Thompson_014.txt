Opinion of the Court

C
1
Instead of relying on a pattern of similar Brady viola
tions, Thompson relies on the “single-incident” liability
that this Court hypothesized in Canton. He contends that
the Brady violation in his case was the “obvious” conse
quence of failing to provide specific Brady training, and
that this showing of “obviousness” can substitute for the
pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish
municipal culpability.
In Canton, the Court left open the possibility that, “in a
narrow range of circumstances,” a pattern of similar viola
tions might not be necessary to show deliberate indiffer
ence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The Court posed the
hypothetical example of a city that arms its police force
with firearms and deploys the armed officers into the
public to capture fleeing felons without training the offi
cers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly
force. Canton, supra, at 390, n. 10. Given the known
frequency with which police attempt to arrest fleeing
felons and the “predictability that an officer lacking spe
cific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens’
rights,” the Court theorized that a city’s decision not to
train the officers about constitutional limits on the use of
deadly force could reflect the city’s deliberate indifference
to the “highly predictable consequence,” namely, violations
of constitutional rights. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The
Court sought not to foreclose the possibility, however rare,
that the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train
could be so patently obvious that a city could be liable
under §1983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of
violations.

(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, no 

court has ever found any of the other Brady violations that Thompson

alleges occurred in his armed robbery and murder trials.
