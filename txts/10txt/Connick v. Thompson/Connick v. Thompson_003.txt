Syllabus
when they are uncertain. Thus, recurring constitutional violations
are not the “obvious consequence” of failing to provide prosecutors
with formal in-house training. The nuance of the allegedly necessary
training also distinguishes the case from the example in Canton.
Here, the prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady rule.
Thus, Thompson cannot rely on the lack of an ability to cope with
constitutional situations that underlies the Canton hypothetical, but
must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular Brady
evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.
That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate
indifference here. Contrary to the holding below, it does not follow
that, because Brady has gray areas and some Brady decisions are dif
ficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing
to train them amounts, as it must, to “a decision by the city itself to
violate the Constitution.” Canton, 489 U. S., at 395 (O’Connor, J.,
