Opinion of the Court

holding—by pointing out that not all prosecutors will
necessarily have enrolled in criminal procedure class—
misses the point. See post, at 29–30. The reason why the
Canton hypothetical is inapplicable is that attorneys,
unlike police officers, are equipped with the tools to find,
——————
in Thompson’s trials. See post, at 3–13. How these violations are
relevant even to the dissent’s own legal analysis is “a mystery.” Post, at
4, n. 2.
The dissent does not list these violations among the
“[a]bundant evidence” that it believes supports the jury’s finding that
Brady training was obviously necessary. Post, at 16. Nor does the
dissent quarrel with our conclusion that contemporaneous or subse
quent conduct cannot establish a pattern of violations. The only point
appears to be to highlight what the dissent sees as sympathetic, even if
legally irrelevant, facts.
In any event, the dissent’s findings are highly suspect. In finding two
of the “new” violations, the dissent belatedly tries to reverse the Court
of Appeals’ 1998 decision that those Brady claims were “without merit.”
Compare Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802, 806–808 (CA5) (rejecting
Brady claims regarding the Perkins-Liuzza audiotapes and the Perkins
police report), with post, at 8–9 (concluding that these were Brady
violations). There is no basis to the dissent’s suggestion that materially
new facts have called the Court of Appeals’ 1998 decision into question.
Cf. State v. Thompson, 2002–0361, p. 6 (La. App. 7/17/02), 825 So. 2d
552, 555 (noting Thompson’s admission that some of his current Brady
claims “ha[ve] been rejected by both the Louisiana Supreme Court and
the federal courts”). Regarding the blood-stained swatch, which the
dissent asserts prosecutors “blocked” the defense from inspecting by
sending it to the crime lab for testing, post, at 6, Thompson’s counsel
conceded at oral argument that trial counsel had access to the evidence
locker where the swatch was recorded as evidence. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
37, 42; Record EX42, EX43 (evidence card identifying “One (1) Piece of
Victims [sic] Right Pants Leg, W/Blood” among the evidence in the
evidence locker and indicating that some evidence had been checked
out); Tr. 401 (testimony from Thompson’s counsel that he “[w]ent down
to the evidence room and checked all of the evidence”); id., at 103, 369–
370, 586, 602 (testimony that evidence card was “available to the
public,” would have been available to Thompson’s counsel, and would
have been seen by Thompson’s counsel because it was stapled to the
evidence bag in “the normal process”). Moreover, the dissent cannot
seriously believe that the jury could have found Brady violations—
indisputably, questions of law. See post, at 12, n. 10, 15, n. 11.
