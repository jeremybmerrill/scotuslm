CONNICK v. THOMPSON
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

pute that Connick “kn[e]w to a moral certainty that” his
prosecutors would regularly face Brady decisions. See
Canton, 489 U. S., at 390, n. 10.
The jury, furthermore, could reasonably find that Brady
rights may involve choices so difficult that Connick obvi
ously knew or should have known prosecutors needed
more than perfunctory training to make the correct
choices. See Canton, 489 U. S., at 390, and n. 10.19 As
demonstrated earlier, see supra, at 16–18, even at trial
prosecutors failed to give an accurate account of their
Brady obligations. And, again as emphasized earlier, see
supra, at 18–20, the evidence permitted the jury to con
clude that Connick should have known Brady training in
his office bordered on “zero.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.
Moreover, Connick understood that newer prosecutors
needed “very clear” guidance and should not be left to
grapple with Brady on their own. Tr. 834–835. It was
thus “obvious” to him, the jury could find, that constitu
tional rights would be in jeopardy if prosecutors received
slim to no Brady training.
Based on the evidence presented, the jury could con
clude that Brady errors by untrained prosecutors would
frequently cause deprivations of defendants’ constitutional
rights. The jury learned of several Brady oversights in
——————
Petitioners, it is true, argued all along that “[t]o prove deliberate
indifference, Thompson had to demonstrate a pattern of violations,”
Brief for Appellants in No. 07–30443 (CA5), p. 41; see ante, at 3–4
(SCALIA, J., concurring), but the court rejected their categorical position.
Petitioners did not otherwise assail the District Court’s formulation of
the deliberate indifference instruction. E.g., Record 1662.
19 Courts have noted the often trying nature of a prosecutor’s Brady
obligation. See, e.g., State v. Whitlock, 454 So. 2d 871, 874 (La. App.
1984) (recognizing, in a case involving Brady issues in Connick’s Office,
that “it is usually most difficult to determine whether or not inconsis
tencies or omitted information in witnesses’ statements are material to
the defendant’s guilt” (quoting State v. Davenport, 399 So. 2d 201, 204
(La. 1981))).
