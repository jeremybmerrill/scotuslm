Opinion of the Court

trial, and the jury convicted Thompson of attempted
armed robbery.
A few weeks later, Williams and special prosecutor Eric
Dubelier tried Thompson for the Liuzza murder. Because
of the armed robbery conviction, Thompson chose not to
testify in his own defense. He was convicted and sen
tenced to death. State v. Thompson, 516 So. 2d 349 (La.
1987). In the 14 years following Thompson’s murder
conviction, state and federal courts reviewed and denied
his challenges to the conviction and sentence. See State ex
rel. Thompson v. Cain, 95–2463 (La. 4/25/96), 672 So. 2d
906; Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802 (CA5 1998). The
State scheduled Thompson’s execution for May 20, 1999.
In late April 1999, Thompson’s private investigator
discovered the crime lab report from the armed robbery
investigation in the files of the New Orleans Police Crime
Laboratory. Thompson was tested and found to have
blood type O, proving that the blood on the swatch was not
his. Thompson’s attorneys presented this evidence to the
district attorney’s office, which, in turn, moved to stay the
execution and vacate Thompson’s armed robbery convic
tion.1 The Louisiana Court of Appeals then reversed
Thompson’s murder conviction, concluding that the armed
robbery conviction unconstitutionally deprived Thompson
of his right to testify in his own defense at the murder
trial. State v. Thompson, 2002–0361 (La. App. 7/17/02),
825 So. 2d 552. In 2003, the district attorney’s office

1 After Thompson discovered the crime lab report, former assistant
district attorney Michael Riehlmann revealed that Deegan had con
fessed to him in 1994 that he had “intentionally suppressed blood
evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thompson that in some
way exculpated the defendant.” Record EX583; see also id., at 2677.
Deegan apparently had been recently diagnosed with terminal cancer
when he made his confession. Following a disciplinary complaint by
the district attorney’s office, the Supreme Court of Louisiana repri
manded Riehlmann for failing to disclose Deegan’s admission earlier.
In re Riehlmann, 2004–0680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239.
