GINSBURG, J., dissenting

offices must “make . . . very clear to [new prosecutors]
what their responsibility [i]s” under Brady and must not
“giv[e] them a lot of leeway.” Tr. 834–835. But the jury
heard ample evidence that Connick’s Office gave prosecu
tors no Brady guidance, and had installed no procedures
to monitor Brady compliance.
In 1985, Connick acknowledged, many of his prosecutors
“were coming fresh out of law school,” and the Office’s
“[h]uge turnover” allowed attorneys with little experience
to advance quickly to supervisory positions. See Tr. 853–
854, 832. By 1985, Dubelier and Williams were two of the
highest ranking attorneys in the Office, id., at 342, 356–
357, yet neither man had even five years of experience as
a prosecutor, see supra, at 5, n. 3; Record EX746; Tr. 55,
571–576.
Dubelier and Williams learned the prosecutorial craft in
Connick’s Office, and, as earlier observed, see supra, at
17–18, their testimony manifested a woefully deficient
understanding of Brady. Dubelier and Williams told the
jury that they did not recall any Brady training in the
Office. Tr. 170–171, 364.
Connick testified that he relied on supervisors, includ
ing Dubelier and Williams, to ensure prosecutors were
familiar with their Brady obligations. Tr. 805–806. Yet
Connick did not inquire whether the supervisors them
selves understood the importance of teaching newer prose
cutors about Brady. Riehlmann could not “recall that [he]
was ever trained or instructed by anybody about [his]
Brady obligations,” on the job or otherwise. Tr. 728–729.
Whittaker agreed it was possible for “inexperienced law
yers, just a few weeks out of law school with no training,”
to bear responsibility for “decisions on . . . whether mate
rial was Brady material and had to be produced.” Id., at
319.
Thompson’s expert characterized Connick’s supervision
regarding Brady as “the blind leading the blind.” Tr. 458.
