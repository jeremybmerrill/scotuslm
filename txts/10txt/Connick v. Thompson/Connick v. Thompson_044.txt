GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Undeterred by his assistants’ disregard of Thompson’s
rights, Connick retried him for the Liuzza murder.
Thompson’s defense was bolstered by evidence earlier
unavailable to him: ten exhibits the prosecution had not
disclosed when Thompson was first tried. The newly
produced items included police reports describing the
assailant in the murder case as having “close cut” hair, the
police report recounting Perkins’ meetings with the Liuzza
family, see supra, at 3–4, audio recordings of those meet
ings, and a 35-page supplemental police report. After
deliberating for only 35 minutes, the jury found Thompson
not guilty.
On May 9, 2003, having served more than 18 years
in prison for crimes he did not commit, Thompson was
released.
II
On July 16, 2003, Thompson commenced a civil action
under 42 U. S. C. §1983 alleging that Connick, other
officials of the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office,
and the Office itself, had violated his constitutional rights
by wrongfully withholding Brady evidence. Thompson
sought to hold Connick and the District Attorney’s Office
liable for failure adequately to train prosecutors concern
ing their Brady obligations. Such liability attaches, I
agree with the Court, only when the failure “amount[s] to
‘deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom
the [untrained employees] come into contact.’ ” Ante, at 9
(quoting Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 388 (1989)). I
disagree, however, with the Court’s conclusion that
——————
earlier noted, the same trial court that made the 1995 findings was, in
1999, outraged by the subsequently discovered Brady violations and by
Connick’s reluctance to bring those violations to light. See supra, at
10–11. Certainly that judge would not have wanted the jury that
assessed Connick’s deliberate indifference in the §1983 trial to defer to
findings he earlier made on a notably incomplete record.
