CONNICK v. THOMPSON
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

near-life sentence for attempted armed robbery, the prose
cution urged, the only way to punish him for murder was
to execute him. The strategy worked as planned; Thomp
son was sentenced to death.
E
Thompson discovered the prosecutors’ misconduct
through a serendipitous series of events. In 1994, nine
years after Thompson’s convictions, Deegan, the assistant
prosecutor in the armed robbery trial, learned he was
terminally ill. Soon thereafter, Deegan confessed to his
friend Michael Riehlmann that he had suppressed blood
evidence in the armed robbery case. Id., at EX709.
Deegan did not heed Riehlmann’s counsel to reveal what
he had done. For five years, Riehlmann, himself a former
Orleans Parish prosecutor, kept Deegan’s confession to
himself. Id., at EX712–EX713.
On April 16, 1999, the State of Louisiana scheduled
Thompson’s execution. Id., at EX1366–EX1367. In an
eleventh-hour effort to save his life, Thompson’s attorneys
hired a private investigator. Deep in the crime lab ar
chives, the investigator unearthed a microfiche copy of the
lab report identifying the robber’s blood type. The copy
showed that the report had been addressed to Whittaker.
See supra, at 7.
Thompson’s attorneys contacted
Whittaker, who informed Riehlmann that the lab report
had been found. Riehlmann thereupon told Whittaker
that Deegan “had failed to turn over stuff that might have
been exculpatory.” Tr. 718. Riehlmann prepared an
affidavit describing Deegan’s disclosure “that he had
intentionally suppressed blood evidence in the armed
robbery trial of John Thompson.” Record EX583.
Thompson’s lawyers presented to the trial court the
crime lab report showing that the robber’s blood type was
B, and a report identifying Thompson’s blood type as O.
This evidence proved Thompson innocent of the robbery.
