CONNICK v. THOMPSON
Opinion of the Court

United States or other person within the jurisdiction
thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or
immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,
shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,
suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for
redress . . . .”
A municipality or other local government may be liable
under this section if the governmental body itself “sub
jects” a person to a deprivation of rights or “causes” a
person “to be subjected” to such deprivation. See Monell v.
New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 692
(1978). But, under §1983, local governments are responsi
ble only for “their own illegal acts.” Pembaur v. Cincin
nati, 475 U. S. 469, 479 (1986) (citing Monell, 436 U. S., at
665–683). They are not vicariously liable under §1983 for
their employees’ actions. See id., at 691; Canton, 489
U. S., at 392; Board of Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown,
520 U. S. 397, 403 (1997) (collecting cases).
Plaintiffs who seek to impose liability on local govern
ments under §1983 must prove that “action pursuant to
official municipal policy” caused their injury. Monell, 436
U. S., at 691; see id., at 694. Official municipal policy
includes the decisions of a government’s lawmakers, the
acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persis
tent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.
See ibid.; Pembaur, supra, at 480–481; Adickes v. S. H.
Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 167–168 (1970). These are
“action[s] for which the municipality is actually responsi
ble.” Pembaur, supra, at 479–480.
In limited circumstances, a local government’s decision
not to train certain employees about their legal duty to
avoid violating citizens’ rights may rise to the level of an
official government policy for purposes of §1983. A mu
nicipality’s culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its
most tenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train.
