CONNICK v. THOMPSON
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Thompson’s right to testify and thus fully present his
defense in the murder trial. Id., at 557. The merits of
several Brady claims arising out of the murder trial, the
court observed, had therefore become “moot.” 825 So. 2d,
at 555; see also Record 684.9 But cf. ante, at 10–11, n. 7,
16–17, n. 11 (suggesting that there were no Brady viola
tions in the murder prosecution because no court had
adjudicated any violations).10

9 Thompson argued that “the State failed to produce police reports
‘and other information’ which would have identified ‘eye- and ear
witnesses’ whose testimony would have exonerated him and inculpated
[Freeman], . . . and would have shown that [Perkins,] . . . who stated
[he] heard [Thompson] admit to committing the murder[,] had been
promised reward money for [his] testimony.” Thompson, 825 So. 2d, at
555. In leaving these arguments unaddressed, the Louisiana Court of
Appeal surely did not defer to the Fifth Circuit’s earlier assessment
of those claims, made on an anemic record, in Thompson v. Cain, 161
F. 3d 802. Nor did the Louisiana Court of Appeal suggest that Thomp
son was “belatedly tr[ying] to reverse” the Fifth Circuit’s decision. But
cf. ante, at 17, n. 11.
10 The Court notes that in Thompson v. Cain, the Fifth Circuit re
jected Brady claims raised by Thompson, characterizing one of those
claims as “without merit.” Ante, at 17, n. 11 (quoting Thompson, 161
F. 3d, at 807); see supra, at 4, n. 2. The Court, however, overlooks the
date of that Fifth Circuit decision. It was rendered before revelation of
the Brady violations in the armed robbery trial, before Thompson had
the opportunity for discovery in his §1983 suit, and before Thompson or
any court was aware of the “close cut hair” police reports. See Thomp
son, 161 F. 3d, at 812, n. 8. It is these later revelations, not the little
Thompson knew in 1998, that should count. For example, the Fifth
Circuit, in 1998, believed that Perkins’ statement recorded in the police
report did not “differ from Freeman’s trial testimony.” Id., at 808. But
evidence put before the jury in 2007 in the §1983 trial showed that the
police report, in several material respects, was inconsistent with
Freeman’s trial testimony. Tr. 382–383.
Connick has never suggested to this Court that the jury in the §1983
trial was bound by the Fifth Circuit’s 1998 Brady rulings. That court
“afford[ed] great deference to” the state trial court’s findings, made
after a 1995 post-conviction relief hearing. Thompson, 161 F. 3d, at
805. The jury in the §1983 trial, of course, had far more extensive and
accurate information on which to reach its decision. Moreover, as
