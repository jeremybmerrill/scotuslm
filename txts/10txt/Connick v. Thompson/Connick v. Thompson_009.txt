CONNICK v. THOMPSON
Opinion of the Court

WL 3541035, *13.
A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
affirmed. The panel acknowledged that Thompson did not
present evidence of a pattern of similar Brady violations,
553 F. 3d 836, 851 (2008), but held that Thompson did not
need to prove a pattern, id., at 854. According to the
panel, Thompson demonstrated that Connick was on
notice of an obvious need for Brady training by presenting
evidence “that attorneys, often fresh out of law school,
would undoubtedly be required to confront Brady issues
while at the DA’s Office, that erroneous decisions regard
ing Brady evidence would result in serious constitutional
violations, that resolution of Brady issues was often un
clear, and that training in Brady would have been help
ful.” 553 F. 3d, at 854.
The Court of Appeals sitting en banc vacated the panel
opinion, granted rehearing, and divided evenly, thereby
affirming the District Court. 578 F. 3d 293 (CA5 2009)
(per curiam). In four opinions, the divided en banc court
disputed whether Thompson could establish municipal
liability for failure to train the prosecutors based on the
single Brady violation without proving a prior pattern of
similar violations, and, if so, what evidence would make
that showing. We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).

The Brady violation conceded in this case occurred when
one or more of the four prosecutors involved with Thomp
son’s armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the
crime lab report to Thompson’s counsel. Under Thomp
son’s failure-to-train theory, he bore the burden of proving
both (1) that Connick, the policymaker for the district
attorney’s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to

ence jury instruction—which would have required Thompson to prove a
pattern of similar violations—for the same reasons as the summary
judgment motion. Tr. 1013; Record 993; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.
