CONNICK v. THOMPSON
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

training “so likely” to result in constitutional violations,
that policymakers who do not provide for the requisite
training “can reasonably be said to have been deliberately
indifferent to the need” for such training. 489 U. S., at
390. This case, I am convinced, belongs in the category
Canton marked out.
Canton offered an often-cited illustration. “[C]ity poli
cymakers know to a moral certainty that their police
officers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.” Ibid.,
n. 10. Those policymakers, Canton observed, equip police
officers with firearms to facilitate such arrests. Ibid. The
need to instruct armed officers about “constitutional limi
tations on the use of deadly force,” Canton said, is “ ‘so
obvious,’ that failure to [train the officers] could properly
be characterized as ‘deliberate indifference’ to constitu
tional rights.” Ibid.
The District Court, tracking Canton’s language, in
structed the jury that Thompson could prevail on his
“deliberate indifference” claim only if the evidence per
suaded the jury on three points. First, Connick “was
certain that prosecutors would confront the situation
where they would have to decide which evidence was
required by the Constitution to be provided to the ac
cused.” Tr. 1099. Second, “the situation involved a diffi
cult choice[,] or one that prosecutors had a history of
mishandling, such that additional training, supervision or
monitoring was clearly needed.” Ibid. Third, “the wrong
choice by a prosecutor in that situation would frequently
cause a deprivation of an accused’s constitutional rights.”

17 JUSTICE SCALIA contends that this “theory of deliberate indifference
would repeal the law of Monell,” and creates a danger that “ ‘failure to
train’ would become a talismanic incantation producing municipal
