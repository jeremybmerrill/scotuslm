The testimony of other leaders in the District Attorney’s
Office revealed similar misunderstandings. Those misun
derstandings, the jury could find, were in large part re

son experienced.
Dubelier admitted that he never
reviewed police files, but simply relied on the police to flag
any potential Brady information. Tr. 542. The court,
however, instructed the jury that an individual prosecutor
has a “duty . . . to learn of any favorable evidence known

Prosecutorial Misconduct: Law, Procedure, Forms (4th ed. 2008), first
published in 1985. Tr. 414. The text is used in a class on ethics and
tactics for the criminal lawyer at Harvard Law School and in the
federal defender training program of the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts. Id., at 416.
