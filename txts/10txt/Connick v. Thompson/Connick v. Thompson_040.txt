GINSBURG, J., dissenting

what he had learned from Freeman about the murder.
See supra, at 4. Freeman’s trial testimony was materially
inconsistent with that report. Tr. 382–384, 612–614;
Record EX270–EX274. Lacking any knowledge of the police
report, Thompson could not point to the inconsistencies.
Third, and most vital, the eyewitness’ initial description

murdered Liuzza, see supra, at 4. The materiality of the
eyewitness’ contemporaneous description of the murderer
should have been altogether apparent to the prosecution.
Failure to produce the police reports setting out what the
eyewitness first said not only undermined efforts to im

Prosecutors finessed the discrepancy between the eye

initial description of the perpetrator’s hair as “black and

prosecutors well knew, nothing in the withheld police
reports, which described the murderer’s hair simply as
“close cut,” portrayed a perpetrator with an Afro or Afro
style hair.
The jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder.
Having prevented Thompson from testifying that Freeman
was the killer, the prosecution delivered its ultimate
argument. Because Thompson was already serving a
