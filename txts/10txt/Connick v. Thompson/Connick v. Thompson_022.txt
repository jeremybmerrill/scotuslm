Opinion of the Court

Brady issues while at the district attorney’s office;
(2) inexperienced prosecutors were expected to understand
Brady’s requirements; (3) Brady has gray areas that make
for difficult choices; and (4) erroneous decisions regarding
Brady evidence would result in constitutional violations.
553 F. 3d, at 854; App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005 WL
3541035, *13. This is insufficient.
It does not follow that, because Brady has gray areas

much [a prosecutor’s] duty to refrain from improper meth
ods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to
use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.”
Ibid. By their own admission, the prosecutors who tried
Thompson’s armed robbery case failed to carry out that
responsibility. But the only issue before us is whether
Connick, as the policymaker for the district attorney’s
office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the
attorneys under his authority.
We conclude that this case does not fall within the
