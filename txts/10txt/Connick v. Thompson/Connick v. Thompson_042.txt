GINSBURG, J., dissenting

The court immediately stayed Thompson’s execution, id.,
at EX590, and commenced proceedings to assess the newly
discovered evidence.
Connick sought an abbreviated hearing. A full hearing
was unnecessary, he urged, because the Office had con
fessed error and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery
charges. See, e.g., id., at EX617. The court insisted on a
public hearing. Given “the history of this case,” the court
said, it “was not willing to accept the representations that
[Connick] and [his] office made [in their motion to dis
miss].” id., at EX882. After a full day’s hearing, the court
vacated Thompson’s attempted armed robbery conviction
and dismissed the charges. Before doing so, the court
admonished:

this, and I hope they take home . . . and take to heart
the message that this kind of conduct cannot go on in
this Parish if this Criminal Justice System is going to
work.” Id., at EX883.
The District Attorney’s Office then initiated grand jury
proceedings against the prosecutors who had withheld the
lab report. Connick terminated the grand jury after just
one day. He maintained that the lab report would not be
Brady material if prosecutors did not know Thompson’s
blood type. Tr. 986; cf. supra, at 7, n. 6. And he told the
investigating prosecutor that the grand jury “w[ould]
make [his] job more difficult.” Tr. 978–979. In protest,
that prosecutor tendered his resignation.

Thereafter, the Louisiana Court of Appeal reversed
Thompson’s murder conviction. State v. Thompson, 2002–

procured robbery conviction, the court held, had violated
