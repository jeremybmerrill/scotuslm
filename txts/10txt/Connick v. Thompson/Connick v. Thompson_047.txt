CONNICK v. THOMPSON
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

cf. ante, at 2, 6, 10, n. 7, 16; ante, at 1 (SCALIA, J., concur
ring) (maintaining that the case involves a single Brady
violation). That evidence included a stipulation that in his
retrial for the Liuzza murder, Thompson had introduced
ten exhibits containing relevant information withheld by
the prosecution in 1985. See supra, at 13.
Abundant evidence supported the jury’s finding that
additional Brady training was obviously necessary to
ensure that Brady violations would not occur: (1) Connick,
the Office’s sole policymaker, misunderstood Brady. (2)
Other leaders in the Office, who bore direct responsibility
for training less experienced prosecutors, were similarly
uninformed about Brady. (3) Prosecutors in the Office
received no Brady training. (4) The Office shirked its
responsibility to keep prosecutors abreast of relevant legal
developments concerning Brady requirements. As a result
of these multiple shortfalls, it was hardly surprising that
Brady violations in fact occurred, severely undermining
the integrity of Thompson’s trials.

Connick was the Office’s sole policymaker, and his
testimony exposed a flawed understanding of a prosecu
tor’s Brady obligations. First, Connick admitted to the
jury that his earlier understanding of Brady, conveyed in
prior sworn testimony, had been too narrow. Tr. 181–182.
Second, Connick confessed to having withheld a crime lab
report “one time as a prosecutor and I got indicted by the
U. S. Attorney over here for doing it.” Id., at 872. Third,
even at trial Connick persisted in misstating Brady’s
requirements. For example, Connick urged that there
could be no Brady violation arising out of “the inadvertent
conduct of [an] assistant under pressure with a lot of case
—————— 

under Brady . . . turns on the cumulative effect of all . . . evidence 

suppressed by the government . . . .”).
