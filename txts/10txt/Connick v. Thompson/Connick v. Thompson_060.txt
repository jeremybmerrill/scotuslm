GINSBURG, J., dissenting

ent” to the risk to innocent lives.
Brady, this Court has long recognized, is among the
most basic safeguards brigading a criminal defendant’s
fair trial right. See Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)
(slip op., at 1). See also United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S.
667, 695 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Vigilance in
superintending prosecutors’ attention to Brady’s require
ment is all the more important for this reason: A Brady
violation, by its nature, causes suppression of evidence
beyond the defendant’s capacity to ferret out. Because the
absence of the withheld evidence may result in the convic
tion of an innocent defendant, it is unconscionable not to
impose reasonable controls impelling prosecutors to bring
the information to light.
The Court nevertheless holds Canton’s example inappo
site. It maintains that professional obligations, ethics
rules, and training—including on-the-job training—set
attorneys apart from other municipal employees, including
rookie police officers. Ante, at 12–15. Connick “had every
incentive at trial to attempt to establish” that he could
reasonably rely on the professional education and status of
his staff. Cf. ante, at 10, n. 6. But the jury heard and
rejected his argument to that effect. Tr. 364, 576–577,
834–835.
The Court advances Connick’s argument with greater
clarity, but with no greater support. On what basis can
one be confident that law schools acquaint students with
prosecutors’ unique obligation under Brady? Whittaker
told the jury he did not recall covering Brady in his crimi
nal procedure class in law school. Tr. 335. Dubelier’s
alma mater, like most other law faculties, does not make
criminal procedure a required course.21
