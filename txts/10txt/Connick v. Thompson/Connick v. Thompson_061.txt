CONNICK v. THOMPSON
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Connick suggested that the bar examination ensures
that new attorneys will know what Brady demands. Tr.
835. Research indicates, however, that from 1980 to the
present, Brady questions have not accounted for even
10% of the total points in the criminal law and procedure
section of any administration of the Louisiana Bar Exami
nation.22 A person sitting for the Louisiana Bar Examina
tion, moreover, need pass only five of the exam’s nine
sections.23 One can qualify for admission to the profession
with no showing of even passing knowledge of criminal
law and procedure.
The majority’s suggestion that lawyers do not need
Brady training because they “are equipped with the tools
to find, interpret, and apply legal principles,” ante, at 17–
18, “blinks reality” and is belied by the facts of this case.
See Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials and
Prosecutors as Amici Curiae 13. Connick himself recog
nized that his prosecutors, because of their inexperience,
were not so equipped. Indeed, “understanding and com
plying with Brady obligations are not easy tasks, and the
appropriate way to resolve Brady issues is not always self
evident.” Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials
and Prosecutors as Amici Curiae 6. “Brady compliance,”
therefore, “is too much at risk, and too fundamental to the
fairness of our criminal justice system, to be taken for
granted,” and “training remains critical.” Id., at 3, 7.
The majority further suggests that a prior pattern of
similar violations is necessary to show deliberate indiffer
ence to defendants’ Brady rights. See ante, at 5–6, and
n. 4, 11–12.24 The text of §1983 contains no such limita
