Opinion of the Court

See Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 822–823
(1985) (plurality opinion) (“[A] ‘policy’ of ‘inadequate train
ing’ ” is “far more nebulous, and a good deal further re
moved from the constitutional violation, than was the
policy in Monell”). To satisfy the statute, a municipality’s
failure to train its employees in a relevant respect must
amount to “deliberate indifference to the rights of persons
with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.”
Canton, 489 U. S., at 388. Only then “can such a short
coming be properly thought of as a city ‘policy or custom’
that is actionable under §1983.” Id., at 389.
“ ‘[D]eliberate indifference’ is a stringent standard of
fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a
known or obvious consequence of his action.” Bryan Cty.,
520 U. S., at 410. Thus, when city policymakers are on
actual or constructive notice that a particular omission in
their training program causes city employees to violate
citizens’ constitutional rights, the city may be deemed
deliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to
retain that program. Id., at 407. The city’s “policy of
inaction” in light of notice that its program will cause
constitutional violations “is the functional equivalent of a
decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.”
Canton, 489 U. S., at 395 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part). A less stringent standard of fault
for a failure-to-train claim “would result in de facto re
spondeat superior liability on municipalities . . . .” Id., at
392; see also Pembaur, supra, at 483 (opinion of Brennan,
J.) (“[M]unicipal liability under §1983 attaches where—
and only where—a deliberate choice to follow a course of
action is made from among various alternatives by [the
relevant] officials . . .”).
B
A pattern of similar constitutional violations by un
trained employees is “ordinarily necessary” to demonstrate
