GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 388 (1989). That standard is well
met in this case.
I
I turn first to a contextual account of the Brady viola
tions that infected Thompson’s trials.
A
In the early morning hours of December 6, 1984, an
assailant shot and killed Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr., son of a
prominent New Orleans business executive, on the street
fronting the victim’s home. Only one witness saw the
assailant. As recorded in two contemporaneous police
reports, that eyewitness initially described the assailant
as African-American, six feet tall, with “close cut hair.”
Record EX2–EX3, EX9.1 Thompson is five feet eight
inches tall and, at the time of the murder, styled his hair
in a large “Afro.” Id., at EX13. The police reports of the
witness’ immediate identification were not disclosed to
Thompson or to the court.
While engaged in the murder investigation, the Orleans
Parish prosecutors linked Thompson to another violent
crime committed three weeks later. On December 28, an
assailant attempted to rob three siblings at gunpoint.
During the struggle, the perpetrator’s blood stained the
oldest child’s pant leg. That blood, preserved on a swatch
of fabric cut from the pant leg by a crime scene analyst,
was eventually tested. The test conclusively established
that the perpetrator’s blood was type B. Id., at EX151.
Thompson’s blood is type O. His prosecutors failed to
disclose the existence of the swatch or the test results.
