GINSBURG, J., dissenting

In sum, the evidence permitted the jury to reach the
following conclusions. First, Connick did not ensure that
prosecutors in his Office knew their Brady obligations; he
neither confirmed their familiarity with Brady when he
hired them, nor saw to it that training took place on his
watch. Second, the need for Brady training and monitor
ing was obvious to Connick. Indeed he so testified. Third,
Connick’s cavalier approach to his staff’s knowledge and
observation of Brady requirements contributed to a cul
ture of inattention to Brady in Orleans Parish.
As earlier noted, see supra, at 11, Connick resisted an
effort to hold prosecutors accountable for Brady compli
ance because he felt the effort would “make [his] job more
difficult.” Tr. 978. He never disciplined or fired a single
prosecutor for violating Brady. Tr. 182–183. The jury was
told of this Court’s decision in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.
419 (1995), a capital case prosecuted by Connick’s Office
that garnered attention because it featured “so many
instances of the state’s failure to disclose exculpatory
evidence.” Id., at 455 (Stevens, J., concurring). When
questioned about Kyles, Connick told the jury he was
satisfied with his Office’s practices and saw no need,
occasioned by Kyles, to make any changes. Tr. 184–185.
In both quantity and quality, then, the evidence canvassed
here was more than sufficient to warrant a jury determi
nation that Connick and the prosecutors who served under
him were not merely negligent regarding Brady. Rather,
they were deliberately indifferent to what the law
requires.
