Opinion of the Court

Ct. Rule XXX (effective 1988). Even those few jurisdic
tions that do not impose mandatory continuing-education
requirements mandate that attorneys represent their
clients competently and encourage attorneys to engage in
continuing study and education. See, e.g., Mass. Rule
Prof. Conduct 1.1 and comment 6 (West 2006). Before
Louisiana adopted continuing-education requirements, it
imposed similar general competency requirements on its
state bar. LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 1–
1, 1–2, DR 6–101 (West 1974) (effective 1971).
Attorneys who practice with other attorneys, such as in
district attorney’s offices, also train on the job as they
learn from more experienced attorneys. For instance, here
in the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office, junior
prosecutors were trained by senior prosecutors who super
vised them as they worked together to prepare cases for
trial, and trial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.
Senior attorneys also circulated court decisions and in
structional memoranda to keep the prosecutors abreast of
relevant legal developments.
In addition, attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy
character and fitness standards to receive a law license
and are personally subject to an ethical regime designed to
reinforce the profession’s standards. See, e.g., LSBA,
Articles of Incorporation, Art. 14, §7 (1985); see generally
id., Art. 16 (1971) (Code of Professional Responsibility).
Trial lawyers have a “duty to bring to bear such skill and
knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial
testing process.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668,
688 (1984). Prosecutors have a special “duty to seek jus
tice, not merely to convict.” LSBA, Articles of Incorpora
tion, Art. 16, EC 7–13 (1971); ABA Standards for Criminal
Justice 3–1.1(c) (2d ed. 1980). Among prosecutors’ unique
ethical obligations is the duty to produce Brady evidence
to the defense. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of Incorporation,
Art. 16, EC 7–13 (1971); ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct
