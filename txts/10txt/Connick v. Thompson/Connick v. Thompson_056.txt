GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Petitioners used this formulation of the failure to train
standard in pretrial and post-trial submissions, Record
1256–1257, 1662, and in their own proposed jury instruc
tion on deliberate indifference.18 Nor do petitioners dis

liability [i]n virtually every instance where a person has had his or her
constitutional rights violated by a city employee.” Ante, at 2–3 (some
internal quotation marks omitted). The District Court’s charge, how
ever, cautiously cabined the jury’s assessment of Connick’s deliberate
indifference. See, e.g., Tr. 1100 (“Mr. Thompson must prove that more
likely than not the Brady material would have been produced if the
prosecutors involved in his underlying criminal cases had been properly
trained, supervised or monitored regarding the production of Brady
evidence.”). See also id., at 1096–1097, 1099–1100.
The deliberate indifference jury instruction in this case was based on
the Second Circuit’s opinion in Walker v. New York, 974 F. 2d 293, 297–
298 (1992), applying Canton to a §1983 complaint alleging that a
district attorney failed to train prosecutors about Brady. JUSTICE
SCALIA’s fears should be calmed by post-Walker experience in the
Second Circuit. There has been no “litigation flood or even rainfall,”
Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12), in that Circuit
in Walker’s wake. See Brief for National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 39 (“Tellingly, in the Second Cir
cuit, in the nearly 20 years since the court decided Walker, there have
been no successful lawsuits for non-Brady constitutional violations
committed by prosecutors at trial (and no reported ‘single violation’
Brady case).” (citation omitted)); Brief for Center on the Administration
of Criminal Law, New York University School of Law, et al. as Amici
Curiae 35–36 (Walker has prompted “no flood of §1983 liability”).
18 The instruction Connick proposed resembled the charge given by
the District Court. See supra, at 24. Connick’s proposed instruction
read: “Before a district attorney’s failure to train or supervise consti
tutes deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens: (1)
the plaintiff must show that Harry Connick knew ‘to a moral certainty’
that his employees will confront a given situation; (2) the plaintiff must
show that the situation either presents the employee with a difficult
choice . . . such that training or supervision will make the choice less
difficult or that there is a history of employees mishandling the situa
tion; and (3) the plaintiff must show that the wrong choice by the
assistant district attorney will frequently cause the deprivation of a
citizen’s constitutional rights.” Record 992 (citing Canton, 489 U. S., at
390; punctuation altered). But cf. ante, at 3 (SCALIA, J., concurring)
(criticizing “Thompson’s theory” of deliberate indifference).
