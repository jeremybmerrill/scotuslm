Statement of ALITO, J.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
ROBERT HUBER ET UX. v. NEW JERSEY DEPART- 

MENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPERIOR 

COURT OF NEW JERSEY, APPELLATE DIVISION

No. 10–388.

Decided March 21, 2011

The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
Statement of JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF
JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE THOMAS join,
respecting the denial of certiorari.
Our cases recognize a limited exception to the Fourth

government supervision”—liquor dealers and pawnbrokers
are classic examples—the expectation of privacy becomes
“particularly attenuated.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks

yard. No. A–5874–07T3, 2010 WL 173533, *9–*10 (Super.
Ct. N. J., App. Div., Jan. 20, 2010) (per curiam). The
Hubers’ residential property contains wetlands protected
by a New Jersey environmental statute. See N. J. Stat.
Ann. §13:9B–1 et seq. (West 2003 and Supp. 2010). Ac
cording to the court below, the presence of these wetlands
brought the Hubers’ yard “directly under the regulatory
arm” of the State “just as much” as if the yard had been
