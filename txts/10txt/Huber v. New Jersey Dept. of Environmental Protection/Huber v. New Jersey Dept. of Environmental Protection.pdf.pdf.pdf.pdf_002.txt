HUBER v. NEW JERSEY DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL 

PROTECTION
Statement of ALITO, J. 





involved in a “regulated industry.” 2010 WL 173533, *10.
This Court has not suggested that a State, by imposing
heavy regulations on the use of privately owned residen
tial property, may escape the Fourth Amendment’s war
rant requirement. But because this case comes to us on
review of a decision by a state intermediate appellate
court, I agree that today’s denial of certiorari is appropri
ate. See this Court’s Rule 10. It does bear mentioning,
however, that “denial of certiorari does not constitute an
expression of any opinion on the merits.” Boumediene v.
Bush, 549 U. S. 1328, 1329 (2007) (Stevens and KENNEDY,
JJ., statement respecting denial of certiorari).
