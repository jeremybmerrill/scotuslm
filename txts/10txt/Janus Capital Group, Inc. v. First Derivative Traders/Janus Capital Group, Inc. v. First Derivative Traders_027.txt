ments as giving “company officials too much leeway to

v. Kasaks, 216 F. 3d 300, 314–315 (CA2 2000); Cooper v.
Pickett, 137 F. 3d 616, 624 (CA9 1997); Freeland v. Irid

My conclusion also reflects the particular circumstances
that the complaint alleges. The complaint states that
“Janus Management, as investment advisor to the funds,
is responsible for the day-to-day management of its
investment portfolio and other business affairs of the
funds. Janus Management furnishes advice and recom­
mendations concerning the funds’ investments, as well as
administrative, compliance and accounting services for the
funds.” Complaint ¶18, App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. Each of
the Fund’s 17 officers was a vice president of Janus
Management. App. 250a–258a. The Fund has “no assets
separate and apart from those they hold for shareholders.”
In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 384 F. Supp. 2d 845,
853, n. 3 (Md. 2005). Janus Management disseminated
the fund prospectuses through its parent company’s Web
site. Complaint ¶38, App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a. Janus
Management employees drafted and reviewed the Fund
prospectuses, including language about “market timing.”
Complaint ¶31, id., at 69a; In re Mutual Funds Inv.
Litigation, 590 F. Supp. 2d 741, 747 (Md. 2008). And
Janus Management may well have kept the trustees in the
dark about the true “market timing” facts. Complaint
¶51, App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a; In re Lammert, 93 S. E. C.

sometimes, can be held to have “ma[d]e” a materially false
statement, Janus Management can be held to have done
so on the facts alleged here. The relationship between
Janus Management and the Fund could hardly have been
