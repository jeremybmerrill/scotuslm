JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE 

TRADERS
BREYER, J., dissenting 


closer. Janus Management’s involvement in preparing
and writing the relevant statements could hardly have
been greater. And there is a serious suggestion that the
board itself knew little or nothing about the falsity of what
was said. See supra, at 9, 13. Unless we adopt a formal
rule (as the majority here has done) that would arbitrarily
exclude from the scope of the word “make” those who
manage a firm—even when those managers perpetrate a
fraud through an unknowing intermediary—the management company at issue here falls within that scope.
We should hold the allegations in the complaint in this
respect legally sufficient.
With respect, I dissent.
