BREYER, J., dissenting

ripe for reliance can be said to have been “ma[d]e” by one
or another actor. How then does Stoneridge support the
majority’s new rule?
The majority adds that its rule is necessary to avoid “a
theory of liability similar to—but broader in application
than”—§20(a)’s liability, for “ ‘[e]very person who, directly
or indirectly, controls any person liable’ ” for violations of
the securities laws. Ante, at 10 (quoting 15 U. S. C. A.
§78t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)). But that is not so. This Court
has explained that the possibility of an express remedy
under the securities laws does not preclude a claim under
§10(b). Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375,
388 (1983).
More importantly, a person who is liable under §20(a)
controls another “person” who is “liable” for a securities
violation. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561
U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2010) (slip op., at 3, n. 2) (“Liability
under §20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some
other provision of the Exchange Act”). We here examine
whether a person is primarily liable whether they do, or
they do not, control another person who is liable. That is
to say, here, the liability of some “other person” is not at
issue.
And there is at least one significant category of cases
that §10(b) may address that derivative forms of liability,
such as under §20(a), cannot, namely, cases in which one
actor exploits another as an innocent intermediary for its
misstatements. Here, it may well be that the Fund’s
board of trustees knew nothing about the falsity of the
prospectuses. See, e.g., In re Lammert, Release No. 348,
93 S. E. C. Docket 5676, 5700 (2008) (Janus Management
was aware of market timing in the Janus Fund no later
than 2002, but “[t]his knowledge was never shared with
the Board”). And if so, §20(a) would not apply.
The possibility of guilty management and innocent
board is the 13th stroke of the new rule’s clock. What is to
