JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE 

TRADERS
BREYER, J., dissenting 


purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a
primary violator under 10b–5, assuming all of the re­
quirements for primary liability under Rule 10b–5 are
met.” 511 U. S., at 191 (some emphasis added).
Given the statements in our opinions, it is not surpris­
ing that lower courts have found primary liability for
actors without “ultimate authority” over issued state­
ments. One court, for example, concluded that an ac­
countant could be primarily liable for having “ma[d]e”
false statements, where he issued fraudulent opinion and
certification letters reproduced in prospectuses, annual
reports, and other corporate materials for which he was
not ultimately responsible.
Anixter v. Home-Stake
Production Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1225–1227 (CA10 1996). In
a later case postdating Stoneridge, that court reaffirmed
that an outside consultant could be primarily liable for
having “ma[d]e” false statements, where he drafted
fraudulent quarterly and annual filing statements later
reviewed and certified by the firm’s auditor, officers, and
counsel. SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F. 3d 1249, 1261 (CA10
2008). And another court found that a corporation’s chief
financial officer could be held primarily liable as having
“ma[d]e” misstatements that appeared in a form 10–K
that she prepared but did not sign or file. McConville v.
SEC, 465 F. 3d 780, 787 (CA7 2006).
One can also easily find lower court cases explaining
that corporate officials may be liable for having “ma[d]e”
false statements where those officials use innocent
persons as conduits through which the false statements
reach the public (without necessarily attributing the false
statements to the officials). See, e.g., In re Navarre Corp.
Securities Litigation, 299 F. 3d 735, 743 (CA8 2002) (liabil­
ity may be premised on use of analysts as a conduit to
communicate false statements to market); In re Cabletron
Systems, Inc., 311 F. 3d 11, 38 (CA1 2002) (rejecting a test
