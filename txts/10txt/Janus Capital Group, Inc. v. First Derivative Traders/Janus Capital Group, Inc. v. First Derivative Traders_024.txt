JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE 

TRADERS
BREYER, J., dissenting 





happen when guilty management writes a prospectus (for
the board) containing materially false statements and
fools both board and public into believing they are true?
Apparently under the majority’s rule, in such circum­
stances no one could be found to have “ma[d]e” a materially false statement—even though under the common
law the managers would likely have been guilty or liable
(in analogous circumstances) for doing so as principals
(and not as aiders and abettors). See, e.g., 2 W. LaFave,
Substantive Criminal Law §13.1(a) (2d ed. 2003); 1 M.
Hale, Pleas of the Crown 617 (1736); Perkins, Parties to
Crime, 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 583 (1941) (one is guilty as a
principal when one uses an innocent third party to commit
a crime); Restatement (Second) of Torts §533 (1976). Cf.
United States v. Giles, 300 U. S. 41, 48–49 (1937).
Indeed, under the majority’s rule it seems unlikely that
the SEC itself in such circumstances could exercise the
authority Congress has granted it to pursue primary
violators who “make” false statements or the authority
that Congress has specifically provided to prosecute aiders
and abettors to securities violations. See §104, 109 Stat.
757 (codified at 15 U. S. C. A. §78t(e) (Feb. 2011 Supp.))
(granting SEC authority to prosecute aiders and abettors).
That is because the managers, not having “ma[d]e” the
statement, would not be liable as principals and there
would be no other primary violator they might have
tried to “aid” or “abet.” Ibid.; SEC v. DiBella, 587 F. 3d
553, 566 (CA2 2009) (prosecution for aiding and abetting requires primary violation to which offender gave
“substantial assistance” (internal quotation marks
omitted)).
If the majority believes, as its footnote hints, that §20(b)
could provide a basis for liability in this case, ante, at 10,
n. 10, then it should remand the case for possible amend­
ment of the complaint. “There is a dearth of authority
construing Section 20(b),” which has been thought largely
