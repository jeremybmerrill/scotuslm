JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE 

TRADERS
BREYER, J., dissenting 


tral Bank’s rule) absolving those who concededly did not
do so.
The majority adds that to interpret the word “make” as
including those “without ultimate control over the content
of a statement” would “substantially undermine” Central
Bank’s holding. Ante, at 7. Would it? The Court in Cen
tral Bank specifically wrote that its holding did
“not mean that secondary actors in the securities
markets are always free from liability under the secu­
rities Acts. Any person or entity, including a lawyer,
accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative de­
vice or makes a material misstatement (or omission)
on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may
be liable as a primary violator under 10b–5, assuming
all of the requirements for primary liability under
Rule 10b–5 are met.” 511 U. S., at 191 (some empha­
sis added).
Thus, as far as Central Bank is concerned, depending upon
the circumstances, board members, senior firm officials,
officials tasked to develop a marketing document, large
investors, or others (taken together or separately) all
might “make” materially false statements subjecting
themselves to primary liability. The majority’s rule does
not protect, it extends, Central Bank’s holding of no­
liability into new territory that Central Bank explicitly
placed outside that holding. And by ignoring the language
in which Central Bank did so, the majority’s rule itself
undermines Central Bank. Where is the legal support for
the majority’s “draw[ing] a clean line,” ante, at 7, n. 6, that
so seriously conflicts with Central Bank? Indeed, where is
the legal support for the majority’s suggestion that plain­
tiffs must show some kind of “attribution” of a statement
to a defendant, ante, at 11, n. 11—if it means plaintiffs
must show, not only that the defendant “ma[d]e” the
statement, but something more?
