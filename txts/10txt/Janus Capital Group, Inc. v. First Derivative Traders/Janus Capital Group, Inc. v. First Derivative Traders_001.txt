Syllabus

JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC., ET AL. v. FIRST 

DERIVATIVE TRADERS 

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
No. 09–525.

Argued December 7, 2010—Decided June 13, 2011

Respondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative), representing a
class of stockholders in petitioner Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG),
filed this private action under Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) Rule 10b–5, which forbids “any person . . . [t]o make any un
true statement of a material fact” in connection with the purchase or
sale of securities. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that JCG and its
wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Janus Capital Management LLC
(JCM), made false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by
Janus Investment Fund—for which JCM was the investment adviser
and administrator—and that those statements affected the price of
JCG’s stock. Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, it is a
separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors. The
District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.
The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had suffi
ciently alleged that JCG and JCM, by participating in the writing
and dissemination of the prospectuses, made the misleading state
ments contained in the documents. Before this Court, First Deriva
tive continues to argue that JCM made the statements but seeks to
hold JCG liable only as a control person of JCM under §20(a).
Held: Because the false statements included in the prospectuses were
made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG cannot
be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b–5. Pp. 5–12.
(a) Although neither Rule 10b–5 nor the statute it interprets,
§10(b) of the Act, expressly creates a private right of action, such an
“action is implied under §10(b).” Superintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v.
