JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE 

TRADERS
BREYER, J., dissenting 


And it held that these deceptive statements or actions
could not provide a basis for liability because the investors
could not prove sufficient reliance upon the particular
false statements that the equipment suppliers had made.
The Court pointed out that the equipment suppliers
“had no duty to disclose; and their deceptive acts were not
communicated to the public.” Id., at 159. And the Court
went on to say that “as a result,” the investors “cannot
show reliance upon any” of the equipment suppliers’
actions, “except in an indirect chain that we find too
remote for liability.” Ibid. The Court concluded,
“[the equipment suppliers’] deceptive acts, which were
not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to
satisfy the requirement of reliance. It was [the cable
company], not [the equipment suppliers], that misled
its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements;
nothing [the equipment suppliers] did made it
necessary or inevitable for [the cable company] to
record the transactions as it did.” Id., at 161.
Insofar as the equipment suppliers’ conduct was at issue,
the fraudulent “arrangement . . . took place in the
marketplace for goods and services, not in the investment
sphere.” Id., at 166.
It is difficult for me to see how Stoneridge “support[s]”
the majority’s rule. Ante, at 7. No one in Stoneridge
disputed the making of the relevant statements, the
fraudulent contracts and the like.
And no one in
Stoneridge contended that the equipment suppliers were,
in fact, the makers of the cable company’s misstatements.
Rather, Stoneridge was concerned with whether the
equipment suppliers’ separate statements were sufficiently
disclosed in the securities marketplace so as to be the
basis for investor reliance. They were not. But this is a
different inquiry than whether statements acknowledged
to have been disclosed in the securities marketplace and
