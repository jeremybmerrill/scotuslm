JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE 

TRADERS
Opinion of the Court 


the investing public, which created the misleading impres
sion that [JCG and JCM] would implement measures to
curb market timing in the Janus [mutual funds].” App. to
Pet. for Cert. 60a. “Had the truth been known, Janus
[mutual funds] would have been less attractive to inves
tors, and consequently, [JCG] would have realized lower
revenues, so [JCG’s] stock would have traded at lower
prices.” Id., at 72a.
First Derivative contends that JCG and JCM “materi
ally misled the investing public” and that class members
relied “upon the integrity of the market price of [JCG]
securities and market information relating to [JCG and
JCM].” Id., at 109a. The complaint also alleges that JCG
should be held liable for the acts of JCM as a “controlling
person” under 15 U. S. C. A. §78t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)
(§20(a) of the Act).
The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to
state a claim.3 In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 487
F. Supp. 2d 618, 620 (D Md. 2007). The Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Deriva
tive had sufficiently alleged that “JCG and JCM, by par
ticipating in the writing and dissemination of the prospec
tuses, made the misleading statements contained in the
documents.” In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 566 F. 3d
111, 121 (2009) (emphasis in original). With respect to the
element of reliance, the court found that investors would
infer that JCM “played a role in preparing or approving
the content of the Janus fund prospectuses,” id., at 127,
but that investors would not infer the same about JCG,
