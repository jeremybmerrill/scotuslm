BREYER, J., dissenting

“superfluous in 10b–5 cases.” 5B A. Jacobs, Disclosure
and Remedies Under the Securities Law §11–8, p. 11–72
(2011). Hence respondent, who reasonably thought that it
referred to the proper securities law provision, is faultless
for failing to mention §20(b) as well.
In sum, I can find nothing in §10(b) or in Rule 10b–5, its

The specific relationships alleged

10b–5 for having “ma[d]e” a materially false statement
even when that statement appears in a document (or is
made by a third person) that the officials do not legally
control. In Herman & MacLean, for example, this Court
pointed out that “certain individuals who play a part in
preparing the registration statement,” including corporate
officers, lawyers, and accountants, may be primarily liable
even where “they are not named as having prepared or
certified” the registration statement. 459 U. S., at 386, n.
22. And as I have already pointed out, this Court wrote in
Central Bank that a “lawyer, accountant, or bank, who . . .
makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a
