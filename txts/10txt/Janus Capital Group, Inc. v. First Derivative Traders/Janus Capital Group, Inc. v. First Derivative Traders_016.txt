JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE 

TRADERS
BREYER, J., dissenting 





chase or sale of securities. 17 CFR §240.10b–5(b) (2010)
(emphasis added). See also 15 U. S. C. §78j(b) (§10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The specific legal
question before us is whether Janus Management can be
held responsible under the Rule for having “ma[d]e” cer­

The statements in question appear in the Janus Fund’s
prospectuses.
The Court holds that only the Janus Fund, not Janus
Management, could have “ma[d]e” those statements. The
majority points out that the Janus Fund’s board of trus­

nor this Court’s earlier cases limit the scope of that
word to those with “ultimate authority” over a statement’s
content. To the contrary, both language and case law
indicate that, depending upon the circumstances, a man­
agement company, a board of trustees, individual company
officers, or others, separately or together, might “make”
statements contained in a firm’s prospectus—even if a
board of directors has ultimate content-related responsi­
bility. And the circumstances here are such that a court
could find that Janus Management made the statements
in question.

Respondent’s complaint sets forth the basic elements
of a typical Rule 10b–5 “fraud on the market” claim. It
alleges that Janus Management made statements that
