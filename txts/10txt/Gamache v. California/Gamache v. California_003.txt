Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.

the absence of misconduct, the burden remains with the
defendant to demonstrate prejudice under the usual stan
dard for ordinary trial error.” 48 Cal. 4th, at 397, 227
P. 3d, at 387 (emphasis added). It is not clear what the
court intended in allocating the burden to the defendant to
demonstrate prejudice, but if it meant to convey that the
defendant bore the burden of persuasion, that would
contravene Chapman. See 386 U. S., at 24 (noting that
the “original common-law harmless-error rule put the
burden on the beneficiary of the error either to prove that
there was no injury or to suffer a reversal of his errone
ously obtained judgment”); cf. O’Neal v. McAninch, 513
U. S. 432, 438–439 (1995) (describing Chapman as “plac
ing the risk of doubt” about harmlessness on the State).
However, it appears from the court’s recitation of the
evidence and its analysis that the court found that the
error at issue was harmless, regardless of the burden
allocation. See 48 Cal. 4th, at 399, 227 P. 3d, at 388
(“[T]here is no reasonable possibility the outcome would
have been different absent the error”). I therefore do not
disagree with the denial of certiorari.
I nonetheless write respecting the denial of certiorari
because the allocation of the burden of proving harmless
ness can be outcome determinative in some cases. See
Fulminante, 499 U. S., at 296 (“Five of us are of the view
that the State has not carried its burden and accordingly
affirm the judgment of the court below reversing respon
dent’s conviction”); see, e.g., State v. Ball, 2004 SD 9, 675
N. W. 2d 192 (holding that the State had not met its bur
den of showing that prosecutor’s improper references in
closing argument to defendant’s silence were harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt); State v. Jorgensen, 2008 WI
60, 310 Wis. 2d 138, 754 N. W. 2d 77 (holding that the
State had not met its burden of showing that Confronta
tion Clause violation was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt). With all that is at stake in capital cases, cf. Kyles
