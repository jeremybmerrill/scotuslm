SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
RICHARD CAMERON GAMACHE v. CALIFORNIA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME

COURT OF CALIFORNIA

No. 10–5196. Decided November 29, 2010 


The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE
GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE KAGAN join,

On appeal, the California Supreme Court held that the
jury’s access to the tape was indisputably error, citing our
opinion in Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 466 (1965). 48
Cal. 4th, at 396, 227 P. 3d, at 386 (“ ‘ The requirement that
