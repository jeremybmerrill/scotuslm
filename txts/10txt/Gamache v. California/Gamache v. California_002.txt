GAMACHE v. CALIFORNIA
Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.

oped at the trial” goes to the fundamental integrity of all
that is embraced in the constitutional concept of trial by
jury’ ” (quoting Turner, 379 U. S., at 472)); see also id., at
472–473 (“In the constitutional sense, trial by jury in a
criminal case necessarily implies at the very least that the
‘evidence developed’ against a defendant shall come from
the witness stand in a public courtroom where there is full
judicial protection of the defendant’s right of confronta
tion, of cross-examination, and of counsel”). The Califor

Chapman, 386 U. S., at 24)); United States v. Dominguez

criminal conviction, it is not enough to negate an effect on
the outcome of the case” (citing Chapman, 386 U. S., at
24)); Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 295–296 (1991)
(“The Court has the power to review the record de novo in
order to determine an error’s harmlessness. In so doing, it
