GAMACHE v. CALIFORNIA
Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.

v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 422 (1995) (“ ‘[O]ur duty to
search for constitutional error with painstaking care is
never more exacting than it is in a capital case’ ” (quoting
Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 785 (1987)), in future cases
the California courts should take care to ensure that their
burden allocation conforms to the commands of Chapman.
In this case, however, because it seems that the burden
allocation would not have altered the court’s prejudice
analysis, I do not disagree with the denial of certiorari.
