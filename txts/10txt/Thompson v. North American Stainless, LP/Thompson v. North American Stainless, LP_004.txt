THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP
Opinion of the Court

activity, either on his own behalf or on behalf of Miriam
Regalado,” he “is not included in the class of persons for
whom Congress created a retaliation cause of action.” Id.,
at 807–808.
We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).
I
Title VII provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful em­
ployment practice for an employer to discriminate against
any of his employees . . . because he has made a charge”
under Title VII. 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). The statute
permits “a person claiming to be aggrieved” to file a charge
with the EEOC alleging that the employer committed an
unlawful employment practice, and, if the EEOC declines
to sue the employer, it permits a civil action to “be brought
. . . by the person claiming to be aggrieved . . . by the al­
leged unlawful employment practice.” §2000e–5(b), (f)(1).
It is undisputed that Regalado’s filing of a charge with
the EEOC was protected conduct under Title VII. In the
procedural posture of this case, we are also required to
assume that NAS fired Thompson in order to retaliate
against Regalado for filing a charge of discrimination.
This case therefore presents two questions: First, did
NAS’s firing of Thompson constitute unlawful retaliation?
And second, if it did, does Title VII grant Thompson a
cause of action?

With regard to the first question, we have little diffi­

true, then NAS’s firing of Thompson violated Title VII. In
Burlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53 (2006),
we held that Title VII’s antiretaliation provision must be
construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct. We
reached that conclusion by contrasting the text of Title
