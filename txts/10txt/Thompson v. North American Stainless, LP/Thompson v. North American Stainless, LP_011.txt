ERIC L. THOMPSON, PETITIONER v. NORTH

AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

[January 24, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion, and add a fortifying observa
tion: Today’s decision accords with the longstanding views
of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC), the federal agency that administers Title VII. In
its Compliance Manual, the EEOC counsels that Title VII

statutory rights that it would discourage or prevent the
person from pursuing those rights. ” Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 12–13 (quoting EEOC Compli

challenged,” the Manual affirms, “by both the individual
who engaged in protected activity and the relative, where
both are employees.” Id., at 25–26 (quoting Compliance
Manual §8–II(B)(3)(c)). The EEOC’s statements in the
Manual merit deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,
323 U. S. 134 (1944). See Federal Express Corp. v.
Holowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 399–400 (2008). The EEOC’s
interpretation of Title VII, I further note, is consistent
with interpretations of analogous statutes by other federal
agencies. See, e.g., NLRB v. Advertisers Mfg. Co., 823 F.
2d 1086, 1088–1089 (CA7 1987) (adopting NLRB’s position
that retaliation against a relative violates the National
