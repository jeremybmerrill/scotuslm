THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 09–291.

Argued December 7, 2010—Decided January 24, 2011

After petitioner Thompson’s fiancée, Miriam Regalado, filed a sex dis­
crimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Com­
mission (EEOC) against their employer, respondent North American
Stainless (NAS), NAS fired Thompson. He filed his own charge and a
subsequent suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, claiming that
NAS fired him to retaliate against Regalado for filing her charge.
The District Court granted NAS summary judgment on the ground
that third-party retaliation claims were not permitted by Title VII,
which prohibits discrimination against an employee “because he has
made a [Title VII] charge,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a), and which per­
mits, inter alia, a “person claiming to be aggrieved . . . by [an] alleged
employment practice” to file a civil action, §2000e–5(f)(1). The en
banc Sixth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Thompson was not enti­
tled to sue NAS for retaliation because he had not engaged in any ac­
tivity protected by the statute.
Held:
1. If the facts Thompson alleges are true, his firing by NAS consti­
tuted unlawful retaliation. Title VII’s antiretaliation provision must
be construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct. Burlington
N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53. It prohibits any employer ac­
tion that “ ‘well might have “dissuaded a reasonable worker from
making or supporting a [discrimination] charge,” ’ ” id., at 68. That
test must be applied in an objective fashion, to “avoi[d] the uncertain­
ties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to de­
termine a plaintiff’s unusual subjective feelings.” Id., at 68–69. A
reasonable worker obviously might be dissuaded from engaging in
protected activity if she knew that her fiancé would be fired. Pp. 2–4.
2. Title VII grants Thompson a cause of action. Pp. 4–7.
