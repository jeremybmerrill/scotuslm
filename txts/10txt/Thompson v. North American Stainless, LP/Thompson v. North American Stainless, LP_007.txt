Opinion of the Court

that the plaintiff have Article III standing. 567 F. 3d, at
808, n. 1. We do not understand how that can be. The
provision unquestionably permits a person “claiming to be
aggrieved” to bring “a civil action.” It is arguable that the
aggrievement referred to is nothing more than the mini­
mal Article III standing, which consists of injury in fact
caused by the defendant and remediable by the court. See
Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561
(1992). But Thompson’s claim undoubtedly meets those
requirements, so if that is indeed all that aggrievement
consists of, he may sue.
We have suggested in dictum that the Title VII ag­
grievement requirement conferred a right to sue on all
who satisfied Article III standing. Trafficante v. Metro
politan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205 (1972), involved the
“person aggrieved” provision of Title VIII (the Fair Hous­
ing Act) rather than Title VII. In deciding the case, how­
ever, we relied upon, and cited with approval, a Third
Circuit opinion involving Title VII, which, we said, “con­
cluded that the words used showed ‘a congressional
intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by
Article III of the Constitution.’ ” Id., at 209 (quoting
Hackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc., 445 F. 2d 442, 446 (1971)).
We think that dictum regarding Title VII was too expan­
sive. Indeed, the Trafficante opinion did not adhere to it
in expressing its Title VIII holding that residents of an
apartment complex could sue the owner for his racial
discrimination against prospective tenants. The opinion
said that the “person aggrieved” of Title VIII was coexten­
sive with Article III “insofar as tenants of the same hous
ing unit that is charged with discrimination are con
cerned.” 409 U. S., at 209 (emphasis added). Later
opinions, we must acknowledge, reiterate that the term
“aggrieved” in Title VIII reaches as far as Article III per­
mits, see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 165–166 (1997);
Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91,
