THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP
Opinion of the Court

will place the employer at risk any time it fires any em­
ployee who happens to have a connection to a different
employee who filed a charge with the EEOC.
Although we acknowledge the force of this point, we do
not think it justifies a categorical rule that third-party
reprisals do not violate Title VII. As explained above, we
adopted a broad standard in Burlington because Title
VII’s antiretaliation provision is worded broadly. We
think there is no textual basis for making an exception to
it for third-party reprisals, and a preference for clear rules
cannot justify departing from statutory text.
We must also decline to identify a fixed class of relation­
ships for which third-party reprisals are unlawful. We
expect that firing a close family member will almost al­
ways meet the Burlington standard, and inflicting a
milder reprisal on a mere acquaintance will almost never
do so, but beyond that we are reluctant to generalize. As
we explained in Burlington, 548 U. S., at 69, “the signifi­
cance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon
the particular circumstances.” Given the broad statutory
text and the variety of workplace contexts in which re­
taliation may occur, Title VII’s antiretaliation provision is
simply not reducible to a comprehensive set of clear rules.
We emphasize, however, that “the provision’s standard for
judging harm must be objective,” so as to “avoi[d] the
uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a
judicial effort to determine a plaintiff’s unusual subjective
feelings.” Id., at 68–69.

The more difficult question in this case is whether
Thompson may sue NAS for its alleged violation of Title
VII. The statute provides that “a civil action may be
brought . . . by the person claiming to be aggrieved.” 42
U. S. C. §2000e–5(f)(1). The Sixth Circuit concluded that
this provision was merely a reiteration of the requirement
