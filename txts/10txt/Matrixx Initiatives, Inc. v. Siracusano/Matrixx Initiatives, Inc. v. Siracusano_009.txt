MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO
Opinion of the Court

founded and misleading.
“In no clinical trial of intranasal zinc gluconate gel
products has there been a single report of lost or di­
minished olfactory function (sense of smell). Rather,
the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treat­
ment of symptoms related to the common cold have
been well established in two double-blind, placebo­
controlled, randomized clinical trials. In fact, in nei­
ther study were there any reports of anosmia related
to the use of this compound. The overall incidence of
adverse events associated with zinc gluconate was ex­
tremely low, with no statistically significant difference
between the adverse event rates for the treated and
placebo subsets.
“A multitude of environmental and biologic influ­
ences are known to affect the sense of smell. Chief
among them is the common cold. As a result, the
population most likely to use cold remedy products is
already at increased risk of developing anosmia.
Other common causes of olfactory dysfunction include
age, nasal and sinus infections, head trauma, ana­
tomical obstructions, and environmental irritants.”

Morning America, a nationally broadcast morning news
program, highlighted Dr. Jafek’s findings. (The complaint
does not allege that Matrixx learned of the news story
before its broadcast.) The program reported that Dr. Jafek
had discovered more than a dozen patients suffering from
anosmia after using Zicam. It also noted that four law­
suits had been filed against Matrixx. The price of Matrixx
stock plummeted to $9.94 per share that same day. Zicam
again issued a press release largely repeating its February
