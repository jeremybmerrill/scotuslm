MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO
Opinion of the Court

held that this materiality requirement is satisfied when
there is “ ‘a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of
the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable
investor as having significantly altered the “total mix” of
information made available.’ ” Id., at 231–232 (quoting
TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 449
(1976)). We were “careful not to set too low a standard of
materiality,” for fear that management would “ ‘bury
the shareholders in an avalanche of trivial information.’ ”
485 U. S., at 231 (quoting TSC Industries, 426 U. S., at
448–449).
Basic involved a claim that the defendant had made
misleading statements denying that it was engaged in
merger negotiations when it was, in fact, conducting pre­
liminary negotiations. See 485 U. S., at 227–229. The
defendant urged a bright-line rule that preliminary
merger negotiations are material only once the parties to
the negotiations reach an agreement in principle. Id., at
232–233. We observed that “[a]ny approach that desig­
nates a single fact or occurrence as always determinative
of an inherently fact-specific finding such as materiality,
must necessarily be overinclusive or underinclusive.” Id.,
at 236. We thus rejected the defendant’s proposed rule,
explaining that it would “artificially exclud[e] from the
definition of materiality information concerning merger
discussions, which would otherwise be considered significant to the trading decision of a reasonable investor.”

event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not
considered drug related.” 21 CFR §314.80(a) (2010). Federal law
