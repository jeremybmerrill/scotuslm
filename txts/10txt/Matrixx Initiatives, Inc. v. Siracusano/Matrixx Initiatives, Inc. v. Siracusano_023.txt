MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO
Opinion of the Court

dant acted with scienter, ‘a mental state embracing intent
to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.’ ” Tellabs, 551 U. S., at
319 (quoting Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185,
193–194, and n. 12 (1976)). We have not decided whether
recklessness suffices to fulfill the scienter requirement.
See Tellabs, 551 U. S., at 319, n. 3. Because Matrixx does
not challenge the Court of Appeals’ holding that the
scienter requirement may be satisfied by a showing of
“deliberate recklessness,” see 585 F. 3d, at 1180 (internal
quotation marks omitted), we assume, without deciding,
that the standard applied by the Court of Appeals is suffi­
cient to establish scienter.14
Under the PSLRA, a plaintiff must “state with par­
ticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the
defendant acted with the required state of mind.” 15
U. S. C. A. §78u–4(b)(2)(A) (Feb. 2011 Supp.). This stan­
dard requires courts to take into account “plausible oppos­
ing inferences.” Tellabs, 551 U. S., at 323. A complaint
adequately pleads scienter under the PSLRA “only if a
reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter
cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing infer­
ence one could draw from the facts alleged.” Id., at 324.
In making this determination, the court must review “all
the allegations holistically.” Id., at 326. The absence of a
motive allegation, though relevant, is not dispositive. Id.,
at 325.
Matrixx argues, in summary fashion, that because
respondents do not allege that it knew of statistically
significant evidence of causation, there is no basis to
consider the inference that it acted recklessly or know­
ingly to be at least as compelling as the alternative infer­

the PSLRA, if the alleged misstatement or omission is a
“forward-looking statement,” the required level of scienter is “actual
knowledge.” 15 U. S. C. §78u–5(c)(1)(B). Matrixx has not argued that
the statements or omissions here are “forward-looking statement[s].”
