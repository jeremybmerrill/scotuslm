Syllabus
complaint’s allegations to be true, Matrixx told the market that reve
nues were going to rise 50 and then 80 percent when it had informa
tion indicating a significant risk to its leading revenue-generating
product. It also publicly dismissed reports linking Zicam and anos
mia and stated that zinc gluconate’s safety was well established,
when it had evidence of a biological link between Zicam’s key ingre
dient and anosmia and had conducted no studies to disprove that
link. Pp. 16–19.
(c) Respondents have also adequately pleaded scienter, “ ‘a mental
state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,’ ” Tellabs,
Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319. This Court
assumes, without deciding, that the scienter requirement may be sat
isfied by a showing of deliberate recklessness. Under the Private Se
curities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, a complaint adequately pleads
scienter “only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of sci
enter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one
could draw from the facts alleged.” Id., at 324. Matrixx’s proposed
bright-line rule requiring an allegation of statistical significance to
establish a strong inference of scienter is once again flawed. The
complaint’s allegations, “taken collectively,” give rise to a “cogent and
compelling” inference that Matrixx elected not to disclose adverse
event reports not because it believed they were meaningless but be
cause it understood their likely effect on the market. Id., at 323, 324.
“[A] reasonable person” would deem the inference that Matrixx acted
with deliberate recklessness “at least as compelling as any [plausible]
opposing inference.” Id., at 324. Pp. 19–22.
585 F. 3d 1167, affirmed.
SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
