MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO
Opinion of the Court

These allegations, “taken collectively,” give rise to a
“cogent and compelling” inference that Matrixx elected not
to disclose the reports of adverse events not because it
believed they were meaningless but because it understood
their likely effect on the market. Tellabs, 551 U. S., at
323, 324. “[A] reasonable person” would deem the infer­
ence that Matrixx acted with deliberate recklessness (or
even intent) “at least as compelling as any opposing infer­
ence one could draw from the facts alleged.” Id., at 324.
We conclude, in agreement with the Court of Appeals, that
respondents have adequately pleaded scienter. Whether
respondents can ultimately prove their allegations and
establish scienter is an altogether different question.
