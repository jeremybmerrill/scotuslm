Opinion of the Court

cam’s safety or that any of the defendants profited or
attempted to profit from Matrixx’s public statements.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.
The Court of Appeals reversed. 585 F. 3d 1167 (CA9
2009). Noting that “ ‘[t]he determination [of materiality]
requires delicate assessments of the inferences a “reason­

585 F. 3d, at 1179, 1180. Turning to scienter, the Court of

departure from the standards of ordinary care,’ ” giving
rise to a strong inference of scienter. Id., at 1183.
We granted certiorari, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), and we now
affirm.
