Opinion of the Court

factors in assessing causation.” Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 12. Statistically significant data are not
always available. For example, when an adverse event is
subtle or rare, “an inability to obtain a data set of appro­
priate quality or quantity may preclude a finding of statis­
tical significance.” Id., at 15; see also Brief for Medical
Researchers as Amici Curiae 11. Moreover, ethical con­
siderations may prohibit researchers from conducting
randomized clinical trials to confirm a suspected causal
link for the purpose of obtaining statistically significant
data. See id., at 10–11.
A lack of statistically significant data does not mean
that medical experts have no reliable basis for inferring a
causal link between a drug and adverse events. As Ma­
trixx itself concedes, medical experts rely on other evi­
dence to establish an inference of causation. See Brief for
Petitioners 44–45, n. 22.7 We note that courts frequently
permit expert testimony on causation based on evidence
other than statistical significance. See, e.g., Best v. Lowe’s
Home Centers, Inc., 563 F. 3d 171, 178 (CA6 2009); West
berry v. Gislaved Gummi AB, 178 F. 3d 257, 263–264 (CA4
1999) (citing cases); Wells v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.,
788 F. 2d 741, 744–745 (CA11 1986). We need not con­
sider whether the expert testimony was properly admitted
in those cases, and we do not attempt to define here what
constitutes reliable evidence of causation. It suffices to

and its amici list as relevant factors the strength of the
association between the drug and the adverse effects; a temporal
relationship between exposure and the adverse event; consistency
across studies; biological plausibility; consideration of alternative
explanations; specificity (i.e., whether the specific chemical is associ­
ated with the specific disease); the dose-response relationship; and the
clinical and pathological characteristics of the event. Brief for Petition­
ers 44–45, n. 22; Brief for Consumer Healthcare Products Assn. et al. as
Amici Curiae 12–13. These factors are similar to the factors the FDA
considers in taking action against pharmaceutical products. See infra,
at 13–14.
