Opinion of the Court

the complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk to
the commercial viability of Matrixx’s leading product.
It is substantially likely that a reasonable investor
would have viewed this information “ ‘as having signifi­
cantly altered the “total mix” of information made avail­
able.’ ” Basic, 485 U. S., at 232 (quoting TSC Industries,
426 U. S., at 449). Matrixx told the market that revenues
were going to rise 50 and then 80 percent. Assuming the
complaint’s allegations to be true, however, Matrixx had
information indicating a significant risk to its leading
revenue-generating product. Matrixx also stated that
reports indicating that Zicam caused anosmia were “ ‘com­
pletely unfounded and misleading’ ” and that “ ‘the safety
and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treatment of symp­
toms related to the common cold have been well estab­
lished.’ ” App. 77a–78a. Importantly, however, Matrixx
had evidence of a biological link between Zicam’s key
ingredient and anosmia, and it had not conducted any
studies of its own to disprove that link. In fact, as Matrixx
later revealed, the scientific evidence at that time was
“ ‘insufficient . . . to determine if zinc gluconate, when used
as recommended, affects a person’s ability to smell.’ ” Id.,
at 82a.
Assuming the facts to be true, these were material facts
“necessary in order to make the statements made, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.” 17 CFR §240.10b–5(b). We therefore
affirm the Court of Appeals’ holding that respondents
adequately pleaded the element of a material misrepre­
sentation or omission.

Matrixx also argues that respondents failed to allege
facts plausibly suggesting that it acted with the required
level of scienter. “To establish liability under §10(b) and
Rule 10b–5, a private plaintiff must prove that the defen­
