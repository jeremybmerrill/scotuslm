Opinion of the Court

2 statement.
On February 19, 2004, Matrixx filed a Form 8–K with
the SEC stating that it had “ ‘convened a two-day meeting
of physicians and scientists to review current information
on smell disorders’ ” in response to Dr. Jafek’s presenta­
tion. Id., at 82a. According to the Form 8–K, “ ‘In the
opinion of the panel, there is insufficient scientific evi­
dence at this time to determine if zinc gluconate, when
used as recommended, affects a person’s ability to smell.’ ”
Ibid. A few weeks later, a reporter quoted Matrixx as

Act and SEC Rule 10b–5 by making untrue statements of
fact and failing to disclose material facts necessary to
make the statements not misleading in an effort to main­
tain artificially high prices for Matrixx securities.

(CA2 2000), it held that respondents had not alleged a
“statistically significant correlation between the use of
Zicam and anosmia so as to make failure to public[ly]
disclose complaints and the University of Colorado study a
material omission.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a. The Dis­
trict Court similarly agreed that respondents had not
stated with particularity facts giving rise to a strong
inference of scienter. See 15 U. S. C. A. §78u–4(b)(2)(A)
(Feb. 2011 Supp.). It noted that the complaint failed to
allege that Matrixx disbelieved its statements about Zi­
