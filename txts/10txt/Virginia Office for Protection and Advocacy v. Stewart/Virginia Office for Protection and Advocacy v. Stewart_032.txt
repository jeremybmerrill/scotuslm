ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

then scores of state entities now “suddenly possess the
authority to pursue Ex parte Young actions against other
state officials” in federal court. Reinhard, supra, at 124.
There would be no Eleventh Amendment impediment to
such suits. Given the number of state agencies across the
country that enjoy independent litigating authority, see,
e.g., Brief for State of Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 11–
13, the Court’s decision today could potentially lead to all
sorts of litigation in federal courts addressing internal
state government disputes.
And there is also no reason to think that the Court’s
holding is limited to state agency plaintiffs. According to
the Court’s basic rationale, state officials who enjoy some
level of independence could as a matter of federal law
bring suit against other state officials in federal court.
Disputes that were formerly resolved in state cabinet
rooms may now appear on the dockets of federal courts.

No one questions the continued vitality or importance of
the doctrine announced in Ex parte Young. But Ex parte
Young was about affording relief to a private party against
unconstitutional state action. It was not about resolving

Our decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419
(1793)—permitting States to be sued by private parties in
federal court—“created such a shock of surprise” through
out the country “that the Eleventh Amendment was at
once proposed and adopted.” Principality of Monaco v.
Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325 (1934). It is fair to say that
today’s decision will probably not trigger a similar re
sponse. But however much their practical functions and
prominence may have changed in the past 218 years, the
States remain a vital element of our political structure.
Sovereign immunity ensures that States retain a stature
