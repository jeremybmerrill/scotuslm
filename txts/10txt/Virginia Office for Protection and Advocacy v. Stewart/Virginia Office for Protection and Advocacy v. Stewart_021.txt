KENNEDY, J., concurring

to a general principle that the National Government can
condition receipt of funds on the State’s agreement to
make far-reaching changes with respect to its governmen
tal structure or its basic policies of governance in matters
within its special competence. Assuming, as the Court
must, that the statutes here are constitutional, the narrow
question is whether VOPA may rely on Young to avoid the
sovereign immunity bar.
One might doubt whether the constitutional question
may be so severed from the Young analysis. The Court
wields Young in the name of the Supremacy Clause only to
vindicate important federal rights. Perhaps this Court
should not extend the fiction in the name of claims that
may rest on unconstitutional foundations. This concern is
misplaced. The canon of constitutional avoidance directs
courts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that pre
serves its validity, but the specter of a statute’s unconsti
tutionality cannot be permitted to distort the antecedent
question of jurisdiction. Courts interpret and evaluate a
statute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate
the case before them. To decline to adjudicate a federal
right for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect
to invalidate the right in the quest to save it. The Court
should not permit the commission of acts that violate a
federal right on the mere suspicion that Congress acted
beyond its authority. Because the suit must be assumed
to vindicate the Supremacy Clause and poses no serious
affront to state sovereignty in light of the options available
to the State under the program, it may proceed.
With these observations, I join the Court’s opinion.
