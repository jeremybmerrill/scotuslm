ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

at 106. In Alden, we held that state sovereign immunity prohibited Congress from authorizing “private suits
against nonconsenting States in their own courts.” 527
U. S., at 749. We explained that such power would permit
one branch of state government, the “State’s own courts,”
“to coerce the other branches of the State” and “to turn the
State against itself.” Ibid.
Here the Court goes further: this suit features a state
agency on one side, and state executive officials on the
other. The objection in Alden was that the Federal Gov
ernment could force the State to defend itself before itself.
Here extending Young forces the State to defend itself
against itself in federal court.
Both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of
the Commonwealth of Virginia. Petitioner claims the title
of “The Commonwealth of Virginia” in its complaint, App.
10; respondents are state officials acting in an official
capacity. Whatever the decision in the litigation, one
thing is clear: The Commonwealth will win. And the
Commonwealth will lose. Because of today’s holding, a
federal judge will resolve which part of the Common
wealth will prevail.
Virginia has not consented to such a suit in federal
court; rather, petitioner has unilaterally determined that
this intramural dispute should be resolved in that forum.
This is precisely what sovereign immunity is supposed to
guard against. See ante, at 10 (“The specific indignity
against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to
a State of being haled into court without its consent”).
That indignity is compounded when the State is haled into
federal court so that a federal judge can decide an internal
state dispute.
The Court is wrong to suggest that Virginia has no
sovereign interest in determining where such disputes will
be resolved. See ante, at 10–11, and n. 6. It is one thing
for a State to decide that its components may sue one
