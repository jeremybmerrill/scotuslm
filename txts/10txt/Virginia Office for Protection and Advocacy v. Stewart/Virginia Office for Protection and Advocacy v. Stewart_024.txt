ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Young, supra, at 159–160.1
While we have consistently acknowledged the important
role Ex parte Young plays in “promot[ing] the vindication
of federal rights,” we have been cautious not to give that
decision “an expansive interpretation.” Pennhurst State
School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 105, 102
(1984). Indeed, the history of our Ex parte Young juris
prudence has largely been focused on ensuring that this
narrow exception is “narrowly construed,” 465 U. S., at
114, n. 25. We have, for example, held that the fiction of
Ex parte Young does not extend to suits where the plaintiff
seeks retroactive relief, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651,
678 (1974); where the claimed violations are based on
state law, Pennhurst, supra, at 106; where the federal law
violation is no longer “ongoing,” Green v. Mansour, 474
U. S. 64, 71 (1985); “where Congress has prescribed a
detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a
State” of the claimed federal right, Seminole Tribe, supra,
at 74; and where “special sovereignty interests” are impli
cated, Coeur d’Alene Tribe, supra, at 281.
We recently stated that when “determining whether the
doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amend
ment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a straightfor
ward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an
ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly
characterized as prospective.” Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public
Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 645 (2002) (internal
quotation marks omitted). But not every plaintiff who
complies with these prerequisites will be able to bring suit
under Ex parte Young. Indeed, in Verizon itself the Court
went beyond its so-called straightforward inquiry in con
——————
1 Ex parte Young also rests on the “well-recognized irony that an offi
cial’s unconstitutional conduct constitutes state action under the
Fourteenth Amendment but not the Eleventh Amendment.” Pennhurst
State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 105 (1984)
(internal quotation marks omitted).
