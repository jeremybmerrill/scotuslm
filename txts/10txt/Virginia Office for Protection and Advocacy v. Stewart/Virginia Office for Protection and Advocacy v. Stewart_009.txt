VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY
v. STEWART
Opinion of the Court

tion by initiating an enforcement action in state court, the
Circuit Court held him in contempt and committed him to
federal custody. In his habeas corpus application in this
Court, Young challenged his confinement by arguing that
Minnesota’s sovereign immunity deprived the federal
court of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his
official duties.
We disagreed. We explained that because an unconsti
tutional legislative enactment is “void,” a state official who
enforces that law “comes into conflict with the superior
authority of [the] Constitution,” and therefore is “stripped
of his official or representative character and is subjected
in his person to the consequences of his individual con
duct. The State has no power to impart to him any immu
nity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the
United States.” 209 U. S., at 159–160.
This doctrine has existed alongside our sovereign
immunity jurisprudence for more than a century, accepted
as necessary to “permit the federal courts to vindicate
federal rights.” Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 105. It rests on
the premise—less delicately called a “fiction,” id., at 114,
n. 25—that when a federal court commands a state official
to do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law,
he is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes. The
doctrine is limited to that precise situation, and does not
apply “when ‘the state is the real, substantial party in
interest,’ ” id., at 101 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Depart
ment of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459, 464 (1945)), as
when the “ ‘judgment sought would expend itself on the
public treasury or domain, or interfere with public ad
ministration,’ ” 465 U. S., at 101, n. 11 (quoting Dugan v.
Rank, 372 U. S. 609, 620 (1963)).
