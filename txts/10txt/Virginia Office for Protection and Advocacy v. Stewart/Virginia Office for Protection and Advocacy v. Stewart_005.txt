VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY
v. STEWART
Opinion of the Court

and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act
(PAIMI Act), 100 Stat. 478, 42 U. S. C. §10801 et seq.,
increases that separate funding and extends the mission
of P&A systems to include the mentally ill. §§10802(2),
10803, 10827. At present, every State accepts funds under
these statutes.
Under the DD and PAIMI Acts, a P&A system must
have certain powers. The system “shall . . . have the
authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect . . .
if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is
probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.”
§15043(a)(2)(B); §10805(a)(1)(A). Subject to certain statu
tory requirements, it must be given access to “all records”
of individuals who may have been abused, see
§15043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II); §10805(a)(4)(B)(iii), as well as
“other records that are relevant to conducting an investi
gation,” §15043(a)(2)(J)(i). The Acts also require that a
P&A system have authority to “pursue legal, administra
tive, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to
ensure the protection of” its charges. §15043(a)(2)(A)(i);
see §10805(a)(1)(B). And in addition to pressing its own
rights, a P&A system may “pursue administrative, legal,
and other remedies on behalf of” those it protects.
§10805(a)(1)(C); see §15044(b).
A participating State is free to appoint either a state
agency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&A system.
§15044(a); §10805(c)(1)(B). But in either case, the desig
nated entity must have certain structural features that
ensure its independence from the State’s government. The
DD Act prohibits the Governor from appointing more than
one-third of the members of the system’s governing board,
§15044(a)(2), and restricts the State’s ability to impose
hiring freezes or other measures that would impair the
system’s ability to carry out its mission, §15043(a)(2)(K).
Once a State designates an entity as its P&A system, it
may not change its selection without “good cause.”
