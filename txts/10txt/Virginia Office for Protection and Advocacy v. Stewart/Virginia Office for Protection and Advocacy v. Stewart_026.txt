ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

property rights in certain submerged lands. 521 U. S., at
281–283.
As we explained in Papasan v. Allain, 478 U. S. 265
(1986), there are “certain types of cases that formally meet
the Young requirements of a state official acting inconsis
tently with federal law but that stretch that case too far
and would upset the balance of federal and state interests
that it embodies.” Id., at 277. This is one of those cases.
In refusing to extend Ex parte Young to claims that
involve “special sovereignty interests,” the Court in Coeur
d’Alene Tribe warned against a rote application of the Ex
parte Young fiction:
“To interpret Young to permit a federal-court action
to proceed in every case where prospective declaratory
and injunctive relief is sought against an officer,
named in his individual capacity, would be to adhere
to an empty formalism and to undermine the principle
. . . that Eleventh Amendment immunity represents a
real limitation on a federal court’s federal-question ju
risdiction. The real interests served by the Eleventh
Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary me
chanics of captions and pleading. Application of the
Young exception must reflect a proper understanding
of its role in our federal system and respect for state
courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fic
tion.” 521 U. S., at 270.
B
It is undisputed that petitioner’s complaint alleges an
ongoing violation of federal law by a state official and
seeks only prospective relief. If this were a “traditional Ex
parte Young action,” Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73, peti
tioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under
that case. This, however, is anything but a traditional
case—and petitioner is anything but a typical Ex parte
Young plaintiff.
