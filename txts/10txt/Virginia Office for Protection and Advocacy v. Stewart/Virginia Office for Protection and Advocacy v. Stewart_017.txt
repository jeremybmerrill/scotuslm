COMMISSIONER, VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT 

OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND DE- 

VELOPMENTAL SERVICES, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[April 19, 2011] 


JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring.
Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), recognized a
narrow limitation on state sovereign immunity, permitting
railroad stockholders to enjoin enforcement of unconsti
tutional rate regulations. That negative injunction was
nothing more than the pre-emptive assertion in equity of a
defense that would otherwise have been available in the
State’s enforcement proceedings at law. Id., at 165–166;
see also Harrison, Ex Parte Young, 60 Stan. L. Rev. 989,
997–999 (2008).
The Court has expanded the Young exception far beyond
its original office in order “to vindicate the federal interest
in assuring the supremacy of [federal] law,” Green v.
Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985), but not without careful
attention in each case to the sovereign interests of the
State. See Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of
Md., 535 U. S. 635, 649 (2002) (KENNEDY, J., concurring).
In Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974), for example,
the Court applied the exception to an affirmative prospec
tive order but not to equitable restitution, for the latter
was too similar to an award of damages against the State.
