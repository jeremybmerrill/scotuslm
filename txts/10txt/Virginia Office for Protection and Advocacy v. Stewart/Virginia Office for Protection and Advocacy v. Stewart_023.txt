VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY
v. STEWART 

ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting


ana, 134 U. S. 1, 13 (1890) (“ ‘It is inherent in the nature of
sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual
without its consent’ ” (quoting The Federalist No. 81 (A.
Hamilton))). “The preeminent purpose of state sovereign
immunity is to accord States the dignity that is consistent
with their status as sovereign entities.” Federal Maritime
Comm’n, supra, at 760. Accordingly, any time a State is
haled into federal court against its will, “the dignity and
respect afforded [that] State, which [sovereign] immunity
is designed to protect, are placed in jeopardy.” Idaho v.
Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 268 (1997).
The immunity does not turn on whether relief will be
awarded; “[t]he Eleventh Amendment is concerned not
only with the States’ ability to withstand suit, but with
their privilege not to be sued.” Puerto Rico Aqueduct and
Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139,
147, n. 5 (1993). See Federal Maritime Comm’n, supra, at
769 (“the primary function of sovereign immunity is not to
protect state treasuries, but to afford the States the dig
nity and respect due sovereign entities” (citation omitted)).
Because of the key role state sovereign immunity plays
in our federal system, the Court has recognized only a few
exceptions to that immunity. The sole one relevant here is
the “narrow exception,” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,
517 U. S. 44, 76 (1996), established by our decision in Ex
parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). In Ex parte Young, the
Court held that private litigants could seek an injunction
in federal court against a state official, prohibiting him
from enforcing a state law claimed to violate the Federal
Constitution. See id., at 159–168. As we have often ob
served, Ex parte Young rests on the “obvious fiction,”
Coeur d’Alene Tribe, supra, at 270, that such a suit is not
really against the State, but rather against an individual
who has been “stripped of his official or representative
character” because of his unlawful conduct, Ex parte
