when a private person does so. Moreover, VOPA’s power to sue state
officials is a consequence of Virginia’s own decision to establish a
public P&A system. Not every offense to a State’s dignity constitutes

of past constitutional doubts. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young
exception, a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses

that right, free from any internal state-government veto; such condi
tions rarely coincide. In any event, the principles undergirding the
Ex parte Young doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.
