VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY
v. STEWART
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

commensurate with their role under the Constitution.
Allowing one part of the State to sue another in federal
court, so that a federal judge decides an important dispute
between state officials, undermines state sovereignty in
an unprecedented and direct way. The fiction of Ex parte
Young should not be extended to permit so real an
intrusion.
Because I believe the Courtâ€™s novel expansion of Ex
parte Young is inconsistent with the federal system estab
lished by our Constitution, I respectfully dissent.
