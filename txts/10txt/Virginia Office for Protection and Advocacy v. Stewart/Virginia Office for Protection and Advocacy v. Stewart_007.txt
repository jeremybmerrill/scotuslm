VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY
v. STEWART
Opinion of the Court

VOPA then brought this action in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging
that the DD and PAIMI Acts entitled it to the peer-review
records, notwithstanding any state-law privilege that
might apply. It sought a declaration that respondents’
refusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI
Acts, along with an injunction requiring respondents to
provide access to the records and refrain in the future
from interfering with VOPA’s right of access to them.
Respondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds
that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh
Amendment. The District Court denied the motion. In its
view, the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte
Young, which normally allows federal courts to award
prospective relief against state officials for violations of
federal law. Virginia v. Reinhard, 2008 WL 2795940, *6
(ED Va., July 18, 2008).
The Court of Appeals reversed. Virginia v. Reinhard,
568 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2009). Believing VOPA’s lawsuit to be
an “intramural contest” that “encroaches more severely on
the dignity and sovereignty of the states than an Ex parte
Young action brought by a private plaintiff,” the Court of
Appeals concluded it was not authorized by that case. Id.,
at 119–120 (internal quotation marks omitted).
We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ____ (2010).
