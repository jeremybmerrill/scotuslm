Like the Court of Appeals, we are mindful of the central
role autonomous States play in our federal system, and
wary of approving new encroachments on their sover
eignty. But we conclude no such encroachment is occa

to VOPA’s ability to invoke federal jurisdiction on the
same terms as any other litigant.
We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and
remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.

here).
