VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY
v. STEWART
ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Unlike the plaintiffs in Ex parte Young—and, for that
matter, unlike any other plaintiff that has ever sought to
invoke Ex parte Young before this Court—petitioner is a
state agency seeking to sue officials of the same State in
federal court. The Court is troubled by this novelty, ante
at 12–13, but not enough. See Free Enterprise Fund v.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___,
___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (“Perhaps the most telling indi
cation of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of
historical precedent” (internal quotation marks omitted));
cf. Alden, 527 U. S., at 743–745; Printz v. United States,
521 U. S. 898, 905–910, 918, 925 (1997). This is especially
true in light of the “presumption” we articulated more
than 120 years ago in Hans v. Louisiana, that States are
immune from suits that would have been “anomalous and
unheard of when the Constitution was adopted.” Hans,
134 U. S., at 18; see also Alden, supra, at 727 (invoking
presumption).
Accordingly, when determining whether to lift the bar of
sovereign immunity, we have “attribute[d] great signifi
cance” to the absence of analogous suits “at the time of the
founding or for many years thereafter.” Federal Maritime
Comm’n, 535 U. S., at 755. This sort of suit was not only
anomalous and unheard of at the time of the founding; it
was anomalous and unheard of yesterday. The Hans
presumption applies here with full force.
The Court speculates that these suits have not previ
ously arisen because the necessary conditions—state
agencies pursuing a federal right free of internal state
veto—are themselves novel. See ante, at 12; see also ante,
at 3–4 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Even if true, that sim
ply highlights the fact that this case is not suitable for
mere rote application of Ex parte Young.
In addition to its novel character, petitioner’s complaint
“conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that
underlie the Eleventh Amendment.” Pennhurst, 465 U. S.,
