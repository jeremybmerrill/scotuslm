Opinion of the Court

§15043(a)(4)(A).
Virginia is one of just eight States that have designated
a government entity as their P&A system. The Virginia
Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an “inde
pendent state agency.” Va. Code Ann. §51.5–39.2(A)
(Lexis 2009). Its board consists of eleven “nonlegislative
citizen members,” of whom only three are appointed by
the Governor. §51.5–39.2(B). The remaining eight are
appointed by components of the legislature: five by the
Speaker of the House of Delegates, and three by the Sen
ate Committee on Rules. Ibid. VOPA itself nominates
candidates for consideration, and the statute instructs the
appointing officials that they “shall seriously consider the
persons nominated and appoint such persons whenever
feasible.” Ibid. Board members serve for fixed terms and
are removable only by a court and only for specified rea
sons. See §51.5–39.2(C) and (F); §24.2–233 and 234 (Lexis
2006).
VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive
branch oversight. It operates independently of the Attor
ney General of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who
are statutorily authorized to sue on VOPA’s behalf. §51.5–
39.2(A); §2.2–510(5) (Lexis 2008). And Virginia law spe
cifically empowers VOPA to “initiate any proceedings to
secure the rights” of disabled individuals. §51.5–39.2(A).
B
In 2006, VOPA opened an investigation into the deaths
of two patients and injuries to a third at state-run mental
hospitals. It asked respondents—state officials in charge
of those institutions—to produce any records related to
risk-management or mortality reviews conducted by the
hospitals with respect to those patients. Respondents
refused, asserting that the records were protected by a
state-law privilege shielding medical peer-review materi
als from disclosure.
