Opinion of the Court

ment in the famous case of Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall.
419 (1793), which involved a suit against a State by a
noncitizen of the State. Since Hans v. Louisiana, 134
U. S. 1 (1890), however, we have understood the Eleventh
Amendment to confirm the structural understanding that
States entered the Union with their sovereign immunity
intact, unlimited by Article III’s jurisdictional grant.
Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779
(1991); see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal
derman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984). Our cases hold that the
States have retained their traditional immunity from suit,
“except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain
constitutional amendments.” Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S.
706, 713 (1999). A State may waive its sovereign immu
nity at its pleasure, College Savings Bank v. Florida Pre
paid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675–
676 (1999), and in some circumstances Congress may
abrogate it by appropriate legislation.2 But absent waiver
or valid abrogation, federal courts may not entertain a
private person’s suit against a State.

In Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, we established an
important limit on the sovereign-immunity principle.
That case involved a challenge to a Minnesota law reduc
ing the freight rates that railroads could charge. A rail
road shareholder claimed that the new rates were un
constitutionally confiscatory, and obtained a federal
injunction against Edward Young, the Attorney General of
Minnesota, forbidding him in his official capacity to en
force the state law. Perkins v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 155
F. 445 (CC Minn. 1907). When Young violated the injunc

have recognized that Congress may abrogate a State’s immunity
when it acts under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Seminole Tribe of
Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 59 (1996), but not when it acts under its
original Article I authority to regulate commerce, id., at 65–66.
