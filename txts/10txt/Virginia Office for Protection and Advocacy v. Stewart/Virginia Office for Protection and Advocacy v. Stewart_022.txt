COMMISSIONER, VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT

VELOPMENTAL SERVICES, ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[April 19, 2011] 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO
joins, dissenting.
Today the Court holds that a state agency may sue
officials acting on behalf of the State in federal court. This
has never happened before. In order to reach this unset
tling result, the Court extends the fiction of Ex parte
Young—what we have called an “empty formalism”—well
beyond the circumstances of that case. Because I cannot
subscribe to such a substantial and novel expansion of
what we have also called “a narrow exception” to a State’s
sovereign immunity, I respectfully dissent.

Eleventh Amendment, “[a]n integral component of that
residuary and inviolable sovereignty” is the States’ “im
