KENNEDY, J., dissenting

of Melendez-Diaz are sure to be forthcoming.
In the meantime, New Mexico’s experience exemplifies
the problems ahead. From 2008 to 2010, subpoenas re
quiring New Mexico analysts to testify in impaired-driving
cases rose 71%, to 1,600—or 8 or 9 every workday. New
Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2. In a State that is the
Nation’s fifth largest by area and that employs just 10
total analysts, id., at 3, each analyst in blood alcohol cases
recently received 200 subpoenas per year, id., at 33. The
analysts now must travel great distances on most working
days. The result has been, in the laboratory’s words,
“chaotic.” Id., at 5. And if the defense raises an objection
and the analyst is tied up in another court proceeding; or
on leave; or absent; or delayed in transit; or no longer
employed; or ill; or no longer living, the defense gets a
windfall. As a result, good defense attorneys will object in
ever-greater numbers to a prosecution failure or inability
to produce laboratory analysts at trial. The concomitant
increases in subpoenas will further impede the state labo
ratory’s ability to keep pace with its obligations. Scarce
state resources could be committed to other urgent needs
in the criminal justice system.

Seven years after its initiation, it bears remembering
that the Crawford approach was not preordained. This
Court’s missteps have produced an interpretation of the
word “witness” at odds with its meaning elsewhere in the
Constitution, including elsewhere in the Sixth Amend
ment, see Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84
Geo. L. J. 641, 647, 691–696 (1996), and at odds with
the sound administration of justice. It is time to return
to solid ground. A proper place to begin that return is to
decline to extend Melendez-Diaz to bar the reliable, com
monsense evidentiary framework the State sought to
follow in this case.
