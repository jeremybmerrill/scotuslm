Opinion of the Court

the defendant’s right of confrontation under the Sixth
Amendment.” Ibid.
In light of Melendez-Diaz, the New Mexico Supreme
Court acknowledged that the blood-alcohol report intro­
duced at Bullcoming’s trial qualified as testimonial evi­
dence. Like the affidavits in Melendez-Diaz, the court
observed, the report was “functionally identical to live, in­
court testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on
direct examination.” 226 P. 3d, at 8 (quoting MelendezDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)).4 Nevertheless, for
two reasons, the court held that admission of the report
did not violate the Confrontation Clause.
First, the court said certifying analyst Caylor “was a
mere scrivener,” who “simply transcribed the results gen­
erated by the gas chromatograph machine.” 226 P. 3d,
at 8–9. Second, SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not
participate in testing Bullcoming’s blood, “qualified as
an expert witness with respect to the gas chromatograph
machine.” Id., at 9. “Razatos provided live, in-court tes­
timony,” the court stated, “and, thus, was available for
cross-examination regarding the operation of the . . . ma­
chine, the results of [Bullcoming’s] BAC test, and the
SLD’s established laboratory procedures.” Ibid. Razatos’
testimony was crucial, the court explained, because Bull­
coming could not cross-examine the machine or the writ­
ten report. Id., at 10. But “[Bullcoming’s] right of con­
frontation was preserved,” the court concluded, because
Razatos was a qualified analyst, able to serve as a surro­
gate for Caylor. Ibid.
We granted certiorari to address this question: Does the
Confrontation Clause permit the prosecution to introduce

so ruling, the New Mexico Supreme Court explicitly overruled
State v. Dedman, 2004–NMSC–037, 102 P. 3d 628 (2004), which had
classified blood-alcohol reports as public records neither “investigative
nor prosecutorial” in nature. 226 P. 3d, at 7–8.
