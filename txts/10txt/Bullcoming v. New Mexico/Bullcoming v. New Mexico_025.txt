BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part

of analysis,” completed by employees of the State Labora­
tory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health, id., at ___ (slip op., at 2), were testimonial because
they were “incontrovertibly . . . ‘ “solemn declaration[s] or
affirmation[s] made for the purpose of establishing or
proving some fact,” ’ ” id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting
Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 51 (2004), in turn
quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the
English Language (1828)).
As we explained earlier this Term in Michigan v. Bry
ant, 562 U. S. ___ (2010), “[i]n making the primary pur­
pose determination, standard rules of hearsay . . . will be
relevant.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11–12).1 As applied to a
scientific report, Melendez-Diaz explained that pursuant
to Federal Rule of Evidence 803, “[d]ocuments kept in the
regular course of business may ordinarily be admitted at
trial despite their hearsay status,” except “if the regularly
conducted business activity is the production of evidence
for use at trial.” 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15–16)

hearsay rules bar admission of even business records. Re­
latedly, in the Confrontation Clause context, business
and public records “are generally admissible absent con­
frontation . . . because—having been created for the ad­
ministration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose
of establishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not
testimonial.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
18). We concluded, therefore, that because the purpose of
the certificates of analysis was use at trial, they were not

1 Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, Bryant deemed reliabil­
ity, as reflected in the hearsay rules, to be “relevant,” 562 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 11–12), not “essential,” post, at 5 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).
The rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause, are designed
primarily to police reliability; the purpose of the Confrontation Clause
is to determine whether statements are testimonial and therefore re­
quire confrontation.
