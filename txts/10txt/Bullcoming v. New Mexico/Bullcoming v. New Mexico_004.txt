BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO
Syllabus
certificates, Caylor’s report here is “formalized” in a signed document,
Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n. 2. Also noteworthy, the SLD report form
contains a legend referring to municipal and magistrate courts’ rules
that provide for the admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.
Thus, although the SLD report was not notarized, the formalities at
tending the report were more than adequate to qualify Caylor’s as
sertions as testimonial. Pp. 14–16.

GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV
and footnote 6. SCALIA, J., joined that opinion in full, SOTOMAYOR and

but Part IV and footnote 6. SOTOMAYOR, J., filed an opinion concurring
in part. KENNEDY, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which ROBERTS,
C. J., and BREYER and ALITO, JJ., joined.
