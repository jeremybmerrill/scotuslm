BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

render a scientific report admissible under the Court’s
approach. Melendez-Diaz stated an inflexible rule: Where
“analysts’ affidavits” included “testimonial statements,”
defendants were “entitled to be confronted with the ana
lysts” themselves. 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (inter
nal quotation marks omitted). Now, the Court reveals,
this rule is either less clear than it first appeared or too
strict to be followed. A report is admissible, today’s opin
ion states, if a “live witness competent to testify to the
truth of the statements made in the report” appears. Ante,
at 1. Such witnesses include not just the certifying ana
lyst, but also any “scientist who . . . perform[ed] or ob
serve[d] the test reported in the certification.” Ante, at 2.
Today’s majority is not committed in equal shares to a
common set of principles in applying the holding of Craw
ford. Compare Davis, supra (opinion for the Court by
SCALIA, J.), with id., at 834 (THOMAS, J., concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part); and Bryant,
supra, (opinion for the Court by SOTOMAYOR, J.), with id.,
at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), and id., at
___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and id., at ___ (GINSBURG, J.,
dissenting); and ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (opinion of the
Court), with ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (SOTOMAYOR, J.,
concurring). That the Court in the wake of Crawford has
had such trouble fashioning a clear vision of that case’s
meaning is unsettling; for Crawford binds every judge in
every criminal trial in every local, state, and federal court
in the Nation. This Court’s prior decisions leave trial
judges to “guess what future rules this Court will distill
from the sparse constitutional text,” Melendez-Diaz, supra,
at ___ (slip op., at 2) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), or to strug
gle to apply an “amorphous, if not entirely subjective,”
“highly context-dependent inquiry” involving “open-ended
balancing.” Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15–16)
(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted)
(listing 11 factors relevant under the majority’s approach).
