KENNEDY, J., dissenting

II
The protections in the Confrontation Clause, and indeed
the Sixth Amendment in general, are designed to ensure
a fair trial with reliable evidence. But the Crawford v.
Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), line of cases has treated
the reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it. Id., at
61–62. Today, for example, the Court bars admission of a
lab report because it “is formalized in a signed document.”
Ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
Court’s unconventional and unstated premise is that
the State—by acting to ensure a statement’s reliability—
makes the statement more formal and therefore less likely
to be admitted. Park, Is Confrontation the Bottom Line?
19 Regent U. L. Rev. 459, 461 (2007). That is so, the
Court insists, because reliability does not animate the
Confrontation Clause. Ante, at 11; Melendez-Diaz, supra,
at ___ (slip op., at 11–12); Crawford, supra, at 61–62. Yet
just this Term the Court ruled that, in another confronta
tion context, reliability was an essential part of the consti
tutional inquiry. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___,
___–___, ___–___ (2010) (slip op., at 11–12, 14–15).
Like reliability, other principles have weaved in and out
of the Crawford jurisprudence. Solemnity has sometimes
been dispositive, see Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 6); id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (THOMAS, J., concur
ring), and sometimes not, see Davis, 547 U. S., at 834–837,
841 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part). So, too, with the elusive distinction
between utterances aimed at proving past events, and
those calculated to help police keep the peace. Compare
Davis, supra, and Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at
24–30), with id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–9) (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting).
It is not even clear which witnesses’ testimony could
