SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part

rationales are incorrect. Ante, at 9–13. Therefore, the
New Mexico court contravened our precedents in holding
that the report was admissible via Razatos’ testimony.
II
Although this case is materially indistinguishable from
the facts we considered in Melendez-Diaz, I highlight
some of the factual circumstances that this case does not
present.
First, this is not a case in which the State suggested an
alternate purpose, much less an alternate primary pur­
pose, for the BAC report. For example, the State has not
claimed that the report was necessary to provide Bullcom­
ing with medical treatment. See Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ ,
n. 9 (slip op., at 15, n. 9) (listing “Statements for Purposes
of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment” under Federal Rule of
Evidence 803(4) as an example of statements that are
“by their nature, made for a purpose other than use in a
prosecution”); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip
op., at 6, n. 2) (“[M]edical reports created for treatment
purposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision
today”); Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 376 (2008)
(“[S]tatements to physicians in the course of receiving
treatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay
rules”).
Second, this is not a case in which the person testifying
is a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal,
albeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.
Razatos conceded on cross-examination that he played no
role in producing the BAC report and did not observe any
portion of Curtis Caylor’s conduct of the testing. App. 58.
The court below also recognized Razatos’ total lack of
connection to the test at issue. 226 P. 3d, at 6. It would
be a different case if, for example, a supervisor who ob­
served an analyst conducting a test testified about the
results or a report about such results. We need not ad­
