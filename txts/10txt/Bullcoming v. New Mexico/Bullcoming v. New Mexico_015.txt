Opinion of the Court

one who saw the number on the house or gun present the
information in court—so long as that officer was equipped
to testify about any technology the observing officer de­
ployed and the police department’s standard operating
procedures? As our precedent makes plain, the answer is
emphatically “No.” See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.
813, 826 (2006) (Confrontation Clause may not be “evaded
by having a note-taking police[ officer] recite the . . . tes­
timony of the declarant” (emphasis deleted)); MelendezDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dis­
senting) (“The Court made clear in Davis that it will not
permit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter
into evidence through the in-court testimony of a second.”).
The New Mexico Supreme Court stated that the number
registered by the gas chromatograph machine called for
no interpretation or exercise of independent judgment on
Caylor’s part. 226 P. 3d, at 8–9. We have already ex­
plained that Caylor certified to more than a machine­
generated number. See supra, at 3–4. In any event, the
comparative reliability of an analyst’s testimonial report
drawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the
Sixth Amendment bar. This Court settled in Crawford
that the “obviou[s] reliab[ility]” of a testimonial statement
does not dispense with the Confrontation Clause. 541
U. S., at 62; see id., at 61 (Clause “commands, not that
evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a
particular manner: by testing [the evidence] in the cruci­
ble of cross-examination”). Accordingly, the analysts who
write reports that the prosecution introduces must be
made available for confrontation even if they possess “the
scientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of
Mother Teresa.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 6
(slip op., at 14, n. 6).
