KENNEDY, J., dissenting

sites.
Instead of freeing the Clause from reliance on hearsay
doctrines, the Court has now linked the Clause with hear
say rules in their earliest, most rigid, and least refined
formulations. See, e.g., Mosteller, Remaking Confronta
tion Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge
of Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L. Rev.
691, 739–740, 742, 744–746; Gallanis, The Rise of Modern
Evidence Law, 84 Iowa L. Rev. 499, 502–503, 514–515,
533–537 (1999). In cases like Melendez-Diaz and this one,
the Court has tied the Confrontation Clause to 18th cen
tury hearsay rules unleavened by principles tending to
make those rules more sensible. Sklansky, Hearsay’s Last
Hurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 5–6, 36. As a result, the Court
has taken the Clause far beyond its most important ap
plication, which is to forbid sworn, ex parte, out-of-court
statements by unconfronted and available witnesses who
observed the crime and do not appear at trial.
Second, the States are not just at risk of having some of
their hearsay rules reviewed by this Court. They often are
foreclosed now from contributing to the formulation and
enactment of rules that make trials fairer and more reli
able. For instance, recent state laws allowing admission
of well-documented and supported reports of abuse by
women whose abusers later murdered them must give
way, unless that abuser murdered with the specific pur
pose of foreclosing the testimony. Giles v. California, 554
U. S. 353 (2008); Sklansky, supra, at 14–15. Whether
those statutes could provide sufficient indicia of reliability
and other safeguards to comply with the Confrontation
Clause as it should be understood is, to be sure, an open
question. The point is that the States cannot now partici
pate in the development of this difficult part of the law.
In short, there is an ongoing, continued, and systemic
displacement of the States and dislocation of the federal
structure. Cf. Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, ___, ___ (slip
