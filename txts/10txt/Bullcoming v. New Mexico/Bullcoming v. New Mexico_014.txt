BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO
Opinion of the Court

therefore “[was] not subject to the Confrontation Clause”
in the first place. Brief for Respondent 7 (capitalization
omitted).
A
The New Mexico Supreme Court held surrogate testi­
mony adequate to satisfy the Confrontation Clause in
this case because analyst Caylor “simply transcribed the
resul[t] generated by the gas chromatograph machine,”
presenting no interpretation and exercising no independ­
ent judgment. 226 P. 3d, at 8. Bullcoming’s “true ‘ac­
cuser,’ ” the court said, was the machine, while testing
analyst Caylor’s role was that of “mere scrivener.” Id., at
9. Caylor’s certification, however, reported more than a
machine-generated number. See supra, at 3–4.
Caylor certified that he received Bullcoming’s blood
sample intact with the seal unbroken, that he checked to
make sure that the forensic report number and the sample
number “correspond[ed],” and that he performed on Bull­
coming’s sample a particular test, adhering to a precise
protocol. App. 62–65. He further represented, by leaving
the “[r]emarks” section of the report blank, that no “cir­
cumstance or condition . . . affect[ed] the integrity of the
sample or . . . the validity of the analysis.” Id., at 62, 65.
These representations, relating to past events and human
actions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data, are
meet for cross-examination.
The potential ramifications of the New Mexico Supreme
Court’s reasoning, furthermore, raise red flags. Most wit­
nesses, after all, testify to their observations of factual
conditions or events, e.g., “the light was green,” “the hour
was noon.” Such witnesses may record, on the spot, what
they observed. Suppose a police report recorded an objec­
tive fact—Bullcoming’s counsel posited the address above
the front door of a house or the read-out of a radar gun.
