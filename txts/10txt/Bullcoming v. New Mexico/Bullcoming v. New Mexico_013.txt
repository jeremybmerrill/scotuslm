Opinion of the Court

Crawford, 541 U. S., at 68)). Melendez-Diaz, relying on
Crawford’s rationale, refused to create a “forensic evi­
dence” exception to this rule. 557 U. S., at ___–___ (slip
op., at 11–15).5 An analyst’s certification prepared in
connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution,
the Court held, is “testimonial,” and therefore within the
compass of the Confrontation Clause. Id., at ___–___ (slip
op., at 15–18).6
The State in the instant case never asserted that the
analyst who signed the certification, Curtis Caylor, was
unavailable. The record showed only that Caylor was
placed on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason. See
supra, at 5. Nor did Bullcoming have an opportunity
to cross-examine Caylor. Crawford and Melendez-Diaz,
therefore, weigh heavily in Bullcoming’s favor. The New
Mexico Supreme Court, however, although recognizing
that the SLD report was testimonial for purposes of the
Confrontation Clause, considered SLD analyst Razatos an
adequate substitute for Caylor. We explain first why
Razatos’ appearance did not meet the Confrontation
Clause requirement. We next address the State’s argu­
ment that the SLD report ranks as “nontestimonial,” and

5 The dissent makes plain that its objection is less to the application
of the Court’s decisions in Crawford and Melendez-Diaz to this case
than to those pathmarking decisions themselves. See post, at 5 (criti­
cizing the “Crawford line of cases” for rejecting “reliable evidence”);
post, at 8–9, 11 (deploring “Crawford’s rejection of the [reliability­
centered] regime of Ohio v. Roberts”).
6 To rank as “testimonial,” a statement must have a “primary pur­
pose” of “establish[ing] or prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to
later criminal prosecution.” Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 822
(2006). See also Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Elaborating
on the purpose for which a “testimonial report” is created, we observed
in Melendez-Diaz that business and public records “are generally
admissible absent confrontation . . . because—having been created for
the administration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of
establishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not testimonial.”
557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).
