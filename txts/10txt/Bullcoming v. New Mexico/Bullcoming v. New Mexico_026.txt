SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part

properly admissible as business or public records under
the hearsay rules, id., at ___ (slip op., at 15–16), nor were
they admissible under the Confrontation Clause, id., at
___ (slip op., at 18). The hearsay rule’s recognition of the
certificates’ evidentiary purpose thus confirmed our deci­
sion that the certificates were testimonial under the pri­
mary purpose analysis required by the Confrontation
Clause. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (explaining that
under Massachusetts law not just the purpose but the
“sole purpose of the affidavits was to provide” evidence).
Similarly, in this case, for the reasons the Court sets
forth the BAC report and Caylor’s certification on it
clearly have a “primary purpose of creating an out-of-court
substitute for trial testimony.” Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 11). The Court also explains why the BAC
report is not materially distinguishable from the certifi­
cates we held testimonial in Melendez-Diaz. See 557 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 2, 4–5). 2
The formality inherent in the certification further sug­
gests its evidentiary purpose. Although “[f]ormality is not
the sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry,” a
statement’s formality or informality can shed light on
whether a particular statement has a primary purpose
of use at trial. Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). 3

2 This is not to say, however, that every person noted on the BAC
report must testify. As we explained in Melendez-Diaz, it is not the
case “that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the
chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing
device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution’s case . . . . It
is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are
so crucial as to require evidence . . . .” 557 U. S., at ___, n. 1 (slip op.,
at 5, n. 1).
3 By looking to the formality of a statement, we do not “trea[t] the
reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it.” Post, at 5 (KENNEDY, J.,
dissenting). Although in some instances formality could signal reliabil­
ity, the dissent’s argument fails to appreciate that, under our Confron­
tation Clause precedents, formality is primarily an indicator of testi­
