BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO
KENNEDY, J., dissenting

cable to the extension of that doctrine and to the new
ruling in this case, are now explained in support of this
respectful dissent.
I
Before today, the Court had not held that the Confron
tation Clause bars admission of scientific findings when
an employee of the testing laboratory authenticates the
findings, testifies to the laboratory’s methods and prac
