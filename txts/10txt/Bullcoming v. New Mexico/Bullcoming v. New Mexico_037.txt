KENNEDY, J., dissenting

The persistent ambiguities in the Court’s approach are
symptomatic of a rule not amenable to sensible applica
tions. Procedures involving multiple participants illus
trate the problem. In Melendez-Diaz the Court insisted
that its opinion did not require everyone in the chain of
custody to testify but then qualified that “what testimony
is introduced must . . . be introduced live.” 557 U. S.,
at ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 5, n. 1); ante, at 6, n. 2. This
could mean that a statement that evidence remained in
law-enforcement custody is admissible if the statement’s
maker appears in court. If so, an intern at police head
quarters could review the evidence log, declare that chain
of custody was retained, and so testify. The rule could also
be that that the intern’s statement—which draws on
statements in the evidence log—is inadmissible unless
every officer who signed the log appears at trial. That
rule, if applied to this case, would have conditioned admis
sibility of the report on the testimony of three or more
identified witnesses. See App. 62. In other instances, 7 or
even 40 witnesses could be required. See supra, at 3. The
court has thus—in its fidelity to Melendez-Diaz—boxed
itself into a choice of evils: render the Confrontation
Clause pro forma or construe it so that its dictates are
unworkable.

Crawford itself does not compel today’s conclusion. It
is true, as Crawford confirmed, that the Confrontation
Clause seeks in part to bar the government from replicat
ing trial procedures outside of public view. See 541 U. S.,
at 50; Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11–12). Crawford
explained that the basic purpose of the Clause was to
address the sort of abuses exemplified at the notorious
treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. 541 U. S., at 51. On
this view the Clause operates to bar admission of out-of
court statements obtained through formal interrogation in
