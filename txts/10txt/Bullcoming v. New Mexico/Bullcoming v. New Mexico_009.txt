Opinion of the Court

Caylor’s report that Bullcoming’s BAC was 0.21 sup­
ported a prosecution for aggravated DWI, the threshold for
which is a BAC of 0.16 grams per hundred milliliters, §66–
8–102(D)(1). The State accordingly charged Bullcoming
with this more serious crime.

The case was tried to a jury in November 2005, after our
decision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004),
but before Melendez-Diaz. On the day of trial, the State
announced that it would not be calling SLD analyst Curtis
Caylor as a witness because he had “very recently [been]
put on unpaid leave” for a reason not revealed. 2010–
NMSC–007, ¶8, 226 P. 3d 1, 6 (internal quotation marks
omitted); App. 58. A startled defense counsel objected.
The prosecution, she complained, had never disclosed,
until trial commenced, that the witness “out there . . .
[was] not the analyst [of Bullcoming’s sample].” Id., at 46.
Counsel stated that, “had [she] known that the analyst
[who tested Bullcoming’s blood] was not available,” her
opening, indeed, her entire defense “may very well have
been dramatically different.” Id., at 47. The State, how­
ever, proposed to introduce Caylor’s finding as a “business
——————
valid. See McNair 207–214.
Nor is the risk of human error so remote as to be negligible. Amici
inform us, for example, that in neighboring Colorado, a single forensic
laboratory produced at least 206 flawed blood-alcohol readings over a
three-year span, prompting the dismissal of several criminal prosecu­
tions. See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers
et al. as Amici Curiae 32–33. An analyst had used improper amounts
of the internal standard, causing the chromatograph machine system­
atically to inflate BAC measurements. The analyst’s error, a supervi­
sor said, was “fairly complex.” Ensslin, Final Tally on Flawed DUI:
