Opinion of the Court

Because Bullcoming refused to take a breath test, the
police obtained a warrant authorizing a blood-alcohol analy­
sis. Pursuant to the warrant, a sample of Bullcoming’s
blood was drawn at a local hospital. To determine Bull­
coming’s blood-alcohol concentration (BAC), the police
sent the sample to the New Mexico Department of Health,
Scientific Laboratory Division (SLD). In a standard SLD
form titled “Report of Blood Alcohol Analysis,” partici­
pants in the testing were identified, and the forensic ana­
lyst certified his finding. App. 62.
SLD’s report contained in the top block “information . . .
filled in by [the] arresting officer.” Ibid. (capitalization
omitted). This information included the “reason [the]
suspect [was] stopped” (the officer checked “Accident”),
and the date (“8.14.05”) and time (“18:25 PM”) the blood
sample was drawn. Ibid. (capitalization omitted). The
arresting officer also affirmed that he had arrested Bull­
coming and witnessed the blood draw. Ibid. The next two
blocks contained certifications by the nurse who drew
Bullcoming’s blood and the SLD intake employee who
received the blood sample sent to the laboratory. Ibid.
Following these segments, the report presented the
“certificate of analyst,” ibid. (capitalization omitted), com­
pleted and signed by Curtis Caylor, the SLD forensic
analyst assigned to test Bullcoming’s blood sample. Id., at
62, 64–65. Caylor recorded that the BAC in Bullcoming’s
sample was 0.21 grams per hundred milliliters, an inordi­
nately high level. Id., at 62. Caylor also affirmed that
“[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken
in the laboratory,” that “the statements in [the analyst’s
block of the report] are correct,” and that he had “followed
the procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.” Ibid.
Those “procedures” instructed analysts, inter alia, to “re­
tai[n] the sample container and the raw data from the
analysis,” and to “not[e] any circumstance or condition
which might affect the integrity of the sample or otherwise
