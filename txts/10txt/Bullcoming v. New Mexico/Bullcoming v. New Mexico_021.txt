Opinion ofof the CourtJ.

“remains free to . . . . call and examine the technician who
performed a test”), post, at 8 (“free retesting” is available
to defendants). The prosecution, however, bears the bur­
den of proof. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
19) (“[T]he Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the
prosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant
to bring those adverse witnesses into court.”). Hence the
obligation to propel retesting when the original analyst is
unavailable is the State’s, not the defendant’s. See Taylor
v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 410, n. 14 (1988) (Confrontation
Clause’s requirements apply “in every case, whether or not
the defendant seeks to rebut the case against him or to
present a case of his own”).
Furthermore, notice-and-demand procedures, long in ef­

typically “render . . . otherwise hearsay forensic reports
admissible[,] while specifically preserving a defendant’s
right to demand that the prosecution call the author/
analyst of [the] report.” PDS Brief 9; see MelendezDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20) (observing that
notice-and-demand statutes “permit the defendant to
assert (or forfeit by silence) his Confrontation Clause right
after receiving notice of the prosecution’s intent to use a
forensic analyst’s report”).
Even before this Court’s decision in Crawford, moreover,
it was common prosecutorial practice to call the forensic
analyst to testify. Prosecutors did so “to bolster the per­
suasive power of [the State’s] case[,] . . . [even] when the
defense would have preferred that the analyst did not
testify.” PDS Brief 8.
We note also the “small fraction of . . . cases” that “actu­
ally proceed to trial.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 20) (citing estimate that “nearly 95% of convic­
tions in state and federal courts are obtained via guilty
plea”). And, “when cases in which forensic analysis has
