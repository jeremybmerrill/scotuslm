BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO
Opinion of the Court

the certificate”).
III
We turn, finally, to the State’s contention that the SLD’s
blood-alcohol analysis reports are nontestimonial in char­
acter, therefore no Confrontation Clause question even
arises in this case. Melendez-Diaz left no room for that
argument, the New Mexico Supreme Court concluded,
see 226 P. 3d, at 7–8; supra, at 7, a conclusion we find
inescapable.
In Melendez-Diaz, a state forensic laboratory, on police
request, analyzed seized evidence (plastic bags) and re­
ported the laboratory’s analysis to the police (the sub­
stance found in the bags contained cocaine). 557 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 2). The “certificates of analysis” prepared
by the analysts who tested the evidence in Melendez-Diaz,
this Court held, were “incontrovertibly . . . affirmation[s]
made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact”
in a criminal proceeding. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (inter­
nal quotation marks omitted). The same purpose was
served by the certificate in question here.
The State maintains that the affirmations made by
analyst Caylor were not “adversarial” or “inquisitorial,”
Brief for Respondent 27–33; instead, they were simply
observations of an “independent scientis[t]” made “accord­
ing to a non-adversarial public duty,” id., at 32–33. That
argument fares no better here than it did in MelendezDiaz. A document created solely for an “evidentiary pur­
pose,” Melendez-Diaz clarified, made in aid of a police
investigation, ranks as testimonial. 557 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 5) (forensic reports available for use at trial are
“testimonial statements” and certifying analyst is a
“ ‘witness’ for purposes of the Sixth Amendment”).
Distinguishing Bullcoming’s case from Melendez-Diaz,
where the analysts’ findings were contained in certificates
“sworn to before a notary public,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 2),
