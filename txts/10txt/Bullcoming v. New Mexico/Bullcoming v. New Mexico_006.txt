BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO
Opinion of the Court

laboratory’s testing procedures, but had neither partici­
pated in nor observed the test on Bullcoming’s blood sam­
ple. The New Mexico Supreme Court determined that,
although the blood-alcohol analysis was “testimonial,” the
Confrontation Clause did not require the certifying ana­
lyst’s in-court testimony. Instead, New Mexico’s high
court held, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the
constitutional requirements.
The question presented is whether the Confrontation
Clause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic
laboratory report containing a testimonial certification—
made for the purpose of proving a particular fact—through
the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the
certification or perform or observe the test reported in the
certification. We hold that surrogate testimony of that
order does not meet the constitutional requirement. The
accused’s right is to be confronted with the analyst who
made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable
at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to
cross-examine that particular scientist.

A

In August 2005, a vehicle driven by petitioner Donald
Bullcoming rear-ended a pick-up truck at an intersection
in Farmington, New Mexico. When the truckdriver exited
his vehicle and approached Bullcoming to exchange insur­
ance information, he noticed that Bullcoming’s eyes were
bloodshot. Smelling alcohol on Bullcoming’s breath, the
truckdriver told his wife to call the police. Bullcoming left
the scene before the police arrived, but was soon appre­
hended by an officer who observed his performance of field
sobriety tests. Upon failing the tests, Bullcoming was
arrested for driving a vehicle while “under the influence of
intoxicating liquor” (DWI), in violation of N. M. Stat. Ann.
§66–8–102 (2004).
