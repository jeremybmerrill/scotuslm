DONALD BULLCOMING, PETITIONER v. NEW

NEW MEXICO

JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
The Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause binds the
States and the National Government. Pointer v. Texas,

was present at trial to testify to its contents.
Whether or not one agrees with the reasoning and the
result in Melendez-Diaz, the Court today takes the new
