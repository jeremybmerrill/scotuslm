BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO
Opinion GINSBURG,
Opinion ofof the CourtJ.

lor’s report “fell within the core class of testimonial state­
ments” 226 P. 3d, at 7, described in this Court’s leading
Confrontation Clause decisions: Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 4); Davis, 547 U. S., at 830; Crawford,
541 U. S., at 51–52.
IV
The State and its amici urge that unbending applica­
tion of the Confrontation Clause to forensic evidence would
impose an undue burden on the prosecution. This argu­
ment, also advanced in the dissent, post, at 10–11, largely
repeats a refrain rehearsed and rejected in Melendez-Diaz.
See 557 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 19–23). The con­
stitutional requirement, we reiterate, “may not [be] disre­
gard[ed] . . . at our convenience,” id., at ___ (slip op., at
19), and the predictions of dire consequences, we again
observe, are dubious, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20).
New Mexico law, it bears emphasis, requires the lab­
oratory to preserve samples, which can be retested by
other analysts, see N. M. Admin. Code §7.33.2.15(A)(4)–(6)
(2010), available at http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/nmac/
_title07/T07C033.htm, and neither party questions SLD’s
compliance with that requirement. Retesting “is almost
always an option . . . in [DWI] cases,” Brief for Public
Defender Service for District of Columbia et al. as Amici
Curiae 25 (hereinafter PDS Brief), and the State had that
option here: New Mexico could have avoided any Confron­
tation Clause problem by asking Razatos to retest the
sample, and then testify to the results of his retest rather
than to the results of a test he did not conduct or observe.
Notably, New Mexico advocates retesting as an effective
means to preserve a defendant’s confrontation right “when
the [out-of-court] statement is raw data or a mere tran­
scription of raw data onto a public record.” Brief for Re­
spondent 53–54. But the State would require the defen­
dant to initiate retesting. Id., at 55; post, at 4 (defense
