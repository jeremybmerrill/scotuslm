10, but overlooks experience documented in Michigan. In that State,
post-Melendez-Diaz, the increase in in-court analyst testimony has been
slight. Compare PDS Brief 21 (in 2006, analysts provided testimony for
only 0.7% of all tests), with Michigan State Police, Forensic Science
Division, available at http://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,1607,7-123­
1593_3800-15901--,00.html (in 2010, analysts provided testimony for
approximately 1% of all tests).
11 As in Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, and n. 14 (slip op., at 23,
and n. 14), we express no view on whether the Confrontation Clause
error in this case was harmless. The New Mexico Supreme Court did
not reach that question, see Brief for Respondent 59–60, and nothing in
this opinion impedes a harmless-error inquiry on remand.
