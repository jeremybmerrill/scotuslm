VALLE v. FLORIDA
BREYER, J., dissenting

death sentence is not a rare phenomenon”); Strafer, Volunteering for Execution, 74 J. Crim. L. & C. 860, 872,
n. 44 (1983) (a study of Florida inmates showed that 35%
of those confined on death row attempted suicide; 42%
seriously considered suicide); id., at 869–871, (“Recent
studies and law suits document both the barbaric conditions pervading death rows and the debilitating and lifenegating effects of these conditions”).
So long a confinement followed by execution would also
seem unusual. The average period of time that an individual sentenced to death spends on death row is almost
15 years. Thirty three years is more than twice as long.
And, such delays are uncommon. See Dept. of Justice,
Bureau of Justice Statistics, T. Snell, Statiscal Tables,
Capital Punishment, 2009, p. 19 (Dec. 2010) (Table 18)
(approximately 113 prisoners have been under a sentence
of death for more than 29 years out of 3,173 death row
prisoners in total; 33 of those 113 are in Florida). Cf.
Knight, 528 U. S., at 993–994 (BREYER, J., dissenting from
denial of certiorari) (noting that 24 prisoners had been on
death row for more than 20 years). See also id., at 995 (“A
growing number of courts outside the United States—
courts that accept or assume the lawfulness of the death
penalty— have held that lengthy delay in administering a
lawful death penalty renders the ultimate execution inhuman, degrading, or unusually cruel”).
The commonly accepted justifications for the death
penalty are close to nonexistent in a case such as this one.
It is difficult to imagine how an execution following so long
a period of incarceration could add significantly to that
punishment’s deterrent value. It seems yet more unlikely
that the execution, coming after what is close to a lifetime
of imprisonment, matters in respect to incapacitation.
Thus, I would focus upon the “moral sensibility” of a community that finds in the death sentence an appropriate
public reaction to a terrible crime. See Spaziano v. Flori-
