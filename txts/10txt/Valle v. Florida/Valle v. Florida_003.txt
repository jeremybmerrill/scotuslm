BREYER, J., dissenting

da, 468 U. S. 447, 481 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part). And, I would ask how often
that community’s sense of retribution would forcefully
insist upon a death that comes only several decades after
the crime was committed.
It might be argued that Valle, not the State, is responsible for the long delay. But Valle replies that more than
two decades of delay reflect the State’s failure to provide
the kind of trial and penalty procedures that the law
requires. Regardless, one cannot realistically expect a
defendant condemned to death to refrain from fighting for
his life by seeking to use whatever procedures the law
allows.
It might also be argued that it is not so much the State
as it is the numerous procedures that the law demands
that produce decades of delay. But this kind of an argument does not automatically justify execution in this case.
Rather, the argument may point instead to a more basic
difficulty, namely the difficulty of reconciling the imposition of the death penalty as currently administered with
procedures necessary to assure that the wrong person is
not executed.
Because this case may well raise these questions and
because I believe the Court should consider them, I vote to
grant the application for stay.
