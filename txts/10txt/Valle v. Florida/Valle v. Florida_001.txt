BREYER, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
MANUEL VALLE v. FLORIDA
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF 

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA 

No. 11–6029. (11A229) (Decided September 28, 2011)


The application for stay of execution of sentence of death
presented to JUSTICE THOMAS and by him referred to the
Court is denied. The motion of Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales, et al. for leave to file a brief
as amici curiae is granted. The petition for a writ of
certiorari is denied.
JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting from denial of stay.
The State of Florida seeks to execute Manuel Valle for a
crime for which he was initially sentenced to death more

execution following decades of incarceration on death row
violates the Constitution’s prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishments.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 8. I would consider the claim. See Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1045 (1995)
(Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari); Knight v.
Florida, 528 U. S. 990, 993 (1989) (BREYER, J., dissenting
from denial of certiorari).
I have little doubt about the cruelty of so long a period of
incarceration under sentence of death. In Lackey and in
Knight Justice Stevens and I referred to the legal sources,
in addition to studies of attempted suicides, that buttress
the commonsense conclusion that 33 years in prison under
threat of execution is cruel. See In re Medley, 134 U. S.
160, 172 (1890) (describing as “horrible” the “feelings” that
accompany uncertainty about whether, or when, the execution will take place); Solesbee v. Balkcom, 339 U. S. 9,
14 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (“In the history of
murder, the onset of insanity while awaiting execution of a
