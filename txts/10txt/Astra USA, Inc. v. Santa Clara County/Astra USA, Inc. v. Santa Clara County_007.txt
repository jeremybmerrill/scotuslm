ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

ceutical Pricing Agreements (PPAs), see supra, at 1,
manufacturers agree to charge covered entities no more
than predetermined ceiling prices, derived from the “aver­
age” and “best” prices and rebates calculated under the
Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. §256b(a)(1); see App. to
Pet. for Cert. 165a–171a (PPA §I–II).2
If a manufacturer overcharges a covered entity, HRSA
may require the manufacturer to reimburse the covered
entity; HRSA may also terminate the manufacturer’s PPA,
§1396r–8(b)(4)(B)(i), (v); App. to Pet. for Cert. 174a (PPA
§IV(c)), which terminates as well the manufacturer’s
eligibility for Medicaid coverage of its drugs, §1396r–
8(a)(1), (5). Currently, HRSA handles overcharge com­
plaints through informal procedures. Manufacturer Audit
Guidelines and Dispute Resolution Process, 61 Fed. Reg.
65412 (1996). The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (PPACA), Pub. L. 111–148, 124 Stat. 119, pro­
vides for more rigorous enforcement. The PPACA directs
the Secretary to develop formal procedures for resolving
overcharge claims. Id., at 826, 42 U. S. C. A. §256b(d)
(3)(A). Under those procedures, which are not yet in place,
HRSA will reach an “administrative resolution” that is
subject to judicial review under the Administrative Proce­
dure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. §701 et seq. See 124 Stat. 827,
42 U. S. C. A. §256b(d)(3)(C). In addition to authorizing
compensation awards to overcharged entities, the PPACA
provides for the imposition of monetary penalties pay­
able to the Government. Id., at 824–825, 42 U. S. C. A.
§256b(d)(1)(B)(ii), (vi).

340B Program also covers over-the-counter medications for
which there are no Medicaid rebates. 42 U. S. C. A. §256b(a)(2)(B) (Oct.
2010 Supp.). For such drugs, §340B prescribes a substitute calculation
method. §256b(a)(2)(B)(i).
