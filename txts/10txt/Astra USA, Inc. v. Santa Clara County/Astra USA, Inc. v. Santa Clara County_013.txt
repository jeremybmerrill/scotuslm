ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has published re­
ports finding that “HRSA lacks the oversight mechanisms
and authority to ensure that [covered] entities pay at or
below the . . . ceiling price.” 588 F. 3d, at 1242 (quoting
OIG, D. Levinson, Deficiencies in the Oversight of the
340B Drug Pricing Program ii (OEI–05–02–00072, Oct.
2005)). See also 588 F. 3d, at 1242–1243 (citing OIG, D.
Levinson, Review of 340B Prices 11 (OEI–05–02–00073,
July 2006) (estimating that covered entities overpaid $3.9
million in June 2005 alone)). But Congress did not re­
spond to the reports of inadequate HRSA enforcement by
inviting 340B entities to launch lawsuits in district courts
across the country. Instead, in the PPACA, Congress
directed HRSA to create a formal dispute resolution pro­
cedure, institute refund and civil penalty systems, and
perform audits of manufacturers. 124 Stat. 823–827, 42
U. S. C. A. §256b(d). Congress thus opted to strengthen
and formalize HRSA’s enforcement authority, to make the
new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for cov­
ered entities complaining of “overcharges and other viola­
tions of the discounted pricing requirements,” id., at 823,
42 U. S. C. A. §256b(d)(1)(A), and to render the agency’s
resolution of covered entities’ complaints binding, subject
to judicial review under the APA, id., at 827, 42 U. S. C. A.
§256b(d)(3)(C).
