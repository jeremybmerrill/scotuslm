Opinion of the Court

ernment Reform, House of Representatives).1 To gain
payment under Medicaid for covered drugs, a manufac­
turer must enter a standardized agreement with HHS; in
the agreement, the manufacturer undertakes to provide
rebates to States on their Medicaid drug purchases. 104
Stat. 1388–143, as amended, 124 Stat. 3290, 42 U. S. C. A.
§1396r–8(a). The amount of the rebates depends on the
manufacturer’s “average” and “best” prices, as defined by

prohibited from disclosing the submitted information “in a

amended, 124 Stat. 823, manufacturers participating in
Medicaid must offer discounted drugs to covered entities,
dominantly, local facilities that provide medical care for
the poor. See §256b(a); §1396r–8(a)(1). The 340B Pro­
gram, like the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, employs a
form contract as an opt-in mechanism. The 340B Program
also draws on the larger scheme’s pricing methodology. In
