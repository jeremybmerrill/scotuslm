ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

The Ninth Circuit determined that “[p]ermitting covered
entities to sue as intended beneficiaries of the PPA is . . .
wholly compatible with the Section 340B program’s objec­
tives” to ensure “that drug companies comply with their
obligations under the program and provide [the required]
discounts.” 588 F. 3d, at 1251. Suits like the County’s,
the Court of Appeals reasoned, would spread the enforce­
ment burden instead of placing it “[entirely] on the gov­
ernment.” Ibid. (citing Price v. Pierce, 823 F. 2d 1114,
1121 (CA7 1987)). But spreading the enforcement burden,
the United States stressed, both in the Ninth Circuit and
in this Court, is hardly what Congress contemplated when
it “centralized enforcement in the government.” Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 32; see Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae in No. 09–15216 (CA9), p. 13
(County’s challenge is at odds with Congress’ unitary
administrative and enforcement scheme).5
Congress made HHS administrator of both the Medicaid
Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Program, the United
States observed, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
33–34, and “[t]he interdependent nature of the two pro­
grams’ requirements means that an adjudication of rights
under one program must proceed with an eye towards any
implications for the other,” id., at 34. Far from assisting
HHS, suits by 340B entities would undermine the agency’s
efforts to administer both Medicaid and §340B harmoni­

5 The County notes that in In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average
Wholesale Price Litigation, 263 F. Supp. 2d 172 (Mass. 2003), the
United States urged that the statute establishing the Medicaid Drug
Rebate Program, §1396r–8, does not preempt States from maintaining
state-law fraud claims based on fraudulent reporting of “best prices” to
HHS. Brief for Respondent 22–23. See Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae in No. 1:01–cv–12257 (D Mass.), pp. 6–9 (observing that
States make their own payments to manufacturers and have long
played a role in identifying and prosecuting Medicaid fraud). We take
no position on this issue.
