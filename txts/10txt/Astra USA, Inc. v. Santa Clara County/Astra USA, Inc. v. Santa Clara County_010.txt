Opinion of the Court

force the statute itself. The absence of a private right to
enforce the statutory ceiling price obligations would be
rendered meaningless if 340B entities could overcome that
obstacle by suing to enforce the contract’s ceiling price
obligations instead. The statutory and contractual obliga­
tions, in short, are one and the same. See Grochowski v.
Phoenix Construction, 318 F. 3d 80, 86 (CA2 2003) (when
a government contract confirms a statutory obligation, “a
third-party private contract action [to enforce that obliga­
tion] would be inconsistent with . . . the legislative scheme
. . . to the same extent as would a cause of action directly
under the statute” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Telling in this regard, the County based its suit on
allegations that the manufacturers charged more than the
§340B ceiling price, see, e.g., Third Amended Complaint in
No. 3:05–cv–03740 (ND Cal.), ¶1, 65, not that they vio­
lated any independent substantive obligation arising only
from the PPAs.4 Repeatedly, the County acknowledged
that §340B is the source of the contractual term allegedly
breached. See, e.g., id., ¶28 (“[Section] 340B requires
pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure that §340B
Participants pay no more than the ‘ceiling price’ . . . for
any pharmaceutical product.”); id., ¶36 (“Under both
§340B and the PPA, [drug manufacturers] are required to
ensure that the §340B Participants . . . pay no more for
any product than the §340B ceiling price.”).

4 Whether

a contracting agency may authorize third-party suits to
enforce a Government contract is not at issue in this case. Cf. Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 22. We can infer no such authorization
where a contract simply incorporates statutorily required terms and
otherwise fails to demonstrate any intent to allow beneficiaries to en­
force those terms. Permitting such a suit, it is evident, would “allo[w]
third parties to circumvent Congress’s decision not to permit private
enforcement of the statute.” Id., at 23–24; cf. Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae in No. 09–15216 (CA9), p. 21 (“In drafting and entering
into [PPAs], HHS never imagined that a 340B entity could bring a
third-party beneficiary lawsuit like [the County]’s.”).
