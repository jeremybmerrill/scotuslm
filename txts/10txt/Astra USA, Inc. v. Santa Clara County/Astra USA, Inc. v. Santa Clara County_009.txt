ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

1083, 1102 (1991). See also Stoneridge Investment Part
ners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 164
(2008); Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286 (2001).
Congress vested authority to oversee compliance with the
340B Program in HHS and assigned no auxiliary enforce­
ment role to covered entities.
Notwithstanding its inability to assert a statutory right
of action, the County maintains that the PPAs implement­
ing the 340B Program are agreements enforceable by
covered entities as third-party beneficiaries. A nonparty
becomes legally entitled to a benefit promised in a
contract, the County recognizes, only if the contracting
parties so intend. Brief for Respondent 31 (citing Re­
statement (Second) of Contracts §302(1)(b) (1979)). The
PPAs “specifically nam[e]” covered entities as the recipi­
ents of discounted drugs, the County observes; indeed the
very object of the agreements is to ensure that those enti­
ties would be “charge[d] . . . no more than the ceiling
price.” Brief for Respondent 33. When the Government
uses a contract to secure a benefit, the County urges, the
intended recipient acquires a right to the benefit enforce­
able under federal common law. Id., at 30. But see 9 J.
Murray, Corbin on Contracts §45.6, p. 92 (rev. ed. 2007)
(“The distinction between an intention to benefit a third
party and an intention that the third party should have
the right to enforce that intention is emphasized where
the promisee is a governmental entity.”).
The County’s argument overlooks that the PPAs simply
incorporate statutory obligations and record the manufac­
turers’ agreement to abide by them. The form agree­
ments, composed by HHS, contain no negotiable terms.
Like the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program agreements, see
supra, at 3, the 340B Program agreements serve as the
means by which drug manufacturers opt into the statutory
scheme. A third-party suit to enforce an HHS-drug manu­
facturer agreement, therefore, is in essence a suit to en­
