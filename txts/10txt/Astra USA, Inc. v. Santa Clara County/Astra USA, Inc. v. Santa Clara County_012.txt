Opinion of the Court

ously and on a uniform, nationwide basis.6 Recognizing
the County’s right to proceed in court could spawn a mul­
titude of dispersed and uncoordinated lawsuits by 340B
entities. With HHS unable to hold the control rein, the
risk of conflicting adjudications would be substantial.
As earlier noted, see supra, at 3, the Medicaid Rebate
Program’s statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing
information in a form that could reveal the prices a manu­
facturer charges for drugs it produces. §1396r–8(b)(3)(D).7
This ban on disclosure is a further indication of the in­
compatibility of private suits with the statute Congress
enacted. If Congress meant to leave open the prospect of
third-party beneficiary suits by 340B entities, it likely
would not have barred the potential suitors from obtaining
the very information necessary to determine whether their
asserted rights have been violated.8
It is true, as the Ninth Circuit observed, that HHS’s

6 Because the Ninth Circuit focused on the 340B Program in isolation,
it failed to recognize that the interests of States under the Medicaid
Drug Rebate Program and covered entities under the 340B Program
may conflict. For example, “average” prices are used both to set the
amount manufacturers must pay in Medicaid rebates and to establish
§340B ceiling prices. §1396r–8(c); §256b(a)(1). Typically, the lower the
“average” price, the lower a product’s price to a 340B entity. Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae in No. 09–15216, p. 31. But the higher
the “average” price, the more a State Medicaid agency typically receives
in rebates from the manufacturers. Ibid. HHS can use its expertise to
ascertain and balance the competing interests. Id., at 31–32. Courts as
first-line decisionmakers are not similarly equipped to deal with the
whole picture.
7 HHS interprets this provision, the United States informs us, as pro­
hibiting the agency from disclosing to covered entities the ceiling prices
calculated based on information submitted by the manufacturers. Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 28.
8 Going forward, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,
Pub. L. 111–148, 124 Stat. 119, in conjunction with the new adminis­
trative adjudication process directed by the Act, will require HHS to
give covered entities access to some of the information submitted by
manufacturers. Id., at 826, 42 U. S. C. A. §256b(d)(3)(B)(iii).
