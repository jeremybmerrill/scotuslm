ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY
Opinion of the Court

of action under §340B for covered entities who claim they
have been charged prices exceeding the statutory ceiling.
This case presents the question whether 340B entities,
though accorded no right to sue for overcharges under the
statute itself, may nonetheless sue allegedly overcharging
manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs to
which the manufacturers subscribed. We hold that suits
by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running
between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS
are incompatible with the statutory regime.
Congress placed the Secretary (acting through her
designate, HRSA) in control of §340B’s drug-price pre­
scriptions. That control could not be maintained were
potentially thousands of covered entities permitted to
bring suits alleging errors in manufacturers’ price calcula­
tions. If 340B entities may not sue under the statute, it
would make scant sense to allow them to sue on a form
contract implementing the statute, setting out terms
identical to those contained in the statute. Though labeled
differently, suits to enforce §340B and suits to enforce
PPAs are in substance one and the same. Their treat­
ment, therefore, must be the same, “[n]o matter the cloth­
ing in which [340B entities] dress their claims.” Tenet v.
Doe, 544 U. S. 1, 8 (2005).

The 340B Program is tied to the earlier-enacted, much
larger Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Adopted by Con­
gress in 1990, the Medicaid Rebate Program covers a
significant portion of drug purchases in the United States.
