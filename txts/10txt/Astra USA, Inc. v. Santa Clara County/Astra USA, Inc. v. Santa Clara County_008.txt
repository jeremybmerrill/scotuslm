Opinion of the Court

several 340B entities, commenced suit against Astra and
eight other pharmaceutical companies, alleging that the
companies were overcharging 340B health care facilities
in violation of the PPAs to which the companies sub­
scribed. The County styled its suit a class action on behalf
of both 340B entities in California and the counties that
fund those entities. Asserting that the 340B entities and
the counties that fund them are the intended beneficiaries
of the PPAs, the County sought compensatory damages for
the pharmaceutical companies’ breach of contract.
The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding
that the PPAs conferred no enforceable rights on 340B
entities. Reversing the District Court’s judgment, the
Ninth Circuit held that covered entities, although they
have no right to sue under the statute, could maintain the
action as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs. 588 F. 3d
1237, 1241 (2009).
We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010),3 and now
reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.
II
As the County conceded below and before this Court, see
588 F. 3d, at 1249; Tr. of Oral Arg. 45, covered entities
have no right of action under §340B itself. “[R]ecognition
of any private right of action for violating a federal stat­
ute,” currently governing decisions instruct, “must ulti­
mately rest on congressional intent to provide a private
remedy.” Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S.
——————
3 U. S. Courts of Appeals have divided on the circumstances under
which suits may be brought by alleged third-party beneficiaries of
Government contracts. Compare 588 F. 3d 1237, 1244 (CA9 2009) (case
below) (“Any intended beneficiary has the right to enforce the obligor’s
duty of performance . . . .”), with Grochowski v. Phoenix Construction,
318 F. 3d 80, 85–86 (CA2 2003) (“there is no presumption in favor of a
right to bring suit” as third-party beneficiary of a government contract),
and Dewakuku v. Martinez, 271 F. 3d 1031, 1042 (CA Fed. 2001)
(rejecting third-party suit).
