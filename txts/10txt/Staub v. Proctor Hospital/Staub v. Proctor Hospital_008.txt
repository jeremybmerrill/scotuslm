such membership.” §4311(c).
The statute is very similar to Title VII, which prohibits
employment discrimination “because of . . . race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin” and states that such
discrimination is established when one of those factors
“was a motivating factor for any employment practice,
even though other factors also motivated the practice.” 42
U. S. C. §§2000e–2(a), (m).
The central difficulty in this case is construing the
phrase “motivating factor in the employer’s action.” When
the company official who makes the decision to take an
adverse employment action is personally acting out of
hostility to the employee’s membership in or obligation to
a uniformed service, a motivating factor obviously exists.
The problem we confront arises when that official has no
discriminatory animus but is influenced by previous com
pany action that is the product of a like animus in some

In approaching this question, we start from the premise
that when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the

47, 68–69 (2007); Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,
524 U. S. 742, 764 (1998). Intentional torts such as this,
“as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts, . . .
generally require that the actor intend ‘the consequences’
of an act,’ not simply ‘the act itself.’ ” Kawaauhau v. Gei
ger, 523 U. S. 57, 61–62 (1998).
Staub contends that the fact that an unfavorable entry
on the plaintiff’s personnel record was caused to be put
there, with discriminatory animus, by Mulally and Koren
chuk, suffices to establish the tort, even if Mulally and
Korenchuk did not intend to cause his dismissal. But
discrimination was no part of Buck’s reason for the dis
