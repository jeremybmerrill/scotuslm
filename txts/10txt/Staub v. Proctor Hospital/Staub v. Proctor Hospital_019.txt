STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL
ALITO, J., concurring in judgment

Staub left his work area without informing his supervi
sors. There was evidence that Korenchuk’s accusation
formed the basis of Buck’s decision to fire Staub, and that
Buck simply accepted the accusation at face value. Ac
cording to one version of events, Buck fired Staub immedi
ately after Korenchuk informed her of Staub’s alleged
misconduct, and she cited only that misconduct in the
termination notice provided to Staub. See 5 Record 128–
129, 267–268, 380–386; App. 74a. All of this is enough to
show that Korenchuk was in effect delegated some of
Buck’s termination authority. There was also evidence
from which it may be inferred that displeasure with
Staub’s Reserve responsibilities was a motivating factor in
Korenchuk’s actions.*

* See 5 Record 343–344 (testimony that Korenchuk made negative
remarks about Staub’s Reserve duties before firing him in 1998); id., at
124–126, 352 (testimony that Korenchuk informed Staub of the revenue
lost while he was on Active Duty in 2003, that Korenchuk was aware in
January 2004 that Staub might be called to Active Duty again, and that
“[b]udget was a big issue with [Korenchuk]”).
