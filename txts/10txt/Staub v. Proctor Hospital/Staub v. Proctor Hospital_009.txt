STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL
Opinion of the Court

missal; and while Korenchuk and Mulally acted with
discriminatory animus, the act they committed—the mere
making of the reports—was not a denial of “initial em
ployment, reemployment, retention in employment, pro
motion, or any benefit of employment,” as liability under
USERRA requires. If dismissal was not the object of
Mulally’s and Korenchuk’s reports, it may have been
their result, or even their foreseeable consequence, but
that is not enough to render Mulally or Korenchuk
responsible.
Here, however, Staub is seeking to hold liable not Mu
lally and Korenchuk, but their employer. Perhaps, there
fore, the discriminatory motive of one of the employer’s
agents (Mulally or Korenchuk) can be aggregated with the
act of another agent (Buck) to impose liability on Proctor.
Again we consult general principles of law, agency law,
which form the background against which federal tort
laws are enacted. See Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285
(2003); Burlington, supra, at 754–755. Here, however, the
answer is not so clear. The Restatement of Agency sug
gests that the malicious mental state of one agent cannot
generally be combined with the harmful action of another
agent to hold the principal liable for a tort that requires
both. See Restatement (Second) Agency §275, Illustration
4 (1958). Some of the cases involving federal torts apply
that rule. See United States v. Science Applications Int’l
Corp., 626 F. 3d 1257, 1273–1276 (CADC 2010); Chaney v.
Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F. 3d 219, 241 (CA5 2010);
United States v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 566 F. 3d 1095,
1122 (CADC 2009). But another case involving a federal
tort, and one involving a federal crime, hold to the con
trary. See United States ex rel. Harrison v. Westinghouse
Savannah River Co., 352 F. 3d 908, 918–919 (CA4 2003);
United States v. Bank of New England, N. A., 821 F. 2d
844, 856 (CA1 1987). Ultimately, we think it unnecessary
in this case to decide what the background rule of agency
