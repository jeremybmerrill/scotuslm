STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL
Opinion of the Court

notice so that he would “ ‘pa[y] back the department for
everyone else having to bend over backwards to cover [his]
schedule for the Reserves.’ ” 560 F. 3d 647, 652 (CA7
2009). She also informed Staub’s co-worker, Leslie Swe
borg, that Staub’s “ ‘military duty had been a strain on
th[e] department,’ ” and asked Sweborg to help her “ ‘get
rid of him.’ ” Ibid. Korenchuk referred to Staub’s military
obligations as “ ‘a b[u]nch of smoking and joking and [a]
waste of taxpayers[’] money.’ ” Ibid. He was also aware
that Mulally was “ ‘out to get’ ” Staub. Ibid.
In January 2004, Mulally issued Staub a “Corrective
Action” disciplinary warning for purportedly violating a
company rule requiring him to stay in his work area
whenever he was not working with a patient. The Correc

[the angio] cases [we]re complete[d].’ ” Id., at 653. Accord

Action was false for two reasons: First, the company rule
invoked by Mulally did not exist; and second, even if it did,
Staub did not violate it.

resources, and Garrett McGowan, Proctor’s chief operating
officer, about Staub’s frequent unavailability and abrupt
ness. McGowan directed Korenchuk and Buck to create a
plan that would solve Staub’s “ ‘availability’ problems.”
Id., at 654. But three weeks later, before they had time to
do so, Korenchuk informed Buck that Staub had left his
desk without informing a supervisor, in violation of the
January Corrective Action. Staub now contends this
accusation was false: he had left Korenchuk a voice-mail
notification that he was leaving his desk. Buck relied on
Korenchuk’s accusation, however, and after reviewing
Staub’s personnel file, she decided to fire him. The termi
nation notice stated that Staub had ignored the directive
