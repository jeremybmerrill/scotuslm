STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL
Opinion of the Court

The jury instruction did not hew precisely to the rule we
adopt today; it required only that the jury find that “mili
tary status was a motivating factor in [Proctor’s] decision
to discharge him.” App. 68a. Whether the variance be
tween the instruction and our rule was harmless error or
should mandate a new trial is a matter the Seventh Cir
cuit may consider in the first instance.

*
The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
