STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL
Opinion of the Court

not think that the ultimate decisionmaker’s exercise of
judgment automatically renders the link to the supervi
sor’s bias “remote” or “purely contingent.” The decision
maker’s exercise of judgment is also a proximate cause of
the employment decision, but it is common for injuries to
have multiple proximate causes. See Sosa v. AlvarezMachain, 542 U. S. 692, 704 (2004). Nor can the ultimate
decisionmaker’s judgment be deemed a superseding cause
of the harm. A cause can be thought “superseding” only if
it is a “cause of independent origin that was not foresee
able.” Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 837
(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Moreover, the approach urged upon us by Proctor gives
an unlikely meaning to a provision designed to prevent
employer discrimination. An employer’s authority to
reward, punish, or dismiss is often allocated among multi
ple agents. The one who makes the ultimate decision does
so on the basis of performance assessments by other su
pervisors. Proctor’s view would have the improbable
consequence that if an employer isolates a personnel
official from an employee’s supervisors, vests the decision
to take adverse employment actions in that official, and
asks that official to review the employee’s personnel file
before taking the adverse action, then the employer will be
effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recom
mendations of supervisors that were designed and in
tended to produce the adverse action. That seems to us an
implausible meaning of the text, and one that is not com
pelled by its words.
Proctor suggests that even if the decisionmaker’s mere
exercise of independent judgment does not suffice to ne
gate the effect of the prior discrimination, at least the
decisionmaker’s independent investigation (and rejection)
—————— 

lally or Korenchuk intended any particular adverse action other than

Staub’s termination.
