GINSBURG, J., dissenting

“[p]ersons in possession of valuable drugs are unlikely to
destroy them unless they fear discovery by the police.”
Ante, at 8. Nothing in the record shows that, prior to the
knock at the apartment door, the occupants were appre
hensive about police proximity.
In no quarter does the Fourth Amendment apply with
greater force than in our homes, our most private space
which, for centuries, has been regarded as “ ‘entitled to
special protection.’ ” Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103,
115, and n. 4 (2006); Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 99
(1998) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Home intrusions, the
Court has said, are indeed “the chief evil against which . . .
the Fourth Amendment is directed.” Payton, 445 U. S., at
585 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Silverman v.
United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511 (1961) (“At [the Fourth
Amendment’s] very core stands the right of a man to
retreat to his own home and there be free from unreason
able governmental intrusion.”). “ ‘[S]earches and seizures
inside a home without a warrant are [therefore] presump
tively unreasonable.’ ” Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403
(quoting Groh, 540 U. S., at 559). How “secure” do our
homes remain if police, armed with no warrant, can pound
on doors at will and, on hearing sounds indicative of
things moving, forcibly enter and search for evidence of
unlawful activity?
II
As above noted, to justify the police activity in this case,
Kentucky invoked the once-guarded exception for emer
gencies “in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant
. . . threaten[s] ‘the destruction of evidence.’ ” Schmerber
v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770 (1966) (quoting Preston v.
United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)). To fit within
this exception, “police action literally must be [taken] ‘now
or never’ to preserve the evidence of the crime.” Roaden v.
Kentucky, 413 U. S. 496, 505 (1973).
