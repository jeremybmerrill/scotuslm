KENTUCKY v. KING
Opinion of the Court

Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam)
(slip op., at 2). Accordingly, the warrant requirement is
subject to certain reasonable exceptions. Brigham City,
supra, at 403.
One well-recognized exception applies when “ ‘the exi­
gencies of the situation’ make the needs of law en­
forcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is
objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.”
Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978); see also
Payton, supra, at 590 (“[T]he Fourth Amendment has
drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent
exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably
be crossed without a warrant”).
This Court has identified several exigencies that may
justify a warrantless search of a home. See Brigham City,
547 U. S., at 403. Under the “emergency aid” exception,
for example, “officers may enter a home without a warrant
to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or
to protect an occupant from imminent injury.” Ibid.; see
also, e.g., Fisher, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5) (upholding
warrantless home entry based on emergency aid excep­
tion). Police officers may enter premises without a war­
rant when they are in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect. See
United States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38, 42–43 (1976).
And—what is relevant here—the need “to prevent the
imminent destruction of evidence” has long been recog­
nized as a sufficient justification for a warrantless search.
Brigham City, supra, at 403; see also Georgia v. Randolph,
547 U. S. 103, 116, n. 6 (2006); Minnesota v. Olson, 495
U. S. 91, 100 (1990).3

3 Preventing the destruction of evidence may also justify dispensing
with Fourth Amendment requirements in other contexts. See, e.g.,
Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, 395–396 (1997) (failure to comply
with the knock-and-announce requirement was justified because “the
circumstances . . . show[ed] that the officers had a reasonable suspicion
that [a suspect] might destroy evidence if given further opportunity to
