KENTUCKY v. KING 

Opinion of the Court 


D

For these reasons, we conclude that the exigent circum­
stances rule applies when the police do not gain entry to
premises by means of an actual or threatened violation of
the Fourth Amendment. This holding provides ample
protection for the privacy rights that the Amendment
protects.
When law enforcement officers who are not armed with
a warrant knock on a door, they do no more than any
private citizen might do. And whether the person who
knocks on the door and requests the opportunity to speak
is a police officer or a private citizen, the occupant has no
obligation to open the door or to speak. Cf. Florida v.
Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 497–498 (1983). (“[H]e may decline
to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way”).
When the police knock on a door but the occupants choose
not to respond or to speak, “the investigation will have
reached a conspicuously low point,” and the occupants
“will have the kind of warning that even the most elabo­
rate security system cannot provide.” Chambers, 395
F. 3d, at 577 (Sutton, J., dissenting). And even if an occu­
pant chooses to open the door and speak with the officers,
the occupant need not allow the officers to enter the prem­
ises and may refuse to answer any questions at any time.
Occupants who choose not to stand on their constitu­
tional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evi­
dence have only themselves to blame for the warrantless
exigent-circumstances search that may ensue.

exigent circumstances. See id., at 14–15 (noting that if “exceptional
circumstances” existed—for example, if a “suspect was fleeing or likely
to take flight” or if “evidence or contraband was threatened with
removal or destruction”—then “it may be contended that a magistrate’s
warrant for search may be dispensed with”).
