GINSBURG, J., dissenting

is . . . a grave concern, not only to the individual but to
a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security
and freedom from surveillance. When the right of
privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is,
as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not a
policeman . . . .

“If the officers in this case were excused from the
constitutional duty of presenting their evidence to a
magistrate, it is difficult to think of [any] case in
which [a warrant] should be required.” Id., at 14–15.
I agree, and would not allow an expedient knock to over
ride the warrant requirement.* Instead, I would accord
that core requirement of the Fourth Amendment full
respect. When possible, “a warrant must generally be
secured,” the Court acknowledges. Ante, at 5. There is
every reason to conclude that securing a warrant was
entirely feasible in this case, and no reason to contract the
Fourth Amendment’s dominion.

* The Court in Johnson was informed that “when [the officer]
knocked on [Johnson’s] door the ‘first thing that naturally struck [her]’
was to conceal the opium and the equipment for smoking it.” See Brief
for United States in Johnson v. United States, O. T. 1947, No. 329,
p. 17, n. 6. Had the Government in Johnson urged that the “shuffling
or noise” indicated evidence was at risk, would the result have
changed? Justice Jackson’s recognition of the primacy of the warrant
requirement suggests not. But see ante, at 15, n. 5 (distinguishing
Johnson on the ground that the Government did not contend “that
the officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of
evidence”).
