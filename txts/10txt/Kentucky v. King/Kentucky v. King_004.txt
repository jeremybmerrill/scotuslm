KENTUCKY, PETITIONER v. HOLLIS DESHAUN KING
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF 

KENTUCKY

[May 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
It is well established that “exigent circumstances,”
including the need to prevent the destruction of evidence,
permit police officers to conduct an otherwise permissible
search without first obtaining a warrant. In this case, we
consider whether this rule applies when police, by knock­
ing on the door of a residence and announcing their pres­
ence, cause the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.
The Kentucky Supreme Court held that the exigent cir­
cumstances rule does not apply in the case at hand be­
cause the police should have foreseen that their conduct
would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evi­
dence. We reject this interpretation of the exigent circum­
stances rule. The conduct of the police prior to their entry
into the apartment was entirely lawful. They did not
violate the Fourth Amendment or threaten to do so. In
such a situation, the exigent circumstances rule applies.
