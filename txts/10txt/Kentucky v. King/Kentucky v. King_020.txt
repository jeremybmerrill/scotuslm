Opinion of the Court

IV
We now apply our interpretation of the police-created
exigency doctrine to the facts of this case.
A
We need not decide whether exigent circumstances
existed in this case. Any warrantless entry based on
exigent circumstances must, of course, be supported by a
genuine exigency. See Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 406.
The trial court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals found
that there was a real exigency in this case, but the Ken­
tucky Supreme Court expressed doubt on this issue, ob­
serving that there was “certainly some question as to
whether the sound of persons moving [inside the apart­
ment] was sufficient to establish that evidence was being
destroyed.” 302 S. W. 3d, at 655. The Kentucky Supreme
Court “assum[ed] for the purpose of argument that exigent
circumstances existed,” ibid., and it held that the police
had impermissibly manufactured the exigency.
We, too, assume for purposes of argument that an exi­
gency existed. We decide only the question on which the
Kentucky Supreme Court ruled and on which we granted
certiorari: Under what circumstances do police impermis­
sibly create an exigency? Any question about whether an
exigency actually existed is better addressed by the Ken­
tucky Supreme Court on remand. See Kirk v. Louisiana,
536 U. S. 635, 638 (2002) (per curiam) (reversing state­
court judgment that exigent circumstances were not re­
quired for warrantless home entry and remanding for
state court to determine whether exigent circumstances
were present).
B
In this case, we see no evidence that the officers either
violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so
prior to the point when they entered the apartment.
