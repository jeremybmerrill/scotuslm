KENTUCKY, PETITIONER v. HOLLIS DESHAUN KING
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF 

KENTUCKY

[May 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting.
The Court today arms the police with a way routinely to
dishonor the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement in
drug cases. In lieu of presenting their evidence to a neu
tral magistrate, police officers may now knock, listen, then
break the door down, nevermind that they had ample time
to obtain a warrant. I dissent from the Court’s reduction
of the Fourth Amendment’s force.
The Fourth Amendment guarantees to the people “[t]he
right . . . to be secure in their . . . houses . . . against un

afoot. These complementary provisions are designed to
ensure that police will seek the authorization of a neutral
magistrate before undertaking a search or seizure. Excep
tions to the warrant requirement, this Court has ex
plained, must be “few in number and carefully delineated,”
if the main rule is to remain hardy. United States v.
United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407
U. S. 297, 318 (1972); see Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S.
27, 31 (2001).
This case involves a principal exception to the warrant
requirement, the exception applicable in “exigent circum
stances.” See ante, at 6–7. “[C]arefully delineated,” the
exception should govern only in genuine emergency situa
