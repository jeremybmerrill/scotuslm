Opinion of the Court 


B

Over the years, lower courts have developed an excep­
tion to the exigent circumstances rule, the so-called “po­
lice-created exigency” doctrine. Under this doctrine, police
may not rely on the need to prevent destruction of evi­
dence when that exigency was “created” or “manufactured”
by the conduct of the police. See, e.g., United States v.
Chambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 566 (CA6 2005) (“[F]or a war­
rantless search to stand, law enforcement officers must be
responding to an unanticipated exigency rather than
simply creating the exigency for themselves”); United
States v. Gould, 364 F. 3d 578, 590 (CA5 2004) (en banc)
(“[A]lthough exigent circumstances may justify a war­
rantless probable cause entry into the home, they will not
do so if the exigent circumstances were manufactured by
the agents” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
In applying this exception for the “creation” or “manu­
facturing” of an exigency by the police, courts require
something more than mere proof that fear of detection by
the police caused the destruction of evidence. An addi­
tional showing is obviously needed because, as the Eighth
Circuit has recognized, “in some sense the police always
create the exigent circumstances.” United States v. Duchi,
906 F. 2d 1278, 1284 (CA8 1990). That is to say, in the
vast majority of cases in which evidence is destroyed by
persons who are engaged in illegal conduct, the reason for
the destruction is fear that the evidence will fall into the
hands of law enforcement. Destruction of evidence issues
probably occur most frequently in drug cases because
drugs may be easily destroyed by flushing them down a

rantless testing for blood-alcohol content was justified based on poten­
tial destruction of evidence); cf. United States v. Banks, 540 U. S. 31,
37–40 (2003) (15 to 20 seconds was a reasonable time for officers to wait
after knocking and announcing their presence where there was a risk
that suspect would dispose of cocaine).
