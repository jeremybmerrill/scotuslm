Opinion of the Court

II 

A

The Fourth Amendment provides: 

“The right of the people to be secure in their per­
sons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreason­
able searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and
no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
describing the place to be searched, and the persons or
things to be seized.”
The text of the Amendment thus expressly imposes two
requirements. First, all searches and seizures must be
reasonable. Second, a warrant may not be issued unless
probable cause is properly established and the scope of the
authorized search is set out with particularity. See Payton
v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 584 (1980).
Although the text of the Fourth Amendment does not
specify when a search warrant must be obtained, this
Court has inferred that a warrant must generally be
secured. “It is a ‘basic principle of Fourth Amendment
law,’ ” we have often said, “ ‘that searches and seizures
inside a home without a warrant are presumptively un­
reasonable.’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403
(2006) (quoting Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 559
(2004)). But we have also recognized that this presump­
tion may be overcome in some circumstances because
“[t]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is
‘reasonableness.’ ” Brigham City, supra, at 403; see also
——————
579, 581, n. 2 (1983). As we explained in Villamonte-Marquez, our
reversal of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision “would reinstate the
judgment of conviction and the sentence entered” by the Circuit Court.
Ibid. The absence of an indictment does not change matters. See
ibid. (“Upon respondents’ conviction and sentence, the indictment that
was returned against them was merged into their convictions and
sentences”).
