KENTUCKY v. KING
Opinion of the Court

U. S. 293, 310 (1966). Faulting the police for failing to
apply for a search warrant at the earliest possible time
after obtaining probable cause imposes a duty that is
nowhere to be found in the Constitution.
Standard or good investigative tactics. Finally, some
lower court cases suggest that law enforcement officers
may be found to have created or manufactured an exi­
gency if the court concludes that the course of their inves­

jurisdictions).” Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 591. This approach
fails to provide clear guidance for law enforcement officers
and authorizes courts to make judgments on matters that
are the province of those who are responsible for federal
and state law enforcement agencies.

Respondent argues for a rule that differs from those
discussed above, but his rule is also flawed. Respondent
contends that law enforcement officers impermissibly
create an exigency when they “engage in conduct that
would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry is
imminent and inevitable.” Brief for Respondent 24. In
respondent’s view, relevant factors include the officers’
tone of voice in announcing their presence and the force­
fulness of their knocks. But the ability of law enforcement
officers to respond to an exigency cannot turn on such
subtleties.
Police officers may have a very good reason to announce
their presence loudly and to knock on the door with some
force. A forceful knock may be necessary to alert the
occupants that someone is at the door. Cf. United States v.
Banks, 540 U. S. 31, 33 (2003) (Police “rapped hard
enough on the door to be heard by officers at the back
door” and announced their presence, but defendant “was
in the shower and testified that he heard nothing”). Fur­
