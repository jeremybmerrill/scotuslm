KENTUCKY v. KING
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

tions. Circumstances qualify as “exigent” when there is an
imminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that
evidence will be immediately destroyed, or that a suspect
will escape. Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403
(2006). The question presented: May police, who could
pause to gain the approval of a neutral magistrate, dis
pense with the need to get a warrant by themselves creat
ing exigent circumstances? I would answer no, as did the
Kentucky Supreme Court. The urgency must exist, I
would rule, when the police come on the scene, not subse
quent to their arrival, prompted by their own conduct.

Two pillars of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence
should have controlled the Court’s ruling: First, “whenever
practical, [the police must] obtain advance judicial ap
proval of searches and seizures through the warrant pro
cedure,” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 20 (1968); second,
unwarranted “searches and seizures inside a home” bear
heightened scrutiny, Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573,
586 (1980). The warrant requirement, Justice Jackson
observed, ranks among the “fundamental distinctions
between our form of government, where officers are under the law, and the police-state where they are the law.”
Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 17 (1948). The
Court has accordingly declared warrantless searches, in
the main, “per se unreasonable.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437
U. S. 385, 390 (1978); see also Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S.
551, 559 (2004). “[T]he police bear a heavy burden,” the
Court has cautioned, “when attempting to demonstrate an
urgent need that might justify warrantless searches.”
Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 749–750 (1984).
That heavy burden has not been carried here. There
was little risk that drug-related evidence would have been
destroyed had the police delayed the search pending
a magistrate’s authorization. As the Court recognizes,
