Syllabus
announcing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks. A
forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occupants that someone
is at the door, and unless officers identify themselves loudly enough,
occupants may not know who is at their doorstep. Respondent’s test
would make it extremely difficult for officers to know how loudly they
may announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock with
out running afoul of the police-created exigency rule. And in most
cases, it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether
that threshold had been passed. Pp. 14–15.
2. Assuming that an exigency existed here, there is no evidence
that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened
to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment. Pp. 16–
19.
(a) Any question about whether an exigency existed here is bet
ter addressed by the Kentucky Supreme Court on remand. P. 17.
(b) Assuming an exigency did exist, the officers’ conduct—
banging on the door and announcing their presence—was entirely
consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Respondent has pointed to
no evidence supporting his argument that the officers made any sort
of “demand” to enter the apartment, much less a demand that
amounts to a threat to violate the Fourth Amendment. If there is
contradictory evidence that has not been brought to this Court’s at
tention, the state court may elect to address that matter on remand.
Finally, the record makes clear that the officers’ announcement that
they were going to enter the apartment was made after the exigency
arose. Pp. 17–19.
