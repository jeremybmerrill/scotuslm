KENTUCKY v. KING
Opinion of the Court

without being told they are free not to respond, hardly
eliminates the consensual nature of the response”).

Some lower courts have adopted a rule that is similar to
the one that we recognize today. See United States v.
MacDonald, 916 F. 2d 766, 772 (CA2 1990) (en banc) (law
enforcement officers “do not impermissibly create exigent
circumstances” when they “act in an entirely lawful man­
ner”); State v. Robinson, 2010 WI 80, ¶32, 327 Wis. 2d 302,
326–328, 786 N. W. 2d 463, 475–476 (2010). But others,
including the Kentucky Supreme Court, have imposed
additional requirements that are unsound and that we
now reject.
Bad faith. Some courts, including the Kentucky Su­
preme Court, ask whether law enforcement officers “ ‘de­
liberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad
faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.’ ” 302 S. W.
3d, at 656 (quoting Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 590); see also, e.g.,
Chambers, 395 F. 3d, at 566; United States v. Socey, 846
F. 2d 1439, 1448 (CADC 1988); United States v. Rengifo,
858 F. 2d 800, 804 (CA1 1988).
This approach is fundamentally inconsistent with our
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. “Our cases have re­
peatedly rejected” a subjective approach, asking only
whether “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify the
action.” ’Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 404 (alteration and
internal quotation marks omitted); see also Fisher, 558
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3–5). Indeed, we have never held,
outside limited contexts such as an “inventory search or
administrative inspection . . . , that an officer’s motive
invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the
Fourth Amendment.” Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.
806, 812 (1996); see also Brigham City, supra, at 405.
The reasons for looking to objective factors, rather than
subjective intent, are clear. Legal tests based on reason­
