Opinion of the Court

ableness are generally objective, and this Court has long
taken the view that “evenhanded law enforcement is best
achieved by the application of objective standards of con­
duct, rather than standards that depend upon the subjec­
tive state of mind of the officer.” Horton, supra, at 138.
Reasonable foreseeability. Some courts, again including
the Kentucky Supreme Court, hold that police may not
rely on an exigency if “ ‘it was reasonably foreseeable that
the investigative tactics employed by the police would
create the exigent circumstances.’ ” 302 S. W. 3d, at 656
(quoting Mann v. State, 357 Ark. 159, 172, 161 S. W. 3d
826, 834 (2004)); see also, e.g., United States v. Mowatt,
513 F. 3d 395, 402 (CA4 2008). Courts applying this
test have invalidated warrantless home searches on the
ground that it was reasonably foreseeable that police
officers, by knocking on the door and announcing their
presence, would lead a drug suspect to destroy evidence.
See, e.g., id., at 402–403; 302 S. W. 3d, at 656.
Contrary to this reasoning, however, we have rejected
the notion that police may seize evidence without a war­
rant only when they come across the evidence by happen­
stance. In Horton, as noted, we held that the police may
seize evidence in plain view even though the officers may
be “interested in an item of evidence and fully expec[t] to
find it in the course of a search.” 496 U. S., at 138.
Adoption of a reasonable foreseeability test would also
introduce an unacceptable degree of unpredictability. For
example, whenever law enforcement officers knock on the
door of premises occupied by a person who may be in­
volved in the drug trade, there is some possibility that the
occupants may possess drugs and may seek to destroy
them. Under a reasonable foreseeability test, it would be
necessary to quantify the degree of predictability that
must be reached before the police-created exigency doc­
trine comes into play.
A simple example illustrates the difficulties that such
