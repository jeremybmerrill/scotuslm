KENTUCKY v. KING
Opinion of the Court

Officer Gibbons watched the deal take place from an un­
marked car in a nearby parking lot. After the deal oc­
curred, Gibbons radioed uniformed officers to move in on
the suspect. He told the officers that the suspect was
moving quickly toward the breezeway of an apartment
building, and he urged them to “hurry up and get there”
before the suspect entered an apartment. App. 20.
In response to the radio alert, the uniformed officers

Id., at 22–23. Cobb said that “[a]s soon as [the officers]
started banging on the door,” they “could hear people
inside moving,” and “[i]t sounded as [though] things were
being moved inside the apartment.” Id., at 24. These
noises, Cobb testified, led the officers to believe that drug­
related evidence was about to be destroyed.
At that point, the officers announced that they “were
going to make entry inside the apartment.” Ibid. Cobb
