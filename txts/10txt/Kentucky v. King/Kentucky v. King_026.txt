KENTUCKY v. KING
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

The existence of a genuine emergency depends not only
on the state of necessity at the time of the warrantless
search; it depends, first and foremost, on “actions taken
by the police preceding the warrantless search.” United
States v. Coles, 437 F. 3d 361, 367 (CA3 2006). See also
United States v. Chambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 565 (CA6 2005)
(“[O]fficers must seek a warrant based on probable cause
when they believe in advance they will find contraband or
evidence of a crime.”). “[W]asting a clear opportunity to
obtain a warrant,” therefore, “disentitles the officer from
relying on subsequent exigent circumstances.” S. Saltz
burg & D. Capra, American Criminal Procedure 376 (8th
ed. 2007).
Under an appropriately reined-in “emergency” or “exi
gent circumstances” exception, the result in this case
should not be in doubt. The target of the investigation’s

tucky Supreme Court rightly determined, gave the police
“probable cause . . . sufficient . . . to obtain a warrant to
search the . . . apartment.” 302 S. W. 3d 649, 653 (2010).
As that court observed, nothing made it impracticable for
the police to post officers on the premises while proceeding
to obtain a warrant authorizing their entry. Id., at
654. Before this Court, Kentucky does not urge otherwise.
See Brief for Petitioner 35, n. 13 (asserting “[i]t should be
of no importance whether police could have obtained a
warrant”).
In Johnson, the Court confronted this scenario: standing
outside a hotel room, the police smelled burning opium
and heard “some shuffling or noise” coming from the room.
333 U. S., at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted). Could
the police enter the room without a warrant? The Court
answered no. Explaining why, the Court said:
“The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home
