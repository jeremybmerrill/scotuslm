Opinion of the Court

however, that absent “this stringent loss causation re
quirement,” it would have granted the Fund’s certification
request. Ibid.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of class certifi
cation. See 597 F. 3d 330 (CA5 2010). It confirmed that,
“[i]n order to obtain class certification on its claims, [EPJ
Fund] was required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the

Metromedia Litigation, 544 F. 3d 474, 483 (CA2 2008) (not
requiring investors to prove loss causation at class certifi

2010) (same); In re DVI, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 08–
8033 etc., 2011 WL 1125926, *7 (CA3, Mar. 29, 2011)
(same; decided after certiorari was granted).

EPJ Fund contends that the Court of Appeals erred by
requiring proof of loss causation for class certification. We
agree.
A
As noted, the sole dispute here is whether EPJ Fund
satisfied the prerequisites of Rule 23(b)(3). In order to
certify a class under that Rule, a court must find “that the
questions of law or fact common to class members pre
dominate over any questions affecting only individual
