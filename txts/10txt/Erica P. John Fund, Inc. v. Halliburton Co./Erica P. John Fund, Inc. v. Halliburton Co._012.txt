Opinion of the Court

misrepresentation does not affect market price, an inves
tor cannot be said to have relied on the misrepresentation
merely because he purchased stock at that price. If the
price is unaffected by the fraud, the price does not reflect
the fraud.
We do not accept Halliburton’s wishful interpretation of
the Court of Appeals’ opinion. As we have explained, loss
causation is a familiar and distinct concept in securities
law; it is not price impact. While the opinion below may
include some language consistent with a “price impact”
approach, see, e.g., 597 F. 3d, at 336, we simply cannot
ignore the Court of Appeals’ repeated and explicit refer
ences to “loss causation,” see id., at 334 (three times), 334
n. 2, 335, 335 n. 10 (twice), 335 n. 11, 336, 336 n. 19, 336
n. 20, 337, 338, 341 (twice), 341 n. 46, 342 n. 47, 343, 344
(three times).
Whatever Halliburton thinks the Court of Appeals
meant to say, what it said was loss causation: “[EPJ Fund]
was required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the cor
rected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the
stock price to fall and resulted in the losses.” 597 F. 3d, at
334; see id., at 335 (“we require plaintiffs to establish loss
causation in order to trigger the fraud-on-the-market
presumption” (internal quotation marks omitted)). We
take the Court of Appeals at its word. Based on those
words, the decision below cannot stand.

Because we conclude the Court of Appeals erred by
requiring EPJ Fund to prove loss causation at the certifi
cation stage, we need not, and do not, address any other
question about Basic, its presumption, or how and when it
may be rebutted. To the extent Halliburton has preserved
any further arguments against class certification, they
may be addressed in the first instance by the Court of
Appeals on remand.
