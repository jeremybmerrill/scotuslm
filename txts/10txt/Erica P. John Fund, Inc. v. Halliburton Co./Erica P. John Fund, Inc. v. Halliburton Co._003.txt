Syllabus
causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show that the misrepre
sentation caused a subsequent economic loss. That has nothing to do
with whether an investor relied on that misrepresentation in the first
place, either directly or through the fraud-on-the-market theory. The
Court of Appeals’ rule contravenes Basic’s fundamental premise—
that an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long
as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction.
Pp. 5–8.
(c) Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs should not
be required to prove loss causation in order to invoke Basic’s pre
sumption of reliance. Halliburton nonetheless defends the judgment
below on the ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually re
quire EPJ Fund to prove “loss causation” as the Court has used that
term. According to Halliburton, “loss causation” was shorthand for a
different analysis. The lower court’s actual inquiry, Halliburton in
sists, was whether EPJ Fund had demonstrated “price impact”—that
is, whether the alleged misrepresentations affected the market price
in the first place.
The Court does not accept Halliburton’s interpretation of the Court
of Appeals’ opinion. Loss causation is a familiar and distinct concept
in securities law; it is not price impact. Whatever Halliburton thinks
the Court of Appeals meant to say, what it said was loss causation.
The Court takes the Court of Appeals at its word. Based on those
words, the decision below cannot stand. Pp. 8–9.
597 F. 3d 330, vacated and remanded.
ROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
