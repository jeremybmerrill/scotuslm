ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.
Opinion of the Court

took place “between the time the misrepresentations were
made and the time the truth was revealed.” Basic, 485
U. S., at 248, n. 27; id., at 241–247; see also Stoneridge,
supra, at 159.
According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund also had to
establish loss causation at the certification stage to “trig
ger the fraud-on-the-market presumption.” 597 F. 3d, at
335 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ibid. (EPJ
Fund must “establish a causal link between the alleged
falsehoods and its losses in order to invoke the fraud-on
the-market presumption”). The court determined that, in
order to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance, EPJ
Fund needed to prove that the decline in Halliburton’s
stock was “because of the correction to a prior misleading
statement” and “that the subsequent loss could not other
wise be explained by some additional factors revealed then
to the market.” Id., at 336 (emphasis deleted). This is the
loss causation requirement as we have described it. See
Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at 342; see also 15 U. S. C.
§78u–4(b)(4).
The Court of Appeals’ requirement is not justified by
Basic or its logic. To begin, we have never before men
tioned loss causation as a precondition for invoking Basic’s
rebuttable presumption of reliance. The term “loss causa
tion” does not even appear in our Basic opinion. And for
good reason: Loss causation addresses a matter different
from whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation,
presumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a
stock.
We have referred to the element of reliance in a private Rule 10b–5 action as “transaction causation,” not loss
causation. Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at 341–342
(citing Basic, supra, at 248–249). Consistent with that
description, when considering whether a plaintiff has
relied on a misrepresentation, we have typically focused
on facts surrounding the investor’s decision to engage in
