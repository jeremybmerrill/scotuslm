ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.
Opinion of the Court

Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b–5. See 48
Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b); 17 CFR §240.10b–5 (2010).
The complaint asserts that Halliburton deliberately made
false statements about (1) the scope of its potential liabil
ity in asbestos litigation, (2) its expected revenue from
certain construction contracts, and (3) the benefits of its
merger with another company. EPJ Fund contends that
Halliburton later made a number of corrective disclosures
that caused its stock price to drop and, consequently,
investors to lose money.
After defeating a motion to dismiss, EPJ Fund sought to
have its proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 23. The parties agreed, and the District
Court held, that EPJ Fund satisfied the general require
ments for class actions set out in Rule 23(a): The class was
sufficiently numerous, there were common questions of
law or fact, the claims of the representative parties were
typical, and the representative parties would fairly and
adequately protect the interests of the class. See App. to
Pet. for Cert. 3a.
The District Court also found that the action could
proceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one
problem: Circuit precedent required securities fraud plain
tiffs to prove “loss causation” in order to obtain class certi
fication. Id., at 4a, and n. 2 (citing Oscar Private Equity
Invs. v. Allegiance Telecom, Inc., 487 F. 3d 261, 269 (CA5
2007)). As the District Court explained, loss causation is
the “ ‘causal connection between the material misrepresen
tation and the [economic] loss’ ” suffered by investors.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, and n. 3 (quoting Dura Pharma
ceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 342 (2005)). After
reviewing the alleged misrepresentations and corrective
disclosures, the District Court concluded that it could not
certify the class in this case because EPJ Fund had “failed
to establish loss causation with respect to any” of its
claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a. The court made clear,
