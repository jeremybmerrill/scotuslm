Opinion of ALITO, J.

the act of voting is not drained of its expressive content
when the vote has a legal effect. If an ordinary citizen
casts a vote in a straw poll on an important proposal
pending before a legislative body, that act indisputably
constitutes a form of speech. If a member of the legislative
body chooses to vote in the same straw poll, the legislatorâ€™s
act is no less expressive than that of an ordinary citizen.
And if the legislator then votes on the measure in the
legislative chamber, the expressive character of that vote
is not eliminated simply because it may affect the outcome
of the legislative process.
In Part III of its opinion, the Court demonstrates that
legislative recusal rules were not regarded during the
founding era as impermissible restrictions on freedom of
speech. On that basis, I agree that the judgment below
must be reversed.
