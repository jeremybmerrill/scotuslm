capacity in the decision of a question in which he is per
sonally and adversely interested”).4 Today, virtually every
State has enacted some type of recusal law, many of
which, not unlike Nevada’s, require public officials to
abstain from voting on all matters presenting a conflict
of interest. See National Conference of State Legisla
tures, Voting Recusal Provisions (2009), online at http://
www.ncsl.org/?TabID=15357 (as visited June 9, 2011, and
available in Clerk of Court’s case file).
In an attempt to combat this overwhelming evidence of
constitutional acceptability, Carrigan relies on a handful
of lower-court cases from the 1980’s and afterwards. See
Brief for Respondent 25 (citing Clark v. United States, 886
F. 2d 404 (CADC 1989); Miller v. Hull, 878 F. 2d 523 (CA1
1989); and Camacho v. Brandon, 317 F. 3d 153 (CA2
2003)). Even if they were relevant, those cases would be
too little and too late to contradict the long-recognized
need for legislative recusal. But they are not relevant.
The first was vacated as moot, see Clark v. United States,
915 F. 2d 699, 700, 706 (CADC 1990) (en banc), and the
other two involve retaliation amounting to viewpoint
discrimination. See Miller, supra, at 533; Camacho, su
pra, at 160. In the past we have applied heightened scru
tiny to laws that are viewpoint discriminatory even as to
speech not protected by the First Amendment, see R. A. V.
v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 383–386 (1992). Carrigan does

number of States enacted early judicial recusal laws as well. See,
e.g., 1797 Vt. Laws, §23, p. 178 (“[N]o justice of the peace shall take
cognizance of any cause, where he shall be within either the first,
second, third, or fourth degree of affinity, or consanguinity, to either of
the parties, or shall be directly or indirectly interested, in the cause or
matter to be determined”); 1818 Mass. Laws, §5, p. 632 (“[W]henever
any Judge of Probate shall be interested in the estate of any person
deceased, within the county of such Judge, such estate shall be settled
in the Probate Court of the most ancient next adjoining county . . .”);
Macon v. Huff, 60 Ga. 221, 223–226 (1878). See generally Frank 609–
626.
