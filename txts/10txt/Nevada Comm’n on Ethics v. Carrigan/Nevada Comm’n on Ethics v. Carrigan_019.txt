NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN
Opinion of ALITO, J.

strange understanding of the concept of speech is shown
by its suggestion that the symbolic act of burning the
American flag is speech but John Quincy Adams calling
out “yea” on the Embargo Act was not. Ibid.*
A legislative vote is not speech, the Court tells us, be
cause the vote may express, not the legislator’s sincere
personal view, but simply the view that is favored by the
legislator’s constituents. See ibid. But the same is some
times true of legislators’ speeches.
Not only is the Court incorrect in its analysis of the
expressive character of voting, but the Court’s position is
inconsistent with our reasoning just last Term in Doe v.
Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010). There, respondents argued
that “signing a petition is a legally operative legislative
act and therefore ‘does not involve any significant expres
sive element.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Brief for
Respondent Reed 31). But the Court rejected this argu
ment, stating:
“It is true that signing a referendum petition may ul
timately have the legal consequence of requiring the
secretary of state to place the referendum on the bal
lot. But we do not see how adding such legal effect to
an expressive activity somehow deprives that activity
of its expressive component, taking it outside the
scope of the First Amendment.” 561 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 6).
But cf. id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)
(slip op., at 1) (“I doubt whether signing a petition that has
the effect of suspending a law fits within ‘the freedom of
speech’ at all”).
Our reasoning in Reed is applicable here. Just as the
act of signing a petition is not deprived of its expressive
character when the signature is given legal consequences,
