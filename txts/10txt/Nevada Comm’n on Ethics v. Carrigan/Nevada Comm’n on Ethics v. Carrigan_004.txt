NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN
Opinion of the Court

281A.420(8)(a)–(d) of the law defines the term “commit
ment in a private capacity to the interests of others” to
mean a “commitment to a person” who is a member of the
officer’s household; is related by blood, adoption, or mar
riage to the officer; employs the officer or a member of his
household; or has a substantial and continuing business
relationship with the officer. Paragraph (e) of the same
subsection adds a catchall to that definition: “[a]ny other
commitment or relationship that is substantially similar”
to one of those listed in paragraphs (a)–(d).
The Ethics in Government Law is administered and
enforced by the petitioner in this litigation, the Nevada
Commission on Ethics. In 2005, the Commission initiated
an investigation of Michael Carrigan, an elected member
of the City Council of Sparks, Nevada, in response to
complaints that Carrigan had violated §281A.420(2) by
voting to approve an application for a hotel/casino project
known as the “Lazy 8.” Carrigan, the complaints asserted,
had a disabling conflict in the matter because his long
time friend and campaign manager, Carlos Vasquez,
worked as a paid consultant for the Red Hawk Land Com
pany, which had proposed the Lazy 8 project and would
benefit from its approval.
Upon completion of its investigation, the Commission
concluded that Carrigan had a disqualifying conflict of
interest under §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall provision because
his relationship with Vasquez was “substantially similar”
to the prohibited relationships listed in §281A.420(8)(a)–
(d). Its written decision censured Carrigan for failing to
abstain from voting on the Lazy 8 matter, but did not
impose a civil penalty because his violation was not will
ful, see §281A.480. (Before the hearing, Carrigan had
consulted the Sparks city attorney, who advised him that
disclosing his relationship with Vasquez before voting on
the Lazy 8 project, which he did, would satisfy his obliga
tions under the Ethics in Government Law.)
