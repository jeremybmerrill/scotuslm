NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN
Opinion of the Court

cating can be unconstitutional if the prohibition on voting
is not. And with good reason. Legislative sessions would
become massive town-hall meetings if those who had a
right to speak were not limited to those who had a right
to vote. If Carrigan was constitutionally excluded from
voting, his exclusion from “advocat[ing]” at the legislative
session was a reasonable time, place and manner limita
tion. See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,
468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984).

“[A] universal and long-established tradition of prohibit
ing certain conduct creates a strong presumption that the
prohibition is constitutional: Principles of liberty funda

U. S. 765, 785 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Laws punishing libel and obscenity are not thought to
violate “the freedom of speech” to which the First Amend
ment refers because such laws existed in 1791 and have

have not cited a single decision invalidating a generally
applicable conflict-of-interest recusal rule—and such rules
have been commonplace for over 200 years.
“[E]arly congressional enactments ‘provid[e] contempo
raneous and weighty evidence of the Constitution’s mean
ing,’ ” Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 905 (1997)
(quoting Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723–724 (1986)).
That evidence is dispositive here. Within 15 years of the
founding, both the House of Representatives and the
Senate adopted recusal rules. The House rule—to which
no one is recorded as having objected, on constitutional or
other grounds, see D. Currie, The Constitution in Con
gress: The Federalist Period 1789–1801, p. 10 (1997)—was
