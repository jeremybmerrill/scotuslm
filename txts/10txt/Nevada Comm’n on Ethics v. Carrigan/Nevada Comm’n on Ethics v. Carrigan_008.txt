NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN
Opinion of the Court

sel to a party appearing before them. Act of May 8, 1792,
ch. 36, §11, 1 Stat. 278–279. In 1821, Congress expanded
these bases for recusal to include situations in which “the
judge . . . is so related to, or connected with, either party,
as to render it improper for him, in his opinion, to sit on
the trial of such suit.” Act of Mar. 3, 1821, ch. 51, 3 Stat.
643. The statute was again expanded in 1911, to make
any “personal bias or prejudice” a basis for recusal. Act of
Mar. 3, 1911, §21, 36 Stat. 1090. The current version,
which retains much of the 1911 version’s language, is
codified at 28 U. S. C. §144. See generally Liteky v. United
States, 510 U. S. 540, 544 (1994); Frank, Disqualification
of Judges, 56 Yale L. J. 605, 626–630 (1947) (hereinafter
Frank). There are of course differences between a legisla
tor’s vote and a judge’s, and thus between legislative and
judicial recusal rules; nevertheless, there do not appear to
have been any serious challenges to judicial recusal stat
utes as having unconstitutionally restricted judges’ First
Amendment rights.3
The Nevada Supreme Court’s belief that recusal rules
violate legislators’ First Amendment rights is also incon
sistent with long-standing traditions in the States. A
number of States, by common-law rule, have long required
recusal of public officials with a conflict. See, e.g., In
re Nashua, 12 N. H. 425, 430 (1841) (“If one of the com
missioners be interested, he shall not serve”); Commis
sioners’ Court v. Tarver, 25 Ala. 480, 481 (1854) (“If any
member . . . has a peculiar, personal interest, such mem
ber would be disqualified”); Stubbs v. Florida State Fi
nance Co., 118 Fla. 450, 451, 159 So. 527, 528 (1935) (“[A]
public official cannot legally participate in his official

3 We have held that restrictions on judges’ speech during elections are
a different matter. See Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U. S.
765, 788 (2002) (holding that it violated the First Amendment to
prohibit announcement of views on disputed legal and political issues
by candidates for judicial election).
