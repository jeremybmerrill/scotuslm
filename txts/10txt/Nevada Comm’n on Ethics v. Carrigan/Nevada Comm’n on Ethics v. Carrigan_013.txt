Opinion of the Court 


V

Carrigan raises two additional arguments in his brief:
that Nevada’s catchall provision unconstitutionally bur
dens the right of association of officials and supporters,
and that the provision is unconstitutionally vague. What
ever the merits of these arguments, we have no occasion to
consider them. Neither was decided below: The Nevada
Supreme Court made no mention of the former argument
and said that it need not address the latter given its reso
lution of the overbreadth challenge, 126 Nev. ___, n. 4, 236
P. 3d, at 619, n. 4. Nor was either argument raised in
Carrigan’s brief in opposition to the petition for writ of
certiorari. Arguments thus omitted are normally consid
ered waived, see this Court’s Rule 15.2; Baldwin v. Reese,
541 U. S. 27, 34 (2004), and we find no reason to sidestep
that Rule here.

The judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
