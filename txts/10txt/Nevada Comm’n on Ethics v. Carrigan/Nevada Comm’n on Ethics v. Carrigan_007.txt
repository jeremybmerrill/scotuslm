Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of
the United States 31 (1801).

Deliberative Assemblies 30 (7th ed. 1854).
Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to judges
also date back to the founding. In 1792, Congress passed
a law requiring district court judges to recuse themselves
if they had a personal interest in a suit or had been coun
