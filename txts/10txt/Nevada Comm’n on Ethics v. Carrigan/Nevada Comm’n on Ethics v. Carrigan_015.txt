NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN
KENNEDY, J., concurring

a legislator or candidate has long and close ties, ties made
all the stronger by shared outlook and civic purpose. The
process is so intricate a part of communication in a democ
racy that it is difficult to describe in summary form, lest
its fundamental character be understated. It may suffice,
however, to note just a few examples.
Assume a citizen has strong and carefully considered
positions on family life; the environment; economic princi
ples; criminal justice; religious values; or the rights of
persons. Assume, too, that based on those beliefs, he or
she has personal ties with others who share those views.
The occasion may arise when, to promote and protect
these beliefs, close friends and associates, perhaps in
concert with organized groups with whom the citizen also
has close ties, urge the citizen to run for office. These
persons and entities may offer strong support in an elec
tion campaign, support which itself can be expression in
its classic form. The question then arises what application
the Nevada statute has if a legislator who was elected
with that support were to vote upon legislation central to
the shared cause, or, for that matter, any other cause
supported by those friends and affiliates.
As the Court notes, Nev. Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007)
provides:
“[A] public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the
passage or failure of, but may otherwise participate in
the consideration of, a matter with respect to which
the independence of judgment of a reasonable person
in his situation would be materially affected by . . .
[h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests
of others.”
There is, in my view, a serious concern that the statute
imposes burdens on the communications and expressions
just discussed. The immediate response might be that the
statute does not apply because its application is confined
