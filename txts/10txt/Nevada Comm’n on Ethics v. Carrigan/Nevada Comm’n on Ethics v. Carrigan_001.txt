NEVADA COMMISSION ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEVADA
No. 10–568.

Argued April 27, 2011—Decided June 13, 2011

Nevada’s Ethics in Government Law requires public officials to recuse
themselves from voting on, or advocating the passage or failure of, “a
matter with respect to which the independence of judgment of a rea
sonable person in his situation would be materially affected by,” inter
alia, “[h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests of oth
ers,” Nev. Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007), which includes a “commit
ment to a [specified] person,” e.g., a member of the officer’s household
or the officer’s relative, §281A.420(8)(a)–(d), and “[a]ny other com
mitment or relationship that is substantially similar” to one enumer
ated in paragraphs (a)–(d), §281A.420(8)(e).
Petitioner (Commission) administers and enforces Nevada’s law.
The Commission investigated respondent Carrigan, an elected local
official who voted to approve a hotel/casino project proposed by a
company that used Carrigan’s long-time friend and campaign man
ager as a paid consultant. The Commission concluded that Carrigan
had a disqualifying conflict of interest under §281A.420(8)(e)’s catch
all provision, and censured him for failing to abstain from voting on
the project. Carrigan sought judicial review, arguing that the Ne
vada law violated the First Amendment. The State District Court
denied the petition, but the Nevada Supreme Court reversed, holding
that voting is protected speech and that §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall
definition is unconstitutionally overbroad.
Held: The Nevada Ethics in Government Law is not unconstitutionally
overbroad. Pp. 3–11.
(a) That law prohibits a legislator who has a conflict both from vot
ing on a proposal and from advocating its passage or failure. If it was
constitutional to exclude Carrigan from voting, then his exclusion
from advocating during a legislative session was not unconstitu
tional, for it was a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation.
