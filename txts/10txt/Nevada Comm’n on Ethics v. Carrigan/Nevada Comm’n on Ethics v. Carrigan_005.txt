Opinion of the Court

Carrigan filed a petition for judicial review in the First
Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada, arguing
that the provisions of the Ethics in Government Law that
he was found to have violated were unconstitutional under
the First Amendment. The District Court denied the
petition, but a divided Nevada Supreme Court reversed.
The majority held that voting was protected by the First
Amendment, and, applying strict scrutiny, found that
§281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall definition was unconstitution

U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (quoting Bolger v. Youngs Drug
Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 65 (1983)). But the Amend

protected speech. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354
U. S. 476, 483 (1957) (obscenity not protected speech). The
Nevada Supreme Court thought a legislator’s vote to be
protected speech because voting “is a core legislative
function.” 126 Nev., at ___, 236 P. 3d, at 621 (internal
quotation marks omitted).
We disagree, for the same reason. But before discussing
that issue, we must address a preliminary detail: The
challenged law not only prohibits the legislator who has a
conflict from voting on the proposal in question, but also
forbids him to “advocate the passage or failure” of the
proposal—evidently meaning advocating its passage or
failure during the legislative debate. Neither Carrigan
nor any of his amici contend that the prohibition on advo
