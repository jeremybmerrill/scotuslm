NEVADA COMMISSION ON ETHICS, PETITIONER v.
MICHAEL A. CARRIGAN
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF 

NEVADA

[June 13, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Nevada Supreme Court invalidated a recusal provi
sion of the State’s Ethics in Government Law as unconsti
tutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.
We consider whether legislators have a personal, First
Amendment right to vote on any given matter.
I
Nevada’s Ethics in Government Law provides that “a
public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the passage
or failure of, but may otherwise participate in the con
sideration of, a matter with respect to which the inde
pendence of judgment of a reasonable person in his
situation would be materially affected by,” inter alia,
“[h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests
of others.” Nev. Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007).1 Section
——————
1 At the time of the relevant events in this case, the disclosure and
recusal provisions of the Ethics in Government Law were codified at
Nev. Rev. Stat. §281.501 (2003). They were recodified without relevant
change in 2007 at §281A.420, and all citations are to that version. The
Nevada Legislature further amended the statute in 2009, see Nev.
Stats., ch. 257, §9.5, p. 1057, but those changes are not relevant here.
