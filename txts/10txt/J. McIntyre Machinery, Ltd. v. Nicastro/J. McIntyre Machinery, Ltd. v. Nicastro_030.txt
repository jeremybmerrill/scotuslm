GINSBURG, J., dissenting

what sensible view of the allocation of adjudicatory au
thority could the place of Nicastro’s injury within the
United States be deemed off limits for his products liabil
ity claim against a foreign manufacturer who targeted the
United States (including all the States that constitute the
Nation) as the territory it sought to develop?
II
A few points on which there should be no genuine de
bate bear statement at the outset. First, all agree, McIntyre UK surely is not subject to general (all-purpose)
jurisdiction in New Jersey courts, for that foreign-country
corporation is hardly “at home” in New Jersey. See Good
year Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, post, at 2–3,
9–13. The question, rather, is one of specific jurisdiction,

underlying controversy.” Goodyear Dunlop, post, at 2

(1966) (hereinafter von Mehren & Trautman); internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Goodyear Dunlop, post,
at 7–8.
Second, no issue of the fair and reasonable allocation of
adjudicatory authority among States of the United States
is present in this case. New Jersey’s exercise of personal
jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer whose dangerous
product caused a workplace injury in New Jersey does not
tread on the domain, or diminish the sovereignty, of any
sister State. Indeed, among States of the United States,
the State in which the injury occurred would seem most
suitable for litigation of a products liability tort claim. See
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286,
297 (1980) (if a manufacturer or distributor endeavors to
develop a market for a product in several States, it is
reasonable “to subject it to suit in one of those States if its
allegedly defective [product] has there been the source of
