Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

the respondent here; J. McIntyre was a defendant and is
now the petitioner.
At oral argument in this Court, Nicastro’s counsel
stressed three primary facts in defense of New Jersey’s as
sertion of jurisdiction over J. McIntyre. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 29–30.
First, an independent company agreed to sell J. McIn

In addition to these facts emphasized by respondent, the
New Jersey Supreme Court noted that J. McIntyre held

the distributor. Id., at 55, 56, 987 A. 2d, at 579 (internal

In light of these facts, the New Jersey Supreme Court
concluded that New Jersey courts could exercise jurisdic
tion over petitioner without contravention of the Due
Process Clause. Jurisdiction was proper, in that court’s

petitioner knew or reasonably should have known “that its
