J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO
BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

agree with the plurality that the contrary judgment of the
Supreme Court of New Jersey should be reversed.
I
In asserting jurisdiction over the British Manufacturer,
the Supreme Court of New Jersey relied most heavily on
three primary facts as providing constitutionally sufficient
“contacts” with New Jersey, thereby making it fundamentally fair to hale the British Manufacturer before its
courts: (1) The American Distributor on one occasion sold
and shipped one machine to a New Jersey customer,
namely, Mr. Nicastro’s employer, Mr. Curcio; (2) the Brit
ish Manufacturer permitted, indeed wanted, its independ
ent American Distributor to sell its machines to anyone in
America willing to buy them; and (3) representatives of
the British Manufacturer attended trade shows in “such
cities as Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Orlando, San
Diego, and San Francisco.” Id., at 54–55, 987 A. 2d, at
578–579. In my view, these facts do not provide contacts
between the British firm and the State of New Jersey
constitutionally sufficient to support New Jersey’s asser
tion of jurisdiction in this case.
None of our precedents finds that a single isolated sale,
even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated
here, is sufficient. Rather, this Court’s previous holdings
suggest the contrary. The Court has held that a single
sale to a customer who takes an accident-causing product
to a different State (where the accident takes place) is not
a sufficient basis for asserting jurisdiction. See WorldWide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286 (1980).
And the Court, in separate opinions, has strongly sug
gested that a single sale of a product in a State does not
constitute an adequate basis for asserting jurisdiction over
an out-of-state defendant, even if that defendant places
his goods in the stream of commerce, fully aware (and
hoping) that such a sale will take place. See Asahi Metal
