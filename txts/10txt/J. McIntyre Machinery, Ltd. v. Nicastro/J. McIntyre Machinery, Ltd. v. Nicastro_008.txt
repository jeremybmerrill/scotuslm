J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

products are distributed through a nationwide distribution
system that might lead to those products being sold in any
of the fifty states”; and because petitioner failed to “take
some reasonable step to prevent the distribution of its prod
ucts in this State.” Id., at 77, 987 A. 2d, at 592.
Both the New Jersey Supreme Court’s holding and its
account of what it called “[t]he stream-of-commerce doc
trine of jurisdiction,” id., at 80, 987 A. 2d, at 594, were
incorrect, however. This Court’s Asahi decision may be
responsible in part for that court’s error regarding the
stream of commerce, and this case presents an opportunity
to provide greater clarity.

The Due Process Clause protects an individual’s right to
be deprived of life, liberty, or property only by the exercise
of lawful power. Cf. Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U. S.
399, 403 (1966) (The Clause “protect[s] a person against
having the Government impose burdens upon him except
in accordance with the valid laws of the land”). This is no
less true with respect to the power of a sovereign to re
solve disputes through judicial process than with respect
to the power of a sovereign to prescribe rules of conduct for
those within its sphere. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Bet
ter Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 94 (1998) (“Jurisdiction is
power to declare the law”). As a general rule, neither
statute nor judicial decree may bind strangers to the
State. Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of
Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 608–609 (1990) (opinion of SCALIA,
J.) (invoking “the phrase coram non judice, ‘before a per
son not a judge’—meaning, in effect, that the proceeding
in question was not a judicial proceeding because lawful
judicial authority was not present, and could therefore not
yield a judgment”)
A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when
the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign
