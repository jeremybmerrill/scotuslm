GINSBURG, J., dissenting

dix of illustrative cases indicates, courts presented with
von Mehren and Trautman’s first scenario—a local plain
tiff injured by the activity of a manufacturer seeking to
exploit a multistate or global market—have repeatedly
confirmed that jurisdiction is appropriately exercised by
courts of the place where the product was sold and caused
injury.

For the reasons stated, I would hold McIntyre UK an
swerable in New Jersey for the harm Nicastro suffered at
his workplace in that State using McIntyre UK’s shearing
machine. While I dissent from the Court’s judgment, I
take heart that the plurality opinion does not speak for
the Court, for that opinion would take a giant step away
from the “notions of fair play and substantial justice”
underlying International Shoe. 326 U. S., at 316 (internal
quotation marks omitted).
