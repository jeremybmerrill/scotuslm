In any event, Asahi, unlike McIntyre UK, did not itself
seek out customers in the United States, it engaged no
distributor to promote its wares here, it appeared at no
tradeshows in the United States, and, of course, it had no
Web site advertising its products to the world. Moreover,
Asahi was a component-part manufacturer with “little
control over the final destination of its products once they
were delivered into the stream of commerce.” A. Uberti,
181 Ariz., at 572, 892 P. 2d, at 1361. It was important to
the Court in Asahi that “those who use Asahi components
in their final products, and sell those products in Califor
nia, [would be] subject to the application of California tort
law.” 480 U. S., at 115 (majority opinion). To hold that
Asahi controls this case would, to put it bluntly, be dead

The Court’s judgment also puts United States plaintiffs
at a disadvantage in comparison to similarly situated
complainants elsewhere in the world. Of particular note,
within the European Union, in which the United Kingdom

worldwide, much less in any given State. By dollar value, the price of a
single machine represents a significant sale. Had a manufacturer sold
in New Jersey $24,900 worth of flannel shirts, see Nelson v. Park
Industries, Inc., 717 F. 2d 1120 (CA7 1983), cigarette lighters, see
Oswalt v. Scripto, Inc., 616 F. 2d 191 (CA5 1980), or wire-rope splices,
see Hedrick v. Daiko Shoji Co., 715 F. 2d 1355 (CA9 1983), the Court
would presumably find the defendant amenable to suit in that State.
