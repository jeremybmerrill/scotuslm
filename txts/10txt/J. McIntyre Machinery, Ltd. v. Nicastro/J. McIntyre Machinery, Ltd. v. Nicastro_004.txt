J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO
Syllabus
(b) JUSTICE BREYER would not go further. Because the incident at
issue does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual re
cord leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for
making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional
rules. At a minimum, he would not work such a change to the law in
the way either the plurality or the New Jersey Supreme Court sug
gests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary
commercial circumstances. Insofar as such considerations are rele
vant to any change in present law, they might be presented in a case
(unlike the present one) in which the Solicitor General participates.
