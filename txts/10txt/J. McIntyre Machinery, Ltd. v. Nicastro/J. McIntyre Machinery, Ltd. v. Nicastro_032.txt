GINSBURG, J., dissenting

See 326 U. S., at 316, 318; Hutchinson v. Chase & Gilbert,
45 F. 2d 139, 141 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.) (“nothing is
gained by [resort to words that] concea[l] what we do”).
“[T]he relationship among the defendant, the forum, and
the litigation” determines whether due process permits the
exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant, Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 204, and “fictions of implied consent”
or “corporate presence” do not advance the proper inquiry,
id., at 202. See also Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal.,
County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 618 (1990) (plurality
opinion) (International Shoe “cast . . . aside” fictions of
“consent” and “presence”).
Whatever the state of academic debate over the role of
consent in modern jurisdictional doctrines,4 the plurality’s
notion that consent is the animating concept draws no
support from controlling decisions of this Court. Quite the
contrary, the Court has explained, a forum can exercise
jurisdiction when its contacts with the controversy are
sufficient; invocation of a fictitious consent, the Court has
repeatedly said, is unnecessary and unhelpful. See, e.g.,
Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 472 (1985)
(Due Process Clause permits “forum . . . to assert specific
jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has not
consented to suit there”); McGee v. International Life Ins.
