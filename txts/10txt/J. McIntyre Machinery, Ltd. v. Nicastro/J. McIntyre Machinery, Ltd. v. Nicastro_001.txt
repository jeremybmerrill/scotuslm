SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Syllabus

J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO, 

INDIVIDUALLY AND AS ADMINISTRATOR OF

THE ESTATE OF NICASTRO

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY
No. 09–1343. Argued January 11, 2011—Decided June 27, 2011
Respondent Nicastro injured his hand while using a metal-shearing
machine that petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre),
manufactured in England, where the company is incorporated and
operates. Nicastro filed this products-liability suit in a state court in
New Jersey, where the accident occurred, but J. McIntyre sought to
dismiss the suit for want of personal jurisdiction. Nicastro’s jurisdic
tional claim was based on three primary facts: A U. S. distributor
agreed to sell J. McIntyre’s machines in this country; J. McIntyre of
ficials attended trade shows in several States, albeit not in New Jer
sey; and no more than four J. McIntyre machines (the record suggests
only one), including the one at issue, ended up in New Jersey. The
State Supreme Court held that New Jersey’s courts can exercise ju
risdiction over a foreign manufacturer without contravening the
Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause so long as the manu
facturer knew or reasonably should have known that its products are
distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead
to sales in any of the States. Invoking this “stream-of-commerce”
doctrine of jurisdiction, the court relied in part on Asahi Metal Indus
try Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102. Apply
ing its test, the court concluded that J. McIntyre was subject to juris
diction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in,
sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.
Held: The judgment is reversed.
