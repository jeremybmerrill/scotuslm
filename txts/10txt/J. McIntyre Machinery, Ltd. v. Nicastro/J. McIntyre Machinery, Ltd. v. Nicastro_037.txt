J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

the market of all States in which its products were sold
by its exclusive distributor. “Th[e] ‘purposeful availment’
requirement,” this Court has explained, simply “ensures
that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely
as a result of ‘random,’ ‘fortuitous,’ or ‘attenuated’ con
tacts.” Burger King, 471 U. S., at 475. Adjudicatory au
thority is appropriately exercised where “actions by the
defendant himself” give rise to the affiliation with the
forum. Ibid. How could McIntyre UK not have intended,
by its actions targeting a national market, to sell products
in the fourth largest destination for imports among all
States of the United States and the largest scrap metal
market? See supra, at 3, 10, n. 6. But see ante, at 11
(plurality opinion) (manufacturer’s purposeful efforts to
sell its products nationwide are “not . . . relevant” to the
personal jurisdiction inquiry).
Courts, both state and federal, confronting facts similar
to those here, have rightly rejected the conclusion that a
manufacturer selling its products across the USA may
evade jurisdiction in any and all States, including the
State where its defective product is distributed and causes
injury. They have held, instead, that it would undermine
principles of fundamental fairness to insulate the foreign
manufacturer from accountability in court at the place
within the United States where the manufacturer’s prod
ucts caused injury. See, e.g., Tobin v. Astra Pharmaceuti
cal Prods., Inc., 993 F. 2d 528, 544 (CA6 1993); A. Uberti
& C. v. Leonardo, 181 Ariz. 565, 573, 892 P. 2d 1354, 1362
