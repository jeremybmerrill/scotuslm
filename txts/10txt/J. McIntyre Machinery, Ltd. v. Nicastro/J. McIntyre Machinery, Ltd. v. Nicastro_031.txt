J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

injury”); 28 U. S. C. §1391(a)–(b) (in federal-court suits,
whether resting on diversity or federal-question jurisdic
tion, venue is proper in the judicial district “in which a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to
the claim occurred”).
Third, the constitutional limits on a state court’s adjudi
catory authority derive from considerations of due process,
not state sovereignty. As the Court clarified in Insurance
Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456
U. S. 694 (1982):
“The restriction on state sovereign power described in
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. . . . must be seen as ul
timately a function of the individual liberty interest
preserved by the Due Process Clause. That Clause is
the only source of the personal jurisdiction require
ment and the Clause itself makes no mention of fed
eralism concerns. Furthermore, if the federalism con
cept operated as an independent restriction on the
sovereign power of the court, it would not be possible
to waive the personal jurisdiction requirement: Indi
vidual actions cannot change the powers of sover
eignty, although the individual can subject himself to
powers from which he may otherwise be protected.”
Id., at 703, n. 10.
See also Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 204, and n. 20
(1977) (recognizing that “the mutually exclusive sover
eignty of the States [is not] the central concern of the
inquiry into personal jurisdiction”). But see ante, at 7
(plurality opinion) (asserting that “sovereign authority,”
not “fairness,” is the “central concept” in determining
personal jurisdiction).
Finally, in International Shoe itself, and decisions there
after, the Court has made plain that legal fictions, notably
“presence” and “implied consent,” should be discarded, for
they conceal the actual bases on which jurisdiction rests.
