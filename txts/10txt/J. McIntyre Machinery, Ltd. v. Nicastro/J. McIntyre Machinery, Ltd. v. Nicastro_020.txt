J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO
BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction, and here I
would take the facts precisely as the New Jersey Supreme
Court stated them. Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Com
pagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U. S. 694, 709 (1982);
Blakey v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 164 N. J. 38, 71, 751
A. 2d 538, 557 (2000); see 201 N. J., at 54–56, 987 A. 2d, at
578–579; App. to Pet. for Cert. 128a–137a (trial court’s
“reasoning and finding(s)”).
Accordingly, on the record present here, resolving this
case requires no more than adhering to our precedents.

I would not go further. Because the incident at issue in
this case does not implicate modern concerns, and because
the factual record leaves many open questions, this is an
unsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that
refashion basic jurisdictional rules.
A
The plurality seems to state strict rules that limit juris
diction where a defendant does not “inten[d] to submit to
the power of a sovereign” and cannot “be said to have
targeted the forum.” Ante, at 7. But what do those stan
dards mean when a company targets the world by selling
products from its Web site? And does it matter if, instead
of shipping the products directly, a company consigns the
products through an intermediary (say, Amazon.com) who
then receives and fulfills the orders? And what if the
company markets its products through popup advertise
ments that it knows will be viewed in a forum? Those
issues have serious commercial consequences but are
totally absent in this case.
B
But though I do not agree with the plurality’s seemingly
strict no-jurisdiction rule, I am not persuaded by the
absolute approach adopted by the New Jersey Supreme
