GINSBURG, J., dissenting

McIntyre UK dealt with the United States as a single
market. Like most foreign manufacturers, it was con
cerned not with the prospect of suit in State X as opposed
to State Y, but rather with its subjection to suit anywhere
in the United States. See Hay, Judicial Jurisdiction Over
Foreign-Country Corporate Defendants—Comments on
Recent Case Law, 63 Ore. L. Rev. 431, 433 (1984) (herein
after Hay). As a McIntyre UK officer wrote in an e-mail to
McIntyre America: “American law—who needs it?!” App.
129a–130a (e-mail dated April 26, 1999 from Sally John
son to Mary Gaither). If McIntyre UK is answerable in
the United States at all, is it not “perfectly appropriate to
permit the exercise of that jurisdiction . . . at the place of
injury”? See Hay 435; Degnan & Kane, The Exercise of
Jurisdiction Over and Enforcement of Judgments Against
Alien Defendants, 39 Hastings L. J. 799, 813–815 (1988)
(noting that “[i]n the international order,” the State that
counts is the United States, not its component States,13
and that the fair place of suit within the United States is
essentially a question of venue).
In sum, McIntyre UK, by engaging McIntyre America to
promote and sell its machines in the United States, “pur
posefully availed itself ” of the United States market na
tionwide, not a market in a single State or a discrete
collection of States. McIntyre UK thereby availed itself of
