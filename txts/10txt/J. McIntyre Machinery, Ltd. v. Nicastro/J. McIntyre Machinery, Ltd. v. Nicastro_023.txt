BREYER, J., concurring in judgment

C
At a minimum, I would not work such a change to the
law in the way either the plurality or the New Jersey
Supreme Court suggests without a better understanding
of the relevant contemporary commercial circumstances.
Insofar as such considerations are relevant to any change
in present law, they might be presented in a case (unlike
the present one) in which the Solicitor General partici
pates. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Op
erations, S. A. v. Brown, O. T. 2010, No. 10–76, pp. 20–22
(Government declining invitation at oral argument to give
its views with respect to issues in this case).
This case presents no such occasion, and so I again re
iterate that I would adhere strictly to our precedents
and the limited facts found by the New Jersey Supreme
Court. And on those grounds, I do not think we can find
jurisdiction in this case. Accordingly, though I agree with
the plurality as to the outcome of this case, I concur only
in the judgment of that opinion and not its reasoning.
