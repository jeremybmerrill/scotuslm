America, Ltd., 201 N. J. 48, 76, 77, 987 A. 2d 575, 591, 592

privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,
thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.”

products-liability case, and the so-called “stream-of
commerce” doctrine cannot displace it.

New Jersey state court. Robert Nicastro seriously injured
his hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufac

accident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was
manufactured in England, where J. McIntyre is incorpo
rated and operates. The question here is whether the New
Jersey courts have jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, notwith
standing the fact that the company at no time either
marketed goods in the State or shipped them there. Ni
