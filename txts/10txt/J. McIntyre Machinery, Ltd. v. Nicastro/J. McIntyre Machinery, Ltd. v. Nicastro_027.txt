GINSBURG, J., dissenting

McIntyre UK representatives attended every ISRI
convention from 1990 through 2005. Id., at 114a–115a.
These annual expositions were held in diverse venues
across the United States; in addition to Las Vegas, con
ventions were held 1990–2005 in New Orleans, Orlando,
San Antonio, and San Francisco. Ibid. McIntyre UK’s
president, Michael Pownall, regularly attended ISRI con
ventions. Ibid. He attended ISRI’s Las Vegas conven

earnings from sales of McIntyre UK products in the
United States “ha[d] been good” in comparison to “the rest

McIntyre UK’s Managing Director, to Gary and Mary
Gaither, officers of McIntyre UK’s exclusive distributor in

rogatories, McIntyre UK stated that its commissioning
engineer had installed the company’s equipment in several
States—Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Virginia, and Washing

From at least 1995 until 2001, McIntyre UK retained an
Ohio-based company, McIntyre Machinery America, Ltd.
(McIntyre America), “as its exclusive distributor for the en
tire United States.” Nicastro v. McIntyre Machinery
