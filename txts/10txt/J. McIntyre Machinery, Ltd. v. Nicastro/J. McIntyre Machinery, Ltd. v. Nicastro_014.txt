J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

It must be remembered, however, that although this
case and Asahi both involve foreign manufacturers, the
undesirable consequences of Justice Brennan’s approach
are no less significant for domestic producers. The owner
of a small Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby
distributor, for example, who might then distribute them
to grocers across the country. If foreseeability were the
controlling criterion, the farmer could be sued in Alaska or
any number of other States’ courts without ever leaving
town. And the issue of foreseeability may itself be con
tested so that significant expenses are incurred just on the
preliminary issue of jurisdiction. Jurisdictional rules
should avoid these costs whenever possible.
The conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant
to judgment depends on purposeful availment, consistent
with Justice O’Connor’s opinion in Asahi, does not by itself
resolve many difficult questions of jurisdiction that will
arise in particular cases. The defendant’s conduct and
the economic realities of the market the defendant seeks
to serve will differ across cases, and judicial exposition
will, in common-law fashion, clarify the contours of that
principle.
III
In this case, petitioner directed marketing and sales
efforts at the United States. It may be that, assuming it
were otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject, the
Congress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in
appropriate courts. That circumstance is not presented in
this case, however, and it is neither necessary nor appro
priate to address here any constitutional concerns that
might be attendant to that exercise of power. See Asahi,
480 U. S., at 113, n. Nor is it necessary to determine what
substantive law might apply were Congress to authorize
jurisdiction in a federal court in New Jersey. See Hanson,
357 U. S., at 254 (“The issue is personal jurisdiction, not
