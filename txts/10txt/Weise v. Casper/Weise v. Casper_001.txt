GINSBURG, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
LESLIE WEISE ET AL. v. MICHAEL CASPER ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–67. Decided October 12, 2010


The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR
joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
The President of the United States gave a speech open
to the public, from which Leslie Weise and Alex Young
allege they were forcibly ejected. Their transgression was
to have arrived at the event in a car that displayed a
bumper sticker reading “No More Blood For Oil.” After
they were marched out, they allege, Secret Service officials
confirmed to them that the bumper sticker was the reason
for their exclusion.
I cannot see how reasonable public officials, or any staff
or volunteers under their direction, could have viewed the
bumper sticker as a permissible reason for depriving
Weise and Young of access to the event. Nevertheless, the
Court of Appeals held respondents entitled to qualified
immunity because “no specific authority instructs this
court . . . how to treat the ejection of a silent attendee from
an official speech based on the attendee’s protected ex
pression outside the speech area.” 593 F. 3d 1163, 1170
(CA10 2010). No “specific authority” should have been
needed; “[f]or at least a [half]-century, this Court has
made clear that . . . [the government] may not deny a
benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitu
tionally protected interests.” Perry v. Sindermann, 408
U. S. 593, 597 (1972). As Judge Holloway noted in his
incisive dissent, solidly established law “may apply with
obvious clarity” even to conduct startling in its novelty.
