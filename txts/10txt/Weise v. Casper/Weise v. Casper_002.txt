WEISE v. CASPER
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

593 F. 3d, at 1177 (quoting Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730,
741 (2002); emphasis deleted).
The Court of Appeals suggested that this Court’s deci
sion in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisex
ual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995), could have
justified a decision to exclude individuals who appear to
disagree with the President’s views. But the comparison
serves only to highlight the unlawfulness of Weise’s and
Young’s alleged treatment: Not only was this an official
presentation of the President’s views, not a private act of
expression as in Hurley; in addition, unlike the Hurley
plaintiff who sought to engage in competing expression,
Weise and Young were “silent attendee[s],” 593 F. 3d, at
1170 (emphasis added). Their presence alone cannot have
affected the President’s message. Therefore, ejecting them
for holding discordant views could only have been a repri
sal for the expression conveyed by the bumper sticker.
“Official reprisal for protected speech ‘offends the Consti
tution because it threatens to inhibit exercise of the pro
tected right.’ ” Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, 256
(2006) (quoting Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 588,
n. 10 (1998); brackets omitted).
I see only one arguable reason for deferring the question
this case presents. Respondents were volunteers following
instructions from White House officials. The Volunteer
Protection Act of 1997, 111 Stat. 218, 42 U. S. C. §14501 et
seq., had respondents invoked it in the courts below, might
have shielded them from liability. Federal officials them
selves, however, gain no shelter from that Act. Suits
against the officials responsible for Weise’s and Young’s
ouster remain pending and may offer this Court an oppor
tunity to take up the issue avoided today.
