ALITO, J., dissenting

infringer actually see a material object with the copyright
notice. It is enough that the infringer could have ascer
tained that the work was copyrighted.2 The Fifth Circuit
did not specify what sort of inquiry a person who
downloads digital music files is required to make in order
to preserve the §402(d) defense, but it may be that the
court had in mind such things as research on the Internet
or a visit to a local store in search of a compact disc con
taining the songs in question. In any event, the Court of
Appeals rejected petitioner’s argument that her youth and
lack of legal sophistication were relevant considerations—
a conclusion that would not necessarily be correct if the
determinative question were simply whether petitioner
had “reason to believe” that her actions were illegal.
Although “reason to believe” is an objective standard, it is
by no means clear that certain objective characteristics of
the infringer—such as age—may not be taken into ac
count.
The Fifth Circuit’s decision may or may not set out a
sensible rule for the post-“phonorecord” age, but it is at
least questionable whether the decision correctly inter
prets §402(d). Although there are now no conflicting
Circuit decisions, I would grant review in this case be
cause not many cases presenting this issue are likely to
reach the Courts of Appeals. The Court has decided not to
grant review at this time, but if a conflict in the Circuits
develops in the future, the question presented, in my
judgment, is important enough to warrant review.

cuit adopted a similar interpretation of §402(d).
