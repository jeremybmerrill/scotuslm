ALITO, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
WHITNEY HARPER v. MAVERICK RECORDING 

COMPANY ET AL. 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–94. Decided November 29, 2010 


The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
I would grant the petition to consider the question
whether 17 U. S. C. §402(d) applies when a person is
found to have engaged in copyright infringement by down
loading digital music files. Under §504(c)(1), an infringer
is ordinarily liable for statutory damages of “not less than
$750 or more than $30,000” per work infringed. In a case
involving an “innocent infringer,” however, the minimum
statutory damages that must be awarded are reduced.
Specifically, if the infringer proves that he or she “was not
aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts
constituted an infringement,” then the minimum statutory
damages per violation are $200. §504(c)(2).
In this case, a 16-year-old was found to have infringed
respondents’ copyrights by downloading digital music files.
The District Court held that there were genuine issues of
fact on whether she qualified as an innocent infringer, but
the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that another
provision, §402(d) foreclosed the innocent-infringer de
fense as a matter of law. Section 402(d) provides, with an
exception not relevant here, that if a prescribed notice of
copyright “appears on the published phonorecord or
phonorecords to which a defendant . . . had access, then no
weight shall be given to . . . a defendant’s interposition of a
defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of
actual or statutory damages.” (Emphasis added.) The
