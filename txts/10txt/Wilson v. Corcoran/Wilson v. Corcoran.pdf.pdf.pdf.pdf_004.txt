WILSON v. CORCORAN
Per Curiam

On remand—and without any opportunity for briefing
by the parties—the Court of Appeals changed course and
granted habeas relief. Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 593 F. 3d
547, 555 (2010). After determining that respondent’s
sentencing challenge had been waived by his failure to
include it in his original cross-appeal, the Seventh Circuit
concluded that the claim satisfied plain-error review. Id.,
at 551. The panel explained that, “unlike the Indiana
Supreme Court,” it was unsatisfied with the trial court’s
representation that it relied only on aggravating factors
authorized by Indiana law. Ibid. Because the trial court’s
revised sentencing order said that it used the nonstatutory
factors of heinousness, victims’ innocence, and future
dangerousness to determine the weight given to the ag
gravator of multiple murders, the Seventh Circuit con

“ ‘unreasonable determination of the facts’ ” when it ac
cepted the trial court’s representation that it did not rely
on those factors as aggravating circumstances. Ibid.
(quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)). The panel therefore
required the Indiana trial court to reconsider its sentenc

with Indiana law.” 593 F. 3d, at 552–553.
But it is only noncompliance with federal law that ren

attack in the federal courts. The habeas statute unambi
guously provides that a federal court may issue the writ to
a state prisoner “only on the ground that he is in custody
in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the
United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(a). And we have re
peatedly held that “ ‘federal habeas corpus relief does not
lie for errors of state law.’ ” Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S.
62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780
(1990)). “[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court
to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law
questions.” 502 U. S., at 67–68. But here, the panel’s
