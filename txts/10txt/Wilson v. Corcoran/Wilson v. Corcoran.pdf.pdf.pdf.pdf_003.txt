Per Curiam

grounds for relief, including a renewed claim that, not
withstanding its assurances to the contrary, the trial court
improperly relied on nonstatutory aggravating factors
when it resentenced him. Respondent also asserted that
this reliance violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend
ments. Record, Doc. 13, p. 11. In its response to the peti
tion, the State specifically disputed that contention. Id.,
Doc. 33, p. 16 (“[Respondent] fails to establish any consti
tutional deficiency in [the] Indiana Supreme Court’s re
view of the trial court’s treatment of Corcoran’s sentence
on remand, let alone does it show that the state supreme
court’s judgment is in any way inconsistent with applica
ble United States Supreme Court precedent”).
The District Court, however, had no need to resolve this
dispute because it granted habeas relief on a wholly dif
ferent ground: that an offer by the prosecutor to take the
death penalty off the table in exchange for a waiver of a
jury trial had violated the Sixth Amendment. Corcoran v.
Buss, 483 F. Supp. 2d 709, 725–726 (2007). It did not
address the sentencing challenge because that was “ren
dered moot” by the grant of habeas relief. Id., at 734.
The State appealed, and the Seventh Circuit reversed
the District Court’s Sixth Amendment ruling. Corcoran v.
Buss, 551 F. 3d 703, 712, 714 (2008). Then, evidently
overlooking respondent’s remaining sentencing claims, the
Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the District Court
“with instructions to deny the writ.” Id., at 714. To cor
rect this oversight, we granted certiorari and vacated the
Seventh Circuit’s judgment. Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 558
U. S. 1 (2009) (per curiam). We explained that the Court
of Appeals “should have permitted the District Court to
consider Corcoran’s unresolved challenges to his death
sentence on remand, or should have itself explained why
such consideration was unnecessary.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,
at 2).
