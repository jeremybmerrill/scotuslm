SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
BILL K. WILSON, SUPERINTENDANT, INDIANA

No. 10–91. Decided November 8, 2010 


PER CURIAM.
Federal courts may not issue writs of habeas corpus to

death.
But on appeal, the Supreme Court of Indiana vacated
the sentence out of concern that the trial judge might have
violated Indiana law by relying partly on nonstatutory
aggravating factors when imposing the death penalty.

makes you, Mr. Corcoran, a very dangerous, evil mass
murderer. And I am convinced in my heart of hearts,
