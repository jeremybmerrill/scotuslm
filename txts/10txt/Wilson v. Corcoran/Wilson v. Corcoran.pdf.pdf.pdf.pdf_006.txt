WILSON v. CORCORAN
Per Curiam

28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) [sic]. (It will also prevent non
compliance with Indiana law. [Corcoran] contended
that, under the circumstances of this case, noncompli
ance with state law also violates the federal Constitu
tion and thus warrants him relief under 28 U. S. C.
§2254(d)(2). [The State] has not advanced any con
trary argument based on Wainwright v. Goode, 464
U. S. 78 (1983), or any similar decision.)” App. to Pet.
for Cert. 144a–145a.
The amendment did not cure the defect. It is not
enough to note that a habeas petitioner asserts the exis
tence of a constitutional violation; unless the federal court
agrees with that assertion, it may not grant relief. The
Seventh Circuit’s opinion reflects no such agreement, nor
does it even articulate what federal right was allegedly
infringed. In fact, as to one possible federal claim, the
court maintains that it would not violate federal law for
Indiana to adopt a rule authorizing what the trial court
did. 593 F. 3d, at 551–552.
In lieu of finding or even describing a constitutional
error, the amended opinion says only that the State had
not “advanced any contrary argument based on Wain
wright v. Goode . . . or any similar decision.” App. to Pet.
for Cert. 145a. It is not clear what this language was
meant to convey. It cannot have meant that the State
forfeited the position that respondent’s allegations do not
state a constitutional violation, since (as we observed) the
State explicitly disputed that point before the District
Court—the last forum in which the subject had been
raised, leading the Court of Appeals to conclude that
respondent had waived the claim entirely. 593 F. 3d, at
551. And there is no suggestion that the State has ever
conceded the existence of a federal right to be sentenced in
accordance with Indiana law. Under those circumstances,
it was improper for the Court of Appeals to issue the writ
