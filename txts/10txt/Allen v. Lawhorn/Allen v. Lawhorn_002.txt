ALLEN v. LAWHORN
SCALIA, J., dissenting

Lawhorn was arrested for the crime and made a full
confession. An Alabama jury found him guilty of capital
murder. During the sentencing phase, Lawhorn’s lawyer
gave an opening argument, detailing the mitigating fac
tors that would be established by the forthcoming testi
mony. Lawhorn’s mother, sister, junior high school prin
cipal, and juvenile probation officer then testified on the
defendant’s behalf. Lawhorn himself also gave a brief
statement to the jury, saying that he knew his actions
were wrong and asking them to “ ‘please have mercy on
me.’ ” Id., at 1280. At the close of the testimony, Law
horn’s counsel waived his right to closing argument; his
ensuing objection to the prosecutor’s making closing ar
gument was overruled.
The jury made a recommendation of death, which the
trial judge accepted. The Alabama Court of Criminal
Appeals and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed the
conviction and sentence. See Lawhorn v. State, 581 So. 2d
1159 (1990); Ex parte Lawhorn, 581 So. 2d 1179 (1991).
We denied Lawhorn’s petition for certiorari. 502 U. S. 970
(1991).
Lawhorn moved in state court for postconviction relief.
He contended, as relevant here, that his lawyer’s failure to
give a closing argument in the sentencing phase consti
tuted ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v.
Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The trial court—the
same court that had imposed the death sentence—denied
the motion, on dual grounds that counsel’s waiver of clos
ing argument was a reasonable strategic decision, and
that Lawhorn had failed to establish prejudice from the
waiver. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed,
Lawhorn v. State, 756 So. 2d 971 (1999). The Supreme
Court of Alabama denied certiorari, No. 1982018 (Jan. 7,
2000), as did we, 531 U. S. 835 (2000).
Lawhorn then sought federal habeas relief. The District
Court set aside both the conviction and the sentence.
