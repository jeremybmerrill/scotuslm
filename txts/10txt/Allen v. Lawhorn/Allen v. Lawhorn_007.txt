SCALIA, J., dissenting

It has been over 21 years since Lawhorn was sentenced
to death. Alabama should be not barred from carrying out
its judgment based on a federal court’s lawless specula
tion. I would not dissent from denial of certiorari if what
happened here were an isolated judicial error. It is not.
With distressing frequency, especially in capital cases
such as this, federal judges refuse to be governed by Con
gress’s command that state criminal judgments must not
be revised by federal courts unless they are “contrary to,
or involv[e] an unreasonable application of, clearly estab
lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of
the United States,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) (emphasis
added). We invite continued lawlessness when we permit
a patently improper interference with state justice such as
that which occurred in this case to stand. We should
grant Alabama’s petition for certiorari and summarily
reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.
