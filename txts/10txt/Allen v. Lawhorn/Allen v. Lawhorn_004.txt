ALLEN v. LAWHORN
SCALIA, J., dissenting

state court’s conclusion. Lawhorn does not deny that the
Eleventh Circuit was required to grant deference, but
contends that it did so. He acknowledges that in its dis
cussion of the prejudice claim the Court of Appeals did not
so much as cite AEDPA, but argues that “[t]his Court has
never required any magical incantation of the terms of
§2254(d)(1) in habeas corpus appeals” and that “[i]t is
unreasonable as a matter of law to suggest that [the Elev
enth] Circuit . . . is unfamiliar with or did not apply
§2254(d).” Brief in Opposition 25–26.
If indeed Lawhorn is correct that the Eleventh Circuit
attempted to apply §2254(d), it is clear that the attempt
failed. As we have repeatedly explained, AEDPA imposes
a “highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court
rulings, and demands that state-court decisions be given
the benefit of the doubt.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 5) (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted); accord, Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S.
___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10–11); Schriro v. Landrigan,
550 U. S. 465, 473 (2007); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S.
19, 24–25 (2002) (per curiam); Williams v. Taylor, 529
U. S. 362, 410–411 (2000). The doubt of which the Ala
bama Court of Criminal Appeals was to be given the bene
fit was particularly expansive in this case, since none of
our cases has ever considered whether the failure to give a
closing argument can be considered prejudicial under
Strickland. Accordingly, only the standard for ineffective
assistance set forth in Strickland itself could be applied;
and as we have explained, “because the Strickland stan
dard is a general standard, a state court has even more
latitude to reasonably determine that a defendant has not
satisfied that standard.” Knowles, supra, at ___ (slip op.,
at 11). “[T]he more general the rule at issue—and thus
the greater the potential for reasoned disagreement
among fair-minded judges—the more leeway state courts
have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determina
