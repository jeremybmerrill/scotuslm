SCALIA, J., dissenting

Lawhorn v. Haley, 323 F. Supp. 2d 1158 (ND Ala. 2004).
A panel of the Eleventh Circuit reversed with regard to
the conviction, but affirmed with regard to the sentence.
519 F. 3d 1272. With regard to the latter, it sustained the
District Court’s finding that counsel’s failure to give a
closing argument was not a reasonable strategic decision,
but rested on the erroneous belief that that would pre
clude closing argument by the prosecutor; and it sustained
the District Court’s conclusion that Lawhorn had been
prejudiced by counsel’s failure. The Eleventh Circuit
denied the State’s petitions for panel rehearing, No. 04–
11711 (Mar. 31, 2010) (per curiam), App. to Pet. for Cert.
197a, and rehearing en banc, No. 04–11711 (Mar. 29,
2010), App. to Pet. for Cert. 220a–221a—after, I may note,
an unexplained delay of over two years.
The State now petitions for certiorari. It does not chal
lenge the Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion that counsel’s
performance was deficient; it contends only that it was
error to find that Lawhorn had established prejudice.

claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State
court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim
. . . resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or in
volved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab
lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).
The State contends that the Eleventh Circuit errone
ously considered the claim of prejudice de novo, rather
than granting the deference mandated by AEDPA to the
