SCALIA, J., dissenting

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
RICHARD F. ALLEN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA 

DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. v. 

JAMES CHARLES LAWHORN 

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–24. Decided December 13, 2010 


The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is
denied.
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and
JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
Respondent James Lawhorn was sentenced to death by
an Alabama court in 1989. Nearly two decades later, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
granted him habeas relief on the ground that his counsel
had rendered ineffective assistance at the sentencing
hearing by failing to make a closing argument. In my
view that decision was patently wrong: The court had no
basis in law for setting aside the state courts’ judgment
that respondent had failed to establish a probable effect of
that failure upon the outcome. I dissent from the Court’s
decision not to grant certiorari and summarily reverse the
Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.

In March 1988, Altion Maxine Walker offered to pay her
nephews, James Lawhorn and his brother Mac Lawhorn,
$100 in exchange for murdering her boyfriend, William
Berry. The Lawhorns accepted. After they ambushed
Berry, Mac Lawhorn shot him, causing him to fall. James
Lawhorn (hereinafter Lawhorn) then heard Berry making
“ ‘gurgling noises’ ” and shot him repeatedly “ ‘to make sure
he was dead.’ ” 519 F. 3d 1272, 1278 (CA11 2008).
