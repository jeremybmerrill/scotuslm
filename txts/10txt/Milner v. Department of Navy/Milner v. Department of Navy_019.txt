MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
Opinion of the Court

to define its scope—does nothing more than state the
truism that in an agency it is “personnel” who follow
internal rules and practices.
And this odd reading would produce a sweeping exemp
tion, posing the risk that FOIA would become less a dis
closure than “a withholding statute.” Mink, 410 U. S., at
79. Many documents an agency generates in some way
aid employees in carrying out their responsibilities. If
Exemption 2 were to reach all these records, it would tend
to engulf other FOIA exemptions, rendering ineffective the
limitations Congress placed on their application. Exemp
tion 7, for example, shields records compiled for law en
forcement purposes, but only if one of six specified criteria
is met. §552(b)(7). Yet on the Government’s view, an
agency could bypass these restrictions by invoking Exemp
tion 2 whenever law enforcement records guide personnel
in performing their duties. Indeed, an agency could use
Exemption 2 as an all-purpose back-up provision to with
hold sensitive records that do not fall within any of FOIA’s
more targeted exemptions.9

dissent asserts that “30 years of experience” with a more expan
sive interpretation of the exemption suggests no “seriou[s] inter
fere[nce] with . . . FOIA’s informational objectives.” Post, at 6. But
those objectives suffer any time an agency denies a FOIA request based
on an improper interpretation of the statute. To give just one example,
the U. S. Forest Service has wrongly invoked Exemption 2 on multiple
occasions to withhold information about (of all things) bird nesting
sites. See Audubon Society v. Forest Serv., 104 F. 3d 1201, 1203 (CA10
1997); Maricopa Audubon Soc. v. Forest Serv., 108 F. 3d 1082, 1084
(CA9 1997). And recent statistics raise a concern that federal agencies
may too readily use Exemption 2 to refuse disclosure. According to
amicus Public Citizen, “while reliance on exemptions overall rose 83%
from 1998 to 2006, reliance on Exemption 2 rose 344% during that
same time period.” Brief for Public Citizen et al. as Amici Curiae 24.
In 2009 alone, federal departments cited Exemption 2 more than 72,000
times to prevent access to records. See Brief for Allied Daily Newspa
pers of Washington et al. as Amici Curiae 3. We do not doubt that
many of these FOIA denials were appropriate. But we are unable to
