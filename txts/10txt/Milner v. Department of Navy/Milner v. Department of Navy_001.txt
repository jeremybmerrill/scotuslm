MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 09–1163. Argued December 1, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to
make Government records available to the public, subject to nine ex
emptions. This case concerns Exemption 2, which protects from dis
closure material “related solely to the internal personnel rules and
practices of an agency.” 5 U. S. C.§552(b)(2). This provision replaced
an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) exemption for “any matter
relating solely to the internal management of an agency,” 5 U. S. C.
§1002 (1964 ed.). Congress believed that the “sweep” of the phrase
“internal management” had led to excessive withholding, and drafted
Exemption 2 “to have a narrower reach.” Department of Air Force v.
Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 362–363.
In Rose, the Court found that Exemption 2 could not be invoked to
withhold Air Force Academy honor and ethics hearing summaries.
The exemption, the Court suggested, primarily targets material con
cerning employee relations or human resources. But the Court stated
a possible caveat: That understanding of the provision’s coverage
governed “at least where the situation is not one where disclosure
may risk circumvention of agency regulation.” Id., at 369. The D. C.
Circuit subsequently converted this caveat into a new definition of
Exemption 2’s scope, finding that the exemption also covered any
“predominantly internal” materials whose disclosure would “signifi
cantly ris[k] circumvention of agency regulation or statutes.” Crooker
v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 670 F. 2d 1051, 1056–
1057, 1074. Courts now use the term “Low 2” for human resources
and employee relations records and “High 2” for records whose disclo
sure would risk circumvention of the law.
