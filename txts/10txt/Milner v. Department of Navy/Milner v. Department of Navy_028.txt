MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
BREYER, J., dissenting

Dirksen v. HHS, 803 F. 2d 1456, 1458 (CA9 1986). Three
Circuits adopted a different approach in the 1970’s before
Crooker was decided, see ante, at 3–4, n. 2, but I read
subsequent decisions in two of those Circuits as not adher
ing to their early positions. See Abraham & Rose, PLC v.
United States, 138 F. 3d 1075, 1080–1081 (CA6 1998)
(finding Crooker’s textual analysis “sound and persuasive,”
and noting that FBI symbols “used internally to identify
confidential sources” may be withheld); Sladek v.
Bensinger, 605 F. 2d 899, 902 (CA5 1979) (expressly re
serving judgment on the Crooker issue). As for the re
maining Circuit, its district courts understand Crooker
now to apply. See, e.g., Gavin v. SEC, No. 04–4522, 2007
WL 2454156, *5–*6 (D Minn., Aug. 23, 2007); see also
McQueen v. United States, 264 F. Supp. 2d 502, 528 (SD
Tex. 2003), aff’d, 100 Fed. Appx. 964 (CA5 2004) (per
curiam); Tickel v. IRS, No. 1–85–709, 1986 WL 14436, *2–
*3 (ED Tenn., Aug. 22, 1986). I recognize that there is
reasonable ground for disagreement over the precise
status of certain pre-Crooker precedents, but the Crooker
interpretation of Exemption 2 has guided nearly every
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case decided over the
last 30 years. See generally Dept. of Justice, Guide to
Freedom of Information Act, pp. 184–206 (2009) (FOIA
Guide) (identifying over 100 district court decisions apply
ing the Crooker approach, and one appearing to reject it).
Congress, moreover, well aware of Crooker, left Exemp
tion 2, 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(2), untouched when it amended
the FOIA five years later. See S. Rep. No. 98–221, p. 25
(1983) (discussing Crooker); Freedom of Information Re
form Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207–48 (amending Exemption
7, 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7)).
This Court has found that circumstances of this kind
offer significant support for retaining an interpretation of
a statute that has been settled by the lower courts. See
General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S.
