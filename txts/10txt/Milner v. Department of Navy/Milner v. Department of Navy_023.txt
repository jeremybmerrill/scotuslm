GLEN SCOTT MILNER, PETITIONER v. DEPARTMENT
OF THE NAVY
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[March 7, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO, concurring.
I agree with the Court that the text of Exemption 2 of
the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 cannot support
the “High 2” interpretation that courts have adopted and
applied over the years. As the Court explains, however,
the Government may avail itself of numerous other ex
emptions, see ante, at 18—exemptions that may have been
overshadowed in recent years by the broad reach of High
2. I write separately to underscore the alternative argu
ment that the Navy raised below, which rested on Exemp
tion 7(F) and which will remain open on remand. See
ante, at 5, n. 3, 18.
Exemption 7 applies to specific categories of information
“compiled for law enforcement purposes.” 5 U. S. C.
§552(b)(7). In particular, Exemption 7(F) permits with
holding of “records or information compiled for law en
forcement purposes” that, if disclosed, “could reasonably
be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any
individual.” §552(b)(7)(F). In most cases involving secu
rity information, it is not difficult to show that disclosure
may “endanger the life or physical safety of any individ
ual.” A more difficult question, however, is whether the
information is “compiled for law enforcement purposes.”
