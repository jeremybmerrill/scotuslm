are settled.
That is why: Where the courts have already interpreted
Exemption 2, where that interpretation has been consis

gress has taken note of that interpretation in amending
other parts of the statute, where that interpretation is
reasonable, where it has proved practically helpful and
achieved commonsense results, where it is consistent with
the FOIAâ€™s overall statutory goals, where a new and dif

and where that new interpretation would require Con
gress to act just to preserve a decades-long status quo,
I would let sleeping legal dogs lie.
For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.
