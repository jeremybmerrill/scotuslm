MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
Opinion of the Court

ness of law enforcement agencies”). And we acknowledge
that our decision today upsets three decades of agency
practice relying on Crooker, and therefore may force con
siderable adjustments.
We also note, however, that the Government has other
tools at hand to shield national security information and
other sensitive materials. Most notably, Exemption 1 of
FOIA prevents access to classified documents. §552(b)(1);
see 575 F. 3d, at 980 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting) (Exemp
tion 1 is “specifically designed to allow government agen
cies to withhold information that might jeopardize our
national security”). The Government generally may clas
sify material even after receiving a FOIA request, see
Exec. Order No. 13526, §1.7(d), 75 Fed. Reg. 711 (2009);
an agency therefore may wait until that time to decide
whether the dangers of disclosure outweigh the costs of
classification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30. Exemption 3
also may mitigate the Government’s security concerns.
That provision applies to records that any other statute
exempts from disclosure, §552(b)(3), thus offering Con
gress an established, streamlined method to authorize the
withholding of specific records that FOIA would not oth
erwise protect. And Exemption 7, as already noted, pro
tects “information compiled for law enforcement purposes”
that meets one of six criteria, including if its release “could
reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical
safety of any individual.” §552(b)(7)(F). The Navy argued
below that the ESQD data and maps fall within Exemp
tion 7(F), see n. 3, supra, and that claim remains open for
the Ninth Circuit to address on remand.
If these or other exemptions do not cover records whose
release would threaten the Nation’s vital interests, the
Government may of course seek relief from Congress. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. All we hold today is that Congress has
not enacted the FOIA exemption the Government desires.
