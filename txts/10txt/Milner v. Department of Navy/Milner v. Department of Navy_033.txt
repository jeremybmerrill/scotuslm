BREYER, J., dissenting

In other Exemption 2 cases, where withholding may
seem less reasonable, the courts have ordered disclosure.
Cf. ante, at 16, n. 9 (citing Audubon Society v. Forest Serv.,
104 F. 3d 1201, 1203 (CA10 1997), and Maricopa Audubon
Soc. v. Forest Serv., 108 F. 3d 1082, 1084 (CA9 1997)). See
generally FOIA Guide 201, and n. 106 (citing nine deci
sions applying the Crooker approach but nonetheless
requiring disclosure).
The majority acknowledges that “our decision today
upsets three decades of agency practice relying on Crooker,
and therefore may force considerable adjustments.” Ante,
at 18. But how are these adjustments to be made? Should
the Government rely upon other exemptions to provide the
protection it believes necessary? As JUSTICE ALITO notes,
Exemption 7 applies where the documents consist of “re
cords or information compiled for law enforcement pur
poses” and release would, e.g., “disclose techniques and
procedures for law enforcement investigations,” or “could
reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical
safety of any individual.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7). But what
about information that is not compiled for law enforce
ment purposes, such as building plans, computer pass
words, credit card numbers, or safe deposit combinations?
The Government, which has much experience litigating
FOIA cases, warns us that Exemption 7 “targets only a
subset of the important agency functions that may be
circumvented.” Brief for Respondent 52–53. Today’s
decision only confirms this point, as the Court’s insistence
on narrow construction might persuade judges to avoid
reading Exemption 7 broadly enough to provide Crooker
type protection.
The majority suggests that the Government can classify
documents that should remain private. Ante, at 18. See 5
U. S. C. §552(b)(1) (permitting withholding of material
“properly classified” as authorized to be “kept secret in the
interest of national defense or foreign policy”). But classi
