Opinion of the Court

Interpreted in this way, Exemption 2—call it “Super 2”
now—would extend, rather than narrow, the APA’s former
exemption for records relating to the “internal manage
ment of an agency.” 5 U. S. C. §1002 (1964 ed.). We doubt
that even the “internal management” provision, which
Congress thought allowed too much withholding, see
supra, at 2, would have protected all information that
guides employees in the discharge of their duties, includ
ing the explosives data and maps in this case. And per
haps needless to say, this reading of Exemption 2 violates
the rule favoring narrow construction of FOIA exemptions.
See, e.g., Abramson, 456 U. S., at 630; Rose, 425 U. S., at
361. Super 2 in fact has no basis in the text, context, or
purpose of FOIA, and we accordingly reject it.
V
Although we cannot interpret Exemption 2 as the Gov
ernment proposes, we recognize the strength of the Navy’s
interest in protecting the ESQD data and maps and other
similar information. The Government has informed us
that “[p]ublicly disclosing the [ESQD] information would
significantly risk undermining the Navy’s ability to safely
and securely store military ordnance,” Brief for Respon
dent 47, and we have no reason to doubt that representa
tion. The Ninth Circuit similarly cautioned that disclo
sure of this information could be used to “wrea[k] havoc”
and “make catastrophe more likely.” 575 F. 3d, at 971.
Concerns of this kind—a sense that certain sensitive
information should be exempt from disclosure—in part led
the Crooker court to formulate the High 2 standard. See
670 F. 2d, at 1074 (contending that “common sense” sup
ported the High 2 interpretation because Congress would
not have wanted FOIA to “undermin[e] . . . the effective
——————
accept the dissent’s unsupported declaration that a sweeping construc
tion of Exemption 2 has not interfered with Congress’s goal of broad
disclosure.
