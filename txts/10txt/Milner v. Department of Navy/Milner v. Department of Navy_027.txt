GLEN SCOTT MILNER, PETITIONER v. DEPARTMENT
OF THE NAVY
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[March 7, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.
Justice Stevens has explained that, once “a statute has
been construed, either by this Court or by a consistent
course of decision by other federal judges and agencies,” it
can acquire a clear meaning that this Court should hesi
tate to change. See Shearson/American Express Inc. v.
McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 268 (1987) (opinion concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added). See also
Commissioner v. Fink, 483 U. S. 89, 104 (1987) (Stevens,
J., dissenting); B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial
Process 149 (1921). I would apply that principle to this
case and accept the 30-year-old decision by the D. C. Cir
cuit in Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms,
670 F. 2d 1051 (1981) (en banc), as properly stating the
law.
For one thing, the Crooker decision, joined by 9 of the 10
sitting Circuit Judges, has been consistently followed, or
favorably cited, by every Court of Appeals to have consid
ered the matter during the past 30 years. See ibid. (writ
ten by Judge Edwards, and joined by Chief Judge Robin
son and Judges Wright, MacKinnon, Robb, Wald, Mikva,
and then-Judge Ginsburg, with Judge Tamm concurring
in the result and Judge Wilkey dissenting); Massey v. FBI,
3 F. 3d 620, 622 (CA2 1993); Kaganove v. EPA, 856 F. 2d
884, 889 (CA7 1988), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 1011 (1989);
