MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
ALITO, J., concurring

example, documents originally gathered for routine busi
ness purposes may fall within Exemption 7 if they are
later compiled for use in a criminal investigation. Simi
larly, federal building plans and related information—
which may have been compiled originally for architectural
planning or internal purposes—may fall within Exemption
7 if that information is later compiled and given to law
enforcement officers for security purposes.
Documents compiled for multiple purposes are not necessarily deprived of Exemption 7’s protection. The text
of Exemption 7 does not require that the information
be compiled solely for law enforcement purposes. Cf.
§552(b)(2) (“related solely to the internal personnel rules
and practices of an agency”). Therefore, it may be
enough that law enforcement purposes are a significant
reason for the compilation.
In this case, the Navy has a fair argument that the
Explosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information
falls within Exemption 7(F). The ESQD information, the
Navy argues, is used “for the purpose of identifying and
addressing security issues” and for the “protection of
people and property on the base, as well as in [the] nearby
community, from the damage, loss, death, or injury that
could occur from an accident or breach of security.” Brief
for Appellee in No. 07–36056 (CA9), pp. 39–40. If, indeed,
the ESQD information was compiled as part of an effort to
prevent crimes of terrorism and to maintain security,
there is a reasonable argument that the information has
been “compiled for law enforcement purposes.” §552(b)(7).
Assuming that this threshold requirement is satisfied, the
ESQD information may fall comfortably within Exemption
7(F).
