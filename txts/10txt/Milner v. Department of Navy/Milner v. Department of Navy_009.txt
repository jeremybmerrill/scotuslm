MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY 

Opinion of the Court 


III 

Our consideration of Exemption 2’s scope starts with its
text. See, e.g., Park ’N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc.,
469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985) (“Statutory construction must
begin with the language employed by Congress and the
assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language
accurately expresses the legislative purpose”). Judicial
decisions since FOIA’s enactment have analyzed and
reanalyzed the meaning of the exemption. But compara
tively little attention has focused on the provision’s 12
simple words: “related solely to the internal personnel
rules and practices of an agency.”
The key word in that dozen—the one that most clearly
marks the provision’s boundaries—is “personnel.” When
used as an adjective, as it is here to modify “rules and
practices,” that term refers to human resources matters.
“Personnel,” in this common parlance, means “the selec
tion, placement, and training of employees and . . . the
formulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or
involving] employees or their representatives.” Webster’s
Third New International Dictionary 1687 (1966) (hereinaf
ter Webster’s). So, for example, a “personnel department”
is “the department of a business firm that deals with
problems affecting the employees of the firm and that
usually interviews applicants for jobs.” Random House
Dictionary 1075 (1966) (hereinafter Random House).
“Personnel management” is similarly “the phase of man
agement concerned with the engagement and effective
utilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency of
human resources.” Webster’s 1687. And a “personnel
agency” is “an agency for placing employable persons in
jobs; employment agency.” Random House 1075.
FOIA itself provides an additional example in Exemp
tion 6. See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 143
(1994) (“A term appearing in several places in a statutory
