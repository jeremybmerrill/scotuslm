construing Exemption 2 to reauthorize the expansive
withholding that Congress wanted to halt. Our reading
instead gives the exemption the “narrower reach” Con
gress intended, id., at 363, through the simple device of
confining the provision’s meaning to its words.
The Government resists giving “personnel” its plain
meaning on the ground that Congress, when drafting
Exemption 2, considered but chose not to enact language
exempting “internal employment rules and practices.”
Brief for Respondent 30–34, and n. 11. This drafting
history, the Navy maintains, proves that Congress did not
wish “to limit the Exemption to employment-related mat
ters,” id., at 31, even if the adjective “personnel” conveys
that meaning in other contexts, id., at 41. But we think
the Navy’s evidence insufficient: The scant history con
cerning this word change as easily supports the inference
that Congress merely swapped one synonym for another.
Cf. Mead Corp. v. Tilley, 490 U. S. 714, 723 (1989) (noting
with respect to the “unexplained disappearance of one
word from an unenacted bill” that “mute intermediate
legislative maneuvers are not reliable” aids to statutory
interpretation (internal quotation marks omitted)). Those
of us who make use of legislative history believe that clear
evidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambigu

ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory
language.
Exemption 2, as we have construed it, does not reach
the ESQD information at issue here. These data and
maps calculate and visually portray the magnitude of
hypothetical detonations. By no stretch of imagination do
they relate to “personnel rules and practices,” as that term
is most naturally understood. They concern the physical
rules governing explosives, not the workplace rules gov
erning sailors; they address the handling of dangerous
