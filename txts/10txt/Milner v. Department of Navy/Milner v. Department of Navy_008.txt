Opinion of the Court

facilities to prevent chain reactions in case of detonation.
Ibid. The ESQD calculations are often incorporated into
specialized maps depicting the effects of hypothetical
explosions. See, e.g., App. 52.
In 2003 and 2004, petitioner Glen Milner, a Puget
Sound resident, submitted FOIA requests for all ESQD
information relating to Indian Island. 575 F. 3d, at 962.
The Navy refused to release the data, stating that disclo
sure would threaten the security of the base and surround
ing community. In support of its decision to withhold the
records, the Navy invoked Exemption 2. Ibid.3
The District Court granted summary judgment to the
Navy, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the
High 2 interpretation developed in Crooker. 575 F. 3d, at
963. The Court of Appeals explained that the ESQD
information “is predominantly used for the internal pur
pose of instructing agency personnel on how to do their
jobs.” Id., at 968. And disclosure of the material, the
court determined, “would risk circumvention of the law”
by “point[ing] out the best targets for those bent on wreak
ing havoc”—for example, “[a] terrorist who wished to hit
the most damaging target.” Id., at 971. The ESQD infor
mation, the court concluded, therefore qualified for a High
2 exemption. 575 F. 3d, at 971.
We granted certiorari in light of the Circuit split re
specting Exemption 2’s meaning, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and
we now reverse.

Navy also invoked Exemption 7(F), which applies to “records or
information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the
extent that the production of such . . . records . . . could reasonably be
expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.” 5
U. S. C. §552(b)(7)(F). The courts below did not decide whether the
Navy could withhold the ESQD data under that exemption. 575 F. 3d
959, 971, n. 8 (CA9 2009); No. CV–06–01301 (WD Wash., Oct. 30, 2007),
App. to Pet. for Cert. 4, 25, 2007 WL 3228049, *8.
