MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
Opinion of the Court

materials, not the treatment of employees. The Navy
therefore may not use Exemption 2, interpreted in accord
with its plain meaning to cover human resources matters,
to prevent disclosure of the requested maps and data.
IV
The Government offers two alternative readings of
Exemption 2 to support withholding the ESQD informa
tion. We cannot square either with the statute.
A
The Navy first encourages us to adopt the construction
of Exemption 2 pioneered by Crooker, which shields mate
rial not only if it meets the criteria set out above (Low 2),
but also if it is “predominant[ly] interna[l]” and its “disclo
sure would significantly risk[] circumvention of federal
agency functions” (High 2). Brief for Respondent 41 (in
ternal quotation marks omitted). The dissent, too, favors
this reading of the statute. Post, at 1. But the Crooker
interpretation, as already suggested, suffers from a patent
flaw: It is disconnected from Exemption 2’s text. The High
2 test (in addition to substituting the word “predomi
nantly” for “solely,” see n. 1, supra) ignores the plain
meaning of the adjective “personnel,” see supra, at 6–9,
and adopts a circumvention requirement with no basis or
referent in Exemption 2’s language. Indeed, the only way
to arrive at High 2 is by taking a red pen to the statute—
“cutting out some” words and “pasting in others” until
little of the actual provision remains. Elliott v. Depart
ment of Agriculture, 596 F. 3d 842, 845 (CADC 2010).
Because this is so, High 2 is better labeled “Non 2” (and
Low 2 . . . just 2).
In support of its text-light approach to the statute, the
Government relies primarily on legislative history, placing
particular emphasis on the House Report concerning
FOIA. See Brief for Respondent 33–38. A statement in
that Report buttresses the High 2 understanding of the
