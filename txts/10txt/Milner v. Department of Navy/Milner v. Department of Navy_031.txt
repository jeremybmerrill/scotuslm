BREYER, J., dissenting

supra, at 1074, takes the “practical approach” that this
Court has “consistently . . . taken” when interpreting the
FOIA, John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U. S. 146,
157 (1989).
I would not underestimate the importance of this “prac
tical approach.” It reflects this Court’s longstanding rec
ognition that it cannot interpret the FOIA (and the Ad
ministrative Procedure Act (APA) of which it is a part)
with the linguistic literalism fit for interpretations of the
tax code. See generally 1 R. Pierce, Administrative Law
Treatise §7.1, p. 413 (4th ed. 2002) (“Judicial interpreta
tion of the malleable language of the APA has produced
changes in the rulemaking procedure that could be charac
terized as revolutionary if they had been affected in a day
or a year rather than gradually over a period of decades”);
cf. Sunstein & Vermeule, Interpretation and Institutions,
101 Mich. L. Rev. 885, 917–918, and n. 111 (2003) (observ
ing that Congress “appears to rely on courts for long peri
ods of time” to give meaning to the APA, which justifies
interpreting it less formalistically than statutes like “the
Internal Revenue Code”). That in large part is because
the FOIA (like the APA but unlike the tax code) must
govern the affairs of a vast Executive Branch with numer
ous different agencies, bureaus, and departments, per
forming numerous tasks of many different kinds. Too
narrow an interpretation, while working well in the case
of one agency, may seriously interfere with congressional
objectives when applied to another. The D. C. Circuit’s
answer to this legal problem here was to interpret Exemp
tion 2 in light of Congress’ basic effort to achieve a
“workable balance between the interests of the public in
greater access to information and the needs of the Gov
ernment to protect certain kinds of information from
disclosure.” John Doe Agency, supra, at 157. See also

phasizing this “workable” balance); S. Rep. No. 813, at 3, 5
