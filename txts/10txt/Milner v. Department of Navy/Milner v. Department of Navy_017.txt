MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
Opinion of the Court

Since Crooker, three other Circuits have accepted the High
2 reading. See supra, at 3. One Circuit has reserved
judgment on the High 2-Low 2 debate. See Audubon
Society v. Forest Serv., 104 F. 3d 1201, 1203–1204 (CA10
1997). And the rest have not considered the matter. (No
one should think Crooker has been extensively discussed
or debated in the Courts of Appeals. In the past three
decades, Crooker’s analysis of Exemption 2 has been cited
a sum total of five times in federal appellate decisions
outside the D. C. Circuit—on average, once every six
years.) The result is a 4 to 3 split among the Circuits.8
We will not flout all usual rules of statutory interpretation
to take the side of the bare majority.
B
Presumably because Crooker so departs from Exemption
2’s language, the Government also offers another con
struction, which it says we might adopt “on a clean slate,”
“based on the plain text . . . alone.” Brief for Respondent
15. On this reading, the exemption “encompasses records
concerning an agency’s internal rules and practices for its
personnel to follow in the discharge of their governmental
functions.” Id., at 20; see also id., at 13–14 (Exemption 2
“applies generally to matters concerning internal rules
and practices to guide agency personnel in performing
——————
Circuits applying Crooker; but that statement does not hold in the
Circuits using the Low 2 approach.
8 Notably, even those courts approving Crooker have disagreed about
how to apply High 2. Fault lines include whether the risk of circum
vention must be significant, see, e.g., Hidalgo v. FBI, 541 F. Supp. 2d
250, 253 (DC 2008); Pet. for Cert. 15–16; whether courts should con
sider the public interest in disclosure when calculating that risk, see,
e.g., Department of Justice, Guide to the Freedom of Information Act,
p. 185 (2009); and whether an agency must regulate the person or
entity threatening circumvention; compare, e.g., 575 F. 3d, at 971, with,
e.g., id., at 978 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting). The disagreement is not
surprising. Because High 2 is nowhere evident in the statute, courts
lack the normal guideposts for ascertaining its coverage.
