MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
BREYER, J., dissenting

(same); H. R. Rep. No. 1497, at 2, 6 (same).
Further, 30 years of experience with Crooker’s holding
suggests that it has not seriously interfered with the
FOIA’s informational objectives, while at the same time it
has permitted agencies to withhold much information
which, in my view, Congress would not have wanted to
force into the public realm. To focus only on the case law,
courts have held that that information protected by Ex
emption 2 includes blueprints for Department of Agricul
ture buildings that store biological agents, Elliot v. De
