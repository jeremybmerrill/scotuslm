Opinion of the Court

We leave to Congress, as is appropriate, the question
whether it should do so.
VI
Exemption 2, consistent with the plain meaning of the
term “personnel rules and practices,” encompasses only
records relating to issues of employee relations and human
resources. The explosives maps and data requested here
do not qualify for withholding under that exemption. We
therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals
and remand the case for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
