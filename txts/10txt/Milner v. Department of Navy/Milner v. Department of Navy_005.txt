Opinion of the Court

long shielded unnecessarily from public view.” Id., at 80.
FOIA thus mandates that an agency disclose records on
request, unless they fall within one of nine exemptions.
These exemptions are “explicitly made exclusive,” id., at
79, and must be “narrowly construed,” FBI v. Abramson,
456 U. S. 615, 630 (1982).
At issue here is Exemption 2, which shields from com
pelled disclosure documents “related solely to the internal
personnel rules and practices of an agency.” §552(b)(2).
Congress enacted Exemption 2 to replace the APA’s ex
emption for “any matter relating solely to the internal
management of an agency,” 5 U. S. C. §1002 (1964 ed.).
Believing that the “sweep” of the phrase “internal man
agement” had led to excessive withholding, Congress
drafted Exemption 2 “to have a narrower reach.” Depart

We considered the extent of that reach in Department of
Air Force v. Rose. There, we rejected the Government’s
invocation of Exemption 2 to withhold case summaries of
honor and ethics hearings at the United States Air Force
Academy. The exemption, we suggested, primarily targets
material concerning employee relations or human re

hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.”
Id., at 363 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.,
8 (1965) (hereinafter S. Rep.)); see Rose, 425 U. S., at 367.
“[T]he general thrust” of Exemption 2, we explained, “is
simply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and
maintaining [such information] for public inspection.” Id.,
at 369. We concluded that the case summaries did not fall
within the exemption because they “d[id] not concern only
routine matters” of “merely internal significance.” Id., at
370. But we stated a possible caveat to our interpretation
of Exemption 2: That understanding of the provision’s
coverage governed, we wrote, “at least where the situation
