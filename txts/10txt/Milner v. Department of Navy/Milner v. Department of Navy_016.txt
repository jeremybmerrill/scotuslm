Opinion of the Court

ratify, approve, or otherwise signal agreement with
Crooker’s interpretation of Exemption 2. This argument
therefore cannot save the High 2 construction.
The dissent offers one last reason to embrace High 2,
and indeed stakes most of its wager on this argument.
Crooker, the dissent asserts, “has been consistently relied
upon and followed for 30 years” by other lower courts.
Post, at 9; see post, at 1–2. But this claim, too, trips at the
starting gate. It would be immaterial even if true, because
we have no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on
the ground that other courts have done so. And in any
event, it is not true. Prior to Crooker, three Circuits
adopted the reading of Exemption 2 we think right, and
they have not changed their minds. See n. 2, supra.7

7 The

dissent’s view that “two of th[ese] Circuits [have] not adher[ed]
to their early positions” is incorrect. Post, at 2. In Abraham & Rose,
P.L.C. v. United States, cited by the dissent, the Sixth Circuit rejected
the Government’s claim that Exemption 2 shielded records of federal
tax lien filings. 138 F. 3d 1075, 1082 (1998). The court nowhere
discussed the High 2 versus Low 2 question at issue here. Its only
reference to Crooker concerned the part of that decision interpreting
“solely” to mean “predominantly.” See 138 F.3d, at 1080; see also n. 1,
supra. Subsequently, the Sixth Circuit once again held, in Rugiero v.
Department of Justice, that Exemption 2 applies to “routine matters of
merely internal significance.” 257 F. 3d 534, 549 (2001). In Sladek v.
Bensinger, which the dissent also cites, the Fifth Circuit insisted that
the Government disclose a Drug Enforcement Administration agent’s
manual because it “is not the type of trivial rule, such as allocation of
parking facilities, that is covered by Exemption 2.” 605 F. 2d 899, 902
(1979). In confirming this Low 2 interpretation of the statute, the court
acknowledged that another Circuit had embraced the High 2 standard.
The court, however, declined to consider this alternative interpretation
because it would not have changed the case’s outcome. See ibid.
Finally, the Eighth Circuit’s last word on Exemption 2 is clear, and the
dissent does not say otherwise. The exemption, according to that most
recent Eighth Circuit decision, applies “only [to an agency’s] housekeep
ing matters.” Cox, 576 F. 2d, at 1309–1310 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The dissent is surely right to say, post at 2, that Crooker “has
guided nearly every FOIA case decided over the last 30 years” in
