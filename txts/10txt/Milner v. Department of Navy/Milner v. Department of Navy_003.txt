Syllabus
1 prevents access to classified documents; Exemption 3 applies to records that any other statute exempts from disclosure; and Exemption
7 protects “information compiled for law enforcement purposes” if its
release, inter alia, “could reasonably be expected to endanger the life
or physical safety of any individual,” §552(b)(7)(F). The Navy’s argument that the explosives information is exempt under Exemption 7
remains open for the Ninth Circuit to address on remand. And if
these or other exemptions do not cover records whose release would
threaten the Nation’s vital interests, the Government may of course
seek relief from Congress. Pp. 17–18.
