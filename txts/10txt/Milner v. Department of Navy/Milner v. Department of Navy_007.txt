MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
Opinion of the Court

new terminology: Courts applying the Crooker approach
now refer to the “Low 2” exemption when discussing mate
rials concerning human resources and employee relations,
and to the “High 2” exemption when assessing records
whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.
See, e.g., 575 F. 3d, at 963; Schiller v. NLRB, 964 F. 2d
1205, 1208 (CADC 1992). Congress, as well, took notice of
the D. C. Circuit’s decision, borrowing language from
Crooker to amend Exemption 7(E) when next enacting
revisions to FOIA. The amended version of Exemption
7(E) shields certain “records or information compiled for
law enforcement purposes” if their disclosure “could rea
sonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.”
§552(b)(7)(E); see Freedom of Information Reform Act of
1986, §1802(a), 100 Stat. 3207–49.
II
The FOIA request at issue here arises from the Navy’s
operations at Naval Magazine Indian Island, a base in
Puget Sound, Washington. The Navy keeps weapons,
ammunition, and explosives on the island. To aid in the
storage and transport of these munitions, the Navy uses
data known as Explosive Safety Quantity Distance
(ESQD) information. 575 F. 3d, at 962. ESQD informa
tion prescribes “minimum separation distances” for explo
sives and helps the Navy design and construct storage

Rose. See Cox v. Department of Justice, 576 F. 2d 1302, 1309–1310
(CA8 1978) (concluding that Exemption 2 covers only an agency’s
internal “housekeeping matters” (internal quotation marks omitted));
Stokes v. Brennan, 476 F. 2d 699, 703 (CA5 1973) (holding that Exemp
tion 2 “must not be read so broadly as to exempt” an Occupational
Safety and Health Administration manual for training compliance
officers); Hawkes v. IRS, 467 F. 2d 787, 797 (CA6 1972) (“[T]he internal
practices and policies referred to in [Exemption 2] relate only to . . .
employee-employer type concerns”). These Circuits have never revised
their understandings of the exemption. See infra, at 13, n. 7.
