is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of
agency regulation.” Id., at 369.
In Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms,
670 F. 2d 1051 (1981), the D. C. Circuit converted this
caveat into a new definition of Exemption 2’s scope.
Crooker approved the use of Exemption 2 to shield a man
ual designed to train Government agents in law enforce
ment surveillance techniques. The D. C. Circuit noted
that it previously had understood Exemption 2 to “refe[r]
only to ‘pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch
hours, parking, etc.’ ” Id., at 1056 (quoting Jordan v.
Department of Justice, 591 F. 2d 753, 763 (1978)). But the
court now thought Exemption 2 should also cover any
“predominantly internal” materials,1 Crooker, 670 F. 2d,
at 1056–1057, whose disclosure would “significantly ris[k]
circumvention of agency regulations or statutes,” id., at
1074. This construction of Exemption 2, the court rea
soned, flowed from FOIA’s “overall design,” its legislative
history, “and even common sense,” because Congress could
not have meant to “enac[t] a statute whose provisions
undermined . . . the effectiveness of law enforcement
agencies.” Ibid.
In the ensuing years, three Courts of Appeals adopted
the D. C. Circuit’s interpretation of Exemption 2. See 575
F. 3d 959, 965 (CA9 2009) (case below); Massey v. FBI, 3
F. 3d 620, 622 (CA2 1993); Kaganove v. EPA, 856 F. 2d
884, 889 (CA7 1988).2 And that interpretation spawned a

1 The court adopted the “predominantly internal” standard as a way
of implementing the exemption’s requirement that materials “relat[e]
solely to” an agency’s internal personnel rules and practices. The
word “solely,” the court reasoned, “has to be given the construction,
consonant with reasonableness, of ‘predominantly’ ” because otherwise
“solely” would conflict with the expansive term “related.” 670 F. 2d, at
1056 (some internal quotation marks omitted).
2 Three other Courts of Appeals had previously taken a narrower view
of Exemption 2’s scope, consistent with the interpretation adopted in
