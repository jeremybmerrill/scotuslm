MILNER v. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY
BREYER, J., dissenting

fication is at best a partial solution. It takes time. It is
subject to its own rules. As the Government points out, it
would hinder the sharing of information about Govern
ment buildings with “first responders,” such as local fire
and police departments. Brief for Respondent 53–54. And
both Congress and the President believe the Nation cur
rently faces a problem of too much, not too little, classified
material. See Reducing Over-Classification Act, 124 Stat.
2648; Exec. Order No. 13526, §§1.3(d), 2.1(d), 5.4(d)(10), 3
CFR 298, 299–300, 304, 321 (2009 Comp.). Indeed, Con
gress recently found:
“The 9/11 Commission and others have observed that
the over-classification of information interferes with
accurate, actionable, and timely information sharing,
increases the cost of information security, and need
lessly limits stakeholder and public access to informa
tion.
“Over-classification of information causes consider
able confusion regarding what information may be
shared with whom, and negatively affects the dis
semination of information within the Federal Gov
ernment and with State, local, and tribal entities, and
with the private sector.” Reducing Over-Classification
Act, §§2(2), (3), 124 Stat. 2648.
These legislative findings suggest that it is “over
classification,” not Crooker, that poses the more serious
threat to the FOIA’s public information objectives.
That leaves congressional action. As the Court points
out, Congress remains free to correct whatever problems it
finds in today’s narrowing of Exemption 2. But legislative
action takes time; Congress has much to do; and other
matters, when compared with a FOIA revision, may war
rant higher legislative priority. In my view, it is for the
courts, through appropriate interpretation, to turn Con
gress’ public information objectives into workable agency
