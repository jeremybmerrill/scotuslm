Opinion of the Court

case does not call upon us to pass on the scope of a corpo
ration’s “privacy” interests as a matter of constitutional or
common law. The discrete question before us is instead
whether Congress used the term “personal privacy” to
refer to the privacy of artificial persons in FOIA Exemp
tion 7(C); the cases AT&T cites are too far afield to be of
help here.
AT&T concludes that the FCC has simply failed to
demonstrate that the phrase “personal privacy” “necessar
ily excludes the privacy of corporations.” Id., at 31–32
(emphasis added). But construing statutory language is
not merely an exercise in ascertaining “the outer limits of
[a word’s] definitional possibilities,” Dolan v. Postal Ser

sound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard
the ordinary meaning of the phrase “personal privacy.”

The meaning of “personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) is
further clarified by the rest of the statute. Congress en
acted Exemption 7(C) against the backdrop of pre-existing
FOIA exemptions, and the purpose and scope of Exemp
tion 7(C) becomes even more apparent when viewed in this
context. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip
op., at 6) (“statutory interpretation turns on ‘the language
itself, the specific context in which that language is used,
and the broader context of the statute as a whole’ ” (quot
ing Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997))).
Two of those other exemptions are particularly relevant
here.
The phrase “personal privacy” first appeared in the
FOIA exemptions in Exemption 6, enacted in 1966, eight
years before Congress enacted Exemption 7(C). See 80
Stat. 250, codified as amended at 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(6).
Exemption 6 covers “personnel and medical files and
similar files the disclosure of which would constitute
