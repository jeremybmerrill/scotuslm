Opinion of the Court

Id., at 43a. The Bureau did not, however, apply that
exemption to the corporation itself, reasoning that “busi
nesses do not possess ‘personal privacy’ interests as re
quired” by the exemption. Id., at 42a–43a.
On review the FCC agreed with the Bureau. The Com
mission found AT&T’s position that it is “a ‘private corpo
rate citizen’ with personal privacy rights that should be
protected from disclosure that would ‘embarrass’ it . . .
within the meaning of Exemption 7(C) . . . at odds with
established [FCC] and judicial precedent.” 23 FCC Rcd.
13704, 13707 (2008). It therefore concluded that “Exemp
tion 7(C) has no applicability to corporations such as
[AT&T].” Id., at 13710.
AT&T sought review in the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, and that court rejected the FCC’s reasoning.
Noting that Congress had defined the word “person” to
include corporations as well as individuals, 5 U. S. C.
§551(2), the court held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the
“personal privacy” of corporations, since “the root from
which the statutory word [personal] . . . is derived” is the
defined term “person.” 582 F. 3d, at 497. As the court
explained, “[i]t would be very odd indeed for an adjectival
form of a defined term not to refer back to that defined
term.” Ibid. The court accordingly ruled “that FOIA’s text
unambiguously indicates that a corporation may have a
‘personal privacy’ interest within the meaning of Exemp
tion 7(C).” Id., at 498.
The FCC petitioned this Court for review of the Third
Circuit’s decision and CompTel filed as a respondent
supporting petitioners. We granted certiorari, 561 U. S.
___ (2010), and now reverse.
II
Like the Court of Appeals below, AT&T relies on the
argument that the word “personal” in Exemption 7(C)
incorporates the statutory definition of the word “person.”
