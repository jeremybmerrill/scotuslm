Opinion of the Court

the legal context. AT&T notes that corporations are “pro
tected by the doctrine of ‘personal’ jurisdiction,” AT&T
Brief 19, but that phrase refers to jurisdiction in per
sonam, as opposed to in rem, not the jurisdiction “of a
person.” The only other example AT&T cites is an 1896
case that referred to the “ ‘personal privilege’ ” of a corpora
tion. Ibid. (quoting Mercantile Bank v. Tennessee ex rel.
Memphis, 161 U. S. 161, 171 (1896) (emphasis deleted)).
These examples fall far short of establishing that “per
sonal” here has a legal meaning apart from its ordinary
one, even if “person” does. Cf. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,
559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010) (slip op., at 8–10) (noting
that “ ‘discovery’ is often used as a term of art in connec
tion with the ‘discovery rule’ ” and describing the judicial
and legislative codification of that meaning over time);
Molzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 306 (1992) (“ ‘Puni
tive damages’ is a legal term of art that has a widely
accepted common-law meaning . . . this Court’s decisions
make clear that the concept . . . has a long pedigree in the
law”).
Regardless of whether “personal” can carry a special
meaning in legal usage, “when interpreting a statute . . .
we construe language . . . in light of the terms surrounding
it.” Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004). Exemption
7(C) refers not just to the word “personal,” but to the term
“personal privacy.” §552(b)(7)(C); cf. Textron Lycoming
Reciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. Automobile
Workers, 523 U. S. 653, 657 (1998) (“It is not the meaning
of ‘for’ we are seeking here, but the meaning of ‘[s]uits for
violation of contracts’ ”). AT&T’s effort to attribute a
special legal meaning to the word “personal” in this par
ticular context is wholly unpersuasive.
AT&T’s argument treats the term “personal privacy” as
simply the sum of its two words: the privacy of a person.
Under that view, the defined meaning of the noun “per
son,” or the asserted specialized legal meaning, takes on
