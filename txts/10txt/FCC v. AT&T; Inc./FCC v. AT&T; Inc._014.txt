leged or confidential.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(4). This clearly
applies to corporations—it uses the defined term “person”
to describe the source of the information—and we far more
readily think of corporations as having “privileged or
confidential” documents than personally private ones. So
at the time Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in
place an exemption that plainly covered a corporation’s
commercial and financial information, and another that
we have described as relating to “individuals.” The lan
guage of Exemption 7(C) tracks the latter.
The Government has long interpreted the phrase “per

after Congress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted
Exemption 7(C), the Attorney General issued a memoran

that “personal privacy” in that exemption “pertains to the
privacy interests of individuals.” U. S. Dept. of Justice,
Attorney General’s Memorandum on the 1974 Amend
ments to the Freedom of Information Act 9, reprinted in
House Committee on Government Operations and Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, Freedom of Information Act
and Amendments of 1974 (P. L. 93–502), 94th Cong., 1st
Sess., 507, 579 (Jt. Comm. Print 1975). The exemption,
the Attorney General noted, “does not seem applicable to
corporations or other entities.” Ibid. We have previously
viewed this Memorandum as a reliable guide in interpret
ing FOIA, see National Archives and Records Admin. v.
Favish, 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004); FBI v. Abramson, 456
U. S. 615, 622, n. 5 (1982), and we agree with its conclu
sion here.

We reject the argument that because “person” is defined
for purposes of FOIA to include a corporation, the phrase
“personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) reaches corporations
as well. The protection in FOIA against disclosure of law
