a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
§552(b)(6). Not only did Congress choose the same term in
drafting Exemption 7(C), it also used the term in a nearly
identical manner.
Although the question whether Exemption 6 is limited
to individuals has not come to us directly, we have regu
larly referred to that exemption as involving an “individ
ual’s right of privacy.” Department of State v. Ray, 502
U. S. 164, 175 (1991) (quoting Department of Air Force v.
Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 372 (1976) (internal quotation marks
omitted)); see also Department of State v. Washington Post
Co., 456 U. S. 595, 599 (1982).
AT&T does not dispute that “identical words and
phrases within the same statute should normally be given
the same meaning,” Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy
Services, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007), but contends that
“if Exemption 6 does not protect corporations, it is because
[it] applies only to ‘personnel and medical files and similar
files,’ ” not because of the term “personal privacy.” AT&T
Brief 36 (quoting §552(b)(6)). Yet the significance of the
pertinent phrase—“the disclosure of which would consti

§552(b)(6)—cannot be so readily dismissed. Without it,
Exemption 6 would categorically exempt “personnel and
medical files” as well as any “similar” file. Even if the
scope of Exemption 6 is also limited by the types of files it
protects, the “personal privacy” phrase importantly de
fines the particular subset of that information Congress
sought to exempt. See Washington Post Co., supra, at 599.
And because Congress used the same phrase in Exemption
7(C), the reach of that phrase in Exemption 6 is pertinent
in construing Exemption 7(C).
In drafting Exemption 7(C), Congress did not, on the
other hand, use language similar to that in Exemption 4.
Exemption 4 pertains to “trade secrets and commercial or
financial information obtained from a person and privi
