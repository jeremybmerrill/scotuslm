FCC v. AT&T INC.
Opinion of the Court

enforcement information on the ground that it would
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
does not extend to corporations. We trust that AT&T will
not take it personally.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
