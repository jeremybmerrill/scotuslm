FCC v. AT&T INC.
Opinion of the Court

have overcharged the Government for services it provided
as part of the program.
The FCC’s Enforcement Bureau launched an investiga
tion. As part of that investigation, AT&T provided the
Bureau various documents, including responses to inter
rogatories, invoices, emails with pricing and billing infor
mation, names and job descriptions of employees involved,
and AT&T’s assessment of whether those employees had
violated the company’s code of conduct. 582 F. 3d 490,
492–493 (CA3 2009). The FCC and AT&T resolved the
matter in December 2004 through a consent decree in
which AT&T—without conceding liability—agreed to pay
the Government $500,000 and to institute a plan to ensure
compliance with the program. See 19 FCC Rcd. 24014,
24016–24019.
Several months later, CompTel—“a trade association
representing some of AT&T’s competitors”—submitted a
FOIA request seeking “ ‘[a]ll pleadings and correspon
dence’ ” in the Bureau’s file on the AT&T investigation.
582 F. 3d, at 493. AT&T opposed CompTel’s request, and
the Bureau issued a letter-ruling in response.
The Bureau concluded that some of the information
AT&T had provided (including cost and pricing data,
billing-related information, and identifying information
about staff, contractors, and customer representatives)
should be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemp
tion 4, which relates to “trade secrets and commercial or
financial information,” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(4). App. to Pet.
for Cert. 40a–41a. The Bureau also decided to withhold
other information under FOIA Exemption 7(C). Exemp
tion 7(C) exempts “records or information compiled for law
enforcement purposes” that “could reasonably be expected
to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal pri
vacy.” §552(b)(7)(C). The Bureau concluded that “indi
viduals identified in [AT&T’s] submissions” have “privacy
rights” that warrant protection under Exemption 7(C).
