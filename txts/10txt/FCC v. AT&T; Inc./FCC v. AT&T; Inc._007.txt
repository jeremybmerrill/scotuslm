FCC v. AT&T INC.
Opinion of the Court

See Brief for Respondent AT&T 8–9, 14–15 (AT&T Brief);
582 F. 3d, at 497. The Administrative Procedure Act
defines “person” to include “an individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or public or private organization
other than an agency.” 5 U. S. C. §551(2). Because that
definition applies here, the argument goes, “personal”
must mean relating to those “person[s]”: namely, corpora
tions and other entities as well as individuals. This read
ing, we are told, is dictated by a “basic principle of gram
mar and usage.” AT&T Brief 8; see id., at 14–15; see also
582 F. 3d, at 497 (citing Delaware River Stevedores v.
DiFidelto, 440 F. 3d 615, 623 (CA3 2006) (Fisher, J., con
curring), for “[t]he grammatical imperativ[e]” that “a
statute which defines a noun has thereby defined the
adjectival form of that noun”). According to AT&T, “[b]y
expressly defining the noun ‘person’ to include corpora
tions, Congress necessarily defined the adjective form
of that noun—‘personal’—also to include corporations.”
AT&T Brief 14 (emphasis added).
We disagree. Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of
corresponding nouns, but not always. Sometimes they
acquire distinct meanings of their own. The noun “crab”
refers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while
the related adjective “crabbed” can refer to handwriting
that is “difficult to read,” Webster’s Third New Interna
tional Dictionary 527 (2002); “corny” can mean “using
familiar and stereotyped formulas believed to appeal to
the unsophisticated,” id., at 509, which has little to do
with “corn,” id., at 507 (“the seeds of any of the cereal
grasses used for food”); and while “crank” is “a part of an
axis bent at right angles,” “cranky” can mean “given to
fretful fussiness,” id., at 530.
Even in cases such as these there may well be a link
between the noun and the adjective. “Cranky” describes a
person with a “wayward” or “capricious” temper, see 3
