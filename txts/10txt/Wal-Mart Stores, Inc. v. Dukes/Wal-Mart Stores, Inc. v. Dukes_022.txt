WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of the Court

discrimination from particular individuals. See id., at
338. That number was significant because the company
involved had only 6,472 employees, of whom 571 were
minorities, id., at 337, and the class itself consisted of
around 334 persons, United States v. T.I.M.E.-D. C., Inc.,
517 F. 2d 299, 308 (CA5 1975), overruled on other
grounds, Teamsters, supra. The 40 anecdotes thus repre
sented roughly one account for every eight members of
the class. Moreover, the Court of Appeals noted that the
anecdotes came from individuals “spread throughout” the
company who “for the most part” worked at the company’s
operational centers that employed the largest numbers of
the class members. 517 F. 2d, at 315, and n. 30. Here, by
contrast, respondents filed some 120 affidavits reporting
experiences of discrimination—about 1 for every 12,500
class members—relating to only some 235 out of WalMart’s 3,400 stores. 603 F. 3d, at 634 (Ikuta, J., dissent
ing). More than half of these reports are concentrated in
only six States (Alabama, California, Florida, Missouri,
Texas, and Wisconsin); half of all States have only one or
two anecdotes; and 14 States have no anecdotes about
Wal-Mart’s operations at all. Id., at 634–635, and n. 10.
Even if every single one of these accounts is true, that
would not demonstrate that the entire company “oper
ate[s] under a general policy of discrimination,” Falcon,
supra, at 159, n. 15, which is what respondents must show
to certify a companywide class.9
The dissent misunderstands the nature of the foregoing
——————
9 The

dissent says that we have adopted “a rule that a discrimination
claim, if accompanied by anecdotes, must supply them in numbers
proportionate to the size of the class.” Post, at 5, n. 4 (GINSBURG, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part). That is not quite accurate.
A discrimination claimant is free to supply as few anecdotes as he
wishes. But when the claim is that a company operates under a gen
eral policy of discrimination, a few anecdotes selected from literally
millions of employment decisions prove nothing at all.
