WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

In so ruling, the Court imports into the Rule 23(a) de
termination concerns properly addressed in a Rule 23(b)(3)
assessment.

A

Rule 23(a)(2) establishes a preliminary requirement for
maintaining a class action: “[T]here are questions of law or
fact common to the class.”2 The Rule “does not require
that all questions of law or fact raised in the litigation be
common,” 1 H. Newberg & A. Conte, Newberg on Class
Actions §3.10, pp. 3–48 to 3–49 (3d ed. 1992); indeed,
“[e]ven a single question of law or fact common to the
members of the class will satisfy the commonality re
quirement,” Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the
Structure of the Class Action, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 149, 176,
n. 110 (2003). See Advisory Committee’s 1937 Notes on
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 138 (citing
with approval cases in which “there was only a question of
law or fact common to” the class members).
A “question” is ordinarily understood to be “[a] subject
or point open to controversy.” American Heritage Diction
ary 1483 (3d ed. 1992). See also Black’s Law Dictionary
1366 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “question of fact” as “[a]
disputed issue to be resolved . . . [at] trial” and “question of
law” as “[a]n issue to be decided by the judge”). Thus, a
“question” “common to the class” must be a dispute, either
——————
2 Rule 23(a) lists three other threshold requirements for class-action
certification: “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is
impracticable”; “(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties
are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representa
tive parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”
The numerosity requirement is clearly met and Wal-Mart does not
contend otherwise. As the Court does not reach the typicality and
adequacy requirements, ante, at 9, n. 5, I will not discuss them either,
but will simply record my agreement with the District Court’s resolu
tion of those issues.
