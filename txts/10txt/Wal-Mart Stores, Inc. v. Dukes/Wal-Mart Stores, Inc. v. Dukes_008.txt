WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of the Court

Wal-Mart has any express corporate policy against the
advancement of women. Rather, they claim that their
local managers’ discretion over pay and promotions is
exercised disproportionately in favor of men, leading to an
unlawful disparate impact on female employees, see 42
U. S. C. §2000e–2(k). And, respondents say, because WalMart is aware of this effect, its refusal to cabin its manag
ers’ authority amounts to disparate treatment, see
§2000e–2(a). Their complaint seeks injunctive and de
claratory relief, punitive damages, and backpay. It does
not ask for compensatory damages.
Importantly for our purposes, respondents claim that
the discrimination to which they have been subjected is
common to all Wal-Mart’s female employees. The basic
theory of their case is that a strong and uniform “corporate
culture” permits bias against women to infect, perhaps
subconsciously, the discretionary decisionmaking of each
one of Wal-Mart’s thousands of managers—thereby mak
ing every woman at the company the victim of one com
mon discriminatory practice. Respondents therefore wish
to litigate the Title VII claims of all female employees at
Wal-Mart’s stores in a nationwide class action.
