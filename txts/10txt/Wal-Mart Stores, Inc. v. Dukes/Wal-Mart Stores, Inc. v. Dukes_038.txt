Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

prototypical cases in this area, Leisner v. New York Tel.
Co., 358 F. Supp. 359, 364–365 (SDNY 1973). In deciding
on promotions, supervisors in that case were to start with
objective measures; but ultimately, they were to “look at
the individual as a total individual.” Id., at 365 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The final question they were to
ask and answer: “Is this person going to be successful in
our business?” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
It is hardly surprising that for many managers, the ideal
candidate was someone with characteristics similar to
their own.
We have held that “discretionary employment practices”
can give rise to Title VII claims, not only when such prac
tices are motivated by discriminatory intent but also when
they produce discriminatory results. See Watson v. Fort
Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 988, 991 (1988). But
see ante, at 17 (“[P]roving that [a] discretionary system
has produced a . . . disparity is not enough.”). In Watson,
as here, an employer had given its managers large author
ity over promotions. An employee sued the bank under
Title VII, alleging that the “discretionary promotion sys

U. S., at 984 (internal quotation marks omitted). Four
different supervisors had declined, on separate occasions,
to promote the employee. Id., at 982. Their reasons were
subjective and unknown. The employer, we noted “had
not developed precise and formal criteria for evaluating
candidates”; “[i]t relied instead on the subjective judgment
of supervisors.” Ibid.
Aware of “the problem of subconscious stereotypes and
prejudices,” we held that the employer’s “undisciplined
system of subjective decisionmaking” was an “employment
practic[e]” that “may be analyzed under the disparate
impact approach.” Id., at 990–991. See also Wards Cove
Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642, 657 (1989) (recogniz
