WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of the Court

5(g)(2)(A)).
C
In Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F. 3d 402, 415
(CA5 1998), the Fifth Circuit held that a (b)(2) class would
permit the certification of monetary relief that is “inciden
tal to requested injunctive or declaratory relief,” which it
defined as “damages that flow directly from liability to
the class as a whole on the claims forming the basis of the
injunctive or declaratory relief.” In that court’s view, such
“incidental damage should not require additional hearings
to resolve the disparate merits of each individual’s case; it
should neither introduce new substantial legal or factual
issues, nor entail complex individualized determinations.”
Ibid. We need not decide in this case whether there are
any forms of “incidental” monetary relief that are consis
tent with the interpretation of Rule 23(b)(2) we have
announced and that comply with the Due Process Clause.
Respondents do not argue that they can satisfy this stan
dard, and in any event they cannot.
Contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s view, Wal-Mart is enti
tled to individualized determinations of each employee’s
eligibility for backpay. Title VII includes a detailed reme
dial scheme. If a plaintiff prevails in showing that an
employer has discriminated against him in violation of the
statute, the court “may enjoin the respondent from en
gaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order
such affirmative action as may be appropriate, [including]
reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without
backpay . . . or any other equitable relief as the court
deems appropriate.” §2000e–5(g)(1). But if the employer
can show that it took an adverse employment action
against an employee for any reason other than discrimina
tion, the court cannot order the “hiring, reinstatement, or
promotion of an individual as an employee, or the payment
to him of any backpay.” §2000e–5(g)(2)(A).
