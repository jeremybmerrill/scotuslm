Opinion of the Court

could justify a class of both applicants and employees
if the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and pro
motion practices in the same general fashion, such as
through entirely subjective decisionmaking processes.”
Ibid. We think that statement precisely describes respon
dents’ burden in this case. The first manner of bridging
the gap obviously has no application here; Wal-Mart has
no testing procedure or other companywide evaluation
method that can be charged with bias. The whole point of
permitting discretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evalu
ating employees under a common standard.
The second manner of bridging the gap requires “signifi
cant proof ” that Wal-Mart “operated under a general
policy of discrimination.” That is entirely absent here.
Wal-Mart’s announced policy forbids sex discrimination,
see App. 1567a–1596a, and as the District Court recog
nized the company imposes penalties for denials of equal
employment opportunity, 222 F. R. D., at 154. The only
evidence of a “general policy of discrimination” respon
dents produced was the testimony of Dr. William Bielby,
their sociological expert. Relying on “social framework”
analysis, Bielby testified that Wal-Mart has a “strong
corporate culture,” that makes it “ ‘vulnerable’ ” to “gender
bias.” Id., at 152. He could not, however, “determine with
any specificity how regularly stereotypes play a meaning
ful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart. At his
deposition . . . Dr. Bielby conceded that he could not calcu
late whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment
decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped
thinking.” 222 F. R. D. 189, 192 (ND Cal. 2004). The
parties dispute whether Bielby’s testimony even met the
standards for the admission of expert testimony under
Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and our Daubert case,
