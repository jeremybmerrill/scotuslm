Opinion of the Court

analysis. It criticizes our focus on the dissimilarities be
tween the putative class members on the ground that
we have “blend[ed]” Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality require
ment with Rule 23(b)(3)’s inquiry into whether common
questions “predominate” over individual ones. See post, at
8–10 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part). That is not so. We quite agree that for purposes of
Rule 23(a)(2) “ ‘[e]ven a single [common] question’ ” will do,
post, at 10, n. 9 (quoting Nagareda, The Preexistence
Principle and the Structure of the Class Action, 103
Colum. L. Rev. 149, 176, n. 110 (2003)). We consider
dissimilarities not in order to determine (as Rule 23(b)(3)
requires) whether common questions predominate, but in
order to determine (as Rule 23(a)(2) requires) whether
there is “[e]ven a single [common] question.” And there is
not here. Because respondents provide no convincing
proof of a companywide discriminatory pay and promotion
policy, we have concluded that they have not established
the existence of any common question.10
In sum, we agree with Chief Judge Kozinski that the
members of the class:
“held a multitude of different jobs, at different levels
of Wal-Mart’s hierarchy, for variable lengths of time,
in 3,400 stores, sprinkled across 50 states, with a ka
leidoscope of supervisors (male and female), subject to
a variety of regional policies that all differed. . . .
Some thrived while others did poorly. They have little
in common but their sex and this lawsuit.” 603 F. 3d,

this reason, there is no force to the dissent’s attempt to distin
guish Falcon on the ground that in that case there were “ ‘no common
questions of law or fact’ between the claims of the lead plaintiff and the
applicant class ” post, at 9, n. 7 (quoting Falcon, 457 U. S., at 162
(Burger, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). Here also
there is nothing to unite all of the plaintiffs’ claims, since (contrary to
the dissent’s contention, post, at 9, n. 7), the same employment prac
tices do not “touch and concern all members of the class.”
