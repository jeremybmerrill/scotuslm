Opinion of the Court

to satisfy Rule 23(a)(3), and that they could serve as ade
quate class representatives, see Rule 23(a)(4). Id., at 614–
615. With respect to the Rule 23(b)(2) question, the Ninth
Circuit held that respondents’ backpay claims could be
certified as part of a (b)(2) class because they did not
“predominat[e]” over the requests for declaratory and
injunctive relief, meaning they were not “superior in
strength, influence, or authority” to the nonmonetary
claims. Id., at 616 (internal quotation marks omitted).4
Finally, the Court of Appeals determined that the action
could be manageably tried as a class action because the
District Court could adopt the approach the Ninth Circuit
approved in Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F. 3d 767, 782–
787 (1996). There compensatory damages for some 9,541
class members were calculated by selecting 137 claims at
random, referring those claims to a special master for
valuation, and then extrapolating the validity and value of
the untested claims from the sample set. See 603 F. 3d, at
625–626. The Court of Appeals “s[aw] no reason why a
similar procedure to that used in Hilao could not be em
ployed in this case.” Id., at 627. It would allow Wal-Mart
“to present individual defenses in the randomly selected
‘sample cases,’ thus revealing the approximate percentage
of class members whose unequal pay or nonpromotion was
due to something other than gender discrimination.”
Ibid., n. 56 (emphasis deleted).

enable that result, the Court of Appeals trimmed the (b)(2) class
in two ways: First, it remanded that part of the certification order
which included respondents’ punitive-damages claim in the (b)(2) class,
so that the District Court might consider whether that might cause the
monetary relief to predominate. 603 F. 3d, at 621. Second, it accepted
in part Wal-Mart’s argument that since class members whom it no
longer employed had no standing to seek injunctive or declaratory
relief, as to them monetary claims must predominate. It excluded from
the certified class “those putative class members who were no longer
Wal-Mart employees at the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed,” id., at
623 (emphasis added).
