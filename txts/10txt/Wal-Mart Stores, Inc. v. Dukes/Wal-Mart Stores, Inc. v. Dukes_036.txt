Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

Wal-Mart’s supervisors do not make their discretion
ary decisions in a vacuum. The District Court reviewed
means Wal-Mart used to maintain a “carefully constructed
. . . corporate culture,” such as frequent meetings to reinforce the common way of thinking, regular transfers of
managers between stores to ensure uniformity through
out the company, monitoring of stores “on a close and con
stant basis,” and “Wal-Mart TV,” “broadcas[t] . . . into
all stores.” Id., at 151–153 (internal quotation marks
omitted).
The plaintiffs’ evidence, including class members’ tales
of their own experiences,4 suggests that gender bias suf
fused Wal-Mart’s company culture. Among illustrations,
senior management often refer to female associates as
“little Janie Qs.” Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification

“can be explained only by gender discrimination and not

4 The majority purports to derive from Teamsters v. United States,
431 U. S. 324 (1977), a rule that a discrimination claim, if accompanied
by anecdotes, must supply them in numbers proportionate to the size of
the class. Ante, at 17–18. Teamsters, the Court acknowledges, see
ante, at 18, n. 9, instructs that statistical evidence alone may suffice,
431 U. S., at 339; that decision can hardly be said to establish a nu
merical floor before anecdotal evidence can be taken into account.
