WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of the Court

at 652 (dissenting opinion).

We also conclude that respondents’ claims for backpay
were improperly certified under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 23(b)(2). Our opinion in Ticor Title Ins. Co. v.
Brown, 511 U. S. 117, 121 (1994) (per curiam) expressed
serious doubt about whether claims for monetary relief
may be certified under that provision. We now hold that
they may not, at least where (as here) the monetary relief
is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.

Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when “the party
opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds
that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive
relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate
respecting the class as a whole.” One possible reading of
this provision is that it applies only to requests for such
injunctive or declaratory relief and does not authorize the
class certification of monetary claims at all. We need not
reach that broader question in this case, because we think
that, at a minimum, claims for individualized relief (like
the backpay at issue here) do not satisfy the Rule. The
key to the (b)(2) class is “the indivisible nature of the
injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion
that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared
unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none
of them.” Nagareda, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 132. In other
words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction
or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each
member of the class. It does not authorize class certifica
tion when each individual class member would be entitled
to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against
the defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certi
fication when each class member would be entitled to an
