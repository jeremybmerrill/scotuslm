WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of the Court

40 and 53 separate departments and 80 to 500 staff posi
tions. In all, Wal-Mart operates approximately 3,400
stores and employs more than one million people.
Pay and promotion decisions at Wal-Mart are generally
committed to local managers’ broad discretion, which is
exercised “in a largely subjective manner.” 222 F. R. D.

Promotions work in a similar fashion. Wal-Mart per
mits store managers to apply their own subjective criteria
when selecting candidates as “support managers,” which is
the first step on the path to management. Admission to
Wal-Mart’s management training program, however, does
require that a candidate meet certain objective criteria,
including an above-average performance rating, at least
one year’s tenure in the applicant’s current position, and a
willingness to relocate. But except for those requirements,
regional and district managers have discretion to use their
own judgment when selecting candidates for management
training. Promotion to higher office—e.g., assistant man
ager, co-manager, or store manager—is similarly at the
discretion of the employee’s superiors after prescribed
objective factors are satisfied.

rent or former Wal-Mart employees who allege that the
company discriminated against them on the basis of their
sex by denying them equal pay or promotions, in violation
of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as
