individualized award of monetary damages.
That interpretation accords with the history of the Rule.
Because Rule 23 “stems from equity practice” that pre
dated its codification, Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor,
521 U. S. 591, 613 (1997), in determining its meaning we
have previously looked to the historical models on which
the Rule was based, Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S.
815, 841–845 (1999). As we observed in Amchem, “[c]ivil
rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class
based discrimination are prime examples” of what (b)(2) is
meant to capture. 521 U. S., at 614. In particular, the
Rule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to
racial segregation—conduct that was remedied by a single
classwide order. In none of the cases cited by the Advisory
Committee as examples of (b)(2)’s antecedents did the
plaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with
their classwide injunction. See Advisory Committee’s
Note, 39 F. R. D. 69, 102 (1966) (citing cases); e.g., Potts v.
Flax, 313 F. 2d 284, 289, n. 5 (CA5 1963); Brunson v.
Board of Trustees of Univ. of School Dist. No. 1, Clarendon
Cty., 311 F. 2d 107, 109 (CA4 1962) (per curiam); Frasier
v. Board of Trustees of N.C., 134 F. Supp. 589, 593 (NC
1955) (three-judge court), aff’d, 350 U. S. 979 (1956).
Permitting the combination of individualized and class
wide relief in a (b)(2) class is also inconsistent with the
structure of Rule 23(b). Classes certified under (b)(1) and
(b)(2) share the most traditional justifications for class
treatment—that individual adjudications would be impos
sible or unworkable, as in a (b)(1) class,11 or that the relief

11 Rule 23(b)(1) applies where separate actions by or against individ
ual class members would create a risk of “establish[ing] incompatible
standards of conduct for the party opposing the class,” Rule 23(b)(1)(A),
such as “where the party is obliged by law to treat the members of the
class alike,” Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 614
(1997), or where individual adjudications “as a practical matter, would
be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the
