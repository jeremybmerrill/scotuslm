The District Court, recognizing that “one significant is
sue common to the class may be sufficient to warrant cer
tification,” 222 F. R. D. 137, 145 (ND Cal. 2004), found
that the plaintiffs easily met that test. Absent an error of
law or an abuse of discretion, an appellate tribunal has no

ante, at 8–10. If the word “questions” were taken literally, the majority
asserts, plaintiffs could pass the Rule 23(a)(2) bar by “[r]eciting . . .
questions” like “Do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart?” Ante,
