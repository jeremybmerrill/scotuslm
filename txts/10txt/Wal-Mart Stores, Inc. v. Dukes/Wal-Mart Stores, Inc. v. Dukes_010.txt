WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of the Court

framework analysis” of Wal-Mart’s “culture” and person
nel practices, and concluded that the company was “vul
nerable” to gender discrimination. 603 F. 3d 571, 601
(CA9 2010) (en banc).
Wal-Mart unsuccessfully moved to strike much of this
evidence. It also offered its own countervailing statistical
and other proof in an effort to defeat Rule 23(a)’s require
ments of commonality, typicality, and adequate represen
tation. Wal-Mart further contended that respondents’
monetary claims for backpay could not be certified under
Rule 23(b)(2), first because that Rule refers only to injunc
tive and declaratory relief, and second because the back
pay claims could not be manageably tried as a class with
out depriving Wal-Mart of its right to present certain
statutory defenses. With one limitation not relevant here,
the District Court granted respondents’ motion and certi
fied their proposed class.3
D
A divided en banc Court of Appeals substantially af
firmed the District Court’s certification order. 603 F. 3d
571. The majority concluded that respondents’ evidence of
commonality was sufficient to “raise the common question
whether Wal-Mart’s female employees nationwide were
subjected to a single set of corporate policies (not merely a
number of independent discriminatory acts) that may
have worked to unlawfully discriminate against them in
violation of Title VII.” Id., at 612 (emphasis deleted). It
also agreed with the District Court that the named plain
tiffs’ claims were sufficiently typical of the class as a whole
——————
3 The District Court excluded backpay claims based on promotion
opportunities that had not been publicly posted, for the reason that no
applicant data could exist for such positions. 222 F. R. D. 137, 182 (ND
Cal. 2004). It also decided to afford class members notice of the ac
tion and the right to opt-out of the class with respect to respondents’
punitive-damages claim. Id., at 173.
