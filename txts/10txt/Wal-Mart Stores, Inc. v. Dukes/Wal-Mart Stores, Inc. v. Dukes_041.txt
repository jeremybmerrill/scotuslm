WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

larities” inquiry the Court endorses, developed his position
in the context of Rule 23(b)(3). See 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev.,
at 131 (Rule 23(b)(3) requires “some decisive degree of
similarity across the proposed class” because it “speaks
of common ‘questions’ that ‘predominate’ over individual
ones”).9 “The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry” is
meant to “tes[t] whether proposed classes are sufficiently
cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”
Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 623
(1997). If courts must conduct a “dissimilarities” analysis
at the Rule 23(a)(2) stage, no mission remains for Rule
23(b)(3).
Because Rule 23(a) is also a prerequisite for Rule
23(b)(1) and Rule 23(b)(2) classes, the Court’s “dissimilari
ties” position is far reaching.
Individual differences
should not bar a Rule 23(b)(1) or Rule 23(b)(2) class, so
long as the Rule 23(a) threshold is met. See Amchem
Products, 521 U. S., at 623, n. 19 (Rule 23(b)(1)(B) “does
not have a predominance requirement”); Yamasaki, 442
U. S., at 701 (Rule 23(b)(2) action in which the Court noted
that “[i]t is unlikely that differences in the factual back
ground of each claim will affect the outcome of the legal
issue”). For example, in Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co.,
424 U. S. 747 (1976), a Rule 23(b)(2) class of AfricanAmerican truckdrivers complained that the defendant had
discriminatorily refused to hire black applicants. We
recognized that the “qualification[s] and performance” of
individual class members might vary. Id., at 772 (internal
quotation marks omitted). “Generalizations concerning
such individually applicable evidence,” we cautioned,
“cannot serve as a justification for the denial of [injunc
