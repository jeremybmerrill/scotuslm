Opinion of the Court

amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–1 et seq.1
Betty Dukes began working at a Pittsburg, California,
Wal-Mart in 1994. She started as a cashier, but later
sought and received a promotion to customer service man
ager. After a series of disciplinary violations, however,
Dukes was demoted back to cashier and then to greeter.
Dukes concedes she violated company policy, but contends
that the disciplinary actions were in fact retaliation for

employees have not been disciplined for similar infrac

burg store are paid more than she is.
Christine Kwapnoski has worked at Sam’s Club stores
in Missouri and California for most of her adult life. She
has held a number of positions, including a supervisory
position. She claims that a male manager yelled at her
frequently and screamed at female employees, but not at
men. The manager in question “told her to ‘doll up,’ to
wear some makeup, and to dress a little better.” App.
1003a.
The final named plaintiff, Edith Arana, worked at a
Wal-Mart store in Duarte, California, from 1995 to 2001.
In 2000, she approached the store manager on more than
one occasion about management training, but was brushed
off. Arana concluded she was being denied opportunity for
advancement because of her sex. She initiated internal
complaint procedures, whereupon she was told to apply
directly to the district manager if she thought her store
manager was being unfair. Arana, however, decided
against that and never applied for management training
again. In 2001, she was fired for failure to comply with
Wal-Mart’s timekeeping policy.
These plaintiffs, respondents here, do not allege that
