Opinion of the Court

Nor is there anything unusual about that consequence:
The necessity of touching aspects of the merits in order to
resolve preliminary matters, e.g., jurisdiction and venue,
is a familiar feature of litigation. See Szabo v. Bridgeport
Machines, Inc., 249 F. 3d 672, 676–677 (CA7 2001)
(Easterbrook, J.).
In this case, proof of commonality necessarily overlaps
with respondents’ merits contention that Wal-Mart en
gages in a pattern or practice of discrimination.7 That is so
because, in resolving an individual’s Title VII claim, the
crux of the inquiry is “the reason for a particular employ
ment decision,” Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Rich
mond, 467 U. S. 867, 876 (1984). Here respondents wish

Perhaps the most common example of considering a merits question
at the Rule 23 stage arises in class-action suits for securities fraud.
Rule 23(b)(3)’s requirement that “questions of law or fact common to
class members predominate over any questions affecting only individ
ual members” would often be an insuperable barrier to class certifica
tion, since each of the individual investors would have to prove reliance
on the alleged misrepresentation. But the problem dissipates if the
plaintiffs can establish the applicability of the so-called “fraud on the
market” presumption, which says that all traders who purchase stock
in an efficient market are presumed to have relied on the accuracy of a
company’s public statements. To invoke this presumption, the plain
tiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certification must prove that their shares were
traded on an efficient market, Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton
Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5), an issue they will surely
have to prove again at trial in order to make out their case on the
merits.
7 In a pattern-or-practice case, the plaintiff tries to “establish by a
preponderance of the evidence that . . . discrimination was the com
pany’s standard operating procedure[,] the regular rather than the
unusual practice.” Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 358
(1977); see also Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U. S. 747, 772
(1976). If he succeeds, that showing will support a rebuttable inference
that all class members were victims of the discriminatory practice, and
will justify “an award of prospective relief,” such as “an injunctive order
against the continuation of the discriminatory practice.” Teamsters,
supra, at 361.
