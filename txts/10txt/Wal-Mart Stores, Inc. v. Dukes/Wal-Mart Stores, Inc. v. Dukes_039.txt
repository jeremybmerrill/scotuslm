WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of GINSBURG, J.

The plaintiffs’ allegations state claims of gender dis
crimination in the form of biased decisionmaking in both
pay and promotions. The evidence reviewed by the Dis
trict Court adequately demonstrated that resolving those
claims would necessitate examination of particular poli

thereby elevates the (a)(2) inquiry so that it is no longer
“easily satisfied,” 5 J. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Prac

7 The Court places considerable weight on General Telephone Co. of
Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147 (1982). Ante, at 12–13. That case
has little relevance to the question before the Court today. The lead
plaintiff in Falcon alleged discrimination evidenced by the company’s
