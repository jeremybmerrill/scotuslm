Opinion of the Court

whether class issues predominate or whether class action
is a superior method of adjudicating the dispute. Pre
dominance and superiority are self-evident. But with
respect to each class member’s individualized claim for
money, that is not so—which is precisely why (b)(3) re
quires the judge to make findings about predominance and
superiority before allowing the class. Similarly, (b)(2) does
not require that class members be given notice and optout rights, presumably because it is thought (rightly or
wrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is
mandatory, and that depriving people of their right to sue
in this manner complies with the Due Process Clause. In
the context of a class action predominantly for money
damages we have held that absence of notice and opt-out
violates due process. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts,
472 U. S. 797, 812 (1985). While we have never held that
to be so where the monetary claims do not predominate,
the serious possibility that it may be so provides an addi
tional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the
monetary claims here.

Against that conclusion, respondents argue that their
claims for backpay were appropriately certified as part of
a class under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not
“predominate” over their requests for injunctive and de
claratory relief. They rely upon the Advisory Committee’s
statement that Rule 23(b)(2) “does not extend to cases in
which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or
predominantly to money damages.” 39 F. R. D., at 102
(emphasis added). The negative implication, they argue,
is that it does extend to cases in which the appropriate
final relief relates only partially and nonpredominantly to
money damages. Of course it is the Rule itself, not the
Advisory Committee’s description of it, that governs. And
a mere negative inference does not in our view suffice to
