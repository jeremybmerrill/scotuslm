The “dissimilarities” approach leads the Court to train
its attention on what distinguishes individual class mem
bers, rather than on what unites them. Given the lack of
standards for pay and promotions, the majority says,
“demonstrating the invalidity of one manager’s use of
discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of
another’s.” Ante, at 15.
Wal-Mart’s delegation of discretion over pay and promo
tions is a policy uniform throughout all stores. The very
nature of discretion is that people will exercise it in vari
ous ways. A system of delegated discretion, Watson held,
is a practice actionable under Title VII when it produces
discriminatory outcomes. 487 U. S., at 990–991; see su
pra, at 7–8. A finding that Wal-Mart’s pay and promo
tions practices in fact violate the law would be the first
step in the usual order of proof for plaintiffs seeking indi
vidual remedies for company-wide discrimination. Team
sters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 359 (1977); see Albe
marle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 415–423 (1975).
That each individual employee’s unique circumstances will
ultimately determine whether she is entitled to backpay or
damages, §2000e–5(g)(2)(A) (barring backpay if a plaintiff
“was refused . . . advancement . . . for any reason other
than discrimination”), should not factor into the Rule
23(a)(2) determination.

The Court errs in importing a “dissimilarities” notion
suited to Rule 23(b)(3) into the Rule 23(a) commonality
inquiry. I therefore cannot join Part II of the Court’s
opinion.
