WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES
Opinion of the Court

We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).
II
The class action is “an exception to the usual rule that
litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual
named parties only.” Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682,
700–701 (1979). In order to justify a departure from that
rule, “a class representative must be part of the class and
‘possess the same interest and suffer the same injury’ as

The crux of this case is commonality—the rule requiring
a plaintiff to show that “there are questions of law or fact
common to the class.” Rule 23(a)(2).5 That language is

5 We have previously stated in this context that “[t]he commonality
and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge. Both serve as
guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances
maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named
plaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the inter
ests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in
their absence. Those requirements therefore also tend to merge with
the adequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter
requirement also raises concerns about the competency of class counsel
and conflicts of interest.” General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Fal
