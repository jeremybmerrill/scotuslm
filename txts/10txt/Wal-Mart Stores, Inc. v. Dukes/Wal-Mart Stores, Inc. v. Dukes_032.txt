WAL-MART STORES, INC., PETITIONER v.

BETTY DUKES ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 20, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER,
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, concurring
in part and dissenting in part.
The class in this case, I agree with the Court, should not
have been certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
23(b)(2). The plaintiffs, alleging discrimination in viola
tion of Title VII, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq., seek monetary
relief that is not merely incidental to any injunctive or
declaratory relief that might be available. See ante, at 20–
27. A putative class of this type may be certifiable under
Rule 23(b)(3), if the plaintiffs show that common class questions “predominate” over issues affecting individuals—
e.g., qualification for, and the amount of, backpay or com
pensatory damages—and that a class action is “superior”
to other modes of adjudication.
Whether the class the plaintiffs describe meets the
specific requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) is not before the
Court, and I would reserve that matter for consideration
and decision on remand.1 The Court, however, disqualifies
the class at the starting gate, holding that the plaintiffs
cannot cross the “commonality” line set by Rule 23(a)(2).
——————
1 The plaintiffs requested Rule 23(b)(3) certification as an alternative,
should their request for (b)(2) certification fail. Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Class Certification in No. 3:01–cv–02252–CRB (ND Cal.), Doc. 99, p. 47.
