UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. TOHONO O’ODHAM
NATION
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[April 26, 2011] 


JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting. 

I dissent from the Court’s immoderate reading of 28

U. S. C. §1500 and would affirm the Federal Circuit’s
judgment.
According to the Court, the Court of Federal Claims
(CFC) lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the Tohono
O’odham Nation’s (Nation) claim because the Tribe was
simultaneously pursuing in the D. C. District Court an
action with “a common factual basis.” Ante, at 1. It mat
ters not, the Court holds, that to gain complete relief, the
Nation had to launch two suits, for neither of the two
courts whose jurisdiction the Tribe invoked could alone
provide full redress. See ante, at 8–9.
The Court concludes that “claim” or “cause of action,”
terms the Court considers synonymous as used in §1500,*
——————
* “ ‘Cause of action,’ ” the Court simultaneously states, “is the more
technical term.” Ante, at 5. If “more technical” means more precise,
clear or certain, the Court is incorrect. See United States v. Memphis
Cotton Oil Co., 288 U. S. 62, 67–68 (1933) (“A ‘cause of action’ may
mean one thing for one purpose and something different for another.”).
In its discourse on the term, the Court has fallen into an old error; the
drafters of the Federal Rules endeavored to “eliminate the unfortunate
rigidity and confusion surrounding the words ‘cause of action.’ ” 5 C.
Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1216, p. 207 (3d
ed. 2004). Today’s invocation of a supposed particular or exact meaning
for the phrase risks reviving that confusion.
