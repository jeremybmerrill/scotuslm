UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

tion of the courts”); see also Marrese v. American Academy
of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U. S. 373, 382 (1985); 18 C.
Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and
Procedure §4412, p. 276 (2d ed. 2002). This principle has
long informed claim preclusion law. See, e.g., Restatement
of Judgments §62, Comment k (1942) (“[W]here a plaintiff
brings an action in a State in which the courts have juris
diction only with reference to one portion of his cause of
action, he is not barred from maintaining an action in a
proper court for the other portion”); 2 H. Black, Law of
Judgments §618, p. 744 (1891) (“A judgment is not conclu
sive of any matter which, from the nature of the case, the
form of action, or the character of the pleadings, could not
have been adjudicated in the former suit”). For these
reasons, preclusion doctrine actually undermines the
majority’s position.
In sum, the majority offers no coherent justification for
its conclusion that Congress intended to preclude jurisdic
tion in the CFC whenever a plaintiff’s claim in that court
is based on substantially the same facts as a suit pending
elsewhere without reference to the relief sought.

Even before today’s decision, §1500 had been described
as “anachronistic,” Keene, 508 U. S., at 217, “harsh,” id., at
222 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and “arbitrar[y],” 79 Fed. Cl.
645, 659, n. 16 (2007). Judges and commentators have
long called for congressional attention to the statute. See,
e.g., Keene, 508 U. S., at 222 (Stevens, J., dissenting);
Schwartz, supra, at 601. Today’s decision—which unnec
essarily considers and repudiates the Casman rule—
renders such attention all the more pressing. Under the
Court’s construction of §1500, plaintiffs whom Congress
has forced to file parallel actions in the CFC and a district
