UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION
Opinion of the Court

The two actions both allege that the United States holds
the same assets in trust for the Nation’s benefit. They
describe almost identical breaches of fiduciary duty—that
the United States engaged in self-dealing and imprudent
investment, and failed to provide an accurate accounting
of the assets held in trust, for example. Indeed, it appears
that the Nation could have filed two identical complaints,
save the caption and prayer for relief, without changing
either suit in any significant respect.
Under §1500, the substantial overlap in operative facts
between the Nation’s District Court and CFC suits pre
cludes jurisdiction in the CFC. The Court of Appeals erred
when it concluded otherwise.
IV
The holding here precludes the CFC from exercising
jurisdiction over the Nation’s suit while the District Court
case is pending. Should the Nation choose to dismiss the
latter action, or upon that action’s completion, the Nation
is free to file suit again in the CFC if the statute of limita
tions is no bar. In the meantime, and in light of the sub
stantial overlap in operative facts between them, the two
suits are “for or in respect to” the same claim under §1500,
and the CFC case must be dismissed. The contrary judg
ment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
