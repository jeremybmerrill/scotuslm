Opinion of the Court

the affected tribe has been given an appropriate account
ing. See, e.g., 123 Stat. 2922; 104 Stat. 1930.
Even were some hardship to be shown, considerations of
policy divorced from the statute’s text and purpose could
not override its meaning. Although Congress has permit
ted claims against the United States for monetary relief in
the CFC, that relief is available by grace and not by right.
See Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858) (“[A]s this
permission is altogether voluntary on the part of the
sovereignty, it follows that it may prescribe the terms and
conditions on which it consents to be sued, and the man
ner in which the suit shall be conducted”). If indeed the
statute leads to incomplete relief, and if plaintiffs like the
Nation are dissatisfied, they are free to direct their com
plaints to Congress. This Court “enjoy[s] no ‘liberty to add
an exception . . . to remove apparent hardship.’ ” Keene,
508 U. S., at 217–218 (quoting Corona Coal Co. v. United
States, 263 U. S. 537, 540 (1924)).
Keene reserved the question whether common facts are
sufficient to bar a CFC action where a similar case is
pending elsewhere. To continue to reserve the question
would force the CFC to engage in an unnecessary and
complicated remedial inquiry, and it would increase the
expense and duration of litigation. The question thus
demands an answer, and the answer is yes. Two suits are
for or in respect to the same claim, precluding jurisdiction
in the CFC, if they are based on substantially the same
operative facts, regardless of the relief sought in each suit.
III
The remaining question is whether the Nation’s two
suits have sufficient factual overlap to trigger the jurisdic
tional bar. The CFC dismissed the action here in part
because it concluded that the facts in the Nation’s two
suits were, “for all practical purposes, identical.” 79 Fed.
Cl. 645, 656 (2007). It was correct to do so.
