SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

court to obtain complete relief must now choose either to
forgo relief in the district court or to file first in the district
court and risk the expiration of the statute of limitations
on their claims in the CFC. I cannot agree that Congress
intended, or intends, for ยง1500 to produce this result. For
these reasons, I respectfully concur only in the judgment.
