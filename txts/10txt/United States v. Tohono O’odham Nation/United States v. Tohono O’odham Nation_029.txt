GINSBURG, J., dissenting

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins the Court’s judgment (although
not the Court’s reasoning) because the “Tohono O’odham
Nation seeks in the [CFC] . . . some of the same relief on
the same facts as it does in its pending District Court
action.” Ante, at 1 (emphasis added). But to the extent
that “the Nation’s two actions seek overlapping relief,”
ibid., a disposition less harsh would be in order. Ordinar
ily, when a plaintiff’s allegations and demands for relief
are excessive, her complaint is not instantly dismissed on
that account. Instead, she may seek leave to trim her
pleading, permission a court “should freely give . . . when
justice so requires.” Rule 15(a)(2) (CFC 2010). Cf. Rule
54(c) (CFC 2010) (judgment, other than default, need not
conform to demand for relief, but “should grant the relief
to which each party is entitled”).
As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and the Nation recognize, to
avoid both duplication and the running of the statute of
limitations, the CFC suit could be stayed while the com
panion District Court action proceeds. See ante, at 11;
Brief for Respondent 35. That is a common practice when
a prior action is pending. See Pennsylvania R. Co. v.
United States, 363 U. S. 202, 204–206 (1960) (instructing
Court of Claims to stay pending proceedings to enable
litigant to obtain District Court review of relevant agency
order); Creppel v. United States, 41 F. 3d 627, 633 (CA
Fed. 1994) (“[T]he Court of Federal Claims may stay a
takings action pending completion of a related action in a
district court.”).
Why is this Court not positioned to direct the CFC to
disregard requests for relief simultaneously sought in a
district-court action, or at least to recognize that an
amended CFC complaint could save the case? I see no
impediment to either course, in §1500 or any other law or
rule.
