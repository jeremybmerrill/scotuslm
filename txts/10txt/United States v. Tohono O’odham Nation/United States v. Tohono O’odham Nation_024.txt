Court and money damages in the CFC); see also, e.g., Ex
parte Skinner & Eddy Corp., 265 U. S. 86, 91–92 (1924)
(seeking money damages against the United States in the
Court of Claims and against a federal entity in state
court); Corona Coal Co. v. United States, 263 U. S. 537,
539 (1924) (seeking money damages against the United
States in the Court of Claims and against a federal agent
in District Court); British American Tobacco Co. v. United
States, 89 Ct. Cl. 438, 439–440 (1939) (per curiam) (seek
ing tort damages in the District Court and contract dam
ages in the Court of Claims). As these cases make clear,
interpreting §1500 to prohibit requests for duplicative
relief hardly renders the statute of limited application.
Third, the majority suggests that its construction of
§1500 is necessary to achieve the statute’s aim of “sav[ing]
the Government from burdens of redundant litigation.”
Ante, at 7. Parallel actions seeking the same or duplica
tive relief, or different forms of relief that are available
entirely in one court, are redundant; actions seeking dif
ferent forms of relief that Congress has made available
exclusively in different courts are not. To the extent the
majority is concerned about the burdens of parallel discov

as stays, to prevent such burdens. See Schwartz, Section
1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the
Government and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 599 (1967).
Finally, the majority contends that focusing on opera
tive facts is consistent with the principles of claim preclu
sion embodied in the statute. Claim preclusion ordinarily
“bar[s] claims arising from the same transaction.” Kremer
v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 482, n. 22 (1982).
There is, however, an exception to this rule when a plain
tiff was unable to obtain a certain remedy in the earlier
action. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments §26(1)(c)
(1980) (claim preclusion does not apply where “[t]he plain
tiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to
