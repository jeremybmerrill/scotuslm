UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION
Opinion of the Court

duplicate suits elsewhere would be unlikely to require
remedial overlap.
Remedial overlap between CFC actions and those in
other courts was even more unusual when §1500’s rule
was first enacted in 1868. At that time the CFC had a
more limited jurisdiction than it does now, for the Tucker
Act’s general waiver of sovereign immunity for non-tort
claims for monetary relief had not yet been enacted. See
24 Stat. 505. And while the district courts can today
adjudicate suits against the United States for money
damages under the Little Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.
§1346(a)(2), and the Federal Tort Claims Act §1346(b), in
1868 the United States could only be sued in the Court of
Claims. United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 212–214
(1983); G. Sisk, Litigation with the Federal Government
§4.02(a)(1) (4th ed. 2006). Because the kinds of suits and
forms of relief available against the United States were
few and constrained, remedial overlap between CFC suits
and those in other courts was even less common then than
now. If the statute were to require remedial as well as
factual overlap, it would have had very limited application
in 1868 despite its broad language that bars not only
identical but also related claims. The rule in §1500 effects
a significant jurisdictional limitation, and Congress reen
acted it even as changes in the structure of the courts
made suits on the same facts more likely to arise. Doing
so reaffirmed the force of the bar and thus the commit
ment to curtailing redundant litigation.
The panel of the Court of Appeals could not identify
“any purpose that §1500 serves today,” 559 F. 3d, at 1292,
in large part because it was bound by Circuit precedent
that left the statute without meaningful force. For exam
ple, the panel cited Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States,
170 Ct. Cl. 389, 343 F. 2d 943 (1965), which held that
§1500 does not prohibit two identical suits from proceed
ing so long as the action in the CFC, or at that time the
