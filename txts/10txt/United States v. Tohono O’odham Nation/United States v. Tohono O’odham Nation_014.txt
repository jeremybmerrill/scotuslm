UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. TOHONO O’ODHAM
NATION
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

[April 26, 2011] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
concurring in the judgment.
Congress enacted the statute currently codified at 28
U. S. C. §1500 to put an end to parallel litigation seeking
duplicative relief against the United States and its agents.
Respondent Tohono O’odham Nation seeks in the Court of
Federal Claims (CFC) some of the same relief on the same
facts as it does in its pending District Court action. Ac
cordingly, applying our decision in Keene Corp. v. United
States, 508 U. S. 200 (1993), I agree with the Court that
§1500 bars the Nation’s CFC action. Because the Nation’s
two actions seek overlapping relief, this case does not
present the question that the Court decides today—
whether §1500 bars an action in the CFC when the plain
tiff’s actions share a common factual basis but seek differ
ent forms of relief. Nonetheless, the Court holds that a
common factual basis alone suffices to bar jurisdiction in
the CFC. Under the Court’s reading of the statute, a
plaintiff cannot pursue a claim in the CFC based on the
same facts as another pending action, even when Congress
has required that plaintiff to file separate actions in two
courts to obtain different forms of relief necessary to make
the plaintiff whole. I cannot agree that §1500 demands
this result.
