SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

B
1
The text, purpose, and history of §1500 provide strong
reason to believe that Congress did not intend for §1500
to put plaintiffs to a choice between two nonduplicative
remedies that Congress has made available exclusively in
two forums. The statute bars jurisdiction in the CFC over
a “claim for or in respect to which” a plaintiff has a suit or
process pending elsewhere. When Congress first enacted
§1500’s predecessor, the statute establishing the jurisdic
tion of the Court of Claims used the term “claims” to refer
to demands for money damages. See Act of Mar. 3, 1863,
§§2–3, 12 Stat. 765; see United States v. Jones, 131 U. S.
1, 17 (1889) (noting that the statute’s provisions “were
inconsistent with the enforcement of any claims under the
law except claims for money”).6 Congress thus would have

Tribes v. United States, 174 Ct. Cl. 483, 487–488, 490 (1966). But see
Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Okla. v. United States, 582 F. 3d 1306, 1308
(CA Fed. 2009) (suggesting in dicta that the CFC can order an equita
ble accounting as “ancillary relief” under 28 U. S. C. §§1491(a)(2) and
(b)(2)), cert. pending, No. 09–1521.
The majority next suggests that Congress has tolled the statute of
limitations governing the Nation’s CFC claims. See ante, at 8–9. But
the cited statute only applies to claims “concerning losses to or mis
management of trust funds.” 123 Stat. 2922. It does not appear to toll
the statute of limitations for claims concerning assets other than funds,
such as tangible assets. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a–69a (seeking
damages for the Government’s mismanagement of the Nation’s mineral
estates). Expiration of the 6-year statute of limitations governing
claims in the CFC is a very real prospect in this and other cases; the
Nation’s District Court action has been pending for more than four
years.
As the majority notes, see ante, at 6–7, the validity of the Court of
Claims’ holding in Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States, 170 Ct. Cl.
389, 343 F. 2d 943 (1965), is not presented in this case. This Court has
never considered that holding. Accordingly, I do not consider whether
the Nation could have avoided application of §1500 altogether by filing
its CFC action first.
