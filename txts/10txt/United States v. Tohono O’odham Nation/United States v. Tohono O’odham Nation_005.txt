UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION
Opinion of the Court

States District Court for the District of Columbia against
federal officials responsible for managing tribal assets
held in trust by the Federal Government. The complaint
alleged various violations of fiduciary duty with respect to
those assets. The Nation claimed, for example, that the
officials failed to provide an accurate accounting of trust
property; to refrain from self-dealing; or to use reasonable
skill in investing trust assets. The complaint requested
equitable relief, including an accounting.
The next day the Nation filed the instant action against
the United States in the CFC. The CFC complaint de
scribed the same trust assets and the same fiduciary
duties that were the subject of the District Court com
plaint. And it alleged almost identical violations of fiduci
ary duty, for which it requested money damages. The CFC
case was dismissed under §1500 for want of jurisdiction.
A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit reversed. 559 F. 3d 1284 (2009). Two suits are for
or in respect to the same claim, it reasoned, only if they
share operative facts and also seek overlapping relief.
Finding no overlap in the relief requested, the court held
that the two suits at issue were not for or in respect to the
same claim.
This Court granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).

Since 1868, Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of
the CFC and its predecessors when related actions are
pending elsewhere. Section 1500, identical in most re
spects to the original statute, provides:
“The United States Court of Federal Claims shall
not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to
which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any
other court any suit or process against the United
States or any person who, at the time when the cause
