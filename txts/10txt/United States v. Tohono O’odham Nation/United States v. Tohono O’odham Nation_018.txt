SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

setts, 487 U. S. 879, 905 (1988); see also 28 U. S. C.
§1491(a). As a result, a plaintiff seeking both money
damages and injunctive relief to remedy distinct harms
arising from the same set of facts may be forced to file
actions in both the CFC and federal district court.
For half a century, the CFC has recognized that §1500
does not preclude jurisdiction in that court when Congress
has required a plaintiff to split a claim into two actions to
obtain different forms of relief necessary to make the
plaintiff whole. In Casman v. United States, 135 Ct. Cl.
647 (1956), a terminated federal employee sought backpay
in the Court of Claims and reinstatement to his position in
District Court. The plaintiff’s two suits arose from the
same facts (his termination) but sought “entirely different”
forms of relief within the exclusive jurisdiction of two
courts.4 Id., at 650. In light of our previous recognition
that the purpose of §1500 “ ‘was only to require an election
between a suit in the Court of Claims and one brought in
another court,’ ” id., at 649 (quoting Matson Nav. Co. v.
United States, 284 U. S. 352, 355–356 (1932)), the Court of
Claims held that §1500 was inapplicable when a “plaintiff
has no right to elect between two courts,” 135 Ct. Cl., at
650. To hold otherwise, the court acknowledged, “would
be to say to plaintiff, ‘If you want your job back you must
forget your back pay’; conversely, ‘If you want your back
pay, you cannot have your job back.’ ” Ibid.; see also Love
ladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 27 F. 3d 1545, 1551
(CA Fed. 1994) (en banc) (reaffirming Casman’s inquiry
into the form of relief sought).
By reserving the question “whether two actions based on

4 Congress has since enacted legislation to permit plaintiffs in Cas
man’s situation to obtain complete relief in the CFC. See Act of Aug.
29, 1972, §1, 86 Stat. 652, 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(2) (permitting the CFC
to “issue orders directing restoration to office or position, placement in
appropriate duty or retirement status, and correction of applicable
records”).
