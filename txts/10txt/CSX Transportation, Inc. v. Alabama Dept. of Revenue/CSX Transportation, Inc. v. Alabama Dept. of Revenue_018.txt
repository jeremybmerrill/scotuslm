Opinion of the Court

Congress drafted §11501 to enable railroads to contest all
other tax exemptions; and when Congress speaks in such
preemptive terms, its decision must govern. Principles of
federalism cannot narrow §11501’s clear scope. See, e.g.,
CSX Transp., Inc. v. Georgia State Bd. of Equalization,
552 U. S. 9, 20 (2007) (rejecting the idea that federalism
principles preclude challenges to state valuation method­
ologies when §11501 “clearly authorized” such actions).
Nothing in ACF Industries suggested otherwise.

Alabama additionally makes a subtler argument involv­
ing ACF Industries. Given that decision, Alabama con­
tends, a ruling in CSX’s favor here would create troubling
inconsistencies. Alabama claims that subsection (b)(4)’s
singular prohibition on “discriminat[ion]” would then
mean one thing for property taxes (according to ACF
Industries) and another for non-property taxes, even
though nothing in the statute supports “morphing defini­
tions.” Brief for Respondents 32. And still worse than the
difference in meaning would be the difference in result:
A ruling for CSX, Alabama argues, would give railroads
more protection against non-property taxes than against
property taxes, even though no good reason exists for this
distinction.
Alabama’s one-word-two-meanings argument collapses
because it again rests on a misunderstanding of ACF
Industries. That decision did not define “discriminat[e]” or
say that a tax exemption could not fall within that term.
Quite to the contrary: As noted earlier, ACF Industries
frankly acknowledged that tax exemptions, including
property tax exemptions, “could be a variant of tax dis­
crimination.” 510 U. S., at 343; supra, at 9. We held that
property tax exemptions were immune from challenge
under subsection (b)(4) for structural, rather than linguis­
tic, reasons. Even assuming these exemptions “discrimi­
