CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF 

REVENUE
Opinion of the Court 





An excise tax, like Alabama’s sales and use tax, is “an­
other tax” under subsection (b)(4).6 The 4–R Act does not
define “tax”; nor does the statute otherwise place any
matters within, or exclude any matters from, the term’s
ambit. In these circumstances, we look to the word’s
ordinary definition, Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513
U. S. 179, 187 (1995), and we note what taxpayers have
long since discovered—that the meaning of “tax” is expan­
sive. A State (or other governmental entity) seeking to
raise revenue may choose among multiple forms of taxa­
tion on property, income, transactions, or activities.
“[A]nother tax,” as used in subsection (b)(4), is best under­
stood to refer to all of these—more precisely, to encompass
any form of tax a State might impose, on any asset or
transaction, except the taxes on property previously ad­
dressed in subsections (b)(1)–(3). See Burlington Northern
R. Co. v. Superior, 932 F. 2d 1185, 1186 (CA7 1991) (Sub­
section (b)(4) includes “an income tax, a gross-receipts tax,
a use tax, an occupation tax . . . —whatever”). The phrase
“another tax” is a catch-all.
In particular, we see no reason to interpret subsection
(b)(4) as applying only to the gross-receipts taxes—known
as “in lieu” taxes—that some States imposed instead of
property taxes at the time of the Act’s passage. See Brief
for Respondents 53–55; Brief for State of Washington
et al. as Amici Curiae 20–22. The argument in favor of
this construction relies on the House Report concerning
——————
We think this question of waiver is also best considered by the trial
court.
6 As originally enacted, the provision that is now 49 U. S. C.
§11501(b)(4) prohibited the imposition of “any other tax” that discrimi­
nates against a railroad. §26c (1976 ed.). The substitution of “another
tax” occurred when Congress first recodified the Act. In line with
Congress’s statement that revisions made at that time should not be
construed as having substantive effect, see n. 1, supra, we treat the two
terms as synonymous.
