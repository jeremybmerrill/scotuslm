CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF 

REVENUE
Opinion of the Court 





the railroad a 4% tax and the competitor nothing. The
latter situation would frustrate the purposes of the Act
even more than the former. In ACF Industries, we ac­
cepted that anomaly because the terms and structure of
the Act demanded that we do so. But we could say no
more in favor of the result than that it was “not so bizarre
that Congress could not have intended it.” 510 U. S., at
347 (internal quotation marks omitted). That was not a
glowing recommendation, and we see no reason today to
view the matter differently. Accordingly, even assuming
that statutory ambiguity permitted us to do so, we would
hesitate to extend the distinction between tax exemptions
and differential tax rates in order to avoid a distinction
between property and non-property taxes. That would
seem a poor trade of statutory anomalies.
In any event, and more importantly, the choice is not
ours to make. Congress wrote the statute it wrote, and
that statute draws a sharp line between property taxes
and other taxes. Congress drafted §§11501(b)(1)–(3) to
exclude tax exemptions from the sphere of prohibited
property tax discrimination. But it drafted §11501(b)(4)
more broadly, without any of the prior subsections’ limita­
tions, to proscribe other “tax[es] that discriminat[e],”
including through the use of exemptions. That congres­
sional election settles this case. Alabama’s preference for
symmetry cannot trump an asymmetrical statute. And its
preference for the greatest possible latitude to levy taxes
cannot trump Congress’s decision to restrict discrimina­
tory taxation of rail carriers.
IV
Our decision in this case is limited. We hold that CSX
may challenge Alabama’s sales and use taxes as “tax[es]
that discriminat[e] against . . . rail carrier[s]” under
§11501(b)(4). We do not address whether CSX should
prevail in that challenge—whether, that is, Alabama’s
