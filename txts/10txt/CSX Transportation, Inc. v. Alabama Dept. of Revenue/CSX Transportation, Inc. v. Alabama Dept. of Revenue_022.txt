Opinion of the Court

taxes in fact discriminate against railroads by exempting
interstate motor and water carriers. Alabama argues, in
support of barring CSX’s challenge at the outset, that this
inquiry into discrimination may pose difficulties. Brief for
Respondents 35–37. We cannot deny that assertion, but
neither can we respond to it by precluding CSX’s claim.
Discrimination cases sometimes do raise knotty questions
about whether and when dissimilar treatment is ade­
quately justified. In the context of the 4–R Act, those hard
calls can arise when States charge different tax rates to
different entities in a practice the statute specifically
subjects to challenge. See §11501(b)(3). So too, difficult
issues can emerge when, as here, States provide certain
entities with tax exemptions. In either case, Congress has
directed the federal courts to review a railroad’s challenge;
and in either case, we would flout the congressional com­
mand were we to declare the matter beyond us.
For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the
Eleventh Circuit and remand the case for further proceed­
ings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
