CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF 

REVENUE
THOMAS, J., dissenting





that states did not shift to new forms of tax discrimination
outside the letter of the first three subsections”); Burling
ton Northern R. Co. v. Superior, 932 F. 2d 1185, 1186 (CA7
1991) (“Subsection (b)(4) is . . . designed to prevent the
state from accomplishing the forbidden end of discriminat
ing against railroads by substituting another type of tax”).
Subsection (b)(4) should be understood to tackle the issue
of systemic railroad over-taxation the same way that the
other subsections do—by linking the taxation of railroads
to the taxation of businesses with local political influence.
Thus, a “tax that discriminates against a rail carrier” is a
tax that targets or singles out rail carriers compared to
commercial and industrial taxpayers.
B
Under this test, CSX’s complaint was properly dis
missed. CSX has not alleged that Alabama’s sales and use
taxes target railroads compared to general commercial
and industrial taxpayers. See ACF Industries, 510 U. S.,
at 346–347 (leaving open a case in which “railroads—
either alone or as part of some isolated and targeted
group—are the only commercial entities” subject to a tax);
Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 550
F. 3d 1306, 1316 (CA11 2008). CSX alleges that it paid a
tax on its fuel that certain rail competitors did not have to
pay. But it concedes, as it must, that the sales and use
taxes are “generally applicable.” Pet. for Cert. i; see Ala.
Code §40–23–2(1) (2010 Cum. Supp.) (imposing a four
percent sales tax on “every person, firm, or corporation . . .
selling at retail any tangible personal property whatso
ever”); §40–23–61(a) (2003); see also Norfolk Southern R.
Co., supra, at 1316; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.
Discrete exemptions for certain railroad competitors—
namely, fuel exemptions for interstate motor carriers and
interstate ships and barges—do not make a generally
applicable tax “discriminat[ory]” under subsection (b)(4).
