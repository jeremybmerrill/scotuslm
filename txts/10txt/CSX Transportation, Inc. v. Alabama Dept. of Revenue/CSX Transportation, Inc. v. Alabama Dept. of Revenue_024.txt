CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF 

REVENUE
THOMAS, J., dissenting





compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers.
That reading settles the ambiguity in the word “discrimi
nates” by reference to the rest of the statute and gives
subsection (b)(4) a reach consistent with the problem the
statute addressed.
A
“Discriminates,” standing alone, is a flexible word.
Compare, e.g., Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates,
P. C. v. Wells, 538 U. S. 440, 446 (2003) (“[T]he statutory

Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 284 (1978)
(opinion of Powell, J.) (“The concept of ‘discrimination’ . . .
is susceptible of varying interpretations”). Here, the word
“discriminates” in subsection (b)(4) is ambiguous as to the
appropriate comparison class. Burlington Northern R. Co.

as compared to someone else”). It is also ambiguous as to
