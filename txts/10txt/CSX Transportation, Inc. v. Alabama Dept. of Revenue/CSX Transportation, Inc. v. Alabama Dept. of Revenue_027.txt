THOMAS, J., dissenting

At the time the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory
Reform Act (4–R Act) was enacted, it was clear that “rail
roads ‘ “are easy prey for State and local tax assessors” in
that they are “nonvoting, often nonresident, targets for
local taxation,” who cannot easily remove themselves from
the locality.’ ” ACF Industries, supra, at 336 (quoting
Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Board of Equalization of S. D.,
480 U. S. 123, 131 (1987) (quoting, in turn, S. Rep. No. 91–
630, p. 3 (1969))). The “temptation to excessively tax
nonvoting, nonresident businesses . . . made federal legis
lation in this area necessary.” Western Air Lines, supra, at
131; see also Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Oklahoma Tax
Comm’n, 481 U. S. 454, 457 (1987) (noting that “[a]fter an
extended period of congressional investigation, Congress
concluded that ‘railroads are over-taxed by at least $50
million each year’ ” (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94–725, p. 78
(1975))).
In other words, §11501(b) responded primarily to what
its text describes—property taxes that soaked the rail
roads. The obvious rationale supporting subsections (b)(1)
through (3) is that the “way to prevent tax discrimination
against the railroads is to tie their tax fate to the fate of a
large and local group of taxpayers.” Kansas City Southern
R. Co. v. McNamara, 817 F. 2d 368, 375 (CA5 1987); see
also Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Arizona, 78 F. 3d 438,
441 (CA9 1996). In this way, subsections (b)(1) through
(3) establish a political check on the taxation of rail
roads. States cannot impose excessive property taxes on
the nonvoting, nonresident railroads without imposing
the same taxes more generally on voting, resident local
businesses.
Absent any indication that subsection (b)(4), as a resid
ual clause, has any different aim, it is reasonable to con
clude that it shares the same one as subsections (b)(1)
through (3). See, e.g., Kansas City Southern R. Co., supra,
at 373–374 (Congress included subsection (b)(4) “to ensure
