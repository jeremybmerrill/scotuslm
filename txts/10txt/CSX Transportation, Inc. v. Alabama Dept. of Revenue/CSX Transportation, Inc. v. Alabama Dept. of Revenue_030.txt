CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF 

REVENUE
THOMAS, J., dissenting





CSX has stated a claim even in this case but instead
leaves that issue for remand. Accordingly, States remain
free to argue—and lower courts to hold—that complaints
like CSX’s should be dismissed for failing to state a “dis
criminat[ion]” claim under §11501(b)(4) when they do not
allege that railroads are targeted or singled out compared
to commercial and industrial taxpayers generally.
Nonetheless, despite the majority’s assertion that it is
“inappropriate” to address whether Alabama’s tax scheme
actually discriminates within the meaning of §11501(b)(4),
ante, at 10, n. 8, parts of its opinion suggest an answer to
that question that I believe is incorrect. Relying on the
second definition in Black’s Law Dictionary, the majority
defines “discriminates” as “ ‘failure to treat all persons
equally when no reasonable distinction can be found be
tween those favored and those not favored.’ ” Ante, at 8.
This definition of “discriminate,” combined with the major
ity’s insistence that the “distinctions drawn in §11501(b)
are . . . between railroads and other actors, whether inter
state or local,” suggests that the comparison class could be

“another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier” is
any tax that draws a distinction between a rail carrier and
anyone else without sufficient justification. See ante, at
10, n. 8 (“Whether the railroad will prevail . . . depends on
whether the State offers a sufficient justification for de

4 A comparison class of “anyone” is broader than either of the sides in
the lower courts’ split on this issue. Courts usually disagree over
whether to use commercial and industrial taxpayers or railroad com
petitors as the comparison class. Compare Burlington Northern, S. F.
R. Co. v. Lohman, 193 F. 3d 984, 985–986 (CA8 1999) (applying a
comparison class of rail competitors); Burlington Northern R. Co. v.
Commissioner of Revenue, 509 N. W. 2d 551, 553 (Minn. 1993) (same),
with Kansas City Southern R. Co., 817 F. 2d, at 375 (using commercial
and industrial taxpayers as the comparison class); Atchison, T. & S. F.
R. Co. v. Arizona, 78 F. 3d 438, 441 (CA9 1996) (same).
