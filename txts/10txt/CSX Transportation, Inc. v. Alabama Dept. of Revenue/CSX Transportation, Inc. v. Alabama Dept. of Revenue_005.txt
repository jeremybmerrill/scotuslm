CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF 

REVENUE
Opinion of the Court 





here, now codified at 49 U. S. C. §11501,1 bars States and
localities from engaging in four forms of discriminatory
taxation. 90 Stat. 54.
Section 11501(b) describes the prohibited practices. It
begins with three provisions addressed specifically to property taxes; it concludes with a catch-all provision con­
cerning other taxes. According to §11501(b), States (or
their subdivisions) “may not”:
“(1) Assess rail transportation property at a value that
has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail
transportation property than the ratio that the as­
sessed value of other commercial and industrial prop­
erty in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the
true market value of the other commercial and indus­
trial property.
“(2) Levy or collect a tax on an assessment that may
not be made under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
“(3) Levy or collect an ad valorem property tax on rail
transportation property at a tax rate that exceeds the
tax rate applicable to commercial and industrial prop­
erty in the same assessment jurisdiction.
“(4) Impose another tax that discriminates against a
rail carrier.”
The following subsection confers jurisdiction on federal
courts to “prevent a violation” of §11501(b) notwithstand­
ing the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. §1341, which ordi­
narily prohibits federal courts from enjoining the collec­
tion of state taxes when a remedy is available in state
——————
1 This provision was originally codified at 49 U. S. C. §26c (1976 ed.).
In 1978, Congress recodified it at §11503 (1976 ed., Supp. II), with
slightly altered language but “without substantive change,” §3(a), 92
Stat. 1466. In 1995, Congress again recodified the section without
substantive change, this time at 49 U. S. C. §11501. This opinion refers
to the statute’s current text.
