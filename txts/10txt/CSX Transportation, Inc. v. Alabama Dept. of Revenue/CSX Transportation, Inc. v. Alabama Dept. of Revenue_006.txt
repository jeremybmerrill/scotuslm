Opinion of the Court

court. §11501(c).2
B
Petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSX) is an inter­
state rail carrier that operates in Alabama and pays taxes
there. Alabama imposes a sales tax of 4% on the gross
receipts of retail businesses, Ala. Code §40–23–2(1) (2010
Cum. Supp.), and a use tax of 4% on the storage, use, or
consumption of tangible personal property, §40–23–61(a)
(2003). Railroads pay these taxes when they purchase or
consume diesel fuel. But railroads’ main competitors—
interstate motor and water carriers—are generally exempt
from paying sales and use taxes on their fuel (although
fuel for motor carriers is subject to a separate excise tax).3
Alleging that Alabama’s tax scheme discriminates
against railroads in violation of §11501(b)(4) of the 4–R
Act, CSX sued respondents, the Alabama Department of
Revenue and its Commissioner (Alabama or State), in
Federal District Court. In particular, CSX complained

2 The first sentence of subsection (c) provides: “Notwithstanding sec­
tion 1341 of title 28 . . . a district court of the United States has
jurisdiction . . . to prevent a violation of subsection (b) of this section.”
The next sentence concerns the relief available for violations of
§§11501(b)(1) and (2): “Relief may be granted under this subsection
only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of rail transpor­
tation property exceeds by at least 5 percent the ratio of assessed value
to true market value of other commercial and industrial property in the
same assessment jurisdiction.”
3 State law provides that motor carriers need not pay sales or use
taxes on diesel fuel so long as they pay a different excise tax of $0.19
per gallon. Ala. Code §40–17–2(1) (2003) (primary tax of $0.13 per
gallon); §40–17–220(e) (2010 Cum. Supp.) (additional tax of $0.06 per
gallon). State law wholly exempts interstate water carriers from sales
and use taxes on diesel fuel. §40–23–4(a)(10); §40–23–62(12). Nor do
these water carriers pay any other tax on the fuel they purchase or
consume. Brief for Respondents 16.
