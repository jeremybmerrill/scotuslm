THOMAS, J., dissenting

what type of difference is required to violate the statute—
e.g., any distinction, singling out, or something in between.
Therefore, I would use the context to resolve the mean
ing of the word as it is used in subsection (b)(4). See Rob
inson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997) (statutory
interpretation focuses on “the language itself, the specific
context in which that language is used, and the broader
context of the statute as a whole”). We did precisely that
in Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc.,
510 U. S. 332 (1994), where we similarly faced a question
about the meaning of subsection (b)(4). In that case, our
structural analysis of §11501(b) was “central to the inter
pretation of subsection (b)(4).” Id., at 340.

The structure of §11501(b) is straightforward. Subsec
tions (b)(1) through (3) instruct that States may not assess
railroad property at “a higher ratio to the true market
value . . . than . . . other commercial and industrial prop
erty,” 49 U. S. C. §11501(b)(1), collect taxes based on those
inflated assessments, §11501(b)(2), or set property tax
rates for railroad property higher than that “applicable to
commercial and industrial property” in the same assess
ment jurisdiction, §11501(b)(3). Subsection (b)(4) then
forbids “[i]mpos[ing] another tax that discriminates
against a rail carrier.”
I would look to subsections (b)(1) through (3) to deter
mine the meaning of “discriminates” in (b)(4). As many
lower courts have correctly recognized, subsection (b)(4)
is a residual clause, naturally appurtenant to subsections
(b)(1) through (3).1 Moreover, the phrase “another tax that
discriminates” in subsection (b)(4) suggests that the previ
