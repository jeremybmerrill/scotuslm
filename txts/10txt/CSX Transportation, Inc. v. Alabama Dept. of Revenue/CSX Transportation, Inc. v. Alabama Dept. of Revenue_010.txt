Opinion of the Court

the bill, which described subsection (b)(4) as prohibiting
“the imposition of . . . the so-called ‘in lieu tax.’ ” H. R.
Rep. No. 94–725, p. 77 (1975). But the Conference Report
on the final bill abandoned the House Report’s narrowing
language and described the subsection as it was written—
as prohibiting, without limitation, “the imposition of any
other tax which results in the discriminatory treatment of
any” railroad. S. Conf. Rep. No. 94–595, pp. 165–166
(1976); accord, S. Rep. No. 94–499, p. 65 (1975). And the
statutory language is the real crux of the matter: Subsec­
tion (b)(4) speaks both clearly and broadly, and a legisla­
tive report misdescribing the provision cannot succeed in
altering it.7
Nor do we agree with the Eleventh Circuit’s apparent
view that CSX does not challenge “another tax” because its
complaint relies on the exemptions the State has given.
See Norfolk Southern, 550 F. 3d, at 1315 (“The language of
section (b)(4) prohibits a discriminatory ‘tax’ not a dis­
criminatory tax exemption”); Brief for American Trucking
Assns., Inc. as Amicus Curiae 9. What the complaint
protests is Alabama’s imposition of taxes on the fuel CSX
——————
7 Alabama also invokes the remedial provision of subsection (c), n. 2,
supra, to urge that we read §11501 as effectively limited to property or
“in lieu” taxes. According to Alabama, that provision entitles federal
courts to grant relief only when States overvalue railroad property
under subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2): Federal courts, the State avers,
“have no power to enjoin the granting of tax exemptions as a violation
of subsection (b)(4), or, apparently [to remedy] any violation of subsection (b)(4).” Brief for Respondents 37. But that interpretation of
subsection (c)’s remedial provision cannot be right, because it would
nullify subsection (b)(4) (and, for that matter, subsection (b)(3) as well).
We understand subsection (c)’s remedial provision neither as limiting
the broad grant of jurisdiction to federal courts to prevent violations of
subsection (b) nor as otherwise restricting the scope of that subsection.
The remedial provision simply limits the availability of relief when a
State discriminates in assessing the value of railroad property, as
proscribed by subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). That kind of discrimination
is not at issue here.
