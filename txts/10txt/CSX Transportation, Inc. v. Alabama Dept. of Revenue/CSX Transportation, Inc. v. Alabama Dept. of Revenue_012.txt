Opinion of the Court

In line with this understanding, our decisions have
repeatedly recognized that tax schemes with exemptions
may be discriminatory. In Davis v. Michigan Dept. of
Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), for example, we reviewed a
state income tax provision that exempted retirement
benefits given by the State, but not those paid by the
Federal Government. We held that the tax “discrimi­
nate[d]” against federal employees under 4 U. S. C. §111,
which serves to protect those employees from discrimina­
tory state taxation. Similarly, our dormant Commerce
Clause cases have often held that tax exemptions given to
local businesses discriminate against interstate actors.
See, e.g., Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263,
268–269 (1984) (holding that a state excise tax on alcohol
“discriminate[d]” against interstate businesses because of
exemptions granted to local producers); Camps New­
found/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564,
588–589 (1997) (invalidating as “discriminatory” a state
property tax that exempted organizations operating for
the benefit of residents, but not organizations aimed at
nonresidents). And even our decision in ACF Industries,
on which the Eleventh Circuit relied in dismissing CSX’s
suit, made clear that tax exemptions “could be a variant of
tax discrimination.” 510 U. S., at 343.
Nor does the 4–R Act limit the prohibited discrimination
to state tax schemes that unjustifiably exempt local actors,
as opposed to interstate entities. Alabama argues for this
result, claiming that §11501(b) is designed “to protect
interstate carriers against discrimination vis-à-vis local
businesses.” Brief for Respondents 29. But the text of
§11501(b) tells a different story. Consistent with the Act’s
purpose of restoring the financial stability of railroads (not
of interstate carriers generally), supra, at 1, each of sub­
section (b)’s provisions proscribes taxes that specially
burden a rail carrier’s property or otherwise discriminate
against a rail carrier. And not a single provision of the
