CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC., PETITIONER v.

ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE 

ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[February 22, 2011] 


JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act
of 1976 restricts the ability of state and local governments
to levy discriminatory taxes on rail carriers. We consider
here whether a railroad may invoke this statute to chal­
lenge sales and use taxes that apply to rail carriers
(among others), but exempt their competitors in the
transportation industry. We conclude that the railroad
may do so.

Congress enacted the Railroad Revitalization and Regu­
latory Reform Act of 1976 (Act or 4–R Act) to “restore the
financial stability of the railway system of the United
States,” among other purposes. §101(a), 90 Stat. 33. To
help achieve this goal, Congress targeted state and local
taxation schemes that discriminate against rail carriers.
