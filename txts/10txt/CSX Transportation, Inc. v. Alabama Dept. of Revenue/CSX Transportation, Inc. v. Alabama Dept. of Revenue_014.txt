Opinion of the Court

III
As against the plain language of subsection (b)(4), Ala­
bama offers two arguments based on our decision in ACF
Industries. The first claim, which the Eleventh Circuit
accepted, rests on the reasoning we adopted in ACF Indus­
tries: We concluded there that railroads could not chal­
lenge property tax exemptions under subsection (b)(4),
and Alabama asserts that the same analysis applies to excise (and other non-property) tax exemptions. The second
contention focuses on alleged problems that would emerge
in the application of §11501(b) if the rule of ACF Indus­
tries did not govern all tax exemptions. On this view, even
if ACF Industries’ reasoning is irrelevant to cases involv­
ing excise taxes, its holding must extend to those cases to
prevent inconsistent or anomalous results. We reject each
of these arguments. We stand foursquare behind our
decision in ACF Industries, but we will not extend it in the
way the State wishes.
A
In ACF Industries, we considered whether a railroad
could sue a State under subsection (b)(4) for taxing rail­
road property while exempting certain other commercial
property. We held that the railroad could not do so. We
noted that the language of subsection (b)(4), when viewed
in isolation, could be read to allow such a challenge. But
we reasoned that the structure of §11501 required the
opposite result. 510 U. S., at 343. The Eleventh Circuit
——————
(assuming some unspecified number of other taxpayers also pay that
rate) while levying only a 2% property tax on railroad competitors. But
we have never decided, in ACF Industries or any other case, whether
subsections (b)(1)–(3) should be interpreted in this manner. And even
accepting the dissent’s unexplained premise, a serious question would
remain about whether to transplant this construction of subsections
(b)(1)–(3) to subsection (b)(4)’s very different terrain, see infra, at 16–
18.
