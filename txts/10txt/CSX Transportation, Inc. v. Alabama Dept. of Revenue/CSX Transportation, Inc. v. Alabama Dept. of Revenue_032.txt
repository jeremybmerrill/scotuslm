CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF 

REVENUE
THOMAS, J., dissenting


distinguish between railroads and others for tax purposes.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. For instance, in this case, Ala
bama points out that motor carriers and interstate water
carriers pay a separate—and frequently higher—tax on
fuel from which railroads are effectively exempt. Brief for
Respondents 12–16, 59–60. That might be a “sufficient
justification” for their exemptions from the taxes here, but
the majority expressly disclaims reaching that question.
Ante, at 5, n. 5.5 Of course, logically extending the mean
ing of “discriminates” from subsections (b)(1) through (3)
would avoid this problem, as there is no need for “justifica
tion” at all: A tax either targets railroads by comparison to
commercial and industrial taxpayers or it does not.

I disagree with the meaning of “discriminat[e]” in sub
section (b)(4) that the majority seems to imply. The rest of
§11501(b) provides a logical and coherent way to deter
mine what subsection (b)(4) means, and we have used that
methodology before. See ACF Industries, 510 U. S., at
340. The best way to read subsection (b)(4) is as prohibit
ing taxes that target or single out railroads as compared to
general commercial and industrial taxpayers. That is the
test I would establish, and I do not understand the major
ity to foreclose the lower courts from utilizing it. Under
that test, CSX’s challenge to Alabama’s sales and use
taxes was properly dismissed. Accordingly, I respectfully
dissent.

——————
5 The majority appears to consider “sufficient justification” as a poten
tial defense for the State, see ante, at 10, n. 8, but since it derives from
the meaning of “discriminates,” a lack of sufficient justification would
seem to be a part of what a railroad would have to plead in order to
state a claim for a violation of §11501(b)(4).
