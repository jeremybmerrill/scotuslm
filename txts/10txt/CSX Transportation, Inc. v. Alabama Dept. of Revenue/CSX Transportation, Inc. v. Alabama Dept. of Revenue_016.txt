Opinion of the Court

§11501 thus compelled our conclusion that property tax
exemptions—even if “a variant of tax discrimination,” id.,
at 343—fell outside subsection (b)(4)’s reach.
But this structural analysis—the core of ACF Indus­
tries—has no bearing on the question here. Subsections
(b)(1)–(3) specifically address—and allow—property tax
exemptions. But neither those subsections nor any other
provision of the 4–R Act speaks to non-property tax ex­
emptions like those at issue in this case. Congress has
expressed no intent to “allo[w] the States to grant” these
exemptions. Ibid. Reading subsection (b)(4) as written—
to encompass non-property tax exemptions—therefore
poses no danger of “nullify[ing]” a congressional policy
choice or otherwise “subvert[ing] the statutory plan.” Id.,
at 340, 343. To the contrary: Giving subsection (b)(4)
something other than its ordinary meaning, absent any
structural reason to do so, would itself contravene the
expressed will of Congress.
Implicitly acknowledging that ACF Industries’ central
theory is irrelevant here, Alabama focuses on what that
decision called “[o]ther considerations reinforc[ing]” its
structural analysis. Id., at 343. Most notably, Alabama
underscores the following sentence from ACF Industries:
“Given the prevalence of property tax exemptions when
Congress enacted the 4–R Act, [§11501’s] silence on the
subject—in light of the explicit prohibition of tax rate and
assessment ratio discrimination—reflects a determination
to permit the States to leave their exemptions in place.”
Id., at 344. Alabama asserts that this statement “holds
just as true” for sales and use taxes. Brief for Respon­
dents 41.
That claim rings hollow. To be sure, ACF Industries
noted that Congress had declined to speak “with any
degree of particularity to” the permissibility of property
tax exemptions, even though States often granted them.
