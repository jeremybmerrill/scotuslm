CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF 

REVENUE
Opinion of the Court 





nate[d],” they did so in a way that the specific provisions of
§§11501(b)(1)–(3) allow, and accordingly §11501(b)(4)’s
prohibition could not include them. That reasoning, once
more, does not apply here, because subsections (b)(1)–(3)
do not permit—indeed, in no way address—non-property
tax exemptions. We therefore do not adopt a new defini­
tion of “discriminate” in this case; in the context of the 4–R
Act, that word has, and has always had, just one meaning.
What remains is Alabama’s complaint that a ruling in
CSX’s favor, when combined with our decision in ACF
Industries, will result in divergent treatment of property
and non-property taxes. At times, Alabama dresses up
this objection in Latin: It contends that the canon of ejus­
dem generis, which “limits general terms [that] follow
specific ones to matters similar to those specified,” Gooch
v. United States, 297 U. S. 124, 128 (1936), has a role to
play in interpreting §11501(b). More particularly, Ala­
bama contends that this canon supports reading into
§11501(b)(4) every limitation contained in §§11501(b)(1)–
(3), including the exclusion of tax exemptions from the
class of state actions subject to challenge. See Brief for
Respondents 26–27. That interpretive move, Alabama
rightly notes, would ensure equal treatment of property
tax and non-property tax exemptions.
But we think ejusdem generis is not relevant here. As
an initial matter, subsection (b)(4), “[a]lthough something
of a catchall, . . . is not a general or collective term follow­
ing a list of specific items to which a particular statutory
command is applicable (e.g., ‘fishing rods, nets, hooks,
bobbers, sinkers, and other equipment’).” United States v.
Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 615 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part). Rather, that subsection is
“one of . . . several distinct and independent prohibitions.”
Ibid. Related to this structural point is a functional one.
We typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general
word will not render specific words meaningless. E.g.,
