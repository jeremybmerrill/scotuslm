CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF 

REVENUE
Opinion of the Court 


exempting motor and water carriers from those taxes.
App. 22 (Complaint ¶26).
The District Court dismissed CSX’s suit as not cogniza­
ble under the 4–R Act, and the United States Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in a brief per
curiam decision. 350 Fed. Appx. 318 (2009). The Elev­
enth Circuit rested on its earlier decision in Norfolk
Southern R. Co. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 550 F. 3d
1306 (2008), which involved a nearly identical challenge to
the application of Alabama’s sales and use taxes.
In Norfolk Southern, the Eleventh Circuit rejected the
plaintiff railroad’s challenge, principally in reliance on this
Court’s decision in Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF
Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332 (1994). In that case, we
held that a railroad could not invoke §11501(b)(4) to chal­
lenge a generally applicable property tax on the basis that
certain non-railroad property was exempt from the tax.
Id., at 335. The Eleventh Circuit recognized that the case
before it involved sales and use taxes—not property taxes,
which the statutory scheme separately addresses. Norfolk
Southern, 550 F. 3d, at 1314. The court concluded, how­
ever, that this difference was immaterial, and accordingly
held that a railroad could not object to Alabama’s sales
and use taxes simply because the State provides exemp­
tions from them. Id., at 1316.
CSX petitioned for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the
Eleventh Circuit had misunderstood ACF Industries and
noting a split of authority concerning whether railroads
may bring a challenge under §11501(b)(4) to non-property
taxes from which their competitors are exempt.4 We
