BOBBY v. MITTS
Per Curiam

beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating cir
cumstances with which [Mitts] was found guilty of
committing outweigh the mitigating factors, you will
then proceed to determine which of two possible life
imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court.”
App. to Pet. for Cert. 352a–353a.
We considered virtually the same Ohio jury instructions
last Term in Smith v. Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)
(slip op., at 7). See Mitts v. Bagley, 620 F. 3d 650, 652
(CA6 2010) (noting that the “instructions in this case are
the same Ohio instructions that were given in” Spisak).
That case, like this one, involved review of a federal ha
beas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). AEDPA provides, as rele
vant here, that relief may not be granted unless the state
court adjudication “resulted in a decision that was con
trary to . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined
by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U. S. C.
§2254(d)(1).
In Spisak, we reversed a Court of Appeals decision that
had found these instructions invalid under our decision in
Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988). See 558 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 8–9). Up until our decision in Spisak,
Mitts had also pressed the claim that the instructions
were invalid under Mills. After Spisak rejected that
claim, the Court of Appeals in this case determined that
the instructions were contrary to our decision in Beck v.
Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), and accordingly vacated
Mitts’s death sentence. See 620 F. 3d, at 658.
In Beck, we held that the death penalty may not be
imposed “when the jury was not permitted to consider a
verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and
when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.”

explained that such a scheme intolerably enhances the
