BOBBY v. MITTS
Per Curiam

decision in Beck. The concern addressed in Beck was “the
risk of an unwarranted conviction” created when the jury
is forced to choose between finding the defendant guilty of
a capital offense and declaring him innocent of any
wrongdoing. 447 U. S., at 637 (emphasis added); id., at
638; see also Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 455
(1984) (explaining that the “goal of the Beck rule” is “to
eliminate the distortion of the factfinding process that is
created when the jury is forced into an all-or-nothing
choice between capital murder and innocence”); Schad v.
Arizona, 501 U. S. 624, 646 (1991) (“Our fundamental
concern in Beck was that a jury convinced that the defen
dant had committed some violent crime but not convinced
that he was guilty of a capital crime might nonetheless
vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to
set the defendant free with no punishment at all”).
The question here, however, concerns the penalty phase,
not the guilt phase, and we have already concluded that
the logic of Beck is not directly applicable to penalty phase
proceedings. In California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992 (1983),
we rejected an argument that Beck prohibited an instruc
tion to “a capital sentencing jury regarding the Governor’s
power to commute a sentence of life without possibility of
parole.” 463 U. S., at 994, 1006–1009. In so doing, we
noted the “fundamental difference between the nature of
the guilt/innocence determination at issue in Beck and the
nature of the life/death choice at the penalty phase.” Id.,
at 1007. In light of that critical distinction, we observed
that “the concern of Beck regarding the risk of an unwar
ranted conviction is simply not directly translatable to the
deliberative process in which the capital jury engages in
determining the appropriate penalty.” Id., at 1009; see
also Schad, supra, at 647 (stating that the “central con
cern of Beck simply is not implicated” when the “jury was
not faced with an all-or-nothing choice between the offense
of conviction (capital murder) and innocence”).
