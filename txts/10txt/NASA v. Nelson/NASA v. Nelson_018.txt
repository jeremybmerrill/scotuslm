NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

at issue here became mandatory for all candidates for the
federal civil service in 1953. Exec. Order No. 10450, 3
CFR 936. And the particular investigations challenged in
this case arose from a decision to extend that requirement
to federal contract employees requiring long-term access to
federal facilities. See HSPD–12, at 1765, App. 127; FIPS
PUB 201–1, at iii–vi, 1–8, App. 131–150.
As this long history suggests, the Government has an
interest in conducting basic employment background
checks. Reasonable investigations of applicants and em
ployees aid the Government in ensuring the security of its
facilities and in employing a competent, reliable work
force. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599. Courts must keep
those interests in mind when asked to go line-by-line
through the Government’s employment forms and to
scrutinize the choice and wording of the questions they
contain.
Respondents argue that, because they are contract
employees and not civil servants, the Government’s broad
authority in managing its affairs should apply with dimin
ished force. But the Government’s interest as “proprietor”
in managing its operations, Cafeteria & Restaurant Work
ers, supra, at 896, does not turn on such formalities. See
Board of Comm’rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U. S.
668, 678, 679 (1996) (formal distinctions such as whether
a “service provider” has a “contract of employment or a
contract for services” with the government is a “very poor
proxy” for constitutional interests at stake). The fact that
respondents’ direct employment relationship is with Cal
Tech—which operates JPL under a Government con
tract—says very little about the interests at stake in this
case. The record shows that, as a “practical matter,” there
are no “[r]elevant distinctions” between the duties per
—————— 

all of this nailed up on the doors, in the form of rules and regulations.”
