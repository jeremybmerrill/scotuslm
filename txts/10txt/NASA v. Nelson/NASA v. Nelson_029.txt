ROBERT M. NELSON ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 19, 2011] 


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court, of course, that background
checks of employees of government contractors do not
offend the Constitution. But rather than reach this con
clusion on the basis of the never-explained assumption
that the Constitution requires courts to “balance” the
Government’s interests in data collection against its con
tractor employees’ interest in privacy, I reach it on simpler
grounds. Like many other desirable things not included
in the Constitution, “informational privacy” seems like a
good idea—wherefore the People have enacted laws at the
federal level and in the states restricting the government’s
collection and use of information. But it is up to the Peo
ple to enact those laws, to shape them, and, when they
think it appropriate, to repeal them. A federal constitu
tional right to “informational privacy” does not exist.
Before addressing the constitutional issues, however, I
must observe a remarkable and telling fact about this
case, unique in my tenure on this Court: Respondents’
brief, in arguing that the Federal Government violated the
Constitution, does not once identify which provision of
the Constitution that might be. The Table of Authorities
contains citations of cases from federal and state courts,
