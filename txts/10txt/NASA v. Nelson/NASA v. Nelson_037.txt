SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

giving a clue as to the rule of law it is applying.
3. It provides no guidance whatsoever for lower courts.
Consider the sheer multiplicity of unweighted, relevant
factors alluded to in today’s opinion:
•	 It is relevant that the Government is acting “in its
capacity ‘as proprietor’ and manager of its ‘internal op
eration.’ ” Ante, at 12. Of course, given that we are
told neither what the appropriate standard should be
when the Government is acting as regulator nor what
the appropriate standard should be when it is acting as
proprietor, it is not clear what effect this fact has on
the analysis; but at least we know that it is something.
•	 History and tradition have some role to play, ante, at
13–14, but how much is uncertain. The Court points
out that the Federal Government has been conducting
investigations of candidates for employment since the
earliest days; but on the other hand it acknowledges
that extension of those investigations to employees of
contractors is of very recent vintage.
•	 The contract employees are doing important work.
They are not mere janitors and maintenance men; they
are working on a $568 million observatory. Ante, at
15. Can it possibly be that the outcome of today’s case
would be different for background checks of lower-level
employees? In the spirit of minimalism we are never
told.
•	 Questions about drug treatment are (hypothetically)
constitutional because they are “reasonable,” “useful,”
and “humane.” Ante, at 16–17 (internal quotation
marks omitted). And questions to third parties are
constitutional because they are “appropriate” and “per
vasiv[e].” Ante, at 18–19. Any or all of these adjectives
may be the hypothetical standard by which violation of
the hypothetical constitutional right to “informational
privacy” is evaluated.
