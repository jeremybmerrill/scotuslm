NASA v. NELSON
Syllabus
terests at stake, SF–85 and Form 42 are also subject to substantial
protections against disclosure to the public. Whalen and Nixon rec
ognized that a “statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted
disclosures” generally allays privacy concerns created by government
“accumulation” of “personal information” for “public purposes.”
Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents attack only the Government’s
collection of information, and here, as in Whalen and Nixon, the in
formation collected is shielded by statute from unwarranted disclo
sure. The Privacy Act—which allows the Government to maintain
only those records “relevant and necessary to accomplish” a purpose
authorized by law, 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(1); requires written consent be
fore the Government may disclose an individual’s records, §552a(b);
and imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclo
sure obligations, §552a(i)(1)—“evidence[s] a proper concern” for indi
vidual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458–459.
Respondents’ claim that the statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act’s
disclosure bar, see §§552a(b)(1)–(12), leave its protections too porous
to supply a meaningful check against unwarranted disclosures. But
that argument rests on an incorrect reading of Whalen, Nixon, and
the Privacy Act. Pp. 19–23.
