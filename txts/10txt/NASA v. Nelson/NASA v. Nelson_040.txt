ROBERT M. NELSON ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[January 19, 2011] 


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that the Constitution does
not protect a right to informational privacy. Ante, at 1
(opinion concurring in judgment). No provision in the
Constitution mentions such a right. Cf. Lawrence v.
Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 605–606 (2003) (THOMAS, J., dissent
ing) (“I can find neither in the Bill of Rights nor any other
part of the Constitution a general right of privacy . . . ”
(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). And
the notion that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment is a wellspring of unenumerated rights
against the Federal Government “strains credulity for
even the most casual user of words.” McDonald v. Chi
cago, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7).
