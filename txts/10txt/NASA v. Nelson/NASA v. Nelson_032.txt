NASA v. NELSON
SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substan
tive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these
claims.” County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833,
842 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration
in original). Here, the Ninth Circuit rejected respondents’
Fourth Amendment argument, correctly holding that the
Form 42 inquiries to third parties were not Fourth
Amendment “searches” under United States v. Miller, 425
U. S. 435 (1976), and that the Fourth Amendment does
not prohibit the Government from asking questions about
private information. 530 F. 3d 865, 876–877 (2008). That
should have been the end of the matter. Courts should not
use the Due Process Clause as putty to fill up gaps they
deem unsightly in the protections provided by other con
stitutional provisions.
In sum, I would simply hold that there is no constitu
tional right to “informational privacy.” Besides being
consistent with constitutional text and tradition, this view
has the attractive benefit of resolving this case without
resort to the Court’s exegesis on the Government’s legiti
mate interest in identifying contractor drug abusers and
the comfortingly narrow scope of NASA’s “routine use”
regulations. I shall not fill the U. S. Reports with further
explanation of the incoherence of the Court’s “substantive
due process” doctrine in its many manifestations, since the
Court does not play the substantive-due-process card.
Instead, it states that it will “assume, without deciding”
that there exists a right to informational privacy, ante,
at 1.
The Court’s sole justification for its decision to “assume,
without deciding” is that the Court made the same mis
take before—in two 33-year-old cases, Whalen v. Roe, 429
U. S. 589 (1977), and Nixon v. Administrator of General
Services, 433 U. S. 425 (1977).* Ante, at 11. But stare
