NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

2
With these interests in view, we conclude that the chal
lenged portions of both SF–85 and Form 42 consist of
reasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the
Government’s interests in managing its internal opera
tions. See Engquist, 553 U. S., at 598–599; Whalen, 429
U. S., at 597–598. As to SF–85, the only part of the form
challenged here is its request for information about “any
treatment or counseling received” for illegal-drug use
within the previous year. The “treatment or counseling”
question, however, must be considered in context. It is a
followup to SF–85’s inquiry into whether the employee has
“used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs”
during the past year. The Government has good reason to
ask employees about their recent illegal-drug use. Like
any employer, the Government is entitled to have its
projects staffed by reliable, law-abiding persons who will
“ ‘efficiently and effectively’ ” discharge their duties. See
Engquist, supra, at 598–599. Questions about illegal-drug
use are a useful way of figuring out which persons have
these characteristics. See, e.g., Breen & Matusitz, An
Updated Examination of the Effects of Illegal Drug Use in
the Workplace, 19 J. Human Behavior in the Social Envi
ronment, 434 (2009) (illicit drug use negatively correlated
with workplace productivity).
In context, the follow-up question on “treatment or
counseling” for recent illegal-drug use is also a reasonable,
employment-related inquiry. The Government, recogniz
ing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and a medical
issue, seeks to separate out those illegal-drug users who
are taking steps to address and overcome their problems.
The Government thus uses responses to the “treatment or
counseling” question as a mitigating factor in determining
whether to grant contract employees long-term access to
