NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

relied on by respondents create any undue risk of public
dissemination. None of the authorized “routine use[s]” of
respondents’ background-check information allows for
release to the public. 71 Fed. Reg. 45859–45860, 45862
(2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084 (1995), as amended, 75 Fed.
Reg. 28307 (2010).
Rather, the established “routine
use[s]” consist of limited, reasonable steps designed to
complete the background-check process in an efficient and
orderly manner. See Whalen, supra, at 602 (approving
disclosures to authorized New York Department of Health
employees that were not “meaningfully distinguishable”
from routine disclosures “associated with many facets of
health care”). One routine use, for example, involves a
limited disclosure to persons filling out Form 42 so that
designated references can “identify the individual” at issue
and can understand the “nature and purpose of the inves
tigation.” App. 89. Authorized JPL employees also review
each completed SF–85 to verify that all requested infor
mation has been provided. Id., at 211. These designated
JPL employees may not “disclose any information con
tained in the form to anyone else,” ibid., and Cal Tech is
not given access to adverse information uncovered during
the Government’s background check, id., at 207–208. The
“remote possibility” of public disclosure created by these
narrow “routine use[s]” does not undermine the Privacy
Act’s substantial protections. See Whalen, 429 U. S., at
601–602 (“remote possibility” that statutory security
provisions will “provide inadequate protection against
unwarranted disclosures” not a sufficient basis for striking
down statute).
