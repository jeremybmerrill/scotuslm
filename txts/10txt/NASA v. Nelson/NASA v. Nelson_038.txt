NASA v. NELSON
SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment

•	 The Court notes that a “ ‘statutory or regulatory duty
to avoid unwarranted disclosures’ generally allays
these privacy concerns,” ante, at 20 (emphasis added),
but it gives no indication of what the exceptions to this
general rule might be. It then discusses the provisions
of the Privacy Act in detail, placing considerable em
phasis on the limitations imposed by NASA’s routine
use regulations. Ante, at 21–23. From the length of
the discussion, I would bet that the Privacy Act is nec
essary to today’s holding, but how much of it is neces
sary is a mystery.
4. It will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits
claiming violations of the right to informational privacy.
Rare will be the claim that is supported by none of the
factors deemed relevant in today’s opinion. Moreover, the
utter silliness of respondents’ position in this case leaves
plenty of room for the possible success of future claims
that are meritless, but slightly less absurd. Respondents
claim that even though they are Government contractor
employees, and even though they are working with highly
expensive scientific equipment, and even though the Gov
ernment is seeking only information about drug treatment
and information from third parties that is standard in
background checks, and even though the Government is
liable for damages if that information is ever revealed, and
even though NASA’s Privacy Act regulations are very
protective of private information, NASA’s background
checks are unconstitutional. Ridiculous. In carefully
citing all of these factors as the basis for its decision, the
Court makes the distinguishing of this case simple as pie.
In future cases filed under 42 U. S. C. §1983 in those
circuits that recognize (rather than merely hypothesize) a
constitutional right to “informational privacy,” lawyers
will always (and I mean always) find some way around
today’s opinion: perhaps the plaintiff will be a receptionist
