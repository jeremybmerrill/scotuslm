NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968)).8
The Court announced the decision in Nixon in the wan
ing days of October Term 1976. Since then, the Court has
said little else on the subject of an “individual interest in
avoiding disclosure of personal matters.” Whalen, supra,
at 599; Nixon, supra, at 457. A few opinions have men
tioned the concept in passing and in other contexts. See
Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of
Press, 489 U. S. 749, 762–763 (1989); New York v. Ferber,
458 U. S. 747, 759, n. 10 (1982). But no other decision has
squarely addressed a constitutional right to informational
privacy.9
——————
8 The Court continued its discussion of Fourth Amendment principles
throughout the “Privacy” section of the opinion. See 433 U. S., at 459
(citing United States v. Miller, 425 U. S. 435 (1976), United States v.
Dionisio, 410 U. S. 1 (1973), and Katz, 389 U. S. 347)); 433 U. S., at
460–462 (addressing the former President’s claim that the Act was
“tantamount to a general warrant” under Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S.
476 (1965)); 433 U. S., at 463–465, and n. 26 (concluding that the
challenged law was analogous to the wiretapping provisions of Title III
of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, notwith
standing the lack of a “warrant requirement”).
9 State and lower federal courts have offered a number of different
interpretations of Whalen and Nixon over the years. Many courts hold
that disclosure of at least some kinds of personal information should be
subject to a test that balances the government’s interests against the
individual’s interest in avoiding disclosure. E.g., Barry v. New York,
712 F. 2d 1554, 1559 (CA2 1983); Fraternal Order of Police v. Philadel
phia, 812 F. 2d 105, 110 (CA3 1987); Woodland v. Houston, 940 F. 2d
134, 138 (CA5 1991) (per curiam); In re Crawford, 194 F. 3d 954, 959
(CA9 1999); State v. Russo, 259 Conn. 436, 459–464, 790 A. 2d 1132,
1147–1150 (2002). The Sixth Circuit has held that the right to infor
mational privacy protects only intrusions upon interests “that can be
deemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” J. P.
v. DeSanti, 653 F. 2d 1080, 1090 (1981) (internal quotation marks
omitted). The D. C. Circuit has expressed “grave doubts” about the
existence of a constitutional right to informational privacy. American
Federation of Govt. Employees v. HUD, 118 F. 3d 786, 791 (1997).
