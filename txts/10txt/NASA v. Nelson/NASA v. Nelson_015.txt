Opinion of the Court

III
As was our approach in Whalen, we will assume for
present purposes that the Government’s challenged in
quiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional sig
nificance. 429 U. S., at 599, 605.10 We hold, however,
——————
10 The opinions concurring in the judgment disagree with this ap
proach and would instead provide a definitive answer to the question
whether there is a constitutional right to informational privacy. Post,
at 6–7 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 1 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). One of
these opinions expresses concern that our failure to do so will “har[m]
our image, if not our self-respect,” post, at 7 (SCALIA, J.), and will cause
practical problems, post, at 8–9. There are sound reasons for eschewing
the concurring opinions’ recommended course.
“The premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not
sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially
as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties
before them.” Carducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983)
(opinion for the court by Scalia, J.). In this case, petitioners did not ask
us to hold that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy,
and respondents and their amici thus understandably refrained from
addressing that issue in detail. It is undesirable for us to decide a
matter of this importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit
of briefing by the parties and in which potential amici had little notice
that the matter might be decided. See Pet. for Cert. 15 (“no need in
this case” for broad decision on “the scope of a constitutionally-based
right to privacy for certain information”). Particularly in cases like this
one, where we have only the “scarce and open-ended” guideposts of
substantive due process to show us the way, see Collins v. Harker
Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992), the Court has repeatedly recognized
the benefits of proceeding with caution. E.g., Herrera v. Collins, 506
U. S. 390, 417 (1993) (joined by SCALIA, J.) (assuming “for the sake of
argument . . . that in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of
‘actual innocence’ ” made after conviction would render execution
unconstitutional); Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S.
261, 279 (1990) (joined by SCALIA, J.) (“[W]e assume that the United
States Constitution would grant a competent person a constitutionally
protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition”); Regents of
Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 222–223 (1985) (“assum[ing],
without deciding, that federal courts can review an academic decision of
a public educational institution under a substantive due process stan
dard”); Board of Curators of Univ. of Mo. v. Horowitz, 435 U. S. 78, 91–
