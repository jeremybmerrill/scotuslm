Opinion of the Court

protected against “public disclosure” of patients’ informa
tion, id., at 600–601. This sort of “statutory or regulatory
duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures” of “accumulated
private data” was sufficient, in the Court’s view, to protect
a privacy interest that “arguably ha[d] its roots in the
Constitution.” Id., at 605–606. The Court thus concluded
that the statute did not violate “any right or liberty pro
tected by the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id., at 606.
Four months later, the Court referred again to a consti
tutional “interest in avoiding disclosure.” Nixon, 433
U. S., at 457 (internal quotation marks omitted). Former
President Nixon brought a challenge to the Presidential
Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, 88 Stat. 1695,
note following 44 U. S. C. §2111, a statute that required
him to turn over his presidential papers and tape re
cordings for archival review and screening. 433 U. S., at
455–465. In a section of the opinion entitled “Privacy,” the
Court addressed a combination of claims that the review
required by this Act violated the former President’s
“Fourth and Fifth Amendmen[t]” rights. Id., at 455, and
n. 18, 458–459. The Court rejected those challenges after
concluding that the Act at issue, like the statute in
Whalen, contained protections against “undue dissemina
tion of private materials.” 433 U. S., at 458. Indeed, the
Court observed that the former President’s claim was
“weaker” than the one “found wanting . . . in Whalen,” as
the Government was required to return immediately all
“purely private papers and recordings” identified by the
archivists. Id., at 458–459. Citing Fourth Amendment
precedent, the Court also stated that the public interest in
preserving presidential papers outweighed any “legitimate
expectation of privacy” that the former President may
have enjoyed. Id., at 458 (citing Katz v. United States, 389
U. S. 347 (1967); Camara v. Municipal Court of City and
County of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523 (1967); and Terry
