Opinion of the Court

Notwithstanding these safeguards, respondents argue
that statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act’s disclosure
bar, see §§552a(b)(1)–(12), leave its protections too porous
to supply a meaningful check against “unwarranted dis
closures,” Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents point in
particular to what they describe as a “broad” exception
for “routine use[s],” defined as uses that are “compatible
with the purpose for which the record was collected.”
§§552a(b)(3), (a)(7).
Respondents’ reliance on these exceptions rests on an
incorrect reading of both our precedents and the terms of
the Privacy Act. As to our cases, the Court in Whalen and
Nixon referred approvingly to statutory or regulatory
protections against “unwarranted disclosures” and “undue
dissemination” of personal information collected by the
Government. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458.
Neither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is
needed to satisfy privacy interests that may be “root[ed] in
the Constitution.” Whalen, supra, at 605. In Whalen, the
New York statute prohibiting “[p]ublic disclosure of the
identity of patients” was itself subject to several excep
tions. 429 U. S., at 594–595, and n. 12. In Nixon, the
protections against “undue dissemination” mentioned in
the opinion were not even before the Court, but were to be
included in forthcoming regulations “mandate[d]” by the
challenged Act. 433 U. S., at 458; see id., at 437–439
(explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the
Act’s “facial validity” and was not considering the Admin
istrator’s forthcoming regulations). Thus, the mere fact
that the Privacy Act’s nondisclosure requirement is sub
ject to exceptions does not show that the statute provides
insufficient protection against public disclosure.
Nor does the substance of the “routine use” exception
