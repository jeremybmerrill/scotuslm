That analysis applies with even greater force where the
Government acts, not as a regulator, but as the manager

Asking an applicant’s designated references broad, open
ended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool
for separating strong candidates from weak ones. It would
be a truly daunting task to catalog all the reasons why a
