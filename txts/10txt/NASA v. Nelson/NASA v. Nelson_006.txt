A

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) is an independent federal agency charged with
planning and conducting the Government’s “space activi
ties.” Pub. L. 111–314, §3, 124 Stat. 3333, 51 U. S. C.
§20112(a)(1). NASA’s workforce numbers in the tens of
thousands of employees. While many of these workers are
federal civil servants, a substantial majority are employed
directly by Government contractors. Contract employees
play an important role in NASA’s mission, and their du
ties are functionally equivalent to those performed by civil
servants.
One NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
in Pasadena, California, is staffed exclusively by contract
employees. NASA owns JPL, but the California Institute
of Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility under a
Government contract. JPL is the lead NASA center for
deep-space robotics and communications. Most of this
country’s unmanned space missions—from the Explorer 1
satellite in 1958 to the Mars Rovers of today—have been
developed and run by JPL. JPL scientists contribute to
NASA earth-observation and technology-development
projects. Many JPL employees also engage in pure scien
tific research on topics like “the star formation history of
the universe” and “the fundamental properties of quantum
fluids.” App. 64–65, 68.
Twenty-eight JPL employees are respondents here.
Many of them have worked at the lab for decades, and
none has ever been the subject of a Government back
