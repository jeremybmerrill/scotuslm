Opinion of the Court

note that it is possible that their personal information
could be disclosed as a result of a similar breach. But data
breaches are a possibility any time the Government stores
information. As the Court recognized in Whalen, the mere
possibility that security measures will fail provides no
“proper ground” for a broad-based attack on government
information-collection practices. Ibid. Respondents also
cite a portion of SF–85 that warns of possible disclosure
“[t]o the news media or the general public.” App. 89. By
its terms, this exception allows public disclosure only
where release is “in the public interest” and would not
result in “an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
Ibid. Respondents have not cited any example of such a
disclosure, nor have they identified any plausible scenario
in which their information might be unduly disclosed
under this exception.15
In light of the protection provided by the Privacy Act’s
nondisclosure requirement, and because the challenged
portions of the forms consist of reasonable inquiries in an
employment background check, we conclude that the
Government’s inquiries do not violate a constitutional
right to informational privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceed
ings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

further contend that the Privacy Act’s ability to deter
unauthorized release of private information is significantly hampered
by the fact that the statute provides only “an ex post money-damages
action,” not injunctive relief. Brief for Respondents 44 (citing Doe v.
Chao, 540 U. S. 614, 635 (2004) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting)). Nothing in
Whalen or Nixon suggests that any private right of action—for money
damages or injunctive relief—is needed in order to provide sufficient
protection against public disclosure.
