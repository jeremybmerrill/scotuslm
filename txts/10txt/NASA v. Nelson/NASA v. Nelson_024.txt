NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

sions also stated that a “statutory or regulatory duty to
avoid unwarranted disclosures” generally allays these
privacy concerns. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at
458–459. The Court in Whalen, relying on New York’s
“security provisions” prohibiting public disclosure, turned
aside a challenge to the collection of patients’ prescription
information. 429 U. S., at 594, and n. 12, 600–601, 605.
In Nixon, the Court rejected what it regarded as an even
“weaker” claim by the former President because the Presi
dential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act “[n]ot
only . . . mandate[d] regulations” against “undue dissemi
nation,” but also required immediate return of any “purely
private” materials flagged by the Government’s archivists.
433 U. S., at 458–459.
Respondents in this case, like the patients in Whalen
and former President Nixon, attack only the Government’s
collection of information on SF–85 and Form 42. And
here, no less than in Whalen and Nixon, the information
collected is shielded by statute from “unwarranted disclo
sur[e].” See Whalen, supra, at 605. The Privacy Act,
which covers all information collected during the back
ground-check process, allows the Government to maintain
records “about an individual” only to the extent the re
cords are “relevant and necessary to accomplish” a pur
pose authorized by law. 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(1). The Act
requires written consent before the Government may
disclose records pertaining to any individual. §552a(b).
And the Act imposes criminal liability for willful violations
of its nondisclosure obligations. §552a(i)(1). These re
quirements, as we have noted, give “forceful recognition”
to a Government employee’s interest in maintaining the
“confidentiality of sensitive information . . . in his person
nel files.” Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB, 440 U. S. 301, 318,
n. 16 (1979). Like the protections against disclosure in
Whalen and Nixon, they “evidence a proper concern” for
individual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra,
