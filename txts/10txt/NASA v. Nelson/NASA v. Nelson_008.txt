NASA v. NELSON
Opinion of the Court

informed employees that anyone failing to complete the
NACI process by October 2007 would be denied access to
JPL and would face termination by Cal Tech.
B
The NACI process has long been the standard back
ground investigation for prospective civil servants. The
process begins when the applicant or employee fills out a
form questionnaire.
Employees who work in “non
sensitive” positions (as all respondents here do) complete
Standard Form 85 (SF–85). Office of Personnel Manage
ment (OPM), Standard Form 85, Questionnaire for NonSensitive Positions, App. 88–95.2
Most of the questions on SF–85 seek basic biographical
information: name, address, prior residences, education,
employment history, and personal and professional refer
ences. The form also asks about citizenship, selective
service registration, and military service. The last ques
tion asks whether the employee has “used, possessed,
supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs” in the last year.
Id., at 94. If the answer is yes, the employee must provide
details, including information about “any treatment or
counseling received.” Ibid. A “truthful response,” the
form notes, cannot be used as evidence against the em
ployee in a criminal proceeding. Ibid. The employee must
certify that all responses on the form are true and must
sign a release authorizing the Government to obtain per
sonal information from schools, employers, and others
during its investigation.
