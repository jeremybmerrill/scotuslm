Opinion of the Court

ground investigation. At the time when respondents were
hired, background checks were standard only for federal
civil servants. See Exec. Order No. 10450, 3 CFR 936
(1949–1953 Comp.). In some instances, individual con
tracts required background checks for the employees of
federal contractors, but no blanket policy was in place.
The Government has recently taken steps to eliminate
this two-track approach to background investigations.
In 2004, a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission
prompted the President to order new, uniform identifica
tion standards for “[f]ederal employees,” including “con
tractor employees.”

also authorized federal agencies to use another “Office of Personnel
Management . . . or National Security community investigation re
quired for Federal employment.” App. 145. None of these alternative
background checks are at issue here.
