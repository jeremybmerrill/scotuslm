10 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.
WINN
Opinion of the Court

State to incur any financial loss.
Even assuming the STO tax credit has an adverse effect
on Arizona’s annual budget, problems would remain. To
conclude there is a particular injury in fact would require
speculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue
shortfalls by increasing respondents’ tax liability. Daim
lerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344. A finding of causation
would depend on the additional determination that any
tax increase would be traceable to the STO tax credits, as

payers shown that higher taxes will result from the tuition
credit scheme. The rule against taxpayer standing, a rule
designed both to avoid speculation and to insist on par­

to object to expenditures alleged to be unconstitutional,
their suit falls within the exception established by Flast v.
Cohen, 392 U. S. 83. It must be noted at the outset that,
as this Court has explained, Flast’s holding provides a
