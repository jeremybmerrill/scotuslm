ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.
WINN
KAGAN, J., dissenting

very case, ruling that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C.
§1341, posed no barrier to the Plaintiffs’ litigation of their
Establishment Clause claim. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at
112.3 The Court in all five of these cases divided sharply
on the merits of the disputes. But in one respect, the
Justices were unanimous: Not a single one thought to
question the litigants’ standing.
The Solicitor General, participating here as amicus
curiae, conceded at oral argument that under the Federal
Government’s—and now the Court’s—view of taxpayer
standing, each of these five cases should have been dis
missed for lack of jurisdiction.
“[The Court:] So if you are right, . . . the Court was
without authority to decide Walz, Nyquist, Hunt,
Mueller, [and] Hibbs [v. Winn,] this very case, just a
few years ago? . . . .
[Solicitor General:] Right. . . . [M]y answer to you is
yes.
[The Court:] I just want to make sure I heard your
answer to the—you said the answer is yes. In other
words, you agree . . . those cases were wrongly de
cided. . . . [Y]ou would have said there would have
been no standing in those cases.

have also several times summarily affirmed lower court deci
sions adjudicating taxpayer challenges to tax expenditures alleged to
violate the Establishment Clause. See Byrne v. Public Funds for Public
Schools of N. J., 442 U. S. 907 (1979), summarily aff’g 590 F. 2d 514,
516, n. 3 (CA3) (holding that “plaintiffs, as taxpayers, have standing
under Flast” to challenge a tax deduction for dependents attending
religious and other private schools); Grit v. Wolman, 413 U. S. 901
(1973), summarily aff’g Kosydar v. Wolman, 353 F. Supp. 744, 749 (SD
Ohio 1972) (three-judge court) (noting that no party had questioned the
standing of taxpayers to contest tax credits for private-school tuition
payments); Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. United Ams. for Public Schools,
419 U. S. 890 (1974), summarily aff’g No. C–73–0090 (ND Cal., Feb. 1,
1974) (three-judge court) (invalidating a tax credit for children attend
ing private schools).
