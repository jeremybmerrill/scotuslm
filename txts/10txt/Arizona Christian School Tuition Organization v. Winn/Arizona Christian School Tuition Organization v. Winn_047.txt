22 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.
WINN
KAGAN, J., dissenting

A Bill Establishing A Provision for Teachers of the Chris
tian Religion, reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of
Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 74 (1947) (supplemental appendix
to dissent of Rutledge, J.); Letter from James Madison to
Thomas Jefferson (Jan. 9, 1785), reprinted in 2 Writings of
James Madison, at 102, 113; see also Blasi, School Vouch
ers and Religious Liberty: Seven Questions from Madi
son’s Memorial and Remonstrance, 87 Cornell L. Rev. 783,
784 (2002) (the tax provision “permitted each taxpayer
to specify which Christian denomination should re
ceive his payment” and “[t]hose who did not wish to sup
port a church could direct their assessment to a pro
posed common school fund”).
Indeed, the Virginia
Assessment was specifically “designed to avoid any
charges of coercion of dissenters to pay taxes to support
religious teachings with which they disagreed.” Feldman,

U. L. Rev. 346, 383 (2002).12

majority speculates that the Virginia General Assembly would
have given some of the monies collected from conscientious objectors to
schools with a sectarian bent. Ante, at 13. Because the Assessment
never became law, no one can know which county schools would have
received aid; indeed, the first of these schools did not open its doors
until decades later. See W. Miller, First Liberty 26 (2003); see gener
ally J. Buck, Development of Public Schools in Virginia 1607–1952
(1952). But historians and legal scholars have uniformly understood
the opt-out provision as a considered attempt to accommodate taxpay
ers who did not want their tax dollars to go to religion. See Berg &
Laycock, supra, at 244, n. 113 (the “provision for payment to a school
fund was not an effort to support religious schools as part of support for
education overall,” but rather “was an effort to accommodate the
possibility of non-Christian taxpayers”); T. Buckley, Church and State
in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776–1787, p. 133 (1977) (under the “text of
the proposed bill . . . nonbelievers would [not] be forced to contribute to
religion” because “[t]he assessment had been carefully drafted to permit
those who preferred to support education rather than religion to do so”);
see also, e.g., Miller, supra, at 26; Underkuffler-Freund, Separation of
the Religious and the Secular: A Foundational Challenge to First
Amendment Theory, 36 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 837, 889–890, n. 265
