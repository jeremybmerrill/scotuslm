Opinion of the Court

version of §43–1089 in effect during the pendency of this
lawsuit, a charitable organization could be deemed an
STO only upon certain conditions. See §43–1089 (West
2006). The organization was required to be exempt from
federal taxation under §501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986. §43–1089(G)(3) (West Supp. 2005). It could
not limit its scholarships to students attending only one
school. Ibid. And it had to allocate “at least ninety per
cent of its annual revenue for educational scholarships or
tuition grants” to children attending qualified schools.
Ibid. A “qualified school,” in turn, was defined in part as a
private school in Arizona that did not discriminate on the
basis of race, color, handicap, familial status, or national
origin. §43–1089(G)(2).
In an earlier lawsuit filed in state court, Arizona tax­
payers challenged §43–1089, invoking both the United
States Constitution and the Arizona Constitution. The
Arizona Supreme Court rejected the taxpayers’ claims on
the merits. Kotterman v. Killian, 193 Ariz. 273, 972 P. 2d
606 (1999). This Court denied certiorari. Rhodes v.
Killian, 528 U. S. 810 (1999); Kotterman v. Killian, 528
U. S. 921 (1999).
The present action was filed in the United States Dis­
trict Court for the District of Arizona. It named the Direc­
tor of the Arizona Department of Revenue as defendant.
The Arizona taxpayers who brought the suit claimed that
§43–1089 violates the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment, as incorporated against the States by the
Fourteenth Amendment. Respondents alleged that §43–
1089 allows STOs “to use State income-tax revenues to
pay tuition for students at religious schools,” some of
which “discriminate on the basis of religion in selecting
students.” Complaint in No. 00–0287 (D Ariz.), ¶¶29–31,
App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 09–987, pp. 125a–126a. Re­
spondents requested, among other forms of relief, an
injunction against the issuance of §43–1089 tax credits for
