Opinion of the Court

nonbinding sub silentio holdings in the cases respondents
cite would have depended on Flast. See, e.g., Walz, supra,
at 666–667 (explaining that the plaintiff was an “owner of
real estate” in New York City who objected to the city’s
issuance of “property tax exemptions to religious organiza­

or-controversy requirement, a requirement that has not
been satisfied here.

role of a Council of Revision, conferring on itself the power
to invalidate laws at the behest of anyone who disagrees
with them. In an era of frequent litigation, class actions,
sweeping injunctions with prospective effect, and continu­

not less so. Making the Article III standing inquiry all the
more necessary are the significant implications of consti­
tutional litigation, which can result in rules of wide appli­
cability that are beyond Congress’ power to change.
The present suit serves as an illustration of these prin­
ciples. The fact that respondents are state taxpayers does
not give them standing to challenge the subsidies that
