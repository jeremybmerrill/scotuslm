ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.
WINN
Opinion of the Court

lishment Clause cases may be shown in various ways.
Some plaintiffs may demonstrate standing based on the
direct harm of what is claimed to be an establishment of
religion, such as a mandatory prayer in a public school
classroom. See School Dist. of Abington Township v.
Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 224, n. 9 (1963). Other plaintiffs
may demonstrate standing on the ground that they have
incurred a cost or been denied a benefit on account of their
religion. Those costs and benefits can result from alleged
discrimination in the tax code, such as when the availabil­
ity of a tax exemption is conditioned on religious affilia­
tion. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S. 1, 8
(1989) (plurality opinion).
For their part, respondents contend that they have
standing to challenge Arizona’s STO tax credit for one and
only one reason: because they are Arizona taxpayers. But
the mere fact that a plaintiff is a taxpayer is not generally
deemed sufficient to establish standing in federal court.
To overcome that rule, respondents must rely on an excep­
tion created in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968). For the
reasons discussed below, respondents cannot take advan­
tage of Flast’s narrow exception to the general rule against
taxpayer standing. As a consequence, respondents lacked
standing to commence this action, and their suit must be
dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

Respondents challenged §43–1089, a provision of the
Arizona Tax Code. See 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws §43–1087,
codified, as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §43–1089
(West Supp. 2010). Section 43–1089 allows Arizona tax­
payers to obtain dollar-for-dollar tax credits of up to $500
per person and $1,000 per married couple for contribu­
tions to STOs. §43–1089(A). If the credit exceeds an
individual’s tax liability, the credit’s unused portion can be
carried forward up to five years. §43–1089(D). Under a
