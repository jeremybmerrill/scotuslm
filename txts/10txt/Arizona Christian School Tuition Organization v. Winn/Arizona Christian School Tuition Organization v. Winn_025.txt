ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.
WINN
SCALIA, J., concurring

587, 618 (2007) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).
I nevertheless join the Court’s opinion because it finds
respondents lack standing by applying Flast rather than
distinguishing it away on unprincipled grounds. Cf. Hein,
supra, at 628–631.
