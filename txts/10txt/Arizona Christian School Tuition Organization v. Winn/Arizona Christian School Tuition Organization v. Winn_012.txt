ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.
WINN
Opinion of the Court

“ ‘The party who invokes the power [of the federal
courts] must be able to show not only that the statute
is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately
in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result
of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in
some indefinite way in common with people gener­
ally.’ ” Doremus, supra, at 434 (quoting Frothingham,
supra, at 488).
The plaintiff in Doremus lacked any “direct and particular
financial interest” in the suit, and, as a result, a decision

In holdings consistent with Frothingham and Doremus,
more recent decisions have explained that claims of tax­
payer standing rest on unjustifiable economic and political
speculation. When a government expends resources or
declines to impose a tax, its budget does not necessarily
suffer. On the contrary, the purpose of many governmen­
tal expenditures and tax benefits is “to spur economic
activity, which in turn increases government revenues.”
DaimlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344.
Difficulties persist even if one assumes that an expendi­
ture or tax benefit depletes the government’s coffers. To
find injury, a court must speculate “that elected officials
will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff’s tax bill to make up a
deficit.” Ibid. And to find redressability, a court must
assume that, were the remedy the taxpayers seek to be
