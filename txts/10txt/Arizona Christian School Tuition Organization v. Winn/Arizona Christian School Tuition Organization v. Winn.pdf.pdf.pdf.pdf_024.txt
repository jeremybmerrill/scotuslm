v.
KATHLEEN M. WINN ET AL.
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[April 4, 2011]

JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring.
Taxpayers ordinarily do not have standing to challenge
federal or state expenditures that allegedly violate the
Constitution. See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547
U. S. 332, 343–345 (2006). In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83
(1968), we created a narrow exception for taxpayers rais
ing Establishment Clause challenges to government ex
penditures. Today’s majority and dissent struggle with
whether respondents’ challenge to the Arizona tuition tax
credit falls within that narrow exception. Under a princi
pled reading of Article III, their struggles are unnecessary.
Flast is an anomaly in our jurisprudence, irreconcilable
with the Article III restrictions on federal judicial power
that our opinions have established. I would repudiate that
misguided decision and enforce the Constitution. See
Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S.
