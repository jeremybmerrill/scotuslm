ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.
WINN
Opinion of the Court

III
To state a case or controversy under Article III, a plain­
tiff must establish standing. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.
737, 751 (1984). The minimum constitutional require­
ments for standing were explained in Lujan v. Defenders
of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555 (1992).
“First, the plaintiff must have suffered an ‘injury in
fact’—an invasion of a legally protected interest which
is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) ‘actual or
imminent, not “conjectural” or “hypothetical.’ ” Sec­
ond, there must be a causal connection between the
injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has
to be ‘fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of
the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the inde­
pendent action of some third party not before the
court.’ Third, it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely
‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a fa­
vorable decision.’ ” Id., at 560–561 (citations and foot­
note omitted).
In requiring a particular injury, the Court meant “that the
injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individ­
ual way.” Id., at 560, n. 1. The question now before the
Court is whether respondents, the plaintiffs in the trial
court, satisfy the requisite elements of standing.
A
Respondents suggest that their status as Arizona tax­
payers provides them with standing to challenge the STO
tax credit. Absent special circumstances, however, stand­
ing cannot be based on a plaintiff’s mere status as a tax­
payer. This Court has rejected the general proposition
that an individual who has paid taxes has a “continuing,
legally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds
are not used by the Government in a way that violates the
Constitution.” Hein v. Freedom From Religion Founda
