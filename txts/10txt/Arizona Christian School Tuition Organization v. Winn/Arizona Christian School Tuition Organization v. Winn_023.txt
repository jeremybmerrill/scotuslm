Opinion of the Court

§43–1089 allegedly provides to religious STOs. To alter
the rules of standing or weaken their requisite elements
would be inconsistent with the case-or-controversy limita­
tion on federal jurisdiction imposed by Article III.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
It is so ordered.
