Opinion of the Court

equated with the Arizona State Treasury.
The conclusion that the Flast exception is inapplicable
at first may seem in tension with several earlier cases, all
addressing Establishment Clause issues and all decided
after Flast. See Mueller, 463 U. S. 388; Committee for
Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756
(1973); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734 (1973); Walz v. Tax
Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970); cf.
Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (reaching only threshold
jurisdictional issues). But those cases do not mention
standing and so are not contrary to the conclusion reached
here. When a potential jurisdictional defect is neither
noted nor discussed in a federal decision, the decision does
not stand for the proposition that no defect existed. See,
e.g., Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974)
(“[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in
prior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings
the jurisdictional issue before us”); United States v. L. A.
Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952) (“Even as
to our own judicial power of jurisdiction, this Court has
followed the lead of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall who held
that this Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was
passed sub silentio”); Frothingham, supra, at 486. The
Court would risk error if it relied on assumptions that
have gone unstated and unexamined.
Furthermore, if a law or practice, including a tax credit,
disadvantages a particular religious group or a particular
nonreligious group, the disadvantaged party would not
have to rely on Flast to obtain redress for a resulting
injury. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S., at 8
(plurality opinion) (finding standing where a general
interest magazine sought to recover tax payments on the
ground that religious periodicals were exempt from the
tax). Because standing in Establishment Clause cases can
be shown in various ways, it is far from clear that any
