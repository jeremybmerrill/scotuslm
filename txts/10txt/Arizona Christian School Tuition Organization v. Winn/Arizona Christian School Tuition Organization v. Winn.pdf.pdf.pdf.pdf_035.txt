10 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.
WINN
KAGAN, J., dissenting

taxpayer suits, see, e.g., United States v. Richardson, 418
U. S. 166 (1974); Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop
the War, 418 U. S. 208 (1974), and the fourth just after we
held that bar applicable to a different kind of Establish
ment Clause claim, see Valley Forge Christian College v.
Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
Inc., 454 U. S. 464 (1982). Indeed, the decisions on their
face reflect the Court’s recognition of what gave the plain
tiffs standing; in each, we specifically described the plain
tiffs as taxpayers who challenged the use of the tax system
to fund religious activities. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at 94;
Mueller, 463 U. S., at 392; Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 759, 762;
Hunt, 413 U. S., at 735–736; Walz, 397 U. S., at 666–667.
In short, we considered and decided all these cases be
cause we thought taxpayer standing existed.
The majority shrugs off these decisions because they did
not discuss what was taken as obvious. Ante, at 17. But
we have previously stressed that the Court should not
“disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial au
thority assumed to be proper for over 40 years.” Brown
Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see
Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 619 (1988) (finding
standing partly because the Court, in deciding similar
cases, had “not questioned the standing of taxpayer plain
tiffs to raise Establishment Clause challenges”); Bank of
United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (1809) (Mar
shall, C. J.) (prior decisions exercising but not discussing
jurisdiction “have much weight, as they show that [a
jurisdictional flaw] neither occurred to the bar or the
bench”). And that principle has extra force here, because
we have relied on some of these decisions to support the
Court’s jurisdiction in other cases. Pause on that for a
moment: The very decisions the majority today so easily
dismisses are featured in our prior cases as exemplars of
jurisdiction. So in School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball,
473 U. S. 373 (1985), we relied on Nyquist and Hunt to
