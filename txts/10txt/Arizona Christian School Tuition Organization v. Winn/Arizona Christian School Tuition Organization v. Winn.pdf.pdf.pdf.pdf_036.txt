KAGAN, J., dissenting

conclude that taxpayers had standing to challenge a pro
gram of aid to religious and other private schools. 473
U. S., at 380, n. 5, overruled in part on other grounds by
Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997). And in Winn I

and citations omitted). Until today, that is—when the
majority does write off these adjudications and reaches a
result against all precedent.

banks in the midst of a financial crisis. Suppose, too, that
many millions of taxpayers oppose this bailout on the
ground (whether right or wrong is immaterial) that it uses
their hard-earned money to reward irresponsible business
behavior. In the face of this hostility, some Members of
Congress make the following proposal: Rather than give
the money to banks via appropriations, the Government
will allow banks to subtract the exact same amount from
the tax bill they would otherwise have to pay to the U. S.
Treasury. Would this proposal calm the furor? Or would
most taxpayers respond by saying that a subsidy is a
subsidy (or a bailout is a bailout), whether accomplished
by the one means or by the other? Surely the latter; in
