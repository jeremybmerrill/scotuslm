Opinion of the Court

Religion, reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,
330 U. S. 1, 74 (1947) (supplemental appendix to dissent of
Rutledge, J.). Under the proposed assessment bill, tax­
payers would direct their payments to Christian societies
of their choosing. Ibid. If a taxpayer made no such choice,
the General Assembly was to divert his funds to “seminar­
ies of learning,” at least some of which “undoubtedly would
have been religious in character.” Rosenberger v. Rector
and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 869, n. 1 (1995)
(Souter, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also id., at 853, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring). How­
ever the “seminaries” provision might have functioned in
practice, critics took the position that the proposed bill
threatened compulsory religious contributions. See, e.g.,
T. Buckley, Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia,
1776–1787, pp. 133–134 (1977); H. Eckenrode, Separation
of Church and State in Virginia 106–108 (1910).
In the Memorial and Remonstrance, Madison objected to
the proposed assessment on the ground that it would
coerce a form of religious devotion in violation of con­
science. In Madison’s view, government should not “ ‘force
a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for
the support of any one establishment.’ ” Flast, supra, at
103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G.
Hunt ed. 1901)). This Madisonian prohibition does not
depend on the amount of property conscripted for sectar­
ian ends. Any such taking, even one amounting to “three
pence only,” violates conscience. 392 U. S., at 103; cf.
supra, at 6–7. The proposed bill ultimately died in com­
mittee; and the General Assembly instead enacted legisla­
tion forbidding “compelled” support of religion. See A Bill
for Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 2 Papers
of Thomas Jefferson 545–546 (J. Boyd ed. 1950); see also
Flast, 392 U. S., at 104, n. 24. Madison himself went on to
become, as Flast put it, “the leading architect of the relig­
ion clauses of the First Amendment.” Id., at 103. Flast
