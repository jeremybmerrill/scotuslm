24 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.
WINN
KAGAN, J., dissenting

means eliminate) the government’s power to finance reli
gious activity. The Court’s ruling today will not shield all
state subsidies for religion from review; as the Court
notes, some persons alleging Establishment Clause viola
tions have suffered individualized injuries, and therefore
have standing, independent of their taxpayer status. See
ante, at 1–2, 17–18. But Flast arose because “the taxing
and spending power [may] be used to favor one religion
over another or to support religion in general,” 392 U. S.,
at 103, without causing particularized harm to discrete
persons. It arose because state sponsorship of religion
sometimes harms individuals only (but this “only” is no
small matter) in their capacity as contributing members of
our national community. In those cases, the Flast Court
thought, our Constitution’s guarantee of religious neutral
ity still should be enforced.
Because that judgment was right then, and remains
right today, I respectfully dissent.
