Opinion of the Court

Even assuming that a residual clause like the one in
§1003 could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, §3
is not unequivocally a “statute prohibiting discrimination”
within the meaning of §1003.9 The text of §3 does not
prohibit “discrimination”; rather, it prohibits “substantial
burden[s]” on religious exercise. This distinction is espe
cially conspicuous in light of §2 of RLUIPA, in which
Congress expressly prohibited “land use regulation[s] that
discriminat[e] . . . on the basis of religion.” §2000cc(b)(2).
A waiver of sovereign immunity must be “strictly con
strued, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.”
Lane, 518 U. S., at 192. We cannot say that the residual
clause clearly extends to §3; a State might reasonably
conclude that the clause covers only provisions using the
term “discrimination.”
The statutory provisions specifically listed in §1003
confirm that §3 does not unequivocally come within the
scope of the residual clause. “[G]eneral words,” such as
the residual clause here, “are construed to embrace only
objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by
the preceding specific words.” Washington State Dept. of
Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffe­
ler, 537 U. S. 371, 384 (2003) (internal quotation marks
omitted); see also Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S.
303, 307 (1961) (noting that this maxim “is often wisely
applied where a word is capable of many meanings in
order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts
of Congress”). Unlike §3, each of the statutes specifically
enumerated in §1003 explicitly prohibits “discrimination.”

9 Every Court of Appeals to consider the question has so held. See
Holley, 599 F. 3d, at 1113–1114; Van Wyhe, 581 F. 3d, at 654–655;
Madison, 474 F. 3d, at 132–133.
10 Sossamon argues that §3 resembles §504 of the Rehabilitation Act,
one of the statutes listed in §1003, because both require special accom
