Opinion of the Court

recognized. See, e.g., 560 F. 3d, at 330–331.5 Far from
clearly identifying money damages, the word “appropriate”
is inherently context-dependent. See Webster’s Third New
International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining “appropri
ate” as “specially suitable: FIT, PROPER”). The context
here—where the defendant is a sovereign—suggests, if
anything, that monetary damages are not “suitable” or
“proper.” See Federal Maritime Comm’n, 535 U. S., at 765
(“[S]tate sovereign immunity serves the important func
tion of shielding state treasuries . . .”).
Indeed, both the Court and dissent appeared to agree in
West v. Gibson, 527 U. S. 212 (1999), that “appropriate”
relief, by itself, does not unambiguously include damages
against a sovereign. The question was whether the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, which has author
ity to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the
Federal Government “through appropriate remedies,”
could require the Federal Government to pay damages. 42
U. S. C. §2000e–16(b). The dissent argued that the phrase
“appropriate remedies” did not authorize damages “in
express and unequivocal terms.” Gibson, 527 U. S., at 226
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). The Court apparently did not
disagree but reasoned that “appropriate remedies” had a
flexible meaning that had expanded to include money
damages after a related statute was amended to explicitly
allow damages in actions under Title VII. See id., at 217–
218.
Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple
plausible interpretations, including one preserving immu
nity, we will not consider a State to have waived its sover
eign immunity. See Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 232
