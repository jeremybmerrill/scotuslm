SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

As explained above, nothing in our precedent demands
the result the majority reaches today. The conclusion that
RLUIPA fails to provide States with sufficient notice that
they are liable for monetary relief cannot be squared with
the straightforward terms of the statute and the general
principles evident in our prior cases. For these reasons,
and because the majority’s decision significantly under
mines Congress’ ability to provide needed redress for
violations of individuals’ rights under federal law, I re
spectfully dissent.
