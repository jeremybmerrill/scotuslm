terms of [the statute] and the Constitution.” §2000cc–3(g).
I find it improbable that, in light of this express statutory
purpose and the history of “long-running congressional
efforts to accord religious exercise heightened protection
from government-imposed burdens,” Cutter v. Wilkinson,
544 U. S. 709, 714 (2005), state officials would read
RLUIPA’s relief provision in the same limited manner the
majority does.5
As the majority acknowledges, RLUIPA was Congress’
second attempt to guarantee by statute the “broad protec
tion” of religious exercise that we found to be unwarranted
as a constitutional matter in Employment Div., Dept. of
Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990).
As we have previously recognized, in passing RLUIPA
Congress was clearly concerned that state institutions
regularly imposed “frivolous or arbitrary barriers im
ped[ing] institutionalized persons’ religious exercise.”

5 I agree with the majority’s conclusion that, because Section 3 of
RLUIPA, addressing the rights of institutionalized persons, is not a
“provisio[n] of [a] . . . Federal statute prohibiting discrimination” within
the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S. C.
§2000d–7(a)(1), the latter statute’s waiver provision does not put the
States on notice that they can be sued for damages under RLUIPA. See
ante, at 12–14. It bears noting, however, that Section 2 of RLUIPA
explicitly prohibits discrimination in land use regulation.
See
§2000cc(b)(2) (“No government shall impose or implement a land use
regulation that discriminates . . . on the basis of religion or religious
denomination”). As a result, the majority’s decision in this case means
that some RLUIPA plaintiffs will be able to seek monetary damages
against a State and others will not, even though RLUIPA’s provision of
“appropriate relief ” applies equally to suits for violations of the terms
of both Section 2 and Section 3.
