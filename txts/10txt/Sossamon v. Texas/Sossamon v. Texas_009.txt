SOSSAMON v. TEXAS
Opinion of the Court

for example, a State’s consent to suit in its own courts is
not a waiver of its immunity from suit in federal court.
College Savings Bank, supra, at 676. Similarly, a waiver
of sovereign immunity to other types of relief does not
waive immunity to damages: “[T]he waiver of sovereign
immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary
claims.” Lane, supra, at 192; cf. United States v. Nordic
Village, 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (construing an ambiguous
waiver of sovereign immunity to permit equitable but not
monetary claims); Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income
Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96, 101–102 (1989) (construing a
statute to authorize injunctive relief but not “monetary
recovery from the States” because intent to abrogate im
munity to monetary recovery was not “ ‘unmistakably clear
in the language of the statute’ ” (quoting Atascadero, su­
pra, at 242)).

A

RLUIPA’s authorization of “appropriate relief against a
government,” §2000cc–2(a), is not the unequivocal expres
sion of state consent that our precedents require. “Appro
priate relief ” does not so clearly and unambiguously waive
sovereign immunity to private suits for damages that we
can “be certain that the State in fact consents” to such a
suit. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S., at 680.

“Appropriate relief ” is open-ended and ambiguous about
what types of relief it includes, as many lower courts have
——————
from “the Eleventh Amendment context” with the principle applicable
to federal sovereign immunity); College Savings Bank v. Florida Pre­
paid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 682 (1999) (noting
the “clos[e] analogy” between federal and state sovereign immunity);
Belknap v. Schild, 161 U. S. 10, 18 (1896) (“[A] State . . . is as exempt
as the United States [is] from private suit”).
