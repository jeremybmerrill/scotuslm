SOSSAMON v. TEXAS
Opinion of the Court

(“[C]lear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by
broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic
inadvertently or without due deliberation”). Without such
a clear statement from Congress and notice to the States,
federal courts may not step in and abrogate state sover
eign immunity.8

Sossamon also argues that §1003 of the Rehabilitation
Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S. C. §2000d–7, independ
ently put the State on notice that it could be sued for
damages under RLUIPA. That provision expressly waives
state sovereign immunity for violations of “section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975,
title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the provisions of
any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by
recipients of Federal financial assistance.” §2000d–7(a)(1)
(emphasis added). Section 1003 makes “remedies (includ
ing remedies both at law and in equity) . . . available for
such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are
available for such a violation in the suit against any public
or private entity other than a State.” §2000d–7(a)(2).
Sossamon contends that §3 of RLUIPA falls within the
residual clause of §1003 and therefore §1003 waives Texas’
sovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.

8 The

dissent finds our decision “difficult to understand,” post, at 6
(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), but it follows naturally from this Court’s
precedents regarding waiver of sovereign immunity, which the dissent
gives astonishingly short shrift. The dissent instead concerns itself
primarily with “general remedies principles.” Post, at 1. The essence of
sovereign immunity, however, is that remedies against the government
differ from “general remedies principles” applicable to private litigants.
See, e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 196 (1996) (calling it a “crucial
point that, when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign
immunity places the . . . Government on an entirely different footing
than private parties”).
