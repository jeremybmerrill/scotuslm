SOSSAMON v. TEXAS
Opinion of the Court

generally Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União
do Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418, 424 (2006). We held RFRA
unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments
because it exceeded Congress’ power under §5 of the Four
teenth Amendment. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S.
507 (1997).
Congress responded by enacting RLUIPA pursuant to
its Spending Clause and Commerce Clause authority.
RLUIPA borrows important elements from RFRA—which
continues to apply to the Federal Government—but
RLUIPA is less sweeping in scope. See Cutter v. Wilkin­
son, 544 U. S. 709, 715 (2005). It targets two areas of
state and local action: land-use regulation, 42 U. S. C.
§2000cc (RLUIPA §2), and restrictions on the religious
exercise of institutionalized persons, §2000cc–1 (RLUIPA
§3).
Section 3 of RLUIPA provides that “[n]o government
shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exer
cise” of an institutionalized person unless, as in RFRA, the
government demonstrates that the burden “is in further
ance of a compelling governmental interest” and “is the
least restrictive means of furthering” that interest.
§2000cc–1(a); cf. §§2000bb–1(a), (b). As relevant here, §3
applies “in any case” in which “the substantial burden is
imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal
financial assistance.”1 §2000cc–1(b)(1).
RLUIPA also includes an express private cause of action
that is taken from RFRA: “A person may assert a violation
of [RLUIPA] as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding
and obtain appropriate relief against a government.”
§2000cc–2(a); cf. §2000bb–1(c). For purposes of this provi
——————
1 No party contends that the Commerce Clause permitted Congress to
address the alleged burden on religious exercise at issue in this case.
See 42 U. S. C. §2000cc–1(b)(2). Nor is Congress’ authority to enact
RLUIPA under the Spending Clause challenged here. We therefore do
not address those issues.
