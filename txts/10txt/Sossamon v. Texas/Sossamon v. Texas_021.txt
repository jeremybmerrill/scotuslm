SOSSAMON v. TEXAS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

RLUIPA . . . creates a private cause of action against the
State, and Virginia cannot be heard to claim that it was
unaware of this condition” (citations omitted)); Benning v.
Georgia, 391 F. 3d 1299, 1305 (CA11 2004) (“Congress
unambiguously required states to waive their sovereign
immunity from suits filed by prisoners to enforce
RLUIPA”).
B
The Court holds that the phrase “appropriate relief”
does not provide state officials clear notice that monetary
relief will be available against the States, meaning that
they could not have waived their immunity with respect to
that particular type of liability. This holding is contrary
to general remedies principles and our precedents.
RLUIPA straightforwardly provides a private right of
action to “obtain appropriate relief against a government.”
§2000cc–2(a). Under “our traditional approach to deciding
what remedies are available for violation of a federal
right,” damages are the default—and equitable relief the
exception—for “it is axiomatic that a court should deter
mine the adequacy of a remedy in law before resorting to
equitable relief.” Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public
Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 75–76 (1992); see also Weinberger v.
Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982) (“The Court has
repeatedly held that the basis for injunctive relief in the
federal courts has always been . . . the inadequacy of legal
remedies”); Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,
403 U. S. 388, 395 (1971) (“Historically, damages have
been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of
personal interests in liberty”); cf. Monsanto Co. v. Geertson
Seed Farms, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 24) (“An
injunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which
should not be granted as a matter of course”). It is unsur
prising, therefore, that on more than one occasion Con
gress has felt it necessary to clarify in the text of a statute
