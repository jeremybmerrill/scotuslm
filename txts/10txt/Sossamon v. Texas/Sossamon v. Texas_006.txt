Opinion of the Court

sion, “government” includes, inter alia, States, counties,
municipalities, their instrumentalities and officers, and
persons acting under color of state law. §2000cc–5(4)(A).
B
Petitioner Harvey Leroy Sossamon III is an inmate in
the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice, Correctional Institutions Division. In 2006, Sos
samon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials
in their official capacities under RLUIPA’s private cause of
action, seeking injunctive and monetary relief. Sossamon
alleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a
policy preventing inmates from attending religious ser
vices while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions;
and (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for reli
gious worship. The District Court granted summary
judgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant
here, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon’s claims
for monetary relief.2 See 713 F. Supp. 2d 657, 662–663
(WD Tex. 2007).

657, 668 (WD Tex. 2007). The Court of Appeals subsequently held that
Sossamon’s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction
policy was moot because the State had abandoned that policy after
Sossamon filed a prison grievance. 560 F. 3d 316, 326 (CA5 2009). The
Court of Appeals reversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon’s
chapel-use policy claim, id., at 331–335, although the Robertson Unit
later amended that policy also and now permits inmates to attend
scheduled worship services in the chapel subject to certain safety
precautions.
