SOSSAMON v. TEXAS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

may waive their sovereign immunity” is an “unremark
able” one. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44,
65 (1996); see also Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 737
(1999) (“[W]e have not questioned the general proposition
that a State may waive its sovereign immunity and con
sent to suit”); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473
U. S. 234, 238 (1985) (noting the “well-established” prin
ciple that “if a State waives its immunity and consents
to suit in federal court, the Eleventh Amendment does
not bar the action”); Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge
Comm’n, 359 U. S. 275, 276 (1959) (noting that a State
may waive sovereign immunity “at its pleasure”).
Neither the majority nor respondents (hereinafter
Texas) dispute that, pursuant to its power under the
Spending Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1, Congress
may secure a State’s consent to suit as a condition of the
State’s receipt of federal funding.1 See College Savings
Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,
527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999) (“Congress may, in the exercise
of its spending power, condition its grant of funds to the
States upon their taking certain actions that Congress
could not require them to take, and . . . acceptance of the
funds entails an agreement to the actions”); Atascadero,
473 U. S., at 247 (suggesting that a federal statute can
“condition participation in the programs funded under the
[statute] on a State’s consent to waive its constitutional
immunity”). As with all waivers of sovereign immunity,
the question is whether the State has unequivocally con
sented to suit in federal court. See College Savings Bank,
527 U. S., at 680; Atascadero, 473 U. S., at 238, n. 1.

1 Though the Court reserves the general question whether RLUIPA is
a valid exercise of Congress’ power under the Spending Clause, see
ante, at 2, n. 1, there is apparently no disagreement among the Federal
Courts of Appeals, see 560 F. 3d 316, 328, n. 34 (CA5 2009) (“Every
circuit to consider whether RLUIPA is Spending Clause legislation has
concluded that it is constitutional under at least that power”).
