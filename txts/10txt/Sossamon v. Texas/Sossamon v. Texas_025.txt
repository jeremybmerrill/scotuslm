SOSSAMON v. TEXAS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

arguably should be the reverse. See supra, at 4–6.
The majority suggests that equitable relief is the sole
“appropriate relief” for statutory violations “where the
defendant is a sovereign.” Ante, at 6–7. There can be
little doubt, however, that the “appropriateness” of relief
to be afforded a civil plaintiff is generally determined by
the nature of the injury to his legal rights. See Franklin,
503 U. S., at 76 (concluding that monetary damages were
“appropriate” because equitable relief offered no redress
for the injury suffered); see also Milliken v. Bradley, 433
U. S. 267, 280 (1977) (“[T]he nature of the . . . remedy is to
be determined by the nature and scope of the . . . viola
tion”); Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946) (“[W]here
federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been
the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to
adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief”).
In support of its proposition the majority cites only to a
case in which we expressly rejected the argument that
state sovereign immunity operates differently according to
what type of relief is sought. See Federal Maritime, 535
U. S., at 765 (“[S]overeign immunity applies regardless of
whether a private plaintiff’s suit is for monetary damages
or some other type of relief”); cf. id., at 769 (“[T]he primary
function of sovereign immunity is not to protect state
treasuries, but to afford the States the dignity and respect
due sovereign entities” (citation omitted)). Nor is the basis
for the majority’s view apparent from the other cases that
it cites.4

Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187 (1996), United States v. Nordic Vil­
lage, Inc., 503 U. S. 30 (1992), and Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of
Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96 (1989), we simply reaffirmed the
principle that a sovereign’s liability for damages must be unambigu
ously expressed in the statute purporting to waive immunity; as dem
onstrated above, RLUIPA satisfies this requirement. The majority
tellingly relies on the dissent’s assertion in West v. Gibson, 527 U. S.
212 (1999), that the phrase “appropriate remedies” was too ambiguous
