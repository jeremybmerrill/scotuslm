SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

that it meant the terms “relief” and “appropriate relief” to
exclude damages. See 5 U. S. C. §702 (providing that,
under the Administrative Procedure Act, “relief other than
money damages” is available against a federal agency to
remedy a “legal wrong”); see also 42 U. S. C. §6395(e)(1)
(providing a cause of action for “appropriate relief,” but
specifying that “[n]othing in this subsection shall author
ize any person to recover damages”); 15 U. S. C. §797(b)(5)
(similar).
If, despite the clarity of this background principle, state
officials reading RLUIPA were somehow still uncertain as
to whether the phrase “appropriate relief” encompasses
monetary damages, our precedents would relieve any
doubt. In Franklin we made clear that, “absent clear
direction to the contrary by Congress,” federal statutes
providing a private right of action authorize all “appropri
ate relief,” including damages, against violators of its
substantive terms. 503 U. S., at 70–71, 75–76. We reiter
ated this principle in Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181,
185, 187 (2002), affirming that “the scope of ‘appropriate
relief ’ ” includes compensatory damages.2 The holdings in
these cases are fully consistent with the general principle

2 The majority suggests that our use of the phrase “appropriate relief ”
in Franklin and Barnes did not “put the States on notice that the same
phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief,” because
“[t]hose cases did not involve sovereign defendants.” Ante, at 10, n. 6.
The majority misperceives the point. Franklin and Barnes simply
confirmed what otherwise would have been already apparent to any
informed reader of RLUIPA—when it comes to remedying injuries to
legal rights, monetary damages are “appropriate relief.” Moreover, as
noted in the text, see supra, at 4–5, the Administrative Procedure Act
expressly excludes “money damages” from the “relief ” available against
the United States, suggesting that Congress understands the term
normally to encompass monetary relief even when the defendant enjoys
sovereign immunity. See 5 U. S. C. §702; Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487
U. S. 879, 891–892 (1988) (noting that §702 waives the United States’
sovereign immunity to suit).
