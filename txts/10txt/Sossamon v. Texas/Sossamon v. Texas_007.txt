SOSSAMON v. TEXAS
Opinion of the Court

tory phrase “appropriate relief against a government” did
not “unambiguously notif[y]” Texas that its acceptance of
funds was conditioned on a waiver of immunity from
claims for money damages. Id., at 330–331. We granted
certiorari to resolve a division of authority among the
courts of appeals on this question.3 560 U. S. ___ (2010).

“Dual sovereignty is a defining feature of our Nation’s
constitutional blueprint.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v.
South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 751 (2002).
Upon ratification of the Constitution, the States entered
the Union “with their sovereignty intact.” Ibid. (internal
quotation marks omitted).
Immunity from private suits has long been considered
“central to sovereign dignity.” Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S.
706, 715 (1999). As was widely understood at the time the
Constitution was drafted:
“It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be
amenable to the suit of an individual without its con­
sent. This is the general sense, and the general prac
tice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the
attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the
government of every State in the Union.” The Feder
alist No. 81, p. 511 (Wright ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).
Indeed, when this Court threatened state immunity from
private suits early in our Nation’s history, the people
responded swiftly to reiterate that fundamental principle.
