SOSSAMON v. TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 


*
*
* 

We conclude that States, in accepting federal funding,
do not consent to waive their sovereign immunity to pri
vate suits for money damages under RLUIPA because no
statute expressly and unequivocally includes such a
waiver. The judgment of the United States Court of Ap
peals for the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.

modations for particular people or activities. By Sossamon’s reasoning,
every Spending Clause statute that arguably provides a benefit to a
class of people or activities would become a federal statute “prohibiting
discrimination,” thereby waiving sovereign immunity. Such an inter
pretation cannot be squared with the foundational rule that waiver of
sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed and strictly
construed.
