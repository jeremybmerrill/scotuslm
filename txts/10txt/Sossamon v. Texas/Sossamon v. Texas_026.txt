SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

The majority’s additional arguments in support of its
holding also fail to persuade. The majority contends that
the use of a “context-dependent” word like “appropriate”
necessarily renders the provision ambiguous. Ante, at 7.
But the fact that the precise relief afforded by a court may
vary depending on the particular injury to be addressed in
a given case does not render §2000cc–2(a) ambiguous; it
simply means that Congress meant for that provision to be
comprehensive. See Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections
v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (“[T]he fact that
a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anti
cipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It
demonstrates breadth” (internal quotation marks omit
ted)); cf. West v. Gibson, 527 U. S. 212, 217–218 (1999)
(holding that the phrase “appropriate remedies” in 42
U. S. C. §2000e–16(b) includes remedies not expressly
enumerated).
Next, the majority repeats Texas’s dictionary-based
contention that in using the word “relief” Congress meant
to “connot[e] equitable relief.” Ante, at 8. This proposition
suffers from three flaws. First, it is not established by the
dictionary to which the majority cites. See Black’s Law
Dictionary 1293 (7th ed. 1999) (“relief: . . . Also termed
remedy”); id., at 1296 (“remedy: . . . The means of enforc
ing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong; legal or
equitable relief” (emphasis added)). Second, it is inconsis
tent with our precedent. See Barnes, 536 U. S., at 185–
187 (noting that “appropriate relief” includes monetary
and injunctive relief ). Third, it is undermined by the fact
that, on numerous occasions, Congress has deemed it
necessary to specify that “relief” includes injunctive and
other equitable relief. See 16 U. S. C. §973i(e) (authoriz
—————— 

to waive sovereign immunity to monetary relief. See id., at 226 (opin
ion of KENNEDY, J.). Accordingly, the cases the majority cites do not

mandate the conclusion it draws today.
