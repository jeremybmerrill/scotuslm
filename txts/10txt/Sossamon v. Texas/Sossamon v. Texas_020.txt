SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Thus, in order to attach a waiver of sovereign immunity
to federal funds, Congress “must do so unambiguously,” so
as to “enable the States to exercise their choice know
ingly.” Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halder­
man, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). In other words, the State
must have notice of the condition it is accepting. See
Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548
U. S. 291, 298 (2006) (“[C]lear notice . . . is required under
the Spending Clause”). The reason for requiring notice is
simple: “States cannot knowingly accept conditions of
which they are ‘unaware’ or which they are ‘unable to
ascertain.’ ” Id., at 296 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at
17). In assessing whether a federal statute provides clear
notice of the conditions attached, “we must view the [stat
ute] from the perspective of a state official who is engaged
in the process of deciding whether the State should accept
[federal] funds and the obligations that go with those
funds.” Arlington Central, 548 U. S., at 296.
There is also no dispute that RLUIPA clearly conditions
a State’s receipt of federal funding on its consent to suit
for violations of the statute’s substantive provisions. The
statute states that “program[s] or activit[ies] that receiv[e]
Federal financial assistance” may not impose a “substan
tial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in
or confined to an institution.” §2000cc–1. When such a
burden has been imposed, the victim “may assert a viola
tion of [RLUIPA] as a claim . . . in a judicial proceeding
and obtain appropriate relief against a government,”
§2000cc–2(a), which the statute defines, as relevant, as “a
State, county, municipality, or other governmental entity
created under the authority of a State,” §2000cc–5(4)(A)(i).
Accordingly, it is evident that Texas had notice that, in
accepting federal funds, it waived its sovereign immunity
to suit by institutionalized persons upon whom it has
imposed an unlawful substantial burden. See Madison v.
Virginia, 474 F. 3d 118, 130 (CA4 2006) (“On its face,
