SOSSAMON v. TEXAS
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ing the Attorney General to “commence a civil action
for appropriate relief, including permanent or temporary injunction”); see also 2 U. S. C. §437g(a)(6)(A); 8
U. S. C. §1324a(f)(2); 12 U. S. C. §1715z–4a(b); 15 U. S. C.
§6309(a). If the term “relief” already connotes equitable
relief—and only equitable relief—additional explication is
redundant.
Finally, the majority asserts that because the parties to
this case advance opposing “plausible arguments” regard
ing the correct interpretation of RLUIPA’s text, we must
conclude that the statute is ambiguous. Ante, at 8–9. This
view of how we adjudicate cases is incorrect as a descrip

390 (2009) (reviewing the parties’ conflicting textual in
terpretations of a statute but concluding that it was un
ambiguous nonetheless). Moreover, I cannot agree with
the majority that our capacity to interpret authoritatively
the text of a federal statute is held hostage to the litigants’
strategic arguments. If this were true, there would be few
cases in which we would be able to decide that a statute
was unambiguous.
In sum, the majority’s conclusion that States accepting
federal funds have not consented to suit for monetary
relief cannot be reconciled with the fact that the availabil
ity of such relief is evident in light of RLUIPA’s plain
terms and the principles animating our relevant prece
dents. In so holding, the majority discovers ambiguity
where none is to be found.
II
There is another reason to question the soundness of
today’s decision. The Court’s reading of §2000cc–2(a)
severely undermines Congress’ unmistakably stated intent
in passing the statute: to afford “broad protection of reli
gious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the
