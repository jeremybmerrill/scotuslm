HARVEY LEROY SOSSAMON, III, PETITIONER v.

TEXAS ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[April 20, 2011] 


JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether the States, by
accepting federal funds, consent to waive their sovereign
immunity to suits for money damages under the Religious
Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000
(RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U. S. C. §2000cc et seq. We
hold that they do not. Sovereign immunity therefore bars
this suit for damages against the State of Texas.

A

RLUIPA is Congress’ second attempt to accord height
ened statutory protection to religious exercise in the wake
of this Court’s decision in Employment Division, Depart­
ment of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U. S.
872 (1990). Congress first enacted the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42
U. S. C. §2000bb et seq., with which it intended to “restore
the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v.
Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406
U. S. 205 (1972) . . . in all cases where free exercise of
religion is substantially burdened.” §2000bb(b)(1). See
