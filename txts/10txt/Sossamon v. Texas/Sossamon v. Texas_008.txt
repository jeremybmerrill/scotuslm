Opinion of the Court

Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), and the Eleventh
Amendment).
Sovereign immunity principles enforce an important
constitutional limitation on the power of the federal
courts. See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal­
derman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984). For over a century now,
this Court has consistently made clear that “federal juris
diction over suits against unconsenting States ‘was not
contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the
judicial power of the United States.’ ” Seminole Tribe of
Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54 (1996) (quoting Hans,
supra, at 15); see Seminole Tribe, supra, at 54–55, n. 7
(collecting cases). A State, however, may choose to waive
its immunity in federal court at its pleasure. Clark v.
Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 447–448 (1883).
Accordingly, “our test for determining whether a State
has waived its immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is
a stringent one.” College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid
Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675 (1999)
(internal quotation marks omitted). A State’s consent to
suit must be “unequivocally expressed” in the text of the
relevant statute. Pennhurst State School and Hospital,
supra, at 99; see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473
U. S. 234, 238, n. 1, 239–240 (1985). Only by requiring
this “clear declaration” by the State can we be “certain
that the State in fact consents to suit.” College Savings
Bank, 527 U. S., at 680. Waiver may not be implied. Id.,
at 682.
For these reasons, a waiver of sovereign immunity “will
be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the
sovereign.” Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192 (1996).4 So,

4 Although Lane concerned the Federal Government, the strict con
struction principle, which flows logically from the requirement that
consent be “unequivocally expressed,” applies to the sovereign immu
nity of the States as well. Cf. United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503
U. S. 30, 37 (1992) (equating the “unequivocal expression” principle
