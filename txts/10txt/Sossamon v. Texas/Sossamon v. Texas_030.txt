SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

alleged violation took place prior to adjudication on the
merits. See, e.g., Colvin v. Caruso, 605 F. 3d 282, 287, 289
(CA6 2010); Simmons v. Herrera, No. C 09–0318 JSW
(PR), 2010 WL 1233815, *3 (ND Cal., Mar. 26, 2010); see
generally Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as
Amici Curiae 8–11. Absent a damages remedy, longstand
ing RLUIPA challenges may well be dismissed for lack of a
case or controversy conferring Article III jurisdiction on
the federal court. Cf. Moussazadeh v. Texas Dept. of Crim.
Justice, Civ. Action No. G–07–574, 2009 WL 819497, *9
(SD Tex., Mar. 26, 2009) (dismissing as moot plaintiff’s
RLUIPA claim because he had been transferred to a facil
ity that provided kosher food), remanded, 364 Fed. Appx.
110 (CA5 2010); Opening Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant in
Moussazadeh v. Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice, No. 09–
40400 (CA5), p. 11 (noting that transfer to a special facil
ity took place 19 months after the plaintiff filed suit and
just before discovery—which had been stayed 12 months
for negotiation—was scheduled to recommence). Or, as
happened in this case, officials may change the policy
while litigation is pending. The fact of “voluntary cessa
tion” may allow some of these claims to go forward, but
many will nonetheless be dismissed as moot (as happened
in this case).6

6 See Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist.
No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 719 (2007) (“Voluntary cessation does not moot a
case or controversy unless subsequent events make it absolutely clear
that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected
to recur” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). The
Fifth Circuit declined to apply the “voluntary cessation” doctrine in this
case and instead granted Texas’s motion that the court dismiss as moot
petitioner’s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the prison’s cell
restriction policy. Because the prison director averred that the policy
was no longer in force, and “absent evidence that the voluntary ces
sation [wa]s a sham,” the court held that the “good faith nature” of
Texas’s change in policy rendered moot petitioner’s claim for injunctive
relief. See 560 F. 3d, at 324–326; see also Nelson v. Miller, 570 F. 3d
