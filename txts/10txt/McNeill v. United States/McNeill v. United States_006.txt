MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

States v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377 (2008), where we ad
dressed whether the “maximum term of imprisonment” in
cludes recidivism enhancements. In assessing the “max
imum term of imprisonment” for Rodriguez’s state drug
offenses, we consulted the version of state law “that
[he] was convicted of violating,” that is, the 1994 statutes
and penalties that applied to his offenses at the time of his
state convictions. Id., at 380–381.
Use of the present tense in the definition of “serious
drug offense” does not suggest otherwise. McNeill argues
that the present-tense verb in the phrase “is prescribed by
law” requires federal courts to determine the maximum
sentence for a potential predicate offense by looking to the
state law in effect at the time of the federal sentencing, as
if the state offense were committed on the day of federal
sentencing. That argument overlooks the fact that ACCA
is concerned with convictions that have already occurred.
Whether the prior conviction was for an offense “involving
manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to
manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance” can
only be answered by reference to the law under which the
defendant was convicted. Likewise, the maximum sen
tence that “is prescribed by law” for that offense must also
be determined according to the law applicable at that
time.
McNeill’s interpretation contorts the plain meaning of
the statute. Although North Carolina courts actually
sentenced him to 10 years in prison for his drug offenses,
McNeill now contends that the “maximum term of impris
onment” for those offenses is 30 or 38 months. We find it
“hard to accept the proposition that a defendant may
lawfully [have] be[en] sentenced to a term of imprison
ment that exceeds the ‘maximum term of imprisonment
. . . prescribed by law.’ ” Id., at 383.
