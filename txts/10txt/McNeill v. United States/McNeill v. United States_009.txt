Opinion of the Court

criminal statutes in a way that prevents precise transla
tion of the old conviction into the new statutes. Congress
based ACCA’s sentencing enhancement on prior convic
tions and could not have expected courts to treat those
convictions as if they had simply disappeared. To the
contrary, Congress has expressly directed that a prior
violent felony conviction remains a “conviction” unless it
has been “expunged, or set aside or [the] person has been
pardoned or has had civil rights restored.” 18 U. S. C.
§921(a)(20); see also Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485,
491 (1994) (explaining that §921(a)(20) “creates a clear
negative implication that courts may count a conviction
that has not been set aside”).
In addition, McNeill’s interpretation would make
ACCA’s applicability depend on the timing of the federal
sentencing proceeding. McNeill cannot explain why two
defendants who violated §922(g) on the same day and who
had identical criminal histories—down to the dates on
which they committed and were sentenced for their prior
offenses—should receive dramatically different federal
sentences solely because one’s §922(g) sentencing hap
pened to occur after the state legislature amended the
punishment for one of the shared prior offenses. In con
trast, the interpretation we adopt permits a defendant to
know even before he violates §922(g) whether ACCA
would apply.

Applying our holding to this case, we conclude that the
District Court properly applied ACCA’s sentencing en
hancement to McNeill. In light of his two admitted violent
felony convictions, McNeill needed only one conviction for
a “serious drug offense” to trigger ACCA, but we note that
all six of his prior drug convictions qualify.
In November 1992, McNeill pleaded guilty and was
sentenced in a North Carolina court for five offenses:
