MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES
Syllabus
ACCA’s use of the present tense in defining a “serious drug offense”
as, inter alia, “an offense . . . for which a maximum [10-year] term . . .
is prescribed by law” does not suggest otherwise. McNeill’s argument
that this language looks to the state law in effect at the time of the
federal sentencing ignores ACCA’s focus on convictions that have al
ready occurred. Pp. 3–4.
(b) The statute’s broader context, specifically the adjacent defini
tion of “violent felony,” confirms this interpretation. Although Con
gress used the present tense in defining “violent felony,” see
§924(e)(2)(B), this Court has repeatedly turned to the version of state
law that the defendant was actually convicted of violating in deter
mining whether he was convicted of such a felony, see, e.g., Taylor v.
United States, 495 U. S. 575, 602. The Court sees no reason to inter
pret “serious drug offenses” any differently. Cf. Nijhawan v. Holder,
557 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 5–6.
(c) This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd results
that would follow from consulting current state law to define a previ
ous offense. Pp. 6–7.
2. The District Court properly applied ACCA’s sentencing en
hancement to McNeill because all six of his prior drug convictions
were for “serious drug offenses.” Pp. 7–8.

598 F. 3d 161, affirmed.
THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
