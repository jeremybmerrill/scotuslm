MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

selling cocaine on four separate occasions in October 1991
and possessing cocaine with intent to sell on one occasion
in February 1992. At the time of McNeill’s November
1992 conviction and sentencing, North Carolina law dic
tated that the maximum sentence for selling cocaine in
1991 and the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine
with intent to sell in 1992 was 10 years in prison. See
N. C. Gen. Stat. §§14–1.1(a)(8), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1)
(Michie 1991). McNeill’s 1992 convictions were therefore
for “serious drug offenses” within the meaning of ACCA.
McNeill’s sixth drug offense was possessing cocaine with
intent to sell in September 1994. He pleaded guilty and
was sentenced in a North Carolina court in April 1995. By
April 1995, North Carolina had changed the sentence
applicable to that type of drug offense but still provided
that the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with
intent to sell in September 1994 was 10 years in prison.
See 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, §2 (repealing N. C.
Gen Stat. §14–1.1); 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, §56 (as
modified by Extra Session 1994 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 24,
§14(b)) (“This act becomes effective October 1, 1994, and
applies only to offenses occurring on or after that date.
Prosecutions for, or sentences based on, offenses occurring
before the effective date of this act [are controlled by] the
statutes that would be applicable to those prosecutions or
sentences but for the provisions of this act”). Therefore,
McNeill’s 1995 conviction was also for a “serious drug
offense.”

We conclude that a federal sentencing court must de
termine whether “an offense under State law” is a “serious
drug offense” by consulting the “maximum term of impris
onment” applicable to a defendant’s previous drug offense
at the time of the defendant’s state conviction for that
