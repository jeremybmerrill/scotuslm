MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

tions, Congress used the present tense to refer to past
convictions. Cf. Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___, ___
(2009) (slip op., at 8) (“Where, as here, Congress uses
similar statutory language . . . in two adjoining provisions,
it normally intends similar interpretations”).

This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd
results that would follow from consulting current state law
to define a previous offense. See United States v. Wilson,
503 U. S. 329, 334 (1992) (“[A]bsurd results are to be
avoided”).
For example, McNeill concedes that under his approach,
a prior conviction could “disappear” entirely for ACCA
purposes if a State reformulated the offense between the
defendant’s state conviction and federal sentencing. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 12–13. The Sixth Circuit confronted a similar
scenario in Mallett v. United States, 334 F. 3d 491 (2003),
where Ohio had substantially changed how drug quanti
ties were measured since Mallett’s state drug conviction.
Id., at 502 (addressing this issue in the context of the
career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines).
The Sixth Circuit could not “determine how Mallett would
now be sentenced under Ohio’s revised drug laws” because
the offense for which he had been convicted “no longer
exist[ed] and no conversion between the former and
amended statutes [wa]s facially apparent.” Ibid. The
court therefore was compelled to look to state law “as of
the time of the state-court conviction” to determine the
maximum possible sentence for Mallet’s prior offense. Id.,
at 503.
It cannot be correct that subsequent changes in state
law can erase an earlier conviction for ACCA purposes. A
defendant’s history of criminal activity—and the culpabil
ity and dangerousness that such history demonstrates—
does not cease to exist when a State reformulates its
