Opinion of the Court

the District Court because North Carolina’s revised sen
tencing scheme does not apply to crimes committed before
October 1, 1994. 598 F. 3d 161, 165 (2010) (agreeing with
United States v. Hinojosa, 349 F. 3d 200 (CA5 2003), and
disagreeing with United States v. Darden, 539 F. 3d 116
(CA2 2008)). Thus, even if McNeill were convicted today
for his 1991, 1992, and September 1994 drug offenses, he
would still be subject to the old 10-year statutory maxi
mum. 598 F. 3d, at 165 (citing N. C. Gen. Stat. §15A–
1340.10 and State v. Branch, 134 N. C. App. 637, 639–640,
518 S. E. 2d 213, 215 (1999)). We granted certiorari, 562
U. S. ___ (2011), and now affirm, albeit for a different
reason.

As in all statutory construction cases, we begin with
“the language itself [and] the specific context in which that
language is used.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S.
337, 341 (1997). ACCA’s sentencing enhancement applies
to individuals who have “three previous convictions . . . for
a violent felony or a serious drug offense.” §924(e)(1). As
relevant here, the statute defines a “serious drug offense”
as “an offense under State law, involving manufacturing,
distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or
distribute, a controlled substance . . . , for which a maxi
mum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is pre
scribed by law.” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii).
The plain text of ACCA requires a federal sentencing
court to consult the maximum sentence applicable to a
defendant’s previous drug offense at the time of his convic
tion for that offense. The statute requires the court to
determine whether a “previous conviction” was for a seri
ous drug offense. The only way to answer this backward
looking question is to consult the law that applied at the
time of that conviction. We did precisely that in United
