MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

McNeill qualified for ACCA’s sentencing enhancement.
Under ACCA, a person who violates 18 U. S. C. §922(g)
and “has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony
or a serious drug offense” is subject to a 15-year minimum
prison sentence. §924(e)(1). McNeill conceded that two of
his prior convictions—assault with a deadly weapon and
robbery—were for “violent felonies.”
McNeill argued, however, that none of his six state drug
trafficking convictions were for “serious drug offenses” be
cause those crimes no longer carried a “maximum term
of imprisonment of ten years or more.” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii).
When McNeill committed those crimes between 1991 and
1994, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, and
McNeill in fact received 10-year sentences. See N. C. Gen.
Stat. §§14–1.1(a)(8), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Michie 1993)
(sale of cocaine and possession with intent to sell cocaine).
But as of October 1, 1994, North Carolina reduced the
maximum sentence for selling cocaine to 38 months and
the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent
to sell to 30 months. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§15A–
1340.17(c) and (d), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Lexis 2009).
The District Court rejected McNeill’s request that it
look to current state law and instead relied on the 10-year
maximum sentence that applied to McNeill’s drug offenses
at the time he committed them. No. 5:08–CR–2–D–1
(EDNC, Jan. 26, 2009), App. 118. Finding that McNeill
therefore had three prior convictions for violent felonies or
serious drug offenses, the court applied ACCA’s sentencing
enhancement. The court then departed upward from the
advisory Sentencing Guidelines range and sentenced
McNeill to 300 months in prison in light of his “long and
unrelenting history of serious criminal conduct” and “near
certain likelihood of recidivism.” Id., at 119, 121.
The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.
Although the court consulted the maximum sentence
under current state law, it reached the same conclusion as
