Opinion of the Court

mation Act (FOIA). The Government there cautioned
that unless we bound nonparties a “ ‘potentially limitless’ ”
number of plaintiffs, perhaps coordinating with each
other, could “mount a series of repetitive lawsuits” de
manding the selfsame documents. 553 U. S., at 903. But
we rejected this argument, even though the payoff in a
single successful FOIA suit—disclosure of documents to
the public—could “trum[p]” or “subsum[e]” all prior losses,
just as a single successful class certification motion could
do. In re Bridgestone/Firestone, 333 F. 3d, at 766, 767. As
that response suggests, our legal system generally relies
on principles of stare decisis and comity among courts to
mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litiga
tion brought by different plaintiffs. We have not thought
that the right approach (except in the discrete categories
of cases we have recognized) lies in binding nonparties to a
judgment.
And to the extent class actions raise special problems of
relitigation, Congress has provided a remedy that does not
involve departing from the usual rules of preclusion. In
the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U. S. C.
§§1332(d), 1453 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), Congress enabled
defendants to remove to federal court any sizable class
action involving minimal diversity of citizenship. Once
removal takes place, Federal Rule 23 governs certification.
And federal courts may consolidate multiple overlapping
suits against a single defendant in one court (as the Judi
cial Panel on Multi-District Litigation did for the many
actions involving Baycol). See §1407. Finally, we would
expect federal courts to apply principles of comity to each
other’s class certification decisions when addressing a
common dispute. See, e.g., Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v. Bill
Harbert Constr. Co., 529 U. S. 193, 198 (2000) (citing
Landis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254 (1936)).
CAFA may be cold comfort to Bayer with respect to suits
like this one beginning before its enactment. But Con
