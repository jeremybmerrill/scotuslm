The Anti-Injunction Act, first enacted in 1793, provides
that
“A court of the United States may not grant an injunc
tion to stay proceedings in a State court except as
expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where
necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or
effectuate its judgments.” 28 U. S. C. §2283.
The statute, we have recognized, “is a necessary concomi

because a “[state] court might well exercise [its] discretion in a different
manner”).

binding on unnamed [putative] class members” because they are “in
privity to [the parties] in the prior action”) and In re Bridge
stone/Firestone, Inc., Tires Prods. Liability Litigation, 333 F. 3d 763,
768–769 (CA7 2003) (same), with In re Ford Motor Co., 471 F. 3d 1233,
1245 (CA11 2006) (holding that “[t]he denial of class certification”
prevents a court from “binding” anyone other than “the parties appear

Prods. Liability Litigation, 134 F. 3d 133, 141 (CA3 1998) (holding that
putative “class members are not parties” and so cannot be bound by a
court’s ruling when “there is no class pending”).
