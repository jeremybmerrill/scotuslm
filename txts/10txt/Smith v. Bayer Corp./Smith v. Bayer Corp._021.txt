SMITH v. BAYER CORP.
Opinion of the Court

gress’s decision to address the relitigation concerns associ
ated with class actions through the mechanism of removal
provides yet another reason for federal courts to adhere
in this context to longstanding principles of preclusion.12
And once again, that is especially so when the federal
court is deciding whether to go so far as to enjoin a state
proceeding.

The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits the order the District
Court entered here. The Act’s relitigation exception au
thorizes injunctions only when a former federal adjudica
tion clearly precludes a state-court decision. As we said
more than 40 years ago, and have consistently maintained
since that time, “[a]ny doubts . . . should be resolved in
favor of permitting the state courts to proceed.” Atlantic
Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 297. Under this approach, close
cases have easy answers: The federal court should not
issue an injunction, and the state court should decide the
preclusion question. But this case does not even strike us
as close. The issues in the federal and state lawsuits
differed because the relevant legal standards differed.
And the mere proposal of a class in the federal action
could not bind persons who were not parties there. For
these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.

——————
12 By the same token, nothing in our holding today forecloses legisla
tion to modify established principles of preclusion should Congress
decide that CAFA does not sufficiently prevent relitigation of class
certification motions. Nor does this opinion at all address the permis
sibility of a change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to
this question. Cf. n. 7, supra (declining to reach Smith’s due process
claim).
