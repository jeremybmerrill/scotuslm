SMITH v. BAYER CORP.
Opinion of the Court

neers, 398 U. S. 281, 282 (1970). That edict is subject to
only “three specifically defined exceptions.” Id., at 286.
And those exceptions, though designed for important
purposes, “are narrow and are ‘not [to] be enlarged by
loose statutory construction.’ ” Chick Kam Choo, 486 U. S.,
at 146 (quoting Atlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 287;
alteration in original). Indeed, “[a]ny doubts as to the
propriety of a federal injunction against state court pro
ceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the
state courts to proceed.” Id., at 297.
This case involves the last of the Act’s three exceptions,
known as the relitigation exception. That exception is de
signed to implement “well-recognized concepts” of claim
and issue preclusion. Chick Kam Choo, 486 U. S., at 147.
The provision authorizes an injunction to prevent state
litigation of a claim or issue “that previously was pre
sented to and decided by the federal court.” Ibid. But in
applying this exception, we have taken special care to
keep it “strict and narrow.” Id., at 148. After all, a court
does not usually “get to dictate to other courts the preclu
sion consequences of its own judgment.” 18 C. Wright,
A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure
§4405, p. 82 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).
Deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive
effect is usually the bailiwick of the second court (here, the
one in West Virginia). So issuing an injunction under the
relitigation exception is resorting to heavy artillery.5 For
that reason, every benefit of the doubt goes toward the
state court, see Atlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 287, 297;
an injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond
——————
5 That is especially so because an injunction is not the only way to
correct a state trial court’s erroneous refusal to give preclusive effect to
a federal judgment. As we have noted before, “the state appellate
courts and ultimately this Court” can review and reverse such a ruling.
See Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281,
287 (1970).
