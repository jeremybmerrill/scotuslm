Opinion of the Court

peradventure.
The question here is whether the federal court’s rejec
tion of McCollins’ proposed class precluded a later adjudi
cation in state court of Smith’s certification motion. For
the federal court’s determination of the class issue to have
this preclusive effect, at least two conditions must be met.6
First, the issue the federal court decided must be the same
as the one presented in the state tribunal. See 18 Wright
& Miller §4417, at 412. And second, Smith must have
been a party to the federal suit, or else must fall within
one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against
binding nonparties. See 18A id., §4449, at 330. In fact,
as we will explain, the issues before the two courts were
not the same, and Smith was neither a party nor the ex
ceptional kind of nonparty who can be bound. So the
courts below erred in finding the certification issue pre
cluded, and erred all the more in thinking an injunction
appropriate.7

6 We have held that federal common law governs the preclusive effect
of a decision of a federal court sitting in diversity. See Semtek Int’l Inc.
v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 508 (2001). Smith assumes
that federal common law should here incorporate West Virginia’s
preclusion law, see Brief for Petitioners 15–16, whereas Bayer favors
looking only to federal rules of preclusion because of the federal inter
ests at stake in this case, see Brief for Respondent 18. We do not think
the question matters here. Neither party identifies any way in which
federal and state principles of preclusion law differ in any relevant
respect. Nor have we found any such divergence. Compare, e.g.,
Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 153–154 (1979) (describing
elements of issue preclusion), with State v. Miller, 194 W. Va. 3, 9, 459
S. E. 2d 114, 120 (1995) (same). We therefore need not decide whether,
in general, federal common law ought to incorporate state law in
situations such as this.
7 Because we rest our decision on the Anti-Injunction Act and the
principles of issue preclusion that inform it, we do not consider Smith’s
argument, based on Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797
(1985), that the District Court’s action violated the Due Process Clause.
