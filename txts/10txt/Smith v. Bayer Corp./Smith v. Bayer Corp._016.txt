posed but uncertified class—qualifies as a party to the
McCollins litigation. See Brief for Respondent 32–34.
Alternatively, Bayer claims that the District Court’s
judgment binds Smith under the recognized exception to
the rule against nonparty preclusion for members of class
actions. See id., at 34–39. We think neither contention
has merit.
Bayer’s first claim ill-comports with any proper under
standing of what a “party” is. In general, “[a] ‘party’ to
litigation is ‘[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is
brought,’ ” United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New
York, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4), or one who
“become[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third
party practice,” Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77 (1987).
And we have further held that an unnamed member of a
certified class may be “considered a ‘party’ for the [particu
lar] purpos[e] of appealing” an adverse judgment. Devlin
v. Scardelletti, 536 U. S. 1, 7 (2002). But as the dissent in
Devlin noted, no one in that case was “willing to advance
the novel and surely erroneous argument that a non
named class member is a party to the class-action litiga
tion before the class is certified.” Id., at 16, n. 1 (opinion of
SCALIA, J.). Still less does that argument make sense once
certification is denied. The definition of the term “party”
can on no account be stretched so far as to cover a person
like Smith, whom the plaintiff in a lawsuit was denied
leave to represent.10 If the judgment in the McCollins

10 In support of its claim that Smith counts as a party, Bayer cites two
cases in which we held that a putative member of an uncertified class
may wait until after the court rules on the certification motion to file an
individual claim or move to intervene in the suit. See Brief for Respon
dent 32–33 (citing United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U. S. 385
(1977); American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974)). But
these cases, which were specifically grounded in policies of judicial
administration, demonstrate only that a person not a party to a class
suit may receive certain benefits (such as the tolling of a limitations
period) related to that proceeding. See id., at 553; McDonald, 432
