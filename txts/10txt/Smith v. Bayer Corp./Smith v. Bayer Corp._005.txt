SMITH v. BAYER CORP.
Opinion of the Court

the District Court’s judgment.
I
Because the question before us involves the effect of a
former adjudication on this case, we begin our statement
of the facts not with this lawsuit, but with another. In
August 2001, George McCollins sued respondent Bayer
Corporation in the Circuit Court of Cabell County, West
Virginia, asserting various state-law claims arising from
Bayer’s sale of an allegedly hazardous prescription drug
called Baycol (which Bayer withdrew from the market that
same month). McCollins contended that Bayer had vio
lated West Virginia’s consumer-protection statute and the
company’s express and implied warranties by selling him
a defective product. And pursuant to West Virginia Rule
of Civil Procedure 23 (2011), McCollins asked the state
court to certify a class of West Virginia residents who had
also purchased Baycol, so that the case could proceed as a
class action.
Approximately one month later, the suit now before us
began in a different part of West Virginia. Petitioners
Keith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza (Smith for short) filed
state-law claims against Bayer, similar to those raised in
McCollins’ suit, in the Circuit Court of Brooke County,
West Virginia. And like McCollins, Smith asked the court
to certify under West Virginia’s Rule 23 a class of Baycol
purchasers residing in the State. Neither Smith nor
McCollins knew about the other’s suit.
In January 2002, Bayer removed McCollins’ case to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
West Virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See 28
U. S. C. §§1332, 1441. The case was then transferred to
the District of Minnesota pursuant to a preexisting order
of the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, which
had consolidated all federal suits involving Baycol (num
bering in the tens of thousands) before a single District
