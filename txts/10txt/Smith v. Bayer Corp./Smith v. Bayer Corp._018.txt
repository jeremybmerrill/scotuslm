Opinion of the Court

nated, it held that the action did not satisfy Federal Rule
23’s requirements for class proceedings. In these circum
stances, we cannot say that a properly conducted class
action existed at any time in the litigation. Federal Rule
23 determines what is and is not a class action in federal
court, where McCollins brought his suit. So in the absence
of a certification under that Rule, the precondition for
binding Smith was not met. Neither a proposed class
action nor a rejected class action may bind nonparties.
What does have this effect is a class action approved under
Rule 23. But McCollins’ lawsuit was never that.
We made essentially these same points in Taylor v.
Sturgell just a few Terms ago. The question there con
cerned the propriety of binding nonparties under a theory
of “virtual representation” based on “identity of interests
and some kind of relationship between parties and non
parties.” 553 U. S., at 901. We rejected the theory
unanimously, explaining that it “would ‘recogniz[e], in
effect, a common-law kind of class action.’ ” Ibid. Such a
device, we objected, would authorize preclusion “shorn of
[Rule 23’s] procedural protections.” Ibid. Or as otherwise
stated in the opinion: We could not allow “circumvent[ion]”
of Rule 23’s protections through a “virtual representation
doctrine that allowed courts to ‘create de facto class ac
tions at will.’ ” Ibid. We could hardly have been more
clear that a “properly conducted class action,” with bind
ing effect on nonparties, can come about in federal courts
in just one way—through the procedure set out in Rule 23.
Bayer attempts to distinguish Taylor by noting that the
party in the prior litigation there did not propose a class
action. But we do not see why that difference matters.
Yes, McCollins wished to represent a class, and made a
motion to that effect. But it did not come to pass. To
allow McCollins’ suit to bind nonparties would be to adopt
