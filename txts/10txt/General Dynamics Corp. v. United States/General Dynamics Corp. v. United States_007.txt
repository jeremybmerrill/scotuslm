GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

grams, id., at 637.
The CFC took Secretary McPeak’s concerns seriously
and terminated discovery relating to superior knowledge.
It later decided that the extent of the Government’s supe­
rior knowledge was a nonjusticiable question. Both sides
had enough evidence to “present a persuasive case” on
the superior-knowledge issue, but the CFC worried that,
“wit[h] numerous layers of potentially dispositive facts”
hidden by the privilege, its superior-knowledge rulings
“would be a sham,” McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United
States, 37 Fed. Cl. 270, 280, 284–285 (1996), and one that
would threaten national security, see id., at 281–282.
In 1996, for reasons not relevant here, the CFC con­
verted the termination into a less-Government-friendly
termination for convenience and awarded petitioners $1.2
billion. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 35 Fed.
Cl. 358. The Federal Circuit reversed, 182 F. 3d, at 1332,
and left it for the CFC to reconsider on remand whether
the need to protect military secrets precluded discovery
into the superior-knowledge issue, id., at 1329–1330.
After a 6-week trial, the CFC sustained the default
termination, McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States,
50 Fed. Cl. 311, 326 (2001), and reaffirmed that the par­
ties could not safely litigate whether the Government’s
superior knowledge excused petitioners’ default, id., at
325. The Court of Appeals reversed the default termina­
tion, but agreed that the state-secrets privilege prevented
adjudicating whether the Government’s superior knowl­
edge excused the default. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.
United States, 323 F. 3d 1006, 1024 (CA Fed. 2003). It
rejected petitioners’ assertion that the Government could
not pursue a claim against a party and then use the state­
secrets privilege to completely preempt defenses to that
claim; the Court of Appeals believed United States v.
Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 12 (1953), had already “rejected”
this “very argument.” 323 F. 3d, at 1023. Litigants can­
