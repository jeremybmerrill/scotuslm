Opinion of the Court

state-secrets field—are repeat players. Even apart from
the judicial sanctions available to punish bad conduct,
see Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11, 26(g), they have strong incen­
tive to behave rather than risk missing out on the next
multibillion-dollar defense contract. And finally, while we
anticipate that the rule we set forth will ordinarily control
Government-contract disputes that become nonjusticiable
because of state secrets, what we promulgate today is not
a statute but a common-law opinion, which, after the
fashion of the common law, is subject to further refine­
ment where relevant factors significantly different from
those before us here counsel a different outcome.
The foregoing analysis assumes that the Government
generally has an obligation to share its superior knowl­
edge, see GAF Corp., 932 F. 2d, at 949; the parties have
not challenged that assumption. The Government argued
below, however, that it does not have that obligation with
respect to “highly classified information,” and does not
have it when (as was the case here) the agreement specifi­
cally identifies information that must be shared. Brief for
United States 52. The Court of Appeals did not address
those questions (it had no reason to, given its disposition
of petitioners’ appeal), and we did not grant certiorari to
decide them. Those issues (and whether they can safely be
litigated without endangering state secrets) therefore
remain for the Court of Appeals to address on remand.

In Reynolds, we warned that the state-secrets eviden­
tiary privilege “is not to be lightly invoked.” 345 U. S., at
7. Courts should be even more hesitant to declare a Gov­
ernment contract unenforceable because of state secrets.
It is the option of last resort, available in a very narrow
set of circumstances. Our decision today clarifies the
consequences of its use only where it precludes a valid
defense in Government-contracting disputes, and only
