GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

where both sides have enough evidence to survive sumÂ­
mary judgment but too many of the relevant facts remain
obscured by the state-secrets privilege to enable a reliable
judgment.
We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and
remand the cases for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
