Opinion of the Court

not complain, the Court of Appeals held, when the state­
secrets privilege trumps a defense “in [a] purely civil
matter, suing the sovereign on the limited terms to which
it has consented.” Ibid.
On remand, the CFC again found petitioners had de­

documents that would disclose state secrets enjoyed such a
