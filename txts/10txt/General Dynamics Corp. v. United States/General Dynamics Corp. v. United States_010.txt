rules of evidence, but our common-law authority to fashion
contractual remedies in Government-contracting disputes.
See Priebe & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 332 U. S. 407,
411 (1947). And our state-secrets jurisprudence bearing
upon that authority is not Reynolds, but two cases dealing
with alleged contracts to spy.
In Totten v. United States, 92 U. S. 105 (1876), the
administrator of a self-styled Civil War spy’s estate
brought a breach-of-contract suit against the United
States. He alleged that his testator had entered into a
contract with President Lincoln to spy on the Confederacy
in exchange for $200 a month. After the war ended, the
United States reimbursed expenses but did not pay the
monthly salary. We recognized that the estate had a
potentially valid breach-of-contract claim but dismissed
the suit. The contract was for “a secret service,” and
litigating the details of that service would risk exposing
secret operations and other clandestine operatives “to the
serious detriment of the public.” Id., at 106–107. “[P]ublic
policy,” we held, “forbids the maintenance of any suit . . .

matters which the law itself regards as confidential, and
respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be
violated.” Id., at 107.
Six years ago, we reaffirmed that “public policy for­
b[ids]” suits “based on covert espionage agreements.”
Tenet v. Doe, 544 U. S. 1, 3 (2005). Such suits threaten to
undermine ongoing intelligence-gathering and covert
operations—two vital aspects of national security—
through inadvertent exposure of espionage relationships.
Id., at 11. Rather than tempt fate, we leave the parties to
an espionage agreement where we found them the day
they filed suit.
We think a similar situation obtains here, and that the
same consequence should follow. Where liability depends
upon the validity of a plausible superior-knowledge de­
