GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Fisheries Development Assn., Inc. v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv.
Co., 45 P. 3d 657, 669 (Alaska 2002); 9 R. Lord, Williston
on Contracts §21:1, pp. 170–172 (4th ed. 1999 and 2010
Supp.). It assumes a valid, enforceable agreement be­
tween the parties but nevertheless leaves them without a
remedy absent reliable evidence—a writing. See 1 id.,
§1:21, at 82 (4th ed. 2007 and 2010 Supp.); 9 id., §21:5, at
192. So also here, it is preferable to leave the parties
without a remedy rather than risk the “potential injus­
tice,” Valdez Fisheries, supra, at 669, of misjudging the
superior-knowledge issue based on a distorted evidentiary
record.
The Government suggested at oral argument that where
the parties stood at the time of suit was that petitioners
had been held in default, liable for the ensuing conse­
quences. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48–49; see also Brief for
United States 32, n. 9, 34–35. That had been the declara­
tion of the contracting officer, pursuant to Chapter 9
(entitled “Contract Disputes”) of Title 41 (entitled “Public
Contracts”). See 41 U. S. C. §605. It was “final and con­
clusive . . . unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced.”
§605(b). We regard that, however, as merely one step in
the contractual regime to which the parties had agreed. It
has no more bearing upon the question we are discussing
than would a provision in a private contract that declara­
tion of default by one of the parties is final unless con­
tested in court. The “position of the parties” in which we
will leave them is not their position with regard to legal
burdens and the legal consequences of contract-related
determinations, but with regard to possession of funds and
property.

Neither side will be entirely happy with the resolution
we reach today. General Dynamics (but not Boeing) wants
us to convert the termination into one for convenience and
