v.
UNITED STATES
ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
[May 23, 2011]

JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
We consider what remedy is proper when, to protect
state secrets, a court dismisses a Government contractor’s
prima facie valid affirmative defense to the Government’s
allegations of contractual breach.
I
In 1988, the Navy awarded petitioners a $4.8 billion
fixed-price contract to research and develop the A–12
Avenger carrier-based, stealth aircraft. The A–12 proved
unexpectedly difficult to design and manufacture, and by
December 1990, petitioners were almost two years behind
schedule and spending $120 to $150 million each month to
develop the A–12.
