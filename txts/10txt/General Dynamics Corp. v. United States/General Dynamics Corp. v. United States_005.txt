GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Petitioners informed the Government that the cost of
completing the contract would exceed the contract price by
an “ ‘unacceptable’ ” amount. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.
United States, 567 F. 3d 1340, 1343 (CA Fed. 2009); see
McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 182 F. 3d 1319,
1323 (CA Fed. 1999). They proposed restructuring the
contract as a cost-reimbursement agreement and offered
to absorb a $1.5 billion loss. The Department of Defense
had lost faith in the project, however, and Rear Admiral
William Morris, the Navy’s contracting officer for the A–12
agreement, terminated the contract for default on Jan­
uary 7, 1991.
By that point, petitioners had spent $3.88 billion at­
tempting to develop the A–12, and the Government had
provided $2.68 billion in progress payments. A few weeks
after terminating the contract, the Navy sent petitioners a
letter demanding the return of approximately $1.35 billion
in progress payments for work never accepted by the
Government. The parties later entered into a deferred
payment agreement covering this amount.
Petitioners filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims
(CFC) to challenge Admiral Morris’s termination decision
under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2388, as
amended, 41 U. S. C. §609(a)(1). The Federal Circuit has
recognized a governmental obligation not to mislead con­
tractors about, or silently withhold, its “superior knowl­
edge” of difficult-to-discover information “vital” to contrac­
tual performance. GAF Corp. v. United States, 932 F. 2d
947, 949 (1991). Petitioners asserted that the Govern­
ment’s failure to share its “superior knowledge” about how
to design and manufacture stealth aircraft excused their
default (and also asserted other claims not relevant here).
Uncovering the extent of the Government’s prior experi­
ence with stealth technology proved difficult. The design,
materials, and manufacturing process for two prior stealth
aircraft operated by the Air Force—the B–2 and the F–
