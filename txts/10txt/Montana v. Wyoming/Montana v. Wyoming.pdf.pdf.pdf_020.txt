We acknowledge that “beneficial use” refers to a type of
use that involves some depletion, as all irrigation does.
See Report 61. The part of the Compact’s definition of
“beneficial use” that refers to depletion—“that use by
which the water supply . . . is depleted”—is fairly clear. It
begins with “that use,” and the words that follow merely
explain that “that use” must be a use that “deplete[s]” the
“water supply.” Nothing in the language suggests that
“beneficial use” means a measure of the amount of water
depleted. A “beneficial use” within the meaning of the
Compact, therefore, is a type of use that depletes the water
supply.
This plain reading makes sense in light of the circum­
stances existing in the signatory States when the Compact
was drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory
preference for irrigation, a type of depletive use, over
power generation, a nondepletive use. Wyo. Stat. Ann.
§71–402 (1945). It makes sense that the Compact would
have been written to protect the irrigation uses that were
legislatively favored and represented the predominant use
of the Yellowstone River system. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–
47; 65 Stat. 663 (Compact Preamble) (noting that the
Compact recognizes “the great importance of water for
irrigation in the signatory States”).
Montana’s reading of the Compact, by contrast, does not
follow from the text and would drastically redefine the
term “beneficial use” from its longstanding meaning. The
amount of water put to “beneficial use” has never been
defined by net water consumption. The quantity of water
“beneficially used” in irrigation, for example, has always
included some measure of necessary loss such as runoff,
evaporation, deep percolation, leakage, and seepage (re­
