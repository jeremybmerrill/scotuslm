MONTANA v. WYOMING
Opinion of the Court

such increases to the detriment of Montana’s pre-1950
uses.” Report 65.
As is typical west of the 100th meridian, the doctrine of
appropriation has governed water rights in Montana and
Wyoming since the 1800’s. See, e.g., Basey v. Gallagher,
20 Wall. 670, 683 (1875). As relevant here, the doctrine
provides that rights to water for irrigation are perfected
and enforced in order of seniority, starting with the first
person to divert water from a natural stream and apply it
to a beneficial use (or to begin such a project, if diligently
completed). See Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry
Creek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938); Arizona v. Cali
fornia, 298 U. S. 558, 565–566 (1936); Wyo. Const., Art. 8,
§3 (“Priority of appropriation for beneficial uses shall give
the better right”). The scope of the right is limited by the
concept of “beneficial use.” That concept restricts a farmer
“to the amount of water that is necessary to irrigate his
land by making a reasonable use of the water.” 1 C.
Kinney, Law of Irrigation and Water Rights §586, pp.
1007–1008 (2d ed. 1912) (hereinafter Kinney) (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Bailey v. Tintinger, 45
Mont. 154, 176–178, 122 P. 575, 583 (1912); Quinn v. John
Whitaker Ranch Co., 54 Wyo. 367, 376–380, 92 P. 2d 568,
570–571 (1939). Once such a water right is perfected, it is
senior to any later appropriators’ rights and may be ful­
filled entirely before those junior appropriators get any
water at all.
For our purposes, Montana’s pre-1950 water users are
similar to junior appropriators. As between the States,
the Compact assigned the same seniority level to all pre­
1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. See Brief for
Montana 23; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12.
But as Montana concedes, precisely because of this equal
seniority, its downstream pre-1950 users cannot stop
Wyoming’s upstream pre-1950 users from fully exercising
their water rights. Thus, when the rivers are low, Mon­
