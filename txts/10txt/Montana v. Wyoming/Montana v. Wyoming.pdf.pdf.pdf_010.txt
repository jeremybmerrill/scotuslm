Opinion of the Court

tana’s downstream pre-1950 users might get no water at
all because the equally senior users upstream in Wyoming
may lawfully consume all of the water. Tr. of Oral Arg.
51.
Junior appropriators are not completely without rights,
however. As they come online, appropriators acquire
rights to the stream basically as it exists when they find
it. See 2 Kinney §803, at 1403–1404. Accordingly, subject
to the fulfillment of all senior users’ existing rights, under
the no-injury rule junior users can prevent senior users
from enlarging their rights to the junior users’ detriment.

ern States 573 (1971) (hereinafter Hutchins).
Montana’s pre-1950 users can therefore “insist that
[Wyoming’s pre-1950 users] confine themselves strictly
within the rights which the law gives them, that is, to the
amount of water within the extent of their appropriation
which they actually apply to some beneficial use.” 2
Kinney §784, at 1366. That general proposition is undis­
puted; the dispute here is in its application. Is a switch to
more efficient irrigation with less return flow within the
extent of Wyoming’s pre-1950 users’ existing appropriative
rights, or is it an improper enlargement of that right to
the detriment of Montana’s pre-1950 water users?
As the Special Master observed, the law of return flows
is an unclear area of appropriation doctrine. Report 65
(citing Trelease, Reclamation Water Rights, 32 Rocky Mt.
L. Rev. 464, 469 (1960)). The States have not directed us
to any case on all fours with this one. Indeed, “[n]o west­
ern state court appears to have conclusively answered the
question.” Report 65.
Despite the lack of clarity, the Special Master found
several reasons to conclude that Wyoming’s pre-1950 users
may switch to sprinkler irrigation. He found that the
scope of the original appropriative right includes such a
change so long as no additional water is diverted from the
