Opinion of the Court

defined water rights in terms of depletion. The Colorado
River Compact of 1922 apportioned 7,500,000 acre-feet of
water per year for “the exclusive beneficial consumptive
use” of several upstream States, including Wyoming. That
compact specifically added that “[t]he States of the Upper
Division will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to
be depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre feet for
any period of ten consecutive years . . . .”
National
Resources Planning Bd., Water Resources Comm., Inter­
state Water Compacts, 1785–1941, p. 8 (1942). See also
Republican River Compact (1943), Kan. Stat. Ann.
§82a–518 (1997) (allocating water by the acre-foot for
beneficial consumptive use in Kansas, Nebraska, and
Colorado). And, even here in the Yellowstone River Com­
pact, Article V(B) unambiguously apportions the third tier
of Yellowstone River system water by percentage. 65 Stat.
666. The notion that Article V(A) accomplishes essentially the same sort of depletive allocation with language
that has a different and longstanding meaning is simply
unpersuasive.

We conclude that the plain terms of the Compact protect
ordinary “[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of
[water] . . . existing in each signatory State as of January
1, 1950.” Art. V(A), ibid. And the best evidence we have
shows that the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and
Montana allows appropriators to improve the efficiency of
their irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down­
stream appropriators. Montana’s allegation that Wyo­
ming has breached Article V(A) of the Compact by allow­
ing its pre-1950 water users to increase their irrigation
efficiency thus fails to state a claim. Accordingly, Mon­
tana’s first exception to the Special Master’s First Interim
Report is overruled.
It is so ordered.
