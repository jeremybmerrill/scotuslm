MONTANA v. WYOMING
Opinion of the Court

gardless of whether any of it returns to the stream). So,
water put to “[b]eneficial use is not what is actually con­
sumed, but what is actually necessary in good faith.” 1
Wiel §481, at 509; see also Trelease, The Concept of Rea­
sonable Beneficial Use in the Law of Surface Streams, 12
Wyo. L. J. 1, 10 (1957) (listing irrigation as a beneficial
use and noting that “the method of application, by flood­
ing, channeling, or sprinkling, is immaterial”); J. Sax, B.
Thompson, J. Leshy, & R. Adams, Legal Control of Water
Resources 131 (4th ed. 2006) (discussing normal irrigation
practices and observing that the amount of water put to
beneficial use “is often considerably more than the quan­

If the Compact’s definition of “beneficial use” were
meant to drastically redefine the term into shorthand for
net water consumption, we would expect far more clarity.
For example, the Compact could have stated that it would
protect “only ‘the amount of water consumed for a benefi­
cial use in each signatory state as of January 1, 1950.’ ”
Report 60. Or it could have defined “beneficial use” as the
“volume by which the water supply . . . is depleted.” More­
over, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of
ordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A),
which expressly states that “the laws governing the acqui­
sition and use of water under the doctrine of appropria­
tion” control, would make little sense.
We agree with the Special Master that the definition of
beneficial use in the Compact is unremarkable. Arti­
cle V(A) does not change the scope of the pre-1950 appro­
priative rights that it protects in both States.

Finally, if Article V(A) were intended to guarantee
Montana a set quantity of water, it could have done so as
plainly as other compacts that do just that. By 1950,
Wyoming itself had entered into at least one compact that
