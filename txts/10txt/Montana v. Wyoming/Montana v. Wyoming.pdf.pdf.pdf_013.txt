MONTANA v. WYOMING
Opinion of the Court

adjustments or repairs. This is also consistent with the
fact that by 1950 both States had statutes regulating
certain changes to water rights, but neither required
farmers to take official action before adjusting irrigation
methods.6 See Report 69–70, 87; id., at 69 (they “do not
generally have procedures for overseeing changes in water
efficiencies stemming from crop shifts or irrigation im­
provements where there are no formal changes in the
underlying water rights”). Like the Special Master, we
find this to be persuasive evidence that the States consid­
ered such changes permissible.
Montana argues that, regardless of the statutes, private
lawsuits could be brought to challenge such efficiency
changes. But it has not provided a single example from
either State. Instead, Montana and Wyoming cases typi­
cally describe the no-injury rule as applying to changes in
point of diversion, purpose of use, and place of use. See,
e.g., Maclay v. Missoula Irrig. Dist., 90 Mont. 344, 355–
357, 3 P. 2d 286, 291 (1931); Thayer v. Rawlins, 594 P. 2d
951, 955 (Wyo. 1979). The abundance of litigation over
such changes—and the absence of any litigation over the
sort of change at issue here—strongly implies that irriga­
tion efficiency improvements do not violate the no-injury
rule and were considered within the scope of the original
appropriative right.

The doctrine of recapture also supports treating im­
provements in irrigation efficiency as within the original
appropriative right. Under this doctrine, an appropriator
who has diverted water for irrigation purposes has the
right to recapture and reuse his own runoff and seepage
