MONTANA v. WYOMING
Opinion of the Court

the Wyoming Supreme Court . . . was expansive” in
Binning, Bower, and Fuss, and “all appear to hold that an
appropriator in Wyoming can increase his water use effi­
ciency by recovering runoff on his property or through
other means so long as the increased consumption is on
the same land to which the appropriative right attaches.”
Report 81; see also id., at 78–85; Thompson, Case Note,
Water Law—Reusing Irrigation Waste Water on Different
Lands: A Warning to Get a New Permit, Fuss v. Franks,
610 P. 2d 17 (Wyo. 1980), 16 Land & Water L. Rev. 71, 76
(1981) (concluding that in Wyoming, “a prior appropriator
can at anytime, utilize irrigation methods that are totally
consumptive, such as pumping the collected waste water
back to the top of the field or installing a sprinkler system,
thereby eliminating all waste of water”); Jones, Note,
Rights of the Original Appropriator to Recapture Water
Used in Irrigation, 11 Wyo. L. J. 39 (1956); Wille, Note,
The Right to Use Waste Water Before It Re-enters the
Stream, 12 Wyo. L. J. 47, 48 (1957).
The Wyoming and Montana doctrine of recapture
strongly suggests that improvements in irrigation effi­
ciency are within the original appropriative right of Wyo­
ming’s pre-1950 water users. By using sprinklers rather
than flood irrigation, those water users effectively recap­
ture water. The sprinklers, by reducing loss due to seep­
age and runoff, operate much like, if more efficiently than,
cruder recapture systems involving ditches or pits. They
are simply different mechanisms for increasing the volume
of water available to the crops without changing the
amount of diversion. Binning, Bower, and Fuss expressly
acknowledged that in such situations, lower appropriators
who have perfected their own appropriative rights are
nonetheless at the mercy of the property owners from
which their water flows. See 55 Wyo., at 474–477, 102
P. 2d, at 63; 77 Wyo., at 100–104, 307 P. 2d, at 601–602;
610 P. 2d, at 20.
