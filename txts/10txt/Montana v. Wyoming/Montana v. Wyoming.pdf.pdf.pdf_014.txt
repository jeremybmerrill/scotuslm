Opinion of the Court

water before it escapes his control or his property.7 An
appropriator is entitled to the “exclusive control [of his
appropriated water] so long as he is able and willing to
apply it to beneficial uses, and such right extends to what
is commonly known as wastage from surface run-off and
deep percolation, necessarily incident to practical irriga­
tion.” Ide v. United States, 263 U. S. 497, 506 (1924)
(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Arizona Pub.
Serv. Co. v. Long, 160 Ariz. 429, 437–438, 773 P. 2d 988,
996–997 (1989) (“No appropriator can compel any other
appropriator to continue the waste of water which benefits
the former. If the senior appropriator, through scientific
and technical advances, can utilize his water so that none
is wasted, no other appropriator can complain”).
Montana contends that this rule does not apply when
the runoff or seepage water would, if not recaptured,
return to the same stream from which it was originally
drawn. There is some support for Montana’s position—
that a beneficial user may not reuse water at all, even
while it is still on his property, if it otherwise would flow
back to the same stream—especially in Utah and Colorado
cases. See Deseret Irrig. Co., supra, at 180–182, 271 P. 2d,
at 456–457; Estate of Steed v. New Escalante Irrig. Co.,
846 P. 2d 1223, 1226 (Utah 1992); Comstock v. Ramsay, 55
Colo. 244, 252–258, 133 P. 1107, 1110–1111 (1913).8 But
other authorities draw no such exception based on where
the runoff or seepage is heading. See 2 Hutchins 580–582

7 And in some narrowly defined circumstances, he retains this right
even after the water leaves his property. See 1 Wiel §§38–40, at 37–43.
8 Colorado has a relatively unique doctrine of recapture. See Hoese,
Comment, Recapture of Reclamation Project Ground Water, 53 Cal.
L. Rev. 541, 544, n. 18 (1965) (noting the general doctrine of recapture,
and adding that “[t]he Colorado rule, however, is to the contrary”);
United States v. Tilley, 124 F. 2d 850, 858 (CA8 1941) (allowing recap­
ture by the original appropriator under Nebraska law, and noting
Colorado’s opposite rule).
