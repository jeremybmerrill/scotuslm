Opinion of the Court

495, 505, 103 P. 2d 1067, 1072 (1940) (“[P]lace of diver­
sion, or place or purpose of use, may be changed only if
others are not thereby injured” (internal quotation marks
omitted)); see also 1 S. Wiel, Water Rights in the Western
States §498, p. 532 (3d ed. 1911) (hereinafter Wiel); Mont.
Code Ann. §89–803 (1947); Wyo. Stat. Ann. §41–3–104
(1977). Accordingly, certain types of changes can occur
even though they may harm downstream appropriators.
See D. Getches, Water Law in a Nutshell 175 (4th ed.
2009) (hereinafter Getches). For instance, an appropriator
may increase his consumption by changing to a more
water-intensive crop so long as he makes no change in
acreage irrigated or amount of water diverted. See id., at
183; East Bench Irrig. Co. v. Deseret Irrig. Co., 2 Utah 2d
170, 179, 271 P. 2d 449, 455 (1954) (assuming that farm­
ers may “legally increase the quantity of water consumed
in irrigating their lands by changing to more water con­
suming crops” and adding that “it would be difficult to
prevent . . . such increased consumptive use”). Ordinary,
day-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not
violate the no-injury rule. See, e.g., 1 Wiel §56, at 51
(“Would the fact that my pump has for years dripped
water onto a neighbor’s ground give him a right to say
that my pump must go on leaking?”). Consumption can
even be increased by adding farm acreage, so long as that
was part of the plan from the start, and diligently pursued
through the years. See Van Tassel Real Estate & Live
Stock Co. v. Cheyenne, 49 Wyo. 333, 357–359, 54 P. 2d 906,
913 (1936) (per curiam); 1 Hutchins 377–378; St. Onge v.
Blakely, 76 Mont. 1, 22–24, 245 P. 532, 539 (1926).
Improvements to irrigation systems seem to be the sort
of changes that fall outside the no-injury rule as it exists
in Montana and Wyoming. Those changes are not to the
“place of diversion, or place or purpose of use,” Quigley,
supra, at 505, 103 P. 2d, at 1072, and thus seem to be
excluded, much like crop changes or day-to-day irrigation
