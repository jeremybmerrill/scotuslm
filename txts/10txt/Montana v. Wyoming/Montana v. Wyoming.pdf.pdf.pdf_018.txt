Opinion of the Court

Our conclusion is consistent with that of water law
scholars who have considered the specific question pre­
sented in this case. One scholar asserted: “[O]f course,
increasing efficiency at one site may reduce the amount of
water available to downstream users who may rely on
return flows from other users. [Wyoming] law, however,
does not preclude more efficient uses merely because a
downstream user may be injured.” Squillace, A Critical
Look at Wyoming Water Law, 24 Land & Water L. Rev.
307, 331 (1989); see id., at 331, n. 156 (“For example, a
farmer who traditionally consumes only 50% of the water
applied to his land is free to change his crop or method of
applying water so as to increase his consumption to 60%”);
see also Thompson, supra, at 76 (“[A] prior appropriator
can at anytime . . . instal[l] a sprinkler system, thereby
eliminating all waste of water”). And a national hornbook
on water law has observed:
“The rule allowing recapture and reuse of salvaged
water on the original land can result in more water
being consumed. For instance, if a water user is con­
suming less than the permitted amount of water and
plants a more water-intensive crop or puts in a more
efficient irrigation system, most or all of the water
that had previously been returned to the stream
might be consumed. This can deprive other appro­
priators of water on which they depend but it is al­
lowed since it is technically within the terms of the
original appropriation.” Getches 143–144.
Montana has not identified any scholars who have reached
the opposite conclusion.
For all of these reasons, we hold that the doctrine of
appropriation in Wyoming and Montana allows appro­
priators to improve their irrigation systems, even to the
detriment of downstream appropriators. We readily ac­
