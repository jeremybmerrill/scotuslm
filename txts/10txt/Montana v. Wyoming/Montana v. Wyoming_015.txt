MONTANA v. WYOMING
Opinion of the Court

(asserting that, even in Utah, “where the original appro­
priator retains possession and control of the waste and
seepage water from irrigation of his lands, he is entitled to
reuse these waters for his own benefit and need not return
them to the channel from which they were diverted” (em­
phasis added)); Getches 139–145; Woolman v. Garringer, 1
Mont. 535 (1872). And Montana cites no case from either
State here in which a court has recognized, much less
found controlling, the idea that a water user may not
reuse his own wastewater while it is still on his property
simply because it otherwise would return to the original
stream.
In fact, Montana and Wyoming appear to apply, without
qualification, the basic doctrine that the original appro­
priator may freely recapture his used water while it re­
mains on his property and reuse it for the same purpose
on the same land. For example, in Binning v. Miller, 55
Wyo. 451, 102 P. 2d 54 (1940), a man was diverting water
from a creek fed largely by irrigation runoff and seepage
from Binning’s property. Although the court found that
the man had a right to that water once Binning’s runoff
and seepage had become a natural stream, it noted that
his right remained subject to Binning’s right “to use the
water above mentioned for beneficial purposes upon the
land for which the seepage water was [originally] appro­
priated.” Id., at 477, 102 P. 2d, at 63. In a later case, the
court explained that the man could not “secure a perma­
nent right to continue to receive the water” because
Binning “might find better ways of utilizing the water on
the same land so that less waste and seepage would oc­
cur.” Bower v. Big Horn Canal Assn., 77 Wyo. 80, 101, 307
P. 2d 593, 601 (1957).
Similarly, in Bower v. Big Horn Canal Assn., the court
held that Bower could appropriate water as it seeped
across his property from the Big Horn Canal toward a
nearby river. Id., at 102–104, 307 P. 2d, at 602. The court
