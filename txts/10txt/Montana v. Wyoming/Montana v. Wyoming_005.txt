MONTANA v. WYOMING
Opinion of the Court

of its tributaries, including the Clarks Fork, Tongue,
Powder, and Bighorn Rivers, also begin in Wyoming and
cross into Montana before joining the main stem of the
Yellowstone River. This river system’s monthly and an­
nual flows, which are dictated largely by snow melt, vary
widely. In 1964, for example, the flow in the Tongue and
Powder Rivers was nearly 10 times the 1961 flow. App.
936. As the rivers came into heavy use for irrigation, it
became expedient to build water storage facilities for
preserving the heaviest flows. See First Interim Report of
Special Master 6 (hereinafter Report).
Before funding new water storage facilities, Congress
sought agreement as to the allocation of the Yellowstone
River system among Wyoming, Montana, and North Da­
kota. In 1932, Congress granted the States permission to
negotiate a compact. See Act of June 14, 1932, ch. 253, 47
Stat. 306. Draft compacts were produced in 1935, 1942,
and 1944, but none was fully agreed upon. Finally, in
1951 Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota ratified the
Yellowstone River Compact, and Congress consented to it.
Act of Oct. 30, 1951, 65 Stat. 663.
The Yellowstone River Compact divides water into three
tiers of priority. First, Article V(A) provides: “Appropria­
tive rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellow­
stone River System existing in each signatory State as of
January 1, 1950, shall continue to be enjoyed in accor­
dance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of
water under the doctrine of appropriation.” Id., at 666.
Second, Article V(B) allocates to each State the “quantity
of that water as shall be necessary to provide supplemen­
tal water supplies” for the pre-1950 uses protected by
Article V(A). Ibid. Third, “the remainder of the unused
and unappropriated water” of each tributary is divided by
percentage: Wyoming receives 60% of the remaining water
in the Clarks Fork River, 80% in the Bighorn River, 40%
in the Tongue River, and 42% in the Powder River; the
