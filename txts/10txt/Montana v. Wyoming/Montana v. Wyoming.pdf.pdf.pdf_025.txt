MONTANA v. WYOMING
SCALIA, J., dissenting

Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938). The
“beneficial use” requirement does most of the legal work.
It marks the types of uses that confer an appropriative
right—irrigation being a paradigmatic example, see
United States v. Willow River Power Co., 324 U. S. 499,
504, n. 2 (1945); and it “measure[s]” the extent of an ap
propriator’s claim, see Ide v. United States, 263 U. S. 497,
505 (1924); A. Tarlock, Law of Water Rights and Re
sources §§5:66, 5:68–5:69, pp. 5–130.3, 5–130.9 to 5–
130.10 (2010). At common law, an appropriator claims the
volume of water diverted and “reasonably required” by his
intended use. Id., §§5:65–5:66, at 5–127, 5–130.2; see
Quinn v. John Whitaker Ranch Co., 54 Wyo. 367, 377–378,
92 P. 2d 568, 570–571 (1939).
The Compact borrows the concept of appropriation to
define the rights of pre-1950 water users along the Yel
lowstone River and its tributaries. Article V(A) promises
that “[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of the
water of the Yellowstone River System existing in each
signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be
enjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi
tion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.”
65 Stat. 666. Article II(H) elaborates that a “Beneficial
Use” is one “by which the water supply of a drainage basin
is depleted when usefully employed by the activities of
man.” Id., at 665 (emphasis added).
Like the common law, this definition lays out the types
of uses that qualify as beneficial and the volume of water
an appropriator may claim through his beneficial use. But
the Compact’s focus on whether a use depletes a river’s
water supply—not whether it diverts the river’s flow—
significantly limits the volume of water to which Wyoming
is entitled. For purposes of the Compact, Wyoming may
lay claim only to its beneficial users’ net consumption of
water, that is, the volume of water diverted from the river
minus the volume that flows (or seeps) back into the
