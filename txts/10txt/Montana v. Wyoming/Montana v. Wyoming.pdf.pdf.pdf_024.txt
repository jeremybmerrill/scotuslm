STATE OF MONTANA, PLAINTIFF v. STATE OF

WYOMING AND STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA 

ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER
[May 2, 2011]

JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.
Thanks to improved irrigation techniques, Wyoming’s
farmers and cattlemen appear to consume more of the
water they divert from the Yellowstone River and its
tributaries today than they did 60 years ago—that is to
say, less of the diverted water ultimately finds its way
back into the Yellowstone. The Court interprets the Yel
lowstone River Compact (Compact), see Act of Oct. 30,
1951, ch. 629, 65 Stat. 663, to grant those Wyomans* the
right to increase their consumption so long as they do not
increase the volume of water they diverted beyond pre
1950 levels. Thus, it holds, Montana cannot complain that
the increased consumption interferes with its residents’
pre-1950 appropriative water rights. I disagree because
the Court’s analysis substitutes its none-too-confident
reading of the common law, see ante, at 7–8, and n. 5, for
the Compact’s definition of “beneficial use.”
The doctrine of appropriation allocates perpetual water
rights along a river, on a “first in time[,] . . . superior in
right” basis, Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 459
(1922), to those who divert its flow and apply the water to
a beneficial use. See Hinderlider v. La Plata River &
——————
* The dictionary-approved term is “Wyomingite,” which is also the
name of a type of lava, see Webster’s New International Dictionary
2961 (2d ed. 1957). I believe the people of Wyoming deserve better.
