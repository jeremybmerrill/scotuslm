MONTANA v. WYOMING
SCALIA, J., dissenting

State for post-1950 “storage or direct diversions for benefi
cial use on new lands or for other purposes.” 65 Stat. 666.
But if “beneficial use” in this last phrase means “the vol
ume of water by which . . . the water supply is depleted,”
the provision makes no sense. It would allocate a fixed
percentage of unused and unappropriated water for “a
volume of water by which the water supply is depleted.” It
makes perfect sense, of course, if “beneficial use” means all
uses that deplete the stream.
The Court also wonders why, “if Article V(A) were in
tended to guarantee Montana a set quantity of water,” it
did not “d[o] so as plainly as other” interstate water com
pacts “that do just that.” Ante, at 18. This is a straw man.
Montana does not demand a precise volume of water each
year; nor does it insist that its pre-1950 water users al
ways receive enough water to satisfy their pre-1950 needs.
It merely asks that its pre-1950 water users occupy the
same position relative to Wyoming’s pre-1950 users in
2011 as they did in 1950—that whatever would have
flowed back into the Yellowstone after Wyoming appro
priators’ beneficial uses in 1950 if the river then had this
year’s flow, will also flow back this year. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 13, 16, 24. In dry years, that may mean some Mon
tanans will have to make do with less or go without.
Because I think the Court’s disposition disregards the
text of the Compact, I respectfully dissent.
