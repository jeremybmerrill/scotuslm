MONTANA v. WYOMING
Opinion of the Court

knowledge that this area of law is far from clear. See
supra, at 7. But the apparent scope of the no-injury rule
in Wyoming and Montana, the doctrine of recapture and
its broad reach in Wyoming and Montana case law, and
the specific conclusions of water law scholars all point in
the same direction, which also comports with the Special
Master’s exhaustive discussion and findings. Accordingly,
if Article V(A) simply incorporates background principles
of appropriation law, it allows Wyoming’s pre-1950 water
users to improve their irrigation efficiency, even to the
detriment of Montana’s pre-1950 users.

Montana, however, takes another tack. It argues that
even if background principles of appropriation law do not
support its position, Article V(A) of the Compact does not
protect the full scope of ordinary appropriative rights.
Montana claims that the Compact’s definition of “benefi­
cial use” restricts the scope of protected pre-1950 appro­
priative rights to the net volume of water that was actu­
ally being consumed in 1950. We agree with the Special
Master that this argument also fails.

Article V(A) protects “[a]ppropriative rights to the bene­
ficial uses of . . . water.” “Beneficial use,” in turn, is de­
fined in Article II(H) as “that use by which the water
supply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully em­
ployed by the activities of man.” 65 Stat. 665. Montana
contends that “beneficial use” is thus defined as the
amount of depletion. According to Montana, any activity
that increases pre-1950 water users’ depletions in Wyo­
ming beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds the scope of the
appropriative rights that Article V(A) protects. See Brief
for Montana 25–28. On this basis, Montana asserts that
the Compact requires (subject to river conditions) that the
