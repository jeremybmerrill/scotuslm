Opinion of the Court

Mensing and Demahy offer no argument that the FDA’s
interpretation is plainly erroneous. See Auer, 519 U. S., at
461. Accordingly, we conclude that federal law did not
permit the Manufacturers to issue additional warnings
through Dear Doctor letters.

Though the FDA denies that the Manufacturers could
have used the CBE process or Dear Doctor letters to
strengthen their warning labels, the agency asserts that
a different avenue existed for changing generic drug la­
bels. According to the FDA, the Manufacturers could have
proposed—indeed, were required to propose—stronger
warning labels to the agency if they believed such warn­
ings were needed. U. S. Brief 20; 57 Fed. Reg. 17961. If
the FDA had agreed that a label change was necessary,
it would have worked with the brand-name manufacturer
to create a new label for both the brand-name and generic
drug. Ibid.
The agency traces this duty to 21 U. S. C. §352(f)(2),
which provides that a drug is “misbranded . . . [u]nless its
labeling bears . . . adequate warnings against . . . unsafe
dosage or methods or duration of administration or appli­
cation, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the
protection of users.” See U. S. Brief 12. By regulation, the
FDA has interpreted that statute to require that “labeling
shall be revised to include a warning as soon as there is
reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard
with a drug.” 21 CFR §201.57(e).
According to the FDA, these requirements apply to ge­
neric drugs. As it explains, a “ ‘central premise of federal drug regulation is that the manufacturer bears re­
sponsibility for the content of its label at all times.’ ” U. S.
Brief 12–13 (quoting Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 570–571). The
FDA reconciles this duty to have adequate and accurate
labeling with the duty of sameness in the following way:
