Opinion of the Court

templates that sort of contingent supremacy. The non
obstante provision suggests that pre-emption analysis
should not involve speculation about ways in which fed­

reconcile federal duties with conflicting state duties.
When the “ordinary meaning” of federal law blocks a
private party from independently accomplishing what
state law requires, that party has established pre-emption.

To be sure, whether a private party can act sufficiently
independently under federal law to do what state law
requires may sometimes be difficult to determine. But this
is not such a case. Before the Manufacturers could satisfy
state law, the FDA—a federal agency—had to undertake
special effort permitting them to do so. To decide these
cases, it is enough to hold that when a party cannot satisfy
its state duties without the Federal Government’s special
permission and assistance, which is dependent on the
exercise of judgment by a federal agency, that party can­
not independently satisfy those state duties for pre­
emption purposes.
Here, state law imposed a duty on the Manufacturers to
take a certain action, and federal law barred them from
taking that action. The only action the Manufacturers
could independently take—asking for the FDA’s help—is
not a matter of state-law concern. Mensing and Demahy’s
tort claims are pre-empted.

the lawsuit was not pre-empted because it was possible for
Wyeth, a brand-name drug manufacturer, to comply with
