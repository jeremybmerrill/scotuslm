PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
Opinion of the Court

labels to satisfy their state-law duty, they would have
violated federal law. Taking Mensing and Demahy’s
allegations as true, state law imposed on the Manufac­
turers a duty to attach a safer label to their generic meto­
clopramide. Federal law, however, demanded that ge­
neric drug labels be the same at all times as the corres­
ponding brand-name drug labels. See, e.g., 21 CFR
§314.150(b)(10). Thus, it was impossible for the Manufac­
turers to comply with both their state-law duty to change
the label and their federal law duty to keep the label the
same.
The federal duty to ask the FDA for help in strengthen­
ing the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such
a duty exists, does not change this analysis. Although
requesting FDA assistance would have satisfied the Man­
ufacturers’ federal duty, it would not have satisfied
their state tort-law duty to provide adequate labeling.
State law demanded a safer label; it did not instruct the
Manufacturers to communicate with the FDA about the
possibility of a safer label. Indeed, Mensing and Demahy
deny that their state tort claims are based on the Manu­
facturers’ alleged failure to ask the FDA for assistance in
changing the labels. Brief for Respondents 53–54; cf.
Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341

pre-empted a state tort-law claim based on failure to
properly communicate with the FDA).

Mensing and Demahy contend that, while their state­
law claims do not turn on whether the Manufacturers
asked the FDA for assistance in changing their labels, the
Manufacturers’ federal affirmative defense of pre-emption
does. Mensing and Demahy argue that if the Manufactur­
ers had asked the FDA for help in changing the corre­
