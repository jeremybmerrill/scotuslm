PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

to the brand-name label, triggering a corresponding
change to the generic labels. Once that occurs, a generic
manufacturer is in full compliance with both federal law
and a state-law duty to warn. Although generic manufac
turers may be able to show impossibility in some cases,
petitioners, generic manufacturers of metoclopramide
(Manufacturers), have shown only that they might have
been unable to comply with both federal law and their
state-law duties to warn respondents Gladys Mensing and
Julie Demahy. This, I would hold, is insufficient to sus
tain their burden.
The Court strains to reach the opposite conclusion. It
invents new principles of pre-emption law out of thin air to
justify its dilution of the impossibility standard. It effec
tively rewrites our decision in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.
555 (2009), which holds that federal law does not pre-empt
failure-to-warn claims against brand-name drug manufac
turers. And a plurality of the Court tosses aside our re
peated admonition that courts should hesitate to conclude
that Congress intended to pre-empt state laws governing
health and safety. As a result of today’s decision, whether
a consumer harmed by inadequate warnings can obtain
relief turns solely on the happenstance of whether her
pharmacist filled her prescription with a brand-name or
generic drug. The Court gets one thing right: This out
come “makes little sense.” Ante, at 18.

Today’s decision affects 75 percent of all prescription

generic drugs in the prescription drug market is the result
of a series of legislative measures, both federal and state.
In 1984, Congress enacted the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585—
commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to
