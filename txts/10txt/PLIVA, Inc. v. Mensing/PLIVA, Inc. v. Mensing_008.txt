PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
Opinion of the Court

588 F. 3d, at 614; 593 F. 3d, at 449. We granted certiorari,
562 U. S. ___ (2010), consolidated the cases, and now
reverse each.
II
Pre-emption analysis requires us to compare federal and
state law. We therefore begin by identifying the state tort
duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the
Manufacturers.
A
It is undisputed that Minnesota and Louisiana tort law
require a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of
its product’s danger to label that product in a way that
renders it reasonably safe. Under Minnesota law, which
applies to Mensing’s lawsuit, “where the manufacturer . . .
of a product has actual or constructive knowledge of
danger to users, the . . . manufacturer has a duty to give
warning of such dangers.” Frey v. Montgomery Ward &
Co., 258 N. W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn. 1977). Similarly, under
Louisiana law applicable to Demahy’s lawsuit, “a manu­
facturer’s duty to warn includes a duty to provide ade­
quate instructions for safe use of a product.” Stahl v.
Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., 283 F. 3d 254, 269–270
(CA5 2002); see also La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §9:2800.57 (West
2009). In both States, a duty to warn falls specifically on
the manufacturer. See Marks v. OHMEDA, Inc., 2003–
1446, pp. 8–9 (La. App. 3/31/04), 871 So. 2d 1148, 1155;
Gray v. Badger Min. Corp., 676 N. W. 2d 268, 274 (Minn.
2004).
Mensing and Demahy have pleaded that the Manufac­
turers knew or should have known of the high risk of
tardive dyskinesia inherent in the long-term use of their
product. They have also pleaded that the Manufacturers
knew or should have known that their labels did not ade­
quately warn of that risk. App. 437–438, 67–69, 94–96.
