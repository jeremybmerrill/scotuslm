Opinion of the Court

tardive dyskinesia, a serious movement disorder that is
often irreversible. . . . Treatment with metoclopramide
for longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare
cases.” See Physician’s Desk Reference 2902 (65th ed.
2011).
Gladys Mensing and Julie Demahy, the plaintiffs in
these consolidated cases, were prescribed Reglan in 2001
and 2002, respectively. Both received generic metoclo­
pramide from their pharmacists. After taking the drug
as prescribed for several years, both women developed
tardive dyskinesia.
In separate suits, Mensing and Demahy sued the ge­
neric drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopra­
mide they took (Manufacturers). Each alleged, as relevant
here, that long-term metoclopramide use caused her tar­
dive dyskinesia and that the Manufacturers were liable
under state tort law (specifically, that of Minnesota and
Louisiana) for failing to provide adequate warning labels.
They claimed that “despite mounting evidence that long
term metoclopramide use carries a risk of tardive dyskine­
sia far greater than that indicated on the label,” none of
the Manufacturers had changed their labels to adequately
warn of that danger. Mensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d
603, 605 (CA8 2009); see also Demahy v. Actavis, Inc., 593
F. 3d 428, 430 (CA5 2010).
In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal law
pre-empted the state tort claims. According to the Manu­
facturers, federal statutes and FDA regulations required
them to use the same safety and efficacy labeling as their
brand-name counterparts. This means, they argued, that
it was impossible to simultaneously comply with both
federal law and any state tort-law duty that required them
to use a different label.
The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eighth Circuits
rejected the Manufacturers’ arguments and held that Men­
sing and Demahy’s claims were not pre-empted. See
