PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Educ. Law Ann. §6816–a (West 2010). Others permit, but
do not require, substitution. Expanding the Use of Ge
neric Drugs 7; see, e.g., Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. §4073
(West Supp. 2011). Some States require patient consent to
substitution, and all States “allow the physician to specify
that the brand name must be prescribed, although with
different levels of effort from the physician.” Expanding
the Use of Generic Drugs 7.2
These legislative efforts to expand production and con
sumption of generic drugs have proved wildly successful.
It is estimated that in 1984, when the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments were enacted, generic drugs constituted 19
percent of drugs sold in this country. Congressional Bud
get Office, How Increased Competition from Generic
Drugs Has Affected Prices and Returns in the Pharmaceu
tical Industry 27 (1998).3 Today, they dominate the mar
ket. See Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 2 (generic
drugs constituted 75 percent of all dispensed prescription
drugs in 2009). Ninety percent of drugs for which a
generic version is available are now filled with generics.
Id., at 3–4. In many cases, once generic versions of a
drug enter the market, the brand-name manufacturer stops
selling the brand-name drug altogether. See Brief for

of Court’s case file).
2 In addition, many insurance plans are structured to promote generic
use. See Congressional Budget Office, Effects of Using Generic Drugs
on Medicare’s Prescription Drug Spending 9 (2010), online at http://

State Medicaid programs similarly promote generic use. See Kaiser
