SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

to monitor the safety of their products. And, second, they
may approach the FDA to propose a label change when
they believe a change is required.

This brings me to the Manufacturers’ pre-emption de
fense. State law obliged the Manufacturers to warn of
dangers to users. See Hines v. Remington Arms Co., 94–
0455, p. 10 (La. 12/8/94), 648 So. 2d 331, 337; Frey v.
Montgomery Ward & Co., 258 N. W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn.
1977). The Manufacturers contend, and the majority
agrees, that federal law pre-empts respondents’ failure-to
warn claims because, under federal law, the Manufac
turers could not have provided additional warnings to
respondents without the exercise of judgment by the FDA.
I cannot endorse this novel conception of impossibility
pre-emption.

Two principles guide all pre-emption analysis. First,
“ ‘the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in
every pre-emption case.’ ” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565 (quoting

ond, “ ‘[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those
in which Congress has legislated . . . in a field which the
States have traditionally occupied, . . . we start with the
assumption that the historic police powers of the States
were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that
was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.’ ” Wyeth,
555 U. S., at 565 (quoting Lohr, 518 U. S., at 485; some
internal quotation marks omitted; alterations in original).
These principles find particular resonance in these
cases. The States have traditionally regulated health and
safety matters. See id., at 485. Notwithstanding Con
gress’ “certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort
litigation” against drug manufacturers, Wyeth, 555 U. S.,
