SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

bels.9 Thus, had the Manufacturers invoked the available
mechanism for initiating label changes, they may well
have been able to change their labels in sufficient time to
warn respondents. Having failed to do so, the Manufac
turers cannot sustain their burden (at least not without
further factual development) to demonstrate that it was
impossible for them to comply with both federal and state
law. At most, they have demonstrated only “a hypotheti
cal or potential conflict.” Rice, 458 U. S., at 659.
Like the majority, the Manufacturers focus on the fact
that they cannot change their labels unilaterally—which
distinguishes them from the brand-name-manufacturer
defendant in Wyeth. They correctly point out that in
Wyeth we concluded that the FDA’s CBE regulation au
thorized the defendant to strengthen its warnings before
receiving agency approval of its supplemental application
describing the label change. 555 U. S., at 568–571; see
also 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6). But the defendant’s label
change was contingent on FDA acceptance, as the FDA
retained “authority to reject labeling changes made pur
suant to the CBE regulation.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 571.
Thus, in the long run, a brand-name manufacturer’s com
pliance with a state-law duty to warn required action by
two actors: The brand-name manufacturer had to change
the label and the FDA, upon reviewing the supplemental
application, had to agree with the change.10 The need for

the time respondents’ cause of action arose, the FDA did not have
authority to require a brand-name manufacturer to change its label.
(It received that authority in 2007. See Pub. L. 110–85, §901, 121
Stat. 924–926, 21 U. S. C. §355(o)(4) (2006 ed., Supp. III). It did, how
ever, have the equally significant authority to withdraw the brand-name
manufacturer’s permission to market its drug if the manufacturer
refused to make a requested labeling change. See 21 U. S. C. §355(e)
(2006 ed.); 21 CFR §314.150(b)(3).
10 A brand-name manufacturer’s ability to comply with a state-law
duty to warn would depend on its own unilateral actions only during
the period after it should have changed its label but before the FDA
