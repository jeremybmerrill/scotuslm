PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ity. See ibid.; Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S.
238, 255 (1984). To prevail on this defense, a defendant
must demonstrate that “compliance with both federal and
state [law] is a physical impossibility.” Florida Lime &
Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142–143
(1963); see also Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573. In other words,
there must be an “inevitable collision” between federal and
state law. Florida Lime, 373 U. S., at 143. “The existence
of a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to
warrant” pre-emption of state law. Rice v. Norman Wil
liams Co., 458 U. S. 654, 659 (1982); see also Gade v.
National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88,
110 (1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concur
ring in judgment). In other words, the mere possibility of
impossibility is not enough.
The Manufacturers contend that it was impossible for
them to provide additional warnings to respondents Men
sing and Demahy because federal law prohibited them
from changing their labels unilaterally.8 They concede,
however, that they could have asked the FDA to initiate a
label change. If the FDA agreed that a label change was
required, it could have asked, and indeed pressured, the
brand-name manufacturer to change its label, triggering
a corresponding change to the Manufacturers’ generic la

8 In its decision below, the Eighth Circuit suggested that the Manu
facturers could not show impossibility because federal law merely
permitted them to sell generic drugs; it did not require them to do so.
See Mensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d 603, 611 (2009) (“The generic
defendants were not compelled to market metoclopramide. If they
realized their label was insufficient but did not believe they could even
propose a label change, they could have simply stopped selling the
product”); see also Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861,
873 (2000) (describing “a case of impossibility” as one “in which state
law penalizes what federal law requires” (emphasis added)). Respon
dents have not advanced this argument, and I find it unnecessary to
consider.
