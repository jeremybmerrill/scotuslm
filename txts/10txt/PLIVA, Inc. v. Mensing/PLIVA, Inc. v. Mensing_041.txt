conflicting state law.” Ante, at 15.
This principle would have been news to the Congress
that enacted the Hatch-Waxman Amendments in 1984:
Our precedents hold just the opposite. For more than half
a century, we have directed courts to presume that con
gressional action does not supersede “the historic police
powers of the States . . . unless that was the clear and
manifest purpose of Congress.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator
Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); see also Gade, 505 U. S.,
at 111–112 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concur
ring in judgment). We apply this presumption against
pre-emption both where Congress has spoken to the pre
emption question and where it has not. See Wyeth, 555
U. S., at 566, n. 3. In the context of express pre-emption,
we read federal statutes whenever possible not to pre
empt state law. See Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S.
70, 77 (2008) (“[W]hen the text of a pre-emption clause
is susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts
ordinarily ‘accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption’ ”
(quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431,
449 (2005))); see also Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505
U. S. 504, 518 (1992). And, when the claim is that federal
law impliedly pre-empts state law, we require a “strong”
showing of a conflict “to overcome the presumption that
state and local regulation . . . can constitutionally coexist
with federal regulation.” Hillsborough County v. Auto
mated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 716
(1985).
The plurality’s new theory of the Supremacy Clause is a
direct assault on these precedents.14 Whereas we have

Supremacy Clause acknowledges as much. See Nelson, Preemption, 86
Va. L. Rev. 225, 304 (2000) (“The non obstante provision rejects an
artificial presumption that Congress did not intend to contradict any
state laws and that federal statutes must therefore be harmonized with
state law”). The plurality, on the other hand, carefully avoids discuss
