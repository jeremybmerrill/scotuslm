generic drugs by consumers, physicians, and state legisla
tors alike.
Today’s decision introduces a critical distinction be
tween brand-name and generic drugs. Consumers of
brand-name drugs can sue manufacturers for inadequate
warnings; consumers of generic drugs cannot. These
divergent liability rules threaten to reduce consumer
demand for generics, at least among consumers who can
afford brand-name drugs. They may pose “an ethical
dilemma” for prescribing physicians. Brief for American
Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29. And they
may well cause the States to rethink their longstanding
efforts to promote generic use through generic substitution
laws. See Brief for National Conference of State Legisla
tors as Amicus Curiae 15 (state generic substitution laws
“have proceeded on the premise that . . . generic drugs are
not, from citizens’ perspective, materially different from
brand ones, except for the lower price”). These conse

Amendments’ goal of increasing consumption of generic
drugs.
Nothing in the Court’s opinion convinces me that, in
enacting the requirement that generic labels match their
corresponding brand-name labels, Congress intended
these absurd results. The Court certainly has not shown
that such was the “clear and manifest purpose of Con
gress.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565 (internal quotation marks

attempting to comply with their state-law duties to warn,
I would hold that federal law does not categorically
pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn claims against generic
manufacturers. Especially in light of the presumption
against pre-emption, the burden should fall on generic
manufacturers to show that compliance was impossible on
the particular facts of their case. By holding that the
