SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

at 575, Congress has not expressly pre-empted state-law
tort actions against prescription drug manufacturers,
whether brand-name or generic. To the contrary, when
Congress amended the FDCA in 1962 to “enlarg[e] the
FDA’s powers to ‘protect the public health’ and ‘assure the
safety, effectiveness, and reliability of drugs,’ [it] took care
to preserve state law.” Id., at 567 (quoting 76 Stat. 780);
see Pub. L. 87–781, §202, 76 Stat. 793 (“Nothing in the
amendments made by this Act to the [FDCA] shall be
construed as invalidating any provision of State law which
would be valid in the absence of such amendments unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such
amendments and such provision of State law”). Notably,
although Congress enacted an express pre-emption provi
sion for medical devices in 1976, see Pub. L. 94–295, §521,
90 Stat. 574, 21 U. S. C. §360k(a), it included no such
provision in the Hatch-Waxman Amendments eight years
later. Cf. Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 567, 574–575. Congress’
“silence on the issue . . . is powerful evidence that [it] did
not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of
ensuring drug safety and effectiveness.” Id., at 575.

Federal law impliedly pre-empts state law when state
and federal law “conflict”—i.e., when “it is impossible for a
private party to comply with both state and federal law” or
when state law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplish
ment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of
Congress.” Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530
U. S. 363, 372–373 (2000) (internal quotation marks omit
ted). The Manufacturers rely solely on the former ground
of pre-emption.
Impossibility pre-emption, we have emphasized, “is a de
manding defense.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573. Because
pre-emption is an affirmative defense, a defendant seeking
to set aside state law bears the burden to prove impossibil
