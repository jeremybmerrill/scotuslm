Opinion of the Court

The parties do not dispute that, if these allegations are
true, state law required the Manufacturers to use a differ­
ent, safer label.
B
Federal law imposes far more complex drug labeling
requirements. We begin with what is not in dispute.
Under the 1962 Drug Amendments to the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 76 Stat. 780, 21 U. S. C. §301 et
seq., a manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a
new drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that
the proposed label is accurate and adequate.1 See, e.g.,
21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1), (d); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,
567 (2009). Meeting those requirements involves costly
and lengthy clinical testing. §§355(b)(1)(A), (d); see also D.
Beers, Generic and Innovator Drugs: A Guide to FDA
Approval Requirements §2.02[A] (7th ed. 2008).
Originally, the same rules applied to all drugs. In 1984,
however, Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and
Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585, commonly
called the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Under this law,
“generic drugs” can gain FDA approval simply by showing
equivalence to a reference listed drug that has already
been approved by the FDA.2 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A).
This allows manufacturers to develop generic drugs in­
expensively, without duplicating the clinical trials already
performed on the equivalent brand-name drug. A generic
drug application must also “show that the [safety and

1 All relevant events in these cases predate the Food and Drug
Administration Amendments Act of 2007, 121 Stat. 823. We therefore
refer exclusively to the pre-2007 statutes and regulations and express
no view on the impact of the 2007 Act.
2 As we use it here, “generic drug” refers to a drug designed to be a
copy of a reference listed drug (typically a brand-name drug), and thus
identical in active ingredients, safety, and efficacy. See, e.g., United
States v. Generix Drug Corp., 460 U. S. 453, 454–455 (1983); 21 CFR
§314.3(b) (2006) (defining “reference listed drug”).
