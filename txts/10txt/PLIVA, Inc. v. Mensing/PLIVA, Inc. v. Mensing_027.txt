SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)—to
“make available more low cost generic drugs by establish
ing a generic drug approval procedure,” H. R. Rep. No. 98–
857, pt. 1, p. 14 (1984). As the majority explains, to ac
complish this goal the amendments establish an abbrevi
ated application process for generic drugs. Ante, at 5–6;
see also 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A). The abbreviated ap
proval process implements the amendments’ core principle
that generic and brand-name drugs must be the “same” in
nearly all respects: To obtain FDA approval, a generic
manufacturer must ordinarily show, among other things,
that its product has the same active ingredients as an
approved brand-name drug; that “the route of adminis
tration, the dosage form, and the strength of the new
drug are the same” as the brand-name drug; and that its
product is “bioequivalent” to the brand-name drug.
§§355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iii), (iv). By eliminating the need for
generic manufacturers to prove their drugs’ safety and
efficacy independently, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments
allow generic manufacturers to bring drugs to market
much less expensively.
The States have also acted to expand consumption of
low-cost generic drugs. In the years leading up to passage
of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, States enacted legis
lation authorizing pharmacists to substitute generic drugs
when filling prescriptions for brand-name drugs. Chris

uct Selection: Legal Issues, 41 J. Am. Pharmaceutical
Assn. 868, 869 (2001). Currently, all States have some
form of generic substitution law. See ibid. Some States
require generic substitution in certain circumstances.
