PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING 

Opinion of the Court 


I

Metoclopramide is a drug designed to speed the move­
ment of food through the digestive system. The Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) first approved metoclopra­
mide tablets, under the brand name Reglan, in 1980. Five
years later, generic manufacturers also began producing meto­
clopramide. The drug is commonly used to treat digestive tract problems such as diabetic gastroparesis and
gastroesophageal reflux disorder.
Evidence has accumulated that long-term metoclopra­
mide use can cause tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurologi­
cal disorder. Studies have shown that up to 29% of pa­
tients who take metoclopramide for several years develop
this condition. McNeil v. Wyeth, 462 F. 3d 364, 370,
n. 5 (CA5 2006); see also Shaffer, Butterfield, Pamer, &
Mackey, Tardive Dyskinesia Risks and Metoclopramide
Use Before and After U. S. Market Withdrawal of Cis­
apride, 44 J. Am. Pharmacists Assn. 661, 663 (2004) (not­
ing 87 cases of metoclopramide-related tardive dyskinesia
reported to the FDA’s adverse event reporting system by
mid-2003).
Accordingly, warning labels for the drug have been
strengthened and clarified several times. In 1985, the
label was modified to warn that “tardive dyskinesia . . .
may develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,”
and the drug’s package insert added that “[t]herapy longer
than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be
recommended.” Physician’s Desk Reference 1635–1636
(41st ed. 1987); see also Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al.
21–22 (hereinafter PLIVA Brief). In 2004, the brand­
name Reglan manufacturer requested, and the FDA ap­
proved, a label change to add that “[t]herapy should not
exceed 12 weeks in duration.” Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 8 (hereinafter U. S. Brief). And in 2009,
the FDA ordered a black box warning—its strongest—
which states: “Treatment with metoclopramide can cause
