SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

showing that anywhere from one-third to one-half of
generic drugs no longer have a marketed brand-name
equivalent). Reflecting the success of their products,
many generic manufacturers, including the Manufacturers
and their amici, are huge, multinational companies. In
total, generic drug manufacturers sold an estimated $66
billion of drugs in this country in 2009. See id., at 15.

As noted, to obtain FDA approval a generic manufac
turer must generally show that its drug is the same as an
approved brand-name drug. It need not conduct clinical
trials to prove the safety and efficacy of the drug. This
does not mean, however, that a generic manufacturer has
no duty under federal law to ensure the safety of its prod
ucts. The FDA has limited resources to conduct postap
proval monitoring of drug safety. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at
578. Manufacturers, we have recognized, “have superior
access to information about their drugs, especially in the
postmarketing phase as new risks emerge.” Id., at 578–
579. Federal law thus obliges drug manufacturers—both
brand-name and generic—to monitor the safety of their
products.
Under federal law, generic manufacturers must “develop
written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evalua
tion, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experi
ences” to the FDA.4 21 CFR §314.80(b);5 see also §314.98
(making §314.80 applicable to generic manufacturers);
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 6, and n. 2
(hereinafter U. S. Brief). They must review all reports
of adverse drug experiences received from “any source.”

4 An adverse drug experience is defined as “[a]ny adverse event asso
ciated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered
drug related.” 21 CFR §314.80(a) (2006).
5 Like the majority, I refer to the pre-2007 statutes and regulations.
See ante, at 5, n. 1.
