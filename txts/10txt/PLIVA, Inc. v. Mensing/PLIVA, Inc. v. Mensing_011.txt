Opinion of the Court

1
First, Mensing and Demahy urge that the FDA’s
“changes-being-effected” (CBE) process allowed the Manu­
facturers to change their labels when necessary. See Brief
for Respondents 33–35; see also 593 F. 3d, at 439–444;
Gaeta v. Perrigo Pharmaceuticals Co., 630 F. 3d 1225,
1231 (CA9 2011); Foster v. American Home Prods. Corp.,
29 F. 3d 165, 170 (CA4 1994). The CBE process permits
drug manufacturers to “add or strengthen a contraindica­
tion, warning, [or] precaution,” 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A)
(2006), or to “add or strengthen an instruction about dos­
age and administration that is intended to increase the
safe use of the drug product,” §314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C). When
making labeling changes using the CBE process, drug man­
ufacturers need not wait for preapproval by the FDA,
which ordinarily is necessary to change a label. Wyeth,
supra, at 568. They need only simultaneously file a sup­
plemental application with the FDA. 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6).
The FDA denies that the Manufacturers could have
used the CBE process to unilaterally strengthen their
warning labels. The agency interprets the CBE regulation
to allow changes to generic drug labels only when a ge­
neric drug manufacturer changes its label to match an
updated brand-name label or to follow the FDA’s instruc­
tions. U. S. Brief 15, 16, n. 7 (interpreting 21 CFR
§314.94(a)(8)(iv)); U. S. Brief 16, n. 8. The FDA argues
that CBE changes unilaterally made to strengthen a
generic drug’s warning label would violate the statutes
and regulations requiring a generic drug’s label to match
its brand-name counterpart’s. Id., at 15–16; see also
21 U. S. C. §355(j)(4)(G); 21 CFR §§314.94(a)(8)(iii),
314.150(b)(10) (approval may be withdrawn if the generic
drug’s label “is no longer consistent with that for [the

ultimate conclusion about whether state law should be pre-empted.
