Opinion of the Court 


III

The Supremacy Clause establishes that federal law
“shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing
in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
notwithstanding.” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Where state
and federal law “directly conflict,” state law must give
way. Wyeth, supra, at 583 (THOMAS, J., concurring in
judgment); see also Crosby v. National Foreign Trade
Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000) (“[S]tate law is natu­
rally preempted to the extent of any conflict with a federal
statute”). We have held that state and federal law conflict
where it is “impossible for a private party to comply with
both state and federal requirements.”4 Freightliner Corp.
v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287 (1995) (internal quotation
marks omitted).5

We find impossibility here. It was not lawful under
federal law for the Manufacturers to do what state law
required of them. And even if they had fulfilled their
federal duty to ask for FDA assistance, they would not
have satisfied the requirements of state law.

4 We do not address whether state and federal law “directly conflict”
in circumstances beyond “impossibility.” See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 582,
590–591 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (suggesting that they
might).
5 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments contain no provision expressly
pre-empting state tort claims. See post, at 9, 19 (SOTOMAYOR, J.,
dissenting). Nor do they contain any saving clause to expressly pre­
serve state tort claims. Cf. Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America,
Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)
(discussing the saving clause in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act of 1966, 49 U. S. C. §30103(e)). Although an express state­
ment on pre-emption is always preferable, the lack of such a statement
does not end our inquiry. Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, the
absence of express pre-emption is not a reason to find no conflict pre­
emption. See post, at 19.
