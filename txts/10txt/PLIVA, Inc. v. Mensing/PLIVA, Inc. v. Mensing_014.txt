PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
Opinion of the Court

Generic drug manufacturers that become aware of safety
problems must ask the agency to work toward strengthen­
ing the label that applies to both the generic and brand­
name equivalent drug. U. S. Brief 20.
The Manufacturers and the FDA disagree over whether
this alleged duty to request a strengthened label actually
existed. The FDA argues that it explained this duty in the
preamble to its 1992 regulations implementing the HatchWaxman Amendments. Ibid.; see 57 Fed. Reg. 17961 (“If
a [generic drug manufacturer] believes new safety infor­
mation should be added to a product’s labeling, it should
contact FDA, and FDA will determine whether the label­
ing for the generic and listed drugs should be revised”).
The Manufacturers claim that the FDA’s 19-year-old
statement did not create a duty, and that there is no evi­
dence of any generic drug manufacturer ever acting pur­
suant to any such duty. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–24;
Reply Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al. 18–22. Because we
ultimately find pre-emption even assuming such a duty
existed, we do not resolve the matter.
C
To summarize, the relevant state and federal require­
ments are these: State tort law places a duty directly on
all drug manufacturers to adequately and safely label
their products. Taking Mensing and Demahy’s allegations
as true, this duty required the Manufacturers to use a
different, stronger label than the label they actually used.
Federal drug regulations, as interpreted by the FDA,
prevented the Manufacturers from independently chang­
ing their generic drugs’ safety labels. But, we assume,
federal law also required the Manufacturers to ask for
FDA assistance in convincing the brand-name manufac­
turer to adopt a stronger label, so that all corresponding
generic drug manufacturers could do so as well. We turn
now to the question of pre-emption.
