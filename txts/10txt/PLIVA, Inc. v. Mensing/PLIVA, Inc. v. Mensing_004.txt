PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
Syllabus
state tort action against a brand-name drug manufacturer for failure
to provide an adequate warning label was not pre-empted because it
was possible for the manufacturer to comply with both state and fed
eral law under the FDA’s CBE regulation. 555 U. S., at 572–573.
The federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug
manufacturers differ, by Congress’ design, from those applicable to
generic drug manufacturers. And different federal statutes and regu
lations may, as here, lead to different pre-emption results. This
Court will not distort the Supremacy Clause in order to create simi
lar pre-emption across a dissimilar statutory scheme. Congress and
the FDA retain authority to change the law and regulations if they so
desire. Pp. 17–20.

THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part III–
B–2. ROBERTS, C. J., and SCALIA and ALITO, JJ., joined that opinion in
full, and KENNEDY, J., joined as to all but Part III–B–2. SOTOMAYOR, J.,
filed a dissenting opinion, in which GINSBURG, BREYER, and KAGAN, JJ.,
joined.
