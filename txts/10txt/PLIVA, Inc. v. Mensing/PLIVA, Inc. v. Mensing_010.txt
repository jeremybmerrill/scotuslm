PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
Opinion of the Court

efficacy] labeling proposed . . . is the same as the labeling
approved for the [brand-name] drug.” §355(j)(2)(A)(v); see
also §355(j)(4)(G); Beers §§3.01, 3.03[A].
As a result, brand-name and generic drug manufactur­
ers have different federal drug labeling duties. A brand­
name manufacturer seeking new drug approval is respon­
sible for the accuracy and adequacy of its label. See, e.g.,
21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1), (d); Wyeth, supra, at 570–571. A
manufacturer seeking generic drug approval, on the other
hand, is responsible for ensuring that its warning label is
the same as the brand name’s. See, e.g., §355(j)(2)(A)(v);
§355(j)(4)(G); 21 CFR §§314.94(a)(8), 314.127(a)(7).
The parties do not disagree. What is in dispute is
whether, and to what extent, generic manufacturers may
change their labels after initial FDA approval. Mensing
and Demahy contend that federal law provided several
avenues through which the Manufacturers could have
altered their metoclopramide labels in time to prevent the
injuries here. The FDA, however, tells us that it inter­
prets its regulations to require that the warning labels of a
brand-name drug and its generic copy must always be the
same—thus, generic drug manufacturers have an ongoing
federal duty of “sameness.” U. S. Brief 16; see also 57 Fed.
Reg. 17961 (1992) (“[T]he [generic drug’s] labeling must
be the same as the listed drug product’s labeling because
the listed drug product is the basis for [generic drug] ap­
proval”). The FDA’s views are “controlling unless plainly
erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]” or there
is any other reason to doubt that they reflect the FDA’s
fair and considered judgment. Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S.
452, 461, 462 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).3
