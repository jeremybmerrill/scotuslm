PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

tutes impossibility somehow renders conflict pre-emption
as a whole meaningless, that concern simply makes no
sense: We have repeatedly recognized that conflict pre
emption may be found, even absent impossibility, where
state law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment
and execution of the full purposes and objectives of
Congress.” Crosby, 530 U. S., at 373 (internal quotation
marks omitted); see, e.g., Geier v. American Honda Motor
Co., 529 U. S. 861, 886 (2000); Barnett Bank of Marion
Cty., N. A. v. Nelson, 517 U. S. 25, 31 (1996); Hines v.
Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941). The majority’s ex
pansive view of impossibility is thus unnecessary to pre
vent conflict pre-emption from losing all meaning.13
Third, a plurality of the Court adopts the novel theory
that the Framers intended for the Supremacy Clause to
operate as a so-called non obstante provision. See ante, at
15–17 (citing Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225
(2000)). According to the plurality, non obstante provi
sions in statutes “instruc[t] courts not to apply the general
presumption against implied repeals.” Ante, at 15 (inter
nal quotation marks omitted); see also ante, at 16 (stating
that when a statute contains a non obstante provision,
“ ‘courts will be less inclined against recognizing repug
nancy in applying such statutes’ ” (quoting J. Sutherland,
Statutes and Statutory Construction §147, p. 199 (1891)).
From this understanding of the Supremacy Clause, the
plurality extrapolates the principle that “courts should not
strain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly

13 JUSTICE

THOMAS, the author of today’s opinion, has previously ex
pressed the view that obstacle pre-emption is inconsistent with the
Constitution. See Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 562
U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–5);
Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 604 (2009) (opinion concurring in
judgment). That position, however, has not been accepted by this
Court, and it thus should not justify the majority’s novel expansion of
impossibility pre-emption.
