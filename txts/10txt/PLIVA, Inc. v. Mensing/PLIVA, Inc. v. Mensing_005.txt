ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURTS OF
APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH AND FIFTH CIRCUITS
[June 23, 2011]

JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court, ex­
cept as to Part III–B–2.*
These consolidated lawsuits involve state tort-law
claims based on certain drug manufacturers’ alleged fail­
ure to provide adequate warning labels for generic meto­
clopramide. The question presented is whether federal
drug regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers
directly conflict with, and thus pre-empt, these state-law
claims. We hold that they do.
