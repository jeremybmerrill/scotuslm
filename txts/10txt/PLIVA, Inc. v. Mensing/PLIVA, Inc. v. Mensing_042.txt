PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

long presumed that federal law does not pre-empt, or
repeal, state law, the plurality today reads the Supremacy
Clause to operate as a provision instructing courts “not to
apply the general presumption against implied repeals.”
Ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis
added). And whereas we have long required evidence of a
“clear and manifest” purpose to pre-empt, Rice, 331 U. S.,
at 230, the plurality now instructs courts to “look no fur
ther than the ordinary meaning of federal law” before
concluding that Congress must have intended to cast aside
state law, ante, at 16 (internal quotation marks and al
teration omitted).
That the plurality finds it necessary to resort to this
novel theory of the Supremacy Clause—a theory advo
cated by no party or amici in these cases—is telling.
Proper application of the longstanding presumption
against pre-emption compels the conclusion that federal
law does not render compliance with state law impossible
merely because it requires an actor to seek federal agency
approval. When federal law provides actors with a mech
anism for attempting to comply with their state-law
duties, “respect for the States as ‘independent sovereigns
in our federal system’ ” should require those actors to
attempt to comply with state law before being heard to
complain that compliance with both laws was impossible.
Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565–566, n. 3 (quoting Lohr, 518
U. S., at 485).
III
Today’s decision leads to so many absurd consequences
that I cannot fathom that Congress would have intended
to pre-empt state law in these cases.
First, the majority’s pre-emption analysis strips generic
—————— 

ing the ramifications of its new theory for the longstanding presump

tion against pre-emption.
