Opinion of the Court
Opinion of THOMAS, J.

Moreover, the text of the Clause—that federal law shall
be supreme, “any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any
State to the Contrary notwithstanding”—plainly contem­
plates conflict pre-emption by describing federal law as
effectively repealing contrary state law. Ibid.; see Nelson,
Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225, 234 (2000); id., at 252–253
(describing discussion of the Supremacy Clause in state
ratification debates as concerning whether federal law
could repeal state law, or vice versa). The phrase “any
[state law] to the Contrary notwithstanding” is a non ob
stante provision. Id., at 238–240, nn. 43–45. Eighteenth­
century legislatures used non obstante provisions to
specify the degree to which a new statute was meant to
repeal older, potentially conflicting statutes in the same
field. Id., at 238–240 (citing dozens of statutes from the
1770’s and 1780’s with similar provisions). A non obstante
provision “in a new statute acknowledged that the statute
might contradict prior law and instructed courts not to
apply the general presumption against implied repeals.”
Id., at 241–242; 4 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the
Law 639 (4th ed. 1778) (“Although two Acts of Parliament
are seemingly repugnant, yet if there be no Clause of non
Obstante in the latter, they shall if possible have such
Construction, that the latter may not be a Repeal of the
former by Implication”). The non obstante provision in the
Supremacy Clause therefore suggests that federal law
should be understood to impliedly repeal conflicting state
law.
Further, the provision suggests that courts should not
strain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly
conflicting state law. Traditionally, courts went to great
lengths attempting to harmonize conflicting statutes, in
order to avoid implied repeals. Warder v. Arell, 2 Va. 282,
296 (1796) (opinion of Roane, J.) (“[W]e ought to seek for
such a construction as will reconcile [the statutes] to­
