PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING
Opinion of the Court

brand-name]”).
We defer to the FDA’s interpretation of its CBE and
generic labeling regulations.
Although Mensing and
Demahy offer other ways to interpret the regulations, see
Brief for Respondents 33–35, we do not find the agency’s
interpretation “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the
regulation.” Auer, supra, at 461 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Nor do Mensing and Demahy suggest there is
any other reason to doubt the agency’s reading. We there­
fore conclude that the CBE process was not open to the
Manufacturers for the sort of change required by state
law.

Next, Mensing and Demahy contend that the Manufac­
turers could have used “Dear Doctor” letters to send ad­
ditional warnings to prescribing physicians and other
healthcare professionals. See Brief for Respondents 36; 21
CFR §200.5. Again, the FDA disagrees, and we defer to
the agency’s views.
The FDA argues that Dear Doctor letters qualify as
“labeling.” U. S. Brief 18; see also 21 U. S. C. §321(m); 21
CFR §202.1(l)(2). Thus, any such letters must be “consis­
tent with and not contrary to [the drug’s] approved . . .
labeling.” 21 CFR §201.100(d)(1). A Dear Doctor letter
that contained substantial new warning information
would not be consistent with the drug’s approved labeling.
Moreover, if generic drug manufacturers, but not the
brand-name manufacturer, sent such letters, that would
inaccurately imply a therapeutic difference between the
brand and generic drugs and thus could be impermissibly
“misleading.” U. S. Brief 19; see 21 CFR §314.150(b)(3)
(FDA may withdraw approval of a generic drug if “the
labeling of the drug . . . is false or misleading in any
particular”).
As with the CBE regulation, we defer to the FDA.
