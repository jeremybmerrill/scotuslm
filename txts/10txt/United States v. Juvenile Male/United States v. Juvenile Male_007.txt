Per Curiam

the established exception to mootness for disputes that are
“ ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review.’ ” Id., at 8
(quoting Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 148–149
(1975) (per curiam)). This exception, however, applies
only where “(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration
too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expira
tion, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the
same complaining party [will] be subject to the same
action again.” Spencer, supra, at 17 (internal quotation
marks omitted). At the very least, respondent cannot
satisfy the second of these requirements. He has now
turned 21, and he will never again be subject to an order
imposing special conditions of juvenile supervision. See,
e.g., DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per cu
riam). The capable-of-repetition exception to mootness
thus does not apply, and the Ninth Circuit lacked
the authority under Article III to decide this case on the
merits.
The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s
motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case
is remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE
SOTOMAYOR would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit
for that court’s consideration of mootness in the first
instance.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
