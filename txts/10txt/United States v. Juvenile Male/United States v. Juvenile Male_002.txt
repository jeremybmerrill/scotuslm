UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE
Per Curiam

tion, Congress enacted SORNA. 120 Stat. 590. Under
SORNA, a sex offender must “register, and keep the re
gistration current, in each jurisdiction” where the offen
der resides, is employed, or attends school. 42 U. S. C.
§16913(a). This registration requirement extends to cer
tain juveniles adjudicated as delinquent for serious sex
offenses. §16911(8). In addition, an interim rule issued by
the Attorney General mandates that SORNA’s require
ments apply retroactively to sex offenders convicted before
the statute’s enactment. 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (2007) (codi
fied at 28 CFR pt. 72 (2010)); see 42 U. S. C. §16913(d).1
In July 2007, the District Court determined that re
spondent had failed to comply with the requirements of
his prerelease program. The court revoked respondent’s
juvenile supervision, imposed an additional 6-month term
of detention, and ordered that the detention be followed by
supervision until respondent’s 21st birthday. 560 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 1–2). At the Government’s urging, and
over respondent’s objection, the court also imposed a
“special conditio[n]” of supervision requiring respondent to
register and keep current as a sex offender. Id., at ___

for Cert. 9 (noting the Government’s argument in the
District Court that respondent should be required to regis
ter under SORNA “ ‘at least until’ ” his release from juve
nile supervision on his 21st birthday).
On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged
this “special conditio[n]” of supervision. He requested that
the Court of Appeals “reverse th[e] portion of his sentence

1 On December 29, 2010, the Attorney General finalized the interim
rule. See 75 Fed. Reg. 81849. In Reynolds v. United States, No. 10–
6549, this Court granted certiorari on the question whether sex offend
ers convicted before the enactment of SORNA have standing to chal
lenge the validity of the Attorney General’s interim rule. 562 U. S. ___
(2011); Pet. for Cert. in Reynolds, p. i. Reynolds is slated to be heard
next Term.
