Montana.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quota

potential ‘collateral consequenc[e]’ that might be remedied
by a judgment in respondent’s favor is the requirement
that respondent remain registered as a sex offender under
Montana law.” Ibid. In order to ascertain whether a
decision invalidating the District Court’s registration
conditions would enable respondent to remove his name
from the Montana sex-offender registry, the Court certi
fied the following question to the Montana Supreme
Court:
“Is respondent’s duty to remain registered as a sex
offender under Montana law contingent upon the
validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal
juvenile-supervision order that required him to regis
ter as a sex offender, or is the duty an independent
requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by
the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile
supervision conditions?” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3)
(citations omitted).
The Montana Supreme Court has now responded to our
certified question. See United States v. Juvenile Male, ___
P. 3d ___, 2011 WL 2162807 (2011). Its answer is that
respondent’s “state law duty to remain registered as a sex
offender is not contingent upon the validity of the condi

ent requirement of Montana law.” Id., at ___, 2011 WL
2162807,*1.
