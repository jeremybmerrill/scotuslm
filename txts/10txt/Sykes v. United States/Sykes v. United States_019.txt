SYKES v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

I
Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a
felony. Any person who “knowingly or intentionally . . .
flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has,
by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered
the person to stop” commits a misdemeanor. Ind. Code
§35–44–3–3(a)(3). If the person “uses a vehicle” to flee,
however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.
§3(b)(1)(A). That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a
“violent felony” under ACCA if it is “burglary, arson, or
extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves
conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).
As explained below, Indiana’s crime of intentional ve
hicular flight “involves conduct that presents a serious
potential risk of physical injury to another.” Ibid. The
elements of §3(b)(1)(A), compared to those of the enumer
ated ACCA offense of burglary, suggest that an ordinary
violation of §3(b)(1)(A) is far riskier than an ordinary
burglary. Statistics, common experience, and Indiana
cases support this conclusion.

The specific crimes Congress listed as “violent felon
[ies]” in ACCA—arson, extortion, burglary, and use of
explosives—provide a “baseline against which to measure
the degree of risk” that a nonenumerated offense must
present in order to qualify as a violent felony. James v.
United States, 550 U. S. 192, 208 (2007); see also ante, at
6. Burglary, for instance, sets a low baseline level for risk.
Its elements are “unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or
remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to com
mit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599
(1990). As this Court has recognized, the risk of burglary
is in “the possibility that an innocent person might appear
while the crime is in progress” and the danger inherent in
