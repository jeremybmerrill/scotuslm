Syllabus
(b)(1)(A) is roughly equivalent to one type of subsection (b)(1)(B) vio
lation. Pp. 11–13.
(d) Congress framed ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than
encyclopedic, terms. The residual clause imposes enhanced punish
ment for unlawful firearm possession when the relevant prior of
fenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar to that pre
sented by several enumerated offenses.
It instructs potential
recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime if they again
transgress. This intelligible principle provides guidance, allowing a
person to conform his conduct to the law. While this approach may at
times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congres
sional power to enact. Pp. 13–14.
