SYKES v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

burglary. It is well known that when offenders use motor
vehicles as their means of escape they create serious po
tential risks of physical injury to others. Flight from a
law enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.
As that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumu
lates. And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a
crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to
avoid capture.
Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by
definitional necessity occur when police are present, are
flights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected
with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious
potential risk of physical injury to another. See post, at 5–
6 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see also post, at
6–7 (listing Indiana cases addressing ordinary intentional
vehicle flight and noting the high-risk conduct that those
convictions involved).
Although statistics are not dispositive, here they con
firm the commonsense conclusion that Indiana’s vehicular
flight crime is a violent felony. See Chambers, 555 U. S.,
at 129 (explaining that statistical evidence sometimes
“helps provide a conclusive . . . answer” concerning the
risks that crimes present). As JUSTICE THOMAS explains,
chase-related crashes kill more than 100 nonsuspects
every year. See post, at 4–5. Injury rates are much
higher. Studies show that between 18% and 41% of chases
involve crashes, which always carry a risk of injury, and
that between 4% and 17% of all chases end in injury. See

A 2008 International Association of Chiefs of Police
(IACP) study examined 7,737 police pursuits reported by
56 agencies in 30 States during 2001–2007. C. Lum & G.
Fachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innovation and
Reform 54. Those pursuits, the study found, resulted in
313 injuries to police and bystanders, a rate of slightly
over 4 injuries to these nonsuspects per 100 pursuits. Id.,
