SYKES v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

volves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to
another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Many years of
prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this defini
tion. A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has
three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year man
datory minimum sentence and the possibility of life im
prisonment. See §924(e)(1); see United States v. Harrison,
558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009). Without those
prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence,
which could not possibly exceed 10 years. See §924(a)(2).
Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within
ACCA’s residual clause; that is, if it “involves conduct
that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to
another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Today’s opinion says, or ini
tially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent
felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
of risk “ ‘comparable to that posed by its closest analog
among the enumerated offenses.’ ” Ante, at 6. That is a
quotation from the Court’s opinion in the first of our
residual-clause trilogy, James, 550 U. S., at 203. I did not
join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the
elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least
risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was
the closest analog. See id., at 230 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
The problem with applying the James standard to the pres
ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under
Indiana law are not analogous to any of the four enumer
ated offenses. See Ind. Code §35–44–3–3 (2004). Nor is it
apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely
resembles, for example, statutory rape, see United States
v. Daye, 571 F. 3d 225, 228–236 (CA2 2009); possession of
a sawed-off shotgun, see United States v. Upton, 512 F. 3d
394, 403–405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison,
see Chambers, supra. I predicted this inadequacy of the
“closest analog” test in my James dissent. See 550 U. S.,
