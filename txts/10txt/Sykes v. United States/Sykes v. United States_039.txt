SCALIA, J., dissenting

We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing
volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particu
lar. It should be no surprise that as the volume increases,
so do the number of imprecise laws. And no surprise that
our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti
tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitu
tion. Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts
legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants
credit for addressing a national problem but does not have
the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty
gritty. In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to
call a halt. I do not think it would be a radical step—
indeed, I think it would be highly responsible—to limit
ACCA to the named violent crimes. Congress can quickly
add what it wishes. Because the majority prefers to let
vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.
