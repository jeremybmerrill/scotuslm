MARCUS SYKES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 9, 2011]


JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.
As the Court's opinion acknowledges, this case is “an
other in a series,” ante, at 1. More specifically, it is an at
tempt to clarify, for the fourth time since 2007, what
distinguishes “violent felonies” under the residual clause
of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii), from other crimes. See James v. United

U. S. 137 (2008); Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122
(2009). We try to include an ACCA residual-clause case in
about every second or third volume of the United States
Reports.
As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar
ification of the Delphic residual clause, today’s opinion
produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further
confusion. Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same
thing over and over again, but expecting different results.
Four times is enough. We should admit that ACCA’s
residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void
for vagueness. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357
(1983).

ACCA defines “violent felony,” in relevant part, as “any
crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding
one year . . . that . . . is burglary, arson, or extortion, in
