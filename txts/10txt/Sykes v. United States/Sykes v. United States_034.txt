SYKES v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

United States 8.
The only case that is not brought forward in today’s
opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most
recent in the trilogy, Chambers, 555 U. S. 122—which
applied both the risky-as-the-least-risky test and the “pur
poseful, violent, and aggressive” test to reach the con
clusion that failure to report for periodic incarceration
was not a crime of violence under ACCA. But today’s
opinion does cite Chambers for another point: Whereas
James rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be
cause, among other reasons, no “hard statistics” on risk
iness “have been called to our attention,” 550 U. S., at
210; and whereas Begay made no mention of statistics;
Chambers explained (as today’s opinion points out) that
“statistical evidence sometimes ‘helps provide a conclusive
. . . answer’ concerning the risks that crimes present,”
ante, at 8 (quoting Chambers, supra, at 129). Today’s
opinion then outdoes Chambers in the volume of statistics
that it spews forth—statistics compiled by the Interna
tional Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries
attributable to police pursuits, ante, at 8; statistics from
the Department of Justice concerning injuries attributable
to burglaries, ante, at 9; statistics from the U. S. Fire
Administration concerning injuries attributable to fires,
ibid., and (by reference to JUSTICE THOMAS’s concurrence)
statistics from the National Center for Statistics & Analy
sis, the Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Research, the
FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin and several articles pub
lished elsewhere concerning injuries attributable to police
pursuits, ante, at 8 (citing ante, at 4–5 (THOMAS, J., con
curring in judgment)).
