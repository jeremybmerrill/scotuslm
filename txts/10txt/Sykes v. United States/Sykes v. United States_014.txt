statute to require “a knowing attempt to escape law en
forcement” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
The phrase “purposeful, violent, and aggressive” has no
precise textual link to the residual clause, which requires
that an ACCA predicate “otherwise involv[e] conduct that
presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to
another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The Begay phrase is an addi
tion to the statutory text. In many cases the purposeful,
violent, and aggressive inquiry will be redundant with the
inquiry into risk, for crimes that fall within the former
formulation and those that present serious potential risks
of physical injury to others tend to be one and the same.
As between the two inquiries, risk levels provide a cate
gorical and manageable standard that suffices to resolve
the case before us.
Begay involved a crime akin to strict liability, negli
gence, and recklessness crimes; and the purposeful, vio
lent, and aggressive formulation was used in that case to
explain the result. The felony at issue here is not a strict
liability, negligence, or recklessness crime and because it
is, for the reasons stated and as a categorical matter,
similar in risk to the listed crimes, it is a crime that “oth
erwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential
risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

Sykes finds it significant that his flight conviction was
not under the Indiana provision that criminalizes flight in
which the offender “operates a vehicle in a manner that
creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another per

laws in this way, Sykes contends, Indiana confirmed that
it did not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)’s general prohibition
on vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehi
cle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.
Sykes’ argument is unconvincing. Indiana treats viola
