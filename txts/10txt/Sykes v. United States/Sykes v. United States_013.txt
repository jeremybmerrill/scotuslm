SYKES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court 


III 

Sykes argues that, regardless of risk level, typical vehi
cle flights do not involve the kinds of dangers that the
Armed Career Criminal Act’s (ACCA) residual clause
demands. In his view this Court’s decisions in Begay and
Chambers require ACCA predicates to be purposeful,
violent, and aggressive in ways that vehicle flight is not.
Sykes, in taking this position, overreads the opinions of
this Court.
ACCA limits the residual clause to crimes “typically
committed by those whom one normally labels ‘armed
career criminals,’ ” that is, crimes that “show an increased
likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who
might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.”
Begay, 553 U. S., at 146. In general, levels of risk divide
crimes that qualify from those that do not. See, e.g.,
James, 550 U. S. 192 (finding attempted burglary risky
enough to qualify). Chambers is no exception. 555 U. S.,
at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6) (explaining that failure to
report does not qualify because the typical offender is not
“significantly more likely than others to attack, or physi
cally to resist, an apprehender”).
The sole decision of this Court concerning the reach of
ACCA’s residual clause in which risk was not the dis
positive factor is Begay, which held that driving under
the influence (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate. There, the
Court stated that DUI is not purposeful, violent, and
aggressive. 553 U. S., at 145–148. But the Court also
gave a more specific reason for its holding. “[T]he conduct
for which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the
influence) need not be purposeful or deliberate,” id., at 145
(analogizing DUI to strict-liability, negligence, and reck
lessness crimes). By contrast, the Indiana statute at issue
here has a stringent mens rea requirement. Violators
must act “knowingly or intentionally.” Ind. Code §35–44–
3–3(a); see Woodward, 770 N. E. 2d, at 901 (construing the
