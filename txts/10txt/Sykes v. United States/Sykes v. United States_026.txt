THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

ignored a police siren for approximately a mile, passed
several good places to pull over, and drove all the way
home, but traveled at the speed limit of 45 mph and
obeyed traffic laws. 770 N. E. 2d, at 898. Eventually the
defendant got out of his car and shouted profanities at the
officer, who drew his pistol. Id., at 898, 901; see also id.,
at 901, 902 (observing that the defendant had refused to
stop “except on his own terms” and noting “the dangers
that could await a police officer stopping where the citizen
selects”). These two cases fall well short of showing
that intentional flight in Indiana is ordinarily nonrisky.1
See also post, at 6 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (noting that
the “intuition that dangerous flights outstrip mere failures
to stop . . . seems consistent with common sense and
experience”).
B
Sykes also notes that a different subparagraph, §3(b)
(1)(B), covers intentional flight committed while “oper
at[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person,” whereas
§3(b)(1)(A) has no such element. From this, Sykes infers
that §3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does
not present a serious potential risk. The argument is that,
even though the elements of §3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct
that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the
presence of §3(b)(1)(B) casts §3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous
light. Post, at 8 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). But the fact that
§3(b)(1)(B) includes “substantial risk of bodily injury”
as an element does not restrict §3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky
——————
1 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.
His
§3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car
at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road,
weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among
bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house. Ante, at 4; 2
App. 11 (Sealed).
