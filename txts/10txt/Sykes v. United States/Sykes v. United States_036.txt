SYKES v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

supra, at 128–129 (demonstrating that the same was true
in that case).
But the more fundamental problem with the Court’s use
of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness. Vague
ness, of course, must be measured ex ante—before the
Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision,
not after. Nothing is vague once the Court decrees pre
cisely what it means. And is it seriously to be expected
that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry
statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that
this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury
than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be
believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extor
tion, or use of explosives? To ask the question is to answer
it. A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.
II
When I dissented from the Court’s judgment in James, I
said that the residual clause’s “shoddy draftsmanship” put
courts to a difficult choice:
“They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtu
ally all predicate offenses, . . . ; (2) apply it case by
case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable
whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the par
ticular reviewing panel) believes there is a ‘serious po
tential risk of physical injury to another’ (whatever
that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of in
terpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively
predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller
subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the
drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness
. . . .” 550 U. S., at 229–230.
My dissent “tried to implement,” id., at 230, the third
option; and the Court, I believed, had chosen the second.
