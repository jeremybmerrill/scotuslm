KAGAN, J., dissenting

ante, at 8–9 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). But
the Court is wrong to think that fact dispositive.
In general, “similar punishment does not necessarily
imply similar risk” (or similar violence). James, 550 U. S.,
at 217 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Because this is so, the
Court has never suggested that all state offenses falling
within a single felony class and subject to the same penal
ties must receive the same treatment under ACCA. To the
contrary, we have always focused on the “conduct encom
passed by the elements of the offense,” id., at 208 (major
ity opinion)—an inquiry that does not mention the of
fense’s sentencing consequences. And that is for good
reason. It would be quite remarkable if either all or none
of Indiana’s (or any State’s) class D felonies satisfied the
requirements of the residual clause. In Indiana, other
such felonies, subject to “the same magnitude” of punish
ment, ante, at 12, include election fraud, computer tam
pering, and “cemetery mischief.” See Ind. Code §3–14–2–1
et seq. (2009); §35–43–1–4; §35–43–1–2.1. I presume the
Court does not also intend to treat these offenses as vio
lent felonies under ACCA.
Moreover, Indiana sentencing law has always enabled
judges to take account of the difference between subsec
tions (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) in imposing punishment. As
the majority notes, ante, at 12, Indiana provides for a
range of prison terms for class D felonies, stretching
from six months to three years. And in deciding what
term to impose (or whether to suspend the term), courts
may consider an array of aggravating factors—including
whether the crime “threatened serious harm to persons,” §35–38–1–7.1(b)(1). Convictions under subsections
(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) therefore may produce widely vary
ing sentences, as judges respond to the different forms
—————— 

person can violate subsection (b)(1)(B) by means independent of any

vehicular flight has no bearing on that question.
