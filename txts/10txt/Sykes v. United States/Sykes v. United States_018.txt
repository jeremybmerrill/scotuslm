MARCUS SYKES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 9, 2011]


JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that the Indiana crime of in
tentional vehicular flight, Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A)
(2004), is a “violent felony” under the Armed Career
Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The
majority also correctly refuses to apply the “ purposeful,
violent, and aggressive ” test created in Begay v. United
States, 553 U. S. 137, 145 (2008). However, the majority
errs by implying that the “purposeful, violent, and aggres
sive” test may still apply to offenses “akin to strict liabil
ity, negligence, and recklessness crimes.” Ante, at 11.
The error in imposing that test, which does not appear
in ACCA, is well catalogued. See, e.g., Begay, 553 U. S., at
150–152 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 158–
159 (ALITO, J., dissenting); ante, at 11 (finding “no pre
cise textual link” in the statute). I agree with JUSTICES
SCALIA and KAGAN that the majority’s partial retreat from
Begay only further muddies ACCA’s residual clause. Post,
at 1 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); post, at 1, n. 1 (KAGAN, J.,
dissenting).
The only question here is whether, in the ordinary case,
using a vehicle to knowingly flee from the police after
being ordered to stop “involves conduct that presents a
serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). I believe that it does. Therefore I concur
in the judgment.
