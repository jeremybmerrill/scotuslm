SYKES v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

tional element, indicates that §3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.
Neither argument is persuasive.
A
Sykes observes that it would violate the statute to flee
at low speed, obeying traffic signs and stopping after only
a short distance. See Woodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d
897, 900–901 (Ind. App. 2002); post, at 4 (KAGAN, J., dis
senting). Such a flight, he urges, would not present “a
serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” so
a conviction under the statute cannot categorically be a
violent felony.
The fact that Sykes can imagine a nonrisky way to
violate §3(b)(1)(A) does not disprove that intentional ve
hicular flight is dangerous “in the ordinary case.” See
James, 550 U. S., at 208. It is also possible to imagine
committing burglary—an enumerated offense—under
circumstances that pose virtually no risk of physical in
jury. See id., at 207 (hypothesizing a “break-in of an
unoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and
away from any potential intervenors”).
Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he
imagines is the ordinary violation of §3(b)(1)(A). Sykes
offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his
view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight. See
Swain v. State, 923 N. E. 2d 32, 2010 WL 623720 (Ind.
App., Feb. 23, 2010); Woodward, supra, at 898. Yet not
even those cases obviously involve nonrisky conduct. In
Swain, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up
her boyfriend’s accomplice as he ran on foot from two
police officers. 2010 WL 623720, *1, *3. As the officers
approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled,
“ ‘Hurry up. Come on. They’re coming,’ ” and drove off as
the runner jumped in. Id., at *1. She stopped 10 to 15
seconds later, when police vehicles converging on the
scene took up pursuit. Ibid. In Woodward, the defendant
