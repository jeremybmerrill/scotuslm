THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

Looking to the elements, statistics, common experience,
and cases, I conclude that in the ordinary case, Indiana’s
crime of intentional vehicular flight, §3(b)(1)(A), “involves
conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The crime
is therefore a violent felony under ACCA.
