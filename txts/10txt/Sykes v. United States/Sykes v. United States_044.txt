KAGAN, J., dissenting

stand the majority to disagree.
The Indiana provision under which Sykes was convicted
straddles the two hypothetical statutes I have just de
scribed. That provision, subsection (b)(1)(A), states that a
person commits a felony if he “flees from a law enforce
ment officer” while “us[ing] a vehicle.” Ind. Code §§35–44–
3–3(a)(3), (b)(1)(A) (2009). As the Indiana courts have
recognized, the subsection thus criminalizes mere failure
to stop, which should not count as a violent felony under
ACCA. See Woodward, 770 N. E. 2d 897; supra, at 4, and
n. 2. But the provision also includes more violent forms of
vehicular flight: It covers a person who speeds or drives
recklessly, who leads the police on a “Hollywood-style car
chase,” Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 380 (2007), and who
endangers police officers, other drivers, and pedestrians.
And so the “conduct encompassed by the elements” of
this subsection, James, 550 U. S., at 208, runs the gamut—
from simple to aggravated vehicular flight, from the least
violent to the most violent form of the activity. Accord,
ante, at 9–10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (stat
ing that subsection (b)(1)(A) is “not restrict[ed] . . . to
nonrisky conduct”). The question presented is whether
such a facially broad provision meets the requirements of
ACCA’s residual clause.
If subsection (b)(1)(A) were the whole of Indiana’s law
on vehicular flight, the majority would have a reasonable
argument that the provision does so. As noted, a statute
fits within the residual clause if it covers conduct that in
the ordinary case—not in every conceivable case—poses
serious risk of physical injury and is purposeful, violent,
and aggressive. See James, 550 U. S., at 208; Begay, 553
U. S., at 145. We therefore must decide what the ordinary
case of vehicular flight actually is. Is it the person trying
to escape from police by speeding or driving recklessly, in
a way that endangers others? Or is it instead the person
driving normally who, for whatever reason, fails to re
