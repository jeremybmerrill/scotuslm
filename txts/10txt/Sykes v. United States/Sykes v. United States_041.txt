SYKES v. UNITED STATES
KAGAN, J., dissenting

“presen[t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to
another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and involve conduct that is
“purposeful, violent, and aggressive,” Begay v. United
States, 553 U. S. 137, 145 (2008).1 Because we use the
“categorical approach,” we do not concern ourselves with
Sykes’s own conduct. See Taylor v. United States, 495
U. S. 575, 602 (1990). Nor do we proceed by exploring
whether some platonic form of an offense—here, some
abstract notion of vehicular flight—satisfies ACCA’s re
sidual clause. We instead focus on the elements of the
actual state statute at issue. Cf. Chambers v. United
States, 555 U. S. 122, 126–127 (2009) (breaking down an
Illinois statute into discrete offenses to decide whether the
crime of conviction fit within the residual clause); James v.
United States, 550 U. S. 192, 202 (2007) (examining how
Florida’s law defined attempted burglary to determine if
the residual clause included that offense). More particu
larly, we ask whether “the conduct encompassed by the
elements” of that statute, “in the ordinary case” (not in
every conceivable case), involves the requisite danger and
violence. Id., at 208. By making this inquiry, we attempt
——————
1 I understand the majority to retain the “purposeful, violent, and
aggressive” test, but to conclude that it is “redundant” in this case. See
ante, at 11. Like JUSTICE SCALIA, see ante, at 3 (dissenting opinion), I
find this conclusion puzzling. I do not think the majority could mean to
limit the test to “strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.”
Ante, at 11 (majority opinion). As JUSTICE SCALIA notes, see ante, at 3,
that would be to eliminate the test’s focus on “violence” and “aggres
sion.” And it would collide with Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S.
122 (2009)—a decision the majority cites approvingly, see ante, at 8—
which applied the test to an intentional crime. See 555 U. S., at 128
(opinion of the Court), 130 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court) (hold
ing that “knowin[g] fail[ure] to report to a penal institution” does not
involve “purposeful, violent, or aggressive conduct” (internal quotation
marks omitted)). So I assume this test will make a resurgence—that it
will be declared non-redundant—the next time the Court considers a
crime, whether intentional or not, that involves risk of injury but not
aggression or violence.
