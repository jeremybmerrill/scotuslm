THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

case that under §3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an
officer or interfere with service of process is a class D
felony only if the vehicle is “operate[d] . . . in a manner
that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another
person.” §3(b)(1)(B). But using a vehicle to intentionally
flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove
risk. §3(b)(1)(A).
This rough equivalence between §3(b)(1)(A) and §3(b)
(1)(B) is borne out in Indiana case law. The conduct
underlying the Indiana cases discussed above, see supra,
at 6–7, demonstrates that despite §3(b)(1)(B), convictions
under §3(b)(1)(A) include risky flights.
Third, the remainder of Indiana’s resisting law enforce
——————
plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,”
Haw. Rev. Stat. §707–714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to “[i]ntentionally
discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,” §707–714(1)(b). I would
infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se
that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given
case. Other States have similar statutes. See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.
11, §§603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§6–2–504(a), (b) (2009); Me.
Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17–A, §§301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).
Similarly here, I infer that §3(b)(1)(A)’s upgrade of intentional flight
to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the
offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, “operat[ing] a vehicle
in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another
person” under §3(b)(1)(B).
JUSTICE KAGAN argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana
Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from
§3(b)(1)(B) when it added §3(b)(1)(A). Post, at 12. There are at least
two problems with this reasoning. First, even though §3(b)(1)(A) may
be redundant with §3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in
subsection (a)(3), the reference to “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B) is
still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).
Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference
to “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B). Second, although JUSTICE
KAGAN can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require
perfection in statutory drafting. See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC,
562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). I think it clear enough what
the statute means.
