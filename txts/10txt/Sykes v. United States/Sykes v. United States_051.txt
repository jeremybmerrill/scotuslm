SYKES v. UNITED STATES
KAGAN, J., dissenting

of vehicular flight targeted by the offenses.
The Court argues, in support of its position, that the
“similarity in punishment” reveals that the conduct falling
within subsection (b)(1)(A) is “rough[ly] equivalent,” in
terms of risk, to the conduct falling within subsection
(b)(1)(B). Ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also ante, at 10–11 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg
ment). More specifically, the Court claims that the Indi
ana Legislature added subsection (b)(1)(A) to the statute
in 1998 because it determined that vehicular flight is per
se risky—and that all such flight therefore deserves the
same punishment as is meted out to the various non-flight
conduct that subsection (b)(1)(B) prohibits upon a showing
of risk. See ante, at 12; see also n. 9, supra. But that
argument disregards the legislature’s decision to criminal
ize vehicular flight in both provisions—that is, to retain
subsection (b)(1)(B)’s prohibition on risky vehicular flight
alongside subsection (b)(1)(A)’s ban on simple flight. In
effect, the Court reads subsection (b)(1)(A) as including all
vehicular flight and subsection (b)(1)(B) as including only
the other (non-flight) things it mentions—even though
subsection (b)(1)(B) specifically bars “flee[ing] from a law
enforcement officer . . . in a manner that creates a sub
stantial risk of bodily injury.”
Perhaps the Court assumes that the Indiana Legisla
ture, in enacting subsection (b)(1)(A), simply forgot to
remove the reference to vehicular flight in subsection
(b)(1)(B). Cf. ante, at 10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg
ment) (acknowledging superfluity). But if so, the legis
lature forgot four more times to correct its error, as it
serially amended and re-amended its vehicular-flight statute over the last 13 years.10 And more fundamentally, a
