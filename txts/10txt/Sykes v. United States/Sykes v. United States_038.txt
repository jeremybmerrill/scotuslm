SYKES v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). What sets
ACCA apart from those statutes—and what confirms its
incurable vagueness—is our repeated inability to craft a
principled test out of the statutory text. We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to
yield “an intelligible principle,” ante, at 13, each attempt
to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less
predictable and more arbitrary than the last. ACCA’s
residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal
proscriptions require. See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89–90 (1921).
The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be
unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant’s
conduct. See ante, at 14. Even apart from the fact that
our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,
this is not the first time I have found the comparison
unpersuasive:
“None of the provisions the Court cites . . . is similar
in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical
injury with the word ‘otherwise,’ preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The
phrase ‘shades of red,’ standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase ‘fireengine red, light pink, maroon, navy blue, or colors
that otherwise involve shades of red’ assuredly does
so.” James, 550 U. S., at 230, n. 7.
Of course even if the cited statutes were comparable,
repetition of constitutional error does not produce constitutional truth.
