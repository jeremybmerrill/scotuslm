Opinion of the Court

at 57. Given that police may be least likely to pursue
suspects where the dangers to bystanders are greatest—
i.e., when flights occur at extraordinarily high speeds—
it is possible that risks associated with vehicle flight are
even higher.
Those risks may outstrip the dangers of at least two
offenses enumerated in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Ac
cording to a study by the Department of Justice, approxi
mately 3.7 million burglaries occurred on average each
year in the United States between 2003 and 2007. Bureau
of Justice Statistics, S. Catalano, Victimization during
Household Burglary 1 (Sept. 2010). Those burglaries
resulted in an annual average of approximately 118,000
injuries, or 3.2 injuries for every 100 burglaries. Id., at 9–
10. That risk level is 20% lower than that which the IACP
found for vehicle pursuits.
The U. S. Fire Administration (USFA) maintains the
world’s largest data bank on fires. It secures participation
from over one-third of U. S. fire departments. It reports
an estimated 38,400 arsons in 2008. Those fires resulted
in an estimated 1,255 injuries, or 3.3 injuries per 100
arsons. USFA, Methodology Used in the Development of
