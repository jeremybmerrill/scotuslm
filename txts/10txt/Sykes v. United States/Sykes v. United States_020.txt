THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

such a “face-to-face confrontation.” James, 550 U. S., at
203. The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an
ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars gen
erally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward
avoiding detection. Nevertheless, that small chance suf
ficed for Congress to list burglary as a “violent felony,” and
for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also quali
fies. See id., at 195.
Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional ve
hicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses
greater potential risk. Although interruption and confron
tation are quite rare for burglary, every §3(a)(3) flight is
committed in the presence of a police officer. Every
§3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in know
ing defiance of an officer’s direct order to stop, “which is a
clear challenge to the officer’s authority and typically
initiates pursuit.” United States v. Harrimon, 568 F. 3d
531, 535 (CA5 2009); see also United States v. Spells, 537
F. 3d 743, 752 (CA7 2008) (“Taking flight calls the officer
to give chase, and aside from any accompanying risk to
pedestrians and other motorists, such flight dares the
officer to needlessly endanger himself in pursuit”). Fi
nally, in every §3(b)(1)(A) flight, the perpetrator is armed
with what can be a deadly weapon: a vehicle. See, e.g.,
Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 383 (2007) (noting that “the
threat posed by the flight on foot of an unarmed suspect”
was not “even remotely comparable to the extreme danger
to human life” posed by that vehicular chase); United
States v. Kendrick, 423 F. 3d 803, 809 (CA8 2005) (“[T]he
dangerous circumstances surrounding a person’s attempt
to flee from law enforcement are compounded by the
person’s operation of a motor vehicle”); United States v.
Aceves-Rosales, 832 F. 2d 1155, 1157 (CA9 1987) (per
curiam) (“It is indisputable that an automobile . . . can be
used as a deadly weapon”).
In sum, every violation of §3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant
