KAGAN, J., dissenting

world of vehicular flight into discrete categories, corre
sponding to the seriousness of the criminal behavior. At
the time of Sykes’s conviction, Indiana had four degrees
of vehicular flight, only the first of which—subsection
(b)(1)(A)—covered mere failure to stop.5 See Ind. Code
§35–44–3–3. Indiana classified as a felon any person who:
•	 “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “us[ing]
a vehicle,” §3(b)(1)(A);
•	 “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op
erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a sub
stantial risk of bodily injury to another person,”
§3(b)(1)(B);6
•	 “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op
erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that causes serious
bodily injury to another person,” §3(b)(2); or
•	 “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op
erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that causes the
death of another person,” §3(b)(3) (all emphasis
added).
Vehicular flight in Indiana is therefore not a single of
fense, but instead a series of separate, escalating crimes.
Each category captures conduct more dangerous than the
one before it, as shown by the language italicized above.7

5 After Sykes’s conviction, Indiana added yet a fifth degree. See 2010
Ind. Acts p. 1197. The four degrees described above remain unchanged.
6 This provision also bars a range of other conduct. See n. 9, infra.
7 JUSTICE THOMAS attempts to bisect this series by stating that the
two most serious degrees of aggravated vehicular flight “enhance
punishment based solely on the results of the flight, not the degree of
risk it posed.” Ante, at 11–12. But conduct that leads to serious injury
or death is ordinarily more risky, viewed ex ante, than conduct that
does not produce these results. And in any event, the fundamental
point here is that the Indiana statute grades vehicular flight according
to the seriousness of the behavior—ranging from flight that need not
pose any risk of harm, through flight posing a substantial risk of harm,
to flight involving a certainty of harm. Subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3)
