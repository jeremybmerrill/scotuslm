Opinion of the Court

10–11; see also post, at 10, n. 2 (identifying reckless en
dangerment statutes with similar structures); cf. post, at
12 (explaining that because in most cases Indiana does not
“specify what additional punishment is warranted when
[a] crime kills or injures,” its provisions creating higher
penalties for vehicle flights that do so reflect a judgment
that these flights are “inherently risky”).
The Government would go further and deem it irrele
vant under the residual clause whether a crime is a lesser
included offense even in cases where that offense carries a
less severe penalty than the offense that includes it. As
the above discussion indicates, however, the case at hand
does not present the occasion to decide that question.
V
Congress chose to frame ACCA in general and qualita
tive, rather than encyclopedic, terms. It could have de
fined violent felonies by compiling a list of specific covered
offenses. Under the principle that all are deemed to know
the law, every armed felon would then be assumed to
know which of his prior felonies could serve to increase
his sentence. Given that ACCA “requires judges to make
sometimes difficult evaluations of the risks posed by dif
ferent offenses,” this approach could simplify adjudica
tions for judges in some cases. James, 550 U. S., at 210,
n. 6.
Congress instead stated a normative principle. The re
sidual clause imposes enhanced punishment for unlawful possession of the firearm when the relevant prior
offenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar
to that presented by burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes
involving use of explosives. The provision instructs poten
tial recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime
if they again transgress. It states an intelligible principle
and provides guidance that allows a person to “conform his
or her conduct to the law.” Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S.
