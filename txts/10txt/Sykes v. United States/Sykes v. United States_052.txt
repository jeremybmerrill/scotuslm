KAGAN, J., dissenting

better explanation than legislative mistake is available for
Indiana’s decision to enact subsection (b)(1)(A) while
keeping subsection (b)(1)(B)’s ban on risky vehicular flight.
Prior to 1998, Indiana, unlike most other States in the
nation, cf. infra, at 13, did not criminalize simple vehicu
lar flight (i.e., failure to stop) at all. See 1998 Ind. Acts
677–678. So Indiana’s decision to create that offense in
subsection (b)(1)(A)—and to distinguish it from the more
aggravated forms of vehicular flight already penalized
under subsections (b)(1)(B), (b)(2), and (b)(3)—brought
the State’s vehicular-flight statute into conformity with
the prevailing approach used nationwide. Especially given
that backdrop, I would not impute shoddy draftsmanship
to the Indiana Legislature. I would heed what that body
said, rather than assume (just because it made both of
fenses class D felonies) that it must have meant something
different. And what the legislature said is that vehicular
flight comes in different forms—one posing substantial
risk of injury (subsection (b)(1)(B)) and one not (subsection
(b)(1)(A)).
The best that can be said for the Court’s approach is
that it is very narrow—indeed, that it decides almost no
case other than this one. As noted above, see supra, at 10,
the Court reserves the question whether a vehicular flight
provision like subsection (b)(1)(A) is a crime of violence
under ACCA “where that offense carries a less severe
penalty than [a greater] offense that includes it.” Ante, at
13. But as fate would have it, that reservation describes
the great majority of vehicular flight statutes across the
country. Indiana is idiosyncratic in this respect; other
States not only separately prohibit, but also differently
punish, simple and aggravated vehicular flight.11 Or
