Court to address the conflict.
II
In determining whether an offense is a violent felony,
this Court has explained,
“we employ the categorical approach . . . . Under this
approach, we look only to the fact of conviction and
the statutory definition of the prior offense, and do not
generally consider the particular facts disclosed by the
record of conviction. That is, we consider whether the
elements of the offense are of the type that would
justify its inclusion within the residual provision,
without inquiring into the specific conduct of this par
ticular offender.” James, 550 U. S., at 202 (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Tay
lor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599–602 (1990).
So while there may be little doubt that the circumstances
of the flight in Sykes’ own case were violent, the question
is whether §35–44–3–3 of the Indiana Code, as a categori
cal matter, is a violent felony.
Under 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), an offense is deemed a
violent felony if it is a crime punishable by more than one
year of imprisonment that
“(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or
threatened use of physical force against the person of
another; or
“(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of
explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre
sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to
another.”
