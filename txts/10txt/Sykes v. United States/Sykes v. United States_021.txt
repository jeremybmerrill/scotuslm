SYKES v. UNITED STATES
THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in
front of a police officer. Based on its elements, the poten
tial risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles “armed
burglary in the presence of a security guard” more than
simple burglary. Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with
much more risk—a far greater likelihood of confrontation
with police and a greater chance of violence in that
confrontation—than burglary. It follows that the “the con
duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi
nary case,” poses a greater risk of harm than the enumer
ated offense of burglary. James, supra, at 208.
B
Common experience and statistical evidence confirm the
“potential risk” of intentional vehicular flight. Cf. Cham
bers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122, 129 (2009) (statistical
evidence, though not always necessary, “strongly supports
the intuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a
serious potential risk of physical injury”). Data from the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows
that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and
occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase
related crashes. National Center for Statistics & Analysis,
Fatalities in Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes Involving
Police in Pursuit 37–56 (2010) (reporting 1,269 such
deaths between 2000 and 2009).
The number injured must be much higher. Many thou
sands of police chases occur every year. In California and
Pennsylvania, which collect statewide pursuit data, police
were involved in a combined total of more than 8,700
chases in 2007 alone. See Pennsylvania State Police
