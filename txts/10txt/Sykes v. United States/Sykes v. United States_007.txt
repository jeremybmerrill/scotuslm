SYKES v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

the stop “on his own terms,” as he had done, “without
adequate justification,” which he lacked. Id., at 901–902.
In the instant case a report prepared for Sykes’ federal
sentencing describes the details of the Indiana crime.
After observing Sykes driving without using needed head
lights, police activated their emergency equipment for a
traffic stop. Sykes did not stop. A chase ensued. Sykes
wove through traffic, drove on the wrong side of the road
and through yards containing bystanders, passed through
a fence, and struck the rear of a house. Then he fled on
foot. He was found only with the aid of a police dog.
The District Court decided that his three prior convic
tions, including the one for violating the prohibition on
vehicle flight in subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute
just discussed, were violent felonies for purposes of §924(e)
and sentenced Sykes to 188 months of imprisonment. On
appeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con
victions were violent felonies. He did not dispute that his
vehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it
was not violent. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit affirmed. 598 F. 3d 334 (2010). The court’s opin
ion was consistent with the rulings of the Courts of Ap
peals in the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits. Powell
v. United States, 430 F. 3d 490 (CA1 2005) (per curiam);
United States v. Harrimon, 568 F. 3d 531, 534–537 (CA5
2009); United States v. LaCasse, 567 F. 3d 763, 765–767
(CA6 2009); United States v. McConnell, 605 F. 3d 822,
827–830 (CA10 2010) (finding the flight to be a “crime of
violence” under the “nearly identical” §4B1.2(a)(2) of the
United States Sentencing Guidelines). It was in conflict
with a ruling by a Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Cir
cuit in United States v. Harrison, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1291–
1296 (2009), and at least in tension, if not in conflict, with
the reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Cir
cuit in United States v. Tyler, 580 F. 3d 722, 724–726
(2009), and for the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Kelly,
