SYKES v. UNITED STATES
KAGAN, J., dissenting

perhaps I should say Indiana was idiosyncratic. That is
because in 2006, a few years after Sykes’s conviction,
Indiana amended its vehicular flight statute to set differ
ent penalties for violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and
(b)(1)(B). A person who violates subsection (b)(1)(B) today
faces a mandatory 30-day sentence that cannot be sus
pended; that sentence rises to six months or one year
for repeat offenders. See Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(d). By
contrast, a person who violates subsection (b)(1)(A), even
more than once, is not subject to any mandatory jail time.
See §35–44–3–3(d). So by its own terms, the Court’s
opinion—our fourth applying ACCA’s residual clause in as
many years—applies only to a single State’s vehicular
flight statute as it existed from 1998 to 2006. Cf. ante, at
7 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[W]e will be doing ad hoc appli
cation of ACCA . . . until the cows come home”).

The Indiana statute before us creates a series of escalat
ing offenses dividing the universe of vehicular flight into
discrete categories. One of those categories, subsection
(b)(1)(B), requires proof that the defendant operated “a
vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of
bodily injury.” That phrase tracks the language that
ACCA’s residual clause uses to define a crime of violence.
Other provisions in the Indiana statute demand even
more—actual injury or death. In stark contrast, subsec
tion (b)(1)(A), the least severe of the State’s vehicular
flight offenses and the one of which Sykes was convicted,
lacks any element relating to threat of physical injury. In
deciding this case, I would respect that statutory differ
ence. And because I would take the Indiana Legislature
at its word, I respectfully dissent.
