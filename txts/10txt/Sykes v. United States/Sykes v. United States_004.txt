MARCUS SYKES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 9, 2011]


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
It is a federal crime for a convicted felon to be in unlaw
ful possession of a firearm. 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1). The or
dinary maximum sentence for that crime is 10 years of
imprisonment. §924(a)(2). If, however, when the unlawful
possession occurred, the felon had three previous convic
tions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, the
punishment is increased to a minimum term of 15 years.
§924(e). The instant case is another in a series in which
the Court is called upon to interpret §924(e) to determine
if a particular previous conviction was for a “violent fel
ony,” as that term is used in the punishment enhancement
statute. See James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007);
Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137 (2008); Chambers v.
United States, 555 U. S. 122 (2009).
In this case the previous conviction in question is under
an Indiana statute that makes it a criminal offense when
ever the driver of a vehicle knowingly or intentionally
“flees from a law enforcement officer.” Ind. Code §35–44–
3–3 (2004). The relevant text of the statute is set out
in the discussion below. For the reasons explained, the
vehicle flight that the statute proscribes is a violent felony
