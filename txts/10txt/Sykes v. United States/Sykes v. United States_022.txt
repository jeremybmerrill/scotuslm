THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment

more than 2,100 police officers and finding an average of
just over one pursuit per officer each year). And up to 41%
of all chases involve a crash, which always carries some
risk of injury. Wells & Falcone, Research on Police Pur
suits: Advantages of Multiple Data Collection Strategies,
20 Policing: Int’l J. Police Strategies & Management 729,
740 (1997) (citing nine studies, each showing a crash rate
between 18% and 41%). Indeed, studies show that 4% to
17% of all chases actually cause injury. Ibid.; see also C.
Lum & G. Fachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innova
tion and Reform 57 (2008) (finding that 23.5% of flights
involve a crash, and 9% of flights cause injury).
An International Association of Chiefs of Police study
of 7,737 pursuits across 30 States found 900 injuries, of
which 313 were to police or bystanders. Ibid. As the
majority observes, that injury rate is just over 4 injuries
per 100 chases, excluding injuries to the perpetrator.
Ante, at 8. By comparison, the injury rate for burglary
and arson is around 3 injuries per 100 crimes, or less.
Ante, at 9; see also Harrimon, supra, at 537 (citing similar
arson statistics, showing between 1 and 3 injuries per 100
fires, apparently including injuries to perpetrators). Sta
tistics support what logic suggests: The ordinary case of
intentional vehicular flight is risky, indeed, more so than
some offenses listed in ACCA.
These statistical risks of intentional flight merely rein
force common sense and real world experience. See, e.g.,
