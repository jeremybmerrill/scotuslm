SCALIA, J., dissenting

at 215.
But as it turns out, the Court’s inability to identify an
analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present
case. For today’s opinion introduces the James standard
with the words “[f]or instance,” ante, at 6. It is (according
to the Court) merely one example of how the enumerated
crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explo
sives) “provide guidance.” Ibid. And the opinion then
proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least
risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in
James—finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both
arson and burglary. See ante, at 6–9.
But what about the test that determined the outcome in
our second case in this “series”—the “purposeful, violent,
and aggressive” test of Begay? Fear not. That incompati
ble variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in
today’s tutti-frutti opinion. “In many cases,” we are told,
it “will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.” Ante, at
11. That seems to be the case here—though why, and
when it will not be the case, are not entirely clear. The
Court’s accusation that Sykes “overreads the opinions of
this Court,” ante, at 10, apparently applies to his interpre
tation of Begay’s “purposeful, violent, and aggressive” test,
which the Court now suggests applies only “to strict liabil
ity, negligence, and recklessness crimes,” ante, at 11. But
that makes no sense. If the test excluded only those unin
tentional crimes, it would be recast as the “purposeful”
test, since the last two adjectives (“violent, and aggres
sive”) would do no work. For that reason, perhaps, all 11
Circuits that have addressed Begay “overrea[d]” it just as
Sykes does*—and as does the Government, see Brief for
