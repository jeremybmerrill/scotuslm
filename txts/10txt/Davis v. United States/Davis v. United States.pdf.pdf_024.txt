APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring in the judgment.
Under our precedents, the primary purpose of the exclu

“binding appellate precedent specifically authorize[d] a
particular police practice,” ante, at 11—in accord with
the holdings of nearly every other court in the country—
application of the exclusionary rule cannot reasonably
be expected to yield appreciable deterrence. I am thus
