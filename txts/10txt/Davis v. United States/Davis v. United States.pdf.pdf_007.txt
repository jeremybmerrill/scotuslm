DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

1230 (2008), and affirmed in a 5-to-4 decision. Arizona v.
Gant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009). Four of the Justices in the
majority agreed with the Arizona Supreme Court that
Belton’s holding applies only where “the arrestee is unse
cured and within reaching distance of the passenger com
partment at the time of the search.” 556 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 10). The four dissenting Justices, by contrast,
understood Belton to have explicitly adopted the simple,
bright-line rule stated in the Belton Court’s opinion. 556
U. S., at ___ (opinion of ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 3); see Bel
ton, 453 U. S., at 460 (“[W]e hold that when a policeman
has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an
automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that
arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automo
bile” (footnote omitted)). To limit Belton to cases involving
unsecured arrestees, the dissenters thought, was to over
rule the decision’s clear holding. Gant, supra, at ___ (slip
op., at 2–3). JUSTICE SCALIA, who provided the fifth vote
to affirm in Gant, agreed with the dissenters’ understand
ing of Belton’s holding. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1–2)
(concurring opinion). JUSTICE SCALIA favored a more ex
plicit and complete overruling of Belton, but he joined
what became the majority opinion to avoid “a 4-to-1-to-4”
disposition. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2–4). As a result,
the Court adopted a new, two-part rule under which an
automobile search incident to a recent occupant’s arrest is
constitutional (1) if the arrestee is within reaching dis
tance of the vehicle during the search, or (2) if the police
have reason to believe that the vehicle contains “evidence
relevant to the crime of arrest.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9–
10) (citing Thornton, supra, at 632 (SCALIA, J., concurring
in judgment); internal quotation marks omitted).
B
The search at issue in this case took place a full two
years before this Court announced its new rule in Gant.
