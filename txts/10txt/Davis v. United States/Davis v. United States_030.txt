DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

distinguishable facts? Suppose the case creating the rele
vant precedent did not directly announce any general
rule but involved highly analogous facts? What about a
rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendant’s
jurisdiction, had previously accepted? What rules can be
developed for determining when, where, and how these
different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as rele
vant “binding precedent”? The Linkletter-like result is
likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.
See Williams v. United States, 401 U. S. 646, 676 (1971)
(opinion of Harlan, J.) (describing trying to follow Linklet
ter decisions as “almost as difficult” as trying to follow “the
tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended
victim”).
Another such problem concerns fairness. Today’s hold
ing, like that in Linkletter, “violates basic norms of con
stitutional adjudication.” Griffith, supra, at 322. It treats
the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way
while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases
are pending on appeal in a different way. See ante, at 18–
19. Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong
when he said:
“We cannot release criminals from jail merely because
we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to
announce a constitutional doctrine] . . . . Simply fish
ing one case from the stream of appellate review, us
ing it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional
standards, and then permitting a stream of similar
cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new
rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our
ordinary] model of judicial review.” Williams, supra,
at 679.
And in Griffith, the Court “embraced to a significant ex
tent the comprehensive analysis presented by Justice
Harlan.” 479 U. S., at 322.
