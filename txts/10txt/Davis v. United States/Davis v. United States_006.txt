Opinion of the Court

“workable rule” to guide police conduct, the Court an
nounced “that when a policeman has made a lawful custo
dial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a
contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the pas
senger compartment of that automobile.” Id., at 459–460
(footnote omitted).
For years, Belton was widely understood to have set
down a simple, bright-line rule. Numerous courts read
the decision to authorize automobile searches incident to
arrests of recent occupants, regardless of whether the
arrestee in any particular case was within reaching dis
tance of the vehicle at the time of the search. See Thorn
ton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 628 (2004) (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in judgment) (collecting cases). Even after the
arrestee had stepped out of the vehicle and had been
subdued by police, the prevailing understanding was that
Belton still authorized a substantially contemporaneous
search of the automobile’s passenger compartment.3
Not every court, however, agreed with this reading of
Belton. In State v. Gant, 216 Ariz. 1, 162 P. 3d 640 (2007),
the Arizona Supreme Court considered an automobile
search conducted after the vehicle’s occupant had been
arrested, handcuffed, and locked in a patrol car. The court
distinguished Belton as a case in which “four unsecured”
arrestees “presented an immediate risk of loss of evidence
and an obvious threat to [a] lone officer’s safety.” 216
Ariz., at 4, 162 P. 3d, at 643. The court held that where no
such “exigencies exis[t]”—where the arrestee has been
subdued and the scene secured—the rule of Belton does
not apply. 216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P. 3d, at 643.
This Court granted certiorari in Gant, see 552 U. S.

had “handcuffed [the arrestee] and put him in the back of [the] patrol
car”); United States v. Barnes, 374 F. 3d 601, 604 (CA8 2004) (same).
