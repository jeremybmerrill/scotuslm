DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

sanctioning such action, exclusion of the evidence obtained
may deter Fourth Amendment violations:
“If, as the Government argues, all rulings resolving
unsettled Fourth Amendment questions should be
nonretroactive, then, in close cases, law enforcement
officials would have little incentive to err on the side
of constitutional behavior. Official awareness of the
dubious constitutionality of a practice would be coun
terbalanced by official certainty that, so long as the
Fourth Amendment law in the area remained un
settled, evidence obtained through the questionable
practice would be excluded only in the one case
definitively resolving the unsettled question.” United
States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 561 (1982) (footnote

The Court of Appeals recognized as much in limiting its
application of the good-faith exception it articulated in this
case to situations where its “precedent on a given point [is]

adopt a ‘ “let’s-wait-until-it’s-decided approach” ’ to ‘unset
tled’ questions of Fourth Amendment law” (quoting John
son, 457 U. S., at 561)). Whether exclusion would deter
Fourth Amendment violations where appellate precedent
does not specifically authorize a certain practice and, if so,
whether the benefits of exclusion would outweigh its costs
are questions unanswered by our previous decisions.
The dissent suggests that today’s decision essentially
answers those questions, noting that an officer who con
ducts a search in the face of unsettled precedent “is no
more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous ‘bind
ing precedent.’ ” Post, at 7 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The
Court does not address this issue. In my view, whether an
officer’s conduct can be characterized as “culpable” is not
itself dispositive. We have never refused to apply the
