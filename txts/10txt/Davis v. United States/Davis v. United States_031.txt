BREYER, J., dissenting

Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un
fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even
to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a
“new rule.” But that approach would make matters worse.
What would then happen in the lower courts? How would
courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their
prior decisions when other circuits’ cases lead them to
believe those decisions may be wrong? Why would a de
fendant seek to overturn any such decision? After all, if
the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if
the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he
loses (on relief). See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 301
(1967). To what extent then could this Court rely upon
lower courts to work out Fourth Amendment differences
among themselves—through circuit reconsideration of a
precedent that other circuits have criticized? See Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 23, n. 1 (1995) (GINSBURG, J.,
dissenting).
B
Perhaps more important, the Court’s rationale for creat
ing its new “good faith” exception threatens to undermine
well-settled Fourth Amendment law. The Court correctly
says that pre-Gant Eleventh Circuit precedent had held
that a Gant-type search was constitutional; hence the
police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent,
was “innocent.” Ante, at 10. But the Court then finds this
fact sufficient to create a new “good faith” exception to the
exclusionary rule. It reasons that the “sole purpose” of the
exclusionary rule “is to deter future Fourth Amendment
violations,” ante, at 6. The “deterrence benefits of exclu
sion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement
conduct at issue,” ante, at 8 (internal quotation marks and
brackets omitted). Those benefits are sufficient to jus
tify exclusion where “police exhibit deliberate, reckless,
or grossly negligent disregard for Fourth Amendment
