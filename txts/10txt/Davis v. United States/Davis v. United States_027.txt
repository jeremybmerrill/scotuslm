WILLIE GENE DAVIS, PETITIONER v. UNITED

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,

In 2009, in Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, this Court

decided Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, and 1987,
when it decided Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, that
conclusion would have been more difficult to reach. Under
Linkletter, the Court determined a new rule’s retroactivity
by looking to several different factors, including whether

the old standards.” Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244,
