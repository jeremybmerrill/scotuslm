BREYER, J., dissenting

follow Griffith, apply Gant’s rule retroactively to this
case, and require suppression of the evidence. Such an ap
proach is consistent with our precedent, and it would
indeed affect no more than “an exceedingly small set of
cases.” Ante, at 18.
For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.
