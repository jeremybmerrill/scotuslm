Opinion of the Court

that “the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police
misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.”
468 U. S., at 916; see id., at 918 (“If exclusion of evidence
obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant
is to have any deterrent effect . . . it must alter the behav
ior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of
their departments”). Krull too noted that “legislators, like
judicial officers, are not the focus” of the exclusionary rule.
480 U. S., at 350. And in Evans, we said that the exclu
sionary rule was aimed at deterring “police misconduct,
not mistakes by court employees.” 514 U. S., at 14. These
cases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be
modified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of cul
pable law-enforcement conduct.

And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in
this context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of
prior Fourth Amendment precedents. In most instances,
as in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will
be a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Su
preme Court. But a good-faith exception for objectively
reasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent
review and correction of such decisions. This Court re
views criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of
Appeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals. If one or even many of these
courts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defen
dants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open
will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the
issue. This Court can then grant certiorari, and the de
velopment of Fourth Amendment law will in no way be
stunted.8

faith exception will prevent us from “rely[ing] upon lower courts to
work out Fourth Amendment differences among themselves.” Post, at
