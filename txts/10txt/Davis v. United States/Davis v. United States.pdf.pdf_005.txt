DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

A
Under this Court’s decision in Chimel v. California, 395
U. S. 752 (1969), a police officer who makes a lawful arrest
may conduct a warrantless search of the arrestee’s person
and the area “within his immediate control.” Id., at 763
(internal quotation marks omitted). This rule “may be
stated clearly enough,” but in the early going after Chimel
it proved difficult to apply, particularly in cases that in
volved searches “inside [of] automobile[s] after the arrest
ees [we]re no longer in [them].” See New York v. Belton,
453 U. S. 454, 458–459 (1981). A number of courts up
held the constitutionality of vehicle searches that were
“substantially contemporaneous” with occupants’ arrests.1
Other courts disapproved of automobile searches incident
to arrests, at least absent some continuing threat that the
arrestee might gain access to the vehicle and “destroy
evidence or grab a weapon.”2 In New York v. Belton, this
Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. See id., at
459–460.
In Belton, a police officer conducting a traffic stop law
fully arrested four occupants of a vehicle and ordered the
arrestees to line up, un-handcuffed, along the side of the
thruway. Id., at 456; see Brief for Petitioner in New York
v. Belton, O. T. 1980, No. 80–328, p. 3. The officer then
searched the vehicle’s passenger compartment and found
cocaine inside a jacket that lay on the backseat. Belton,
453 U. S., at 456. This Court upheld the search as rea
sonable incident to the occupants’ arrests. In an opinion
that repeatedly stressed the need for a “straightforward,”
