DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Davis argues that Fourth Amendment precedents of this
Court will be effectively insulated from challenge under a
good-faith exception for reliance on appellate precedent.
But this argument is overblown. For one thing, it is im
portant to keep in mind that this argument applies to an
exceedingly small set of cases. Decisions overruling this
Court’s Fourth Amendment precedents are rare. Indeed,
it has been more than 40 years since the Court last
handed down a decision of the type to which Davis refers.
Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (overruling United
States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950), and Harris v.
United States, 331 U. S. 145 (1947)). And even in those
cases, Davis points out that no fewer than eight separate
doctrines may preclude a defendant who successfully
challenges an existing precedent from getting any relief.
Brief for Petitioner 50. Moreover, as a practical matter,
defense counsel in many cases will test this Court’s Fourth
Amendment precedents in the same way that Belton was
tested in Gant—by arguing that the precedent is distin
guishable. See Brief for Respondent in Arizona v. Gant,
O. T. 2008, No. 07–542, pp. 22–29.9
At most, Davis’s argument might suggest that—to
prevent Fourth Amendment law from becoming ossified—
the petitioner in a case that results in the overruling of
one of this Court’s Fourth Amendment precedents should
——————
5. If that is correct, then today’s holding may well lead to more circuit
splits in Fourth Amendment cases and a fuller docket of Fourth
Amendment cases in this Court. See this Court’s Rule 10. Such a state
of affairs is unlikely to result in ossification of Fourth Amendment
doctrine.
9 Where the search at issue is conducted in accordance with a munici
pal “policy” or “custom,” Fourth Amendment precedents may also be
challenged, without the obstacle of the good-faith exception or qualified
immunity, in civil suits against municipalities. See 42 U. S. C. §1983;
Los Angeles County v. Humphries, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at
7) (citing Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658,
690–691 (1978)).
