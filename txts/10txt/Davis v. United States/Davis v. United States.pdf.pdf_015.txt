DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

pable, other considerations should prevent the good-faith
exception from applying. We are not persuaded.

The principal argument of both the dissent and Davis is
that the exclusionary rule’s availability to enforce new
Fourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue, see
Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), not a good-faith
issue. They contend that applying the good-faith excep
tion where police have relied on overruled precedent effec
tively revives the discarded retroactivity regime of Linklet
ter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). See post, at 2–5.
In Linkletter, we held that the retroactive effect of a new
constitutional rule of criminal procedure should be deter
mined on a case-by-case weighing of interests. For each
new rule, Linkletter required courts to consider a three
factor balancing test that looked to the “purpose” of the
new rule, “reliance” on the old rule by law enforcement
and others, and the effect retroactivity would have “on
the administration of justice.” 381 U. S., at 636. After
“weigh[ing] the merits and demerits in each case,” courts
decided whether and to what extent a new rule should be
given retroactive effect. Id., at 629. In Linkletter itself,
the balance of interests prompted this Court to conclude
that Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643—which incorporated the
exclusionary rule against the States—should not apply
retroactively to cases already final on direct review. 381
U. S., at 639–640. The next year, we extended Linkletter
to retroactivity determinations in cases on direct review.
See Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U. S. 719, 733 (1966)
(holding that Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),
and Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 (1964), applied
retroactively only to trials commenced after the decisions
were released).
Over time, Linkletter proved difficult to apply in a con
