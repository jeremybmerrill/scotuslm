DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

States, 555 U. S. 135, 137 (2009); internal quotation marks
omitted). The court concluded that “penalizing the [ar
resting] officer” for following binding appellate precedent
would do nothing to “dete[r] . . . Fourth Amendment viola
tions.” 598 F. 3d, at 1265–1266 (bracketing and internal
quotation marks omitted). It therefore declined to apply
the exclusionary rule and affirmed Davis’s conviction. We
granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).
II
The Fourth Amendment protects the “right of the peo
ple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and ef
fects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The
Amendment says nothing about suppressing evidence ob
tained in violation of this command. That rule—the
exclusionary rule—is a “prudential” doctrine, Pennsyl
vania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott, 524 U. S. 357,
363 (1998), created by this Court to “compel respect for the
constitutional guaranty.” Elkins v. United States, 364
U. S. 206, 217 (1960); see Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S.
383 (1914); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961). Exclusion
is “not a personal constitutional right,” nor is it designed
to “redress the injury” occasioned by an unconstitutional
search. Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 486 (1976); see
United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 454, n. 29 (1976)
(exclusionary rule “unsupportable as reparation or com
pensatory dispensation to the injured criminal” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). The rule’s sole purpose, we
have repeatedly held, is to deter future Fourth Amend
ment violations. E.g., Herring, supra, at 141, and n. 2;
United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 909, 921, n. 22
(1984); Elkins, supra, at 217 (“calculated to prevent, not to
repair”). Our cases have thus limited the rule’s operation
to situations in which this purpose is “thought most effica
ciously served.” United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338,
348 (1974). Where suppression fails to yield “appreciable
