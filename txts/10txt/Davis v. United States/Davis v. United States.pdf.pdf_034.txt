DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

lower courts in this direction. See United States v. Julius,
610 F. 3d 60, 66–67 (CA2 2010) (assuming warrantless
search was unconstitutional and remanding for District
Court to “perform the cost/benefit analysis required by
Herring” and to consider “whether the degree of police
culpability in this case rose beyond mere . . . negligence”
before ordering suppression); United States v. Master, 614
F. 3d 236, 243 (CA6 2010) (“[T]he Herring Court’s empha

use in obtaining convictions, even if illegally seized . . .
unless the officers engage in ‘deliberate, reckless, or
grossly negligent conduct’ ” (quoting Herring, supra, at
144)). Today’s decision will doubtless accelerate this
trend.
Any such change (which may already be underway)
would affect not “an exceedingly small set of cases,” ante,
at 18, but a very large number of cases, potentially many
thousands each year. See Valdes, supra, at 1728. And
since the exclusionary rule is often the only sanction avail
able for a Fourth Amendment violation, the Fourth
Amendment would no longer protect ordinary Americans
from “unreasonable searches and seizures.” See Wolf v.
Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 41 (1949) (Murphy, J., dissenting)
(overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)) (In
many circumstances, “there is but one alternative to the
rule of exclusion. That is no sanction at all”); Herring,
supra, at 152 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (the exclusionary
rule is “an essential auxiliary” to the Fourth Amendment).
It would become a watered-down Fourth Amendment,
offering its protection against only those searches and sei
zures that are egregiously unreasonable.
III
In sum, I fear that the Court’s opinion will undermine
the exclusionary rule. And I believe that the Court
wrongly departs from Griffith regardless. Instead I would
