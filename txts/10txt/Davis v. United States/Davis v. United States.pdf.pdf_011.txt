DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

exclusionary rule for what it undoubtedly is—a “judicially
created remedy” of this Court’s own making. Calandra,
supra, at 348. We abandoned the old, “reflexive” applica
tion of the doctrine, and imposed a more rigorous weighing
of its costs and deterrence benefits. Evans, supra, at 13;
see, e.g., Calandra, supra; Janis, supra; Stone, supra; INS
v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032 (1984); United States v.
Havens, 446 U. S. 620 (1980). In a line of cases beginning
with United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, we also recali
brated our cost-benefit analysis in exclusion cases to focus
the inquiry on the “flagrancy of the police misconduct” at
issue. Id., at 909, 911.
The basic insight of the Leon line of cases is that the
deterrence benefits of exclusion “var[y] with the culpabil
ity of the law enforcement conduct” at issue. Herring, 555
U. S., at 143. When the police exhibit “deliberate,” “reck
less,” or “grossly negligent” disregard for Fourth Amend
ment rights, the deterrent value of exclusion is strong and
tends to outweigh the resulting costs. Id., at 144. But
when the police act with an objectively “reasonable good
faith belief” that their conduct is lawful, Leon, supra, at
909 (internal quotation marks omitted), or when their
conduct involves only simple, “isolated” negligence, Her
ring, supra, at 137, the “ ‘deterrence rationale loses much
of its force,’ ” and exclusion cannot “pay its way.” See
Leon, supra, at 919, 908, n. 6 (quoting United States v.
Peltier, 422 U. S. 531, 539 (1975)).
The Court has over time applied this “good-faith” excep
tion across a range of cases. Leon itself, for example, held
that the exclusionary rule does not apply when the police
conduct a search in “objectively reasonable reliance” on a
warrant later held invalid. 468 U. S., at 922. The error in
such a case rests with the issuing magistrate, not the
police officer, and “punish[ing] the errors of judges” is not
the office of the exclusionary rule. Id., at 916; see also
Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981, 990 (1984)
