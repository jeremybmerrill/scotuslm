DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
BREYER, J., dissenting

citing “the purpose to be served by the new standards”
and “the effect on the administration of justice” as factors
(internal quotation marks omitted)). And the Court would
often not apply the new rule to identical cases still pend
ing on appeal. See ibid.
After 22 years of struggling with its Linkletter approach,
however, the Court decided in Griffith that Linkletter
had proved unfair and unworkable. It then substituted a
clearer approach, stating that “a new rule for the conduct

prevents application of the normal remedy for a Fourth
Amendment violation, namely, suppression of the illegally

At this point I can no longer agree with the Court. A
new “good faith” exception and this Court’s retroactivity
decisions are incompatible. For one thing, the Court’s
distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new
