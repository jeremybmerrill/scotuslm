DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

But this is not such a case. Davis did not secure a deci
sion overturning a Supreme Court precedent; the police in
his case reasonably relied on binding Circuit precedent.
See United States v. Gonzalez, 71 F. 3d 819. That sort of
blameless police conduct, we hold, comes within the good
faith exception and is not properly subject to the exclu
sionary rule.

It is one thing for the criminal “to go free because the
constable has blundered.” People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13,
21, 150 N. E. 585, 587 (1926) (Cardozo, J.). It is quite
another to set the criminal free because the constable has
scrupulously adhered to governing law. Excluding evi
dence in such cases deters no police misconduct and im
poses substantial social costs. We therefore hold that
when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable
reliance on binding appellate precedent, the exclusionary
rule does not apply. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit is
Affirmed.

dent can be challenged by others, Fourth Amendment case law will not 

be insulated from reconsideration.
