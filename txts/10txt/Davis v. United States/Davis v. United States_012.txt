Opinion of the Court

(companion case declining to apply exclusionary rule
where warrant held invalid as a result of judge’s clerical
error).
Other good-faith cases have sounded a similar theme.
Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340 (1987), extended the good
faith exception to searches conducted in reasonable reli
ance on subsequently invalidated statutes. Id., at 349–
350 (“legislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of
the rule”). In Arizona v. Evans, supra, the Court applied
the good-faith exception in a case where the police rea
sonably relied on erroneous information concerning an
arrest warrant in a database maintained by judicial em
ployees. Id., at 14. Most recently, in Herring v. United
States, 555 U. S. 135, we extended Evans in a case where
police employees erred in maintaining records in a war
rant database. “[I]solated,” “nonrecurring” police negli
gence, we determined, lacks the culpability required to
justify the harsh sanction of exclusion. 555 U. S., at 137,
144.
III
The question in this case is whether to apply the exclu
sionary rule when the police conduct a search in objec
tively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.
At the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet
decided Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, and the Eleventh
Circuit had interpreted our decision in New York v. Belton,
453 U. S. 454, to establish a bright-line rule authorizing
the search of a vehicle’s passenger compartment incident
to a recent occupant’s arrest. Gonzalez, 71 F. 3d, at 825.
The search incident to Davis’s arrest in this case followed
the Eleventh Circuit’s Gonzalez precedent to the letter.
Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional
under Gant, all agree that the officers’ conduct was in
strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was
not culpable in any way. See Brief for Petitioner 49 (“sup
