Opinion of the Court

deterrence,” exclusion is “clearly . . . unwarranted.” Janis,
supra, at 454.
Real deterrent value is a “necessary condition for exclu
sion,” but it is not “a sufficient” one. Hudson v. Michigan,
547 U. S. 586, 596 (2006). The analysis must also account
for the “substantial social costs” generated by the rule.
Leon, supra, at 907. Exclusion exacts a heavy toll on both
the judicial system and society at large. Stone, 428 U. S.,
at 490–491. It almost always requires courts to ignore
reliable, trustworthy evidence bearing on guilt or inno
cence. Ibid. And its bottom-line effect, in many cases, is
to suppress the truth and set the criminal loose in the
community without punishment. See Herring, supra, at
141. Our cases hold that society must swallow this bitter
pill when necessary, but only as a “last resort.” Hudson,
supra, at 591. For exclusion to be appropriate, the deter

costs. See Herring, supra, at 141; Leon, supra, at 910.
Admittedly, there was a time when our exclusionary
rule cases were not nearly so discriminating in their
approach to the doctrine. “Expansive dicta” in several deci
sions, see Hudson, supra, at 591, suggested that the rule
was a self-executing mandate implicit in the Fourth
Amendment itself. See Olmstead v. United States, 277
U. S. 438, 462 (1928) (remarking on the “striking outcome
of the Weeks case” that “the Fourth Amendment, although
not referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts,
really forbade its introduction”); Mapp, supra, at 655
(“[A]ll evidence obtained by searches and seizures in viola
tion of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inad
missible in a state court”). As late as our 1971 decision in
Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, 401 U. S.
560, 568–569, the Court “treated identification of a Fourth
Amendment violation as synonymous with application of
the exclusionary rule.” Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 13
(1995). In time, however, we came to acknowledge the
