SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment

exclusionary rule where its application would appreciably
deter Fourth Amendment violations on the mere ground
that the officer’s conduct could be characterized as noncul
pable. Rather, an officer’s culpability is relevant because
it may inform the overarching inquiry whether exclusion
would result in appreciable deterrence. See ante, at 8
(“The basic insight of the Leon line of cases is that the
deterrence benefits of exclusion var[y] with the culpability
of the law enforcement conduct at issue” (internal quota
tion marks omitted; alteration in original)); see also, e.g.,
Herring, 555 U. S., at 143 (“The extent to which the exclu
sionary rule is justified by these deterrence principles
varies with the culpability of the law enforcement con
duct”); United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 919 (1984)
(“ ‘Where the official action was pursued in complete good
faith, . . . the deterrence rationale loses much of its force’ ”
(quoting Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 447 (1974))).
Whatever we have said about culpability, the ultimate ques
tions have always been, one, whether exclusion would
result in appreciable deterrence and, two, whether the
benefits of exclusion outweigh its costs. See, e.g., ante, at
6–7; Herring, 555 U. S., at 141; Krull, 480 U. S., at 347.
As stated, whether exclusion would result in appreciable
deterrence in the circumstances of this case is a different
question from whether exclusion would appreciably deter
Fourth Amendment violations when the governing law is
unsettled. The Court’s answer to the former question in
this case thus does not resolve the latter one.
