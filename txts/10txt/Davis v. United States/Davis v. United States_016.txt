Opinion of the Court

sistent, coherent way. Individual applications of the
standard “produced strikingly divergent results,” see Dan
forth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. 264, 273 (2008), that
many saw as “incompatible” and “inconsistent.” Desist v.
United States, 394 U. S. 244, 258 (1969) (Harlan, J., dis
senting). Justice Harlan in particular, who had endorsed
the Linkletter standard early on, offered a strong critique
in which he argued that “basic judicial” norms required
full retroactive application of new rules to all cases still
subject to direct review. 394 U. S., at 258–259; see also
Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 675–702 (1971)
(Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
Eventually, and after more than 20 years of toil under
Linkletter, the Court adopted Justice Harlan’s view and
held that newly announced rules of constitutional criminal
procedure must apply “retroactively to all cases, state or
federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no
exception.” Griffith, supra, at 328.

The dissent and Davis argue that applying the good
faith exception in this case is “incompatible” with our
retroactivity precedent under Griffith. See post, at 2;
Reply Brief for Petitioner 3–7. We think this argument
conflates what are two distinct doctrines.
Our retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned with
whether, as a categorical matter, a new rule is available
on direct review as a potential ground for relief. Retroac
tive application under Griffith lifts what would otherwise
be a categorical bar to obtaining redress for the govern
ment’s violation of a newly announced constitutional rule.
See Danforth, supra, at 271, n. 5 (noting that it may
“make more sense to speak in terms of the ‘redressability’
of violations of new rules, rather than the ‘retroactivity’ of
such new rules”). Retroactive application does not, how
ever, determine what “appropriate remedy” (if any) the
