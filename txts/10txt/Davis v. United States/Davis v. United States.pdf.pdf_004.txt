WILLIE GENE DAVIS, PETITIONER v. UNITED 

STATES 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

[June 16, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Fourth Amendment protects the right to be free
from “unreasonable searches and seizures,” but it is silent
about how this right is to be enforced. To supplement
the bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a
deterrent sanction that bars the prosecution from intro
ducing evidence obtained by way of a Fourth Amendment
violation. The question here is whether to apply this
sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance
with binding precedent that is later overruled. Because
suppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct
in these circumstances, and because it would come at a
high cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold
that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance
on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the
exclusionary rule.
I
The question presented arises in this case as a result
of a shift in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on
searches of automobiles incident to arrests of recent
occupants.
