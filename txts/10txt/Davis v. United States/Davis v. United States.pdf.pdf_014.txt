Opinion of the Court

“ ‘[p]enalizing the officer for the legislature’s error . . .
cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth
Amendment violations.’ ” See Krull, 480 U. S., at 350. The
same should be true of Davis’s attempt here to
“ ‘[p]enaliz[e] the officer for the [appellate judges’] error.’ ”
See ibid.
About all that exclusion would deter in this case is
conscientious police work. Responsible law-enforcement
officers will take care to learn “what is required of them”
under Fourth Amendment precedent and will conform
their conduct to these rules. Hudson, 547 U. S., at 599.
But by the same token, when binding appellate precedent
specifically authorizes a particular police practice, well
trained officers will and should use that tool to fulfill their
crime-detection and public-safety responsibilities. An of
ficer who conducts a search in reliance on binding appel
late precedent does no more than “ ‘ac[t] as a reasonable
officer would and should act’ ” under the circumstances.
Leon, 468 U. S., at 920 (quoting Stone, 428 U. S., at 539–
540 (White, J., dissenting)). The deterrent effect of exclu
sion in such a case can only be to discourage the officer
from “ ‘do[ing] his duty.’ ” 468 U. S., at 920.
That is not the kind of deterrence the exclusionary rule
seeks to foster. We have stated before, and we reaffirm
today, that the harsh sanction of exclusion “should not be
applied to deter objectively reasonable law enforcement
activity.” Id., at 919. Evidence obtained during a search
conducted in reasonable reliance on binding precedent is
not subject to the exclusionary rule.
