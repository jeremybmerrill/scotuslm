AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT
Syllabus
Pp. 12–15.
(d) The plaintiffs also sought relief under state nuisance law.
The Second Circuit did not reach those claims because it held that
federal common law governed. In light of the holding here that the
Clean Air Act displaces federal common law, the availability vel non
of a state lawsuit depends, inter alia, on the preemptive effect of the
federal Act. Because none of the parties have briefed preemption or
otherwise addressed the availability of a claim under state nuisance
law, the matter is left for consideration on remand. Pp. 15–16.
