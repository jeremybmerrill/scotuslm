AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT
Opinion of the Court

Water Act does not preclude aggrieved individuals from
bringing a “nuisance claim pursuant to the law of the
source State”). None of the parties have briefed preemp
tion or otherwise addressed the availability of a claim
under state nuisance law. We therefore leave the matter
open for consideration on remand.
*
*
*
For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the
Second Circuit and remand the case for further proceed
ings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
