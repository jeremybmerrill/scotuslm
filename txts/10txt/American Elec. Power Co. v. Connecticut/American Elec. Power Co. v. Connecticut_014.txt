AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT
Opinion of the Court

a promoter of democracy,’ ” id., at 316 (quoting San Diego
Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 243
(1959)), does not enter the calculus, for it is primarily
the office of Congress, not the federal courts, to prescribe
national policy in areas of special federal interest. TVA v.
Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 194 (1978). The test for whether
congressional legislation excludes the declaration of fed
eral common law is simply whether the statute “speak[s]
directly to [the] question” at issue. Mobil Oil Corp. v.
Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978); see Milwaukee
II, 451 U. S., at 315; County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian
Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226, 236–237 (1985).
We hold that the Clean Air Act and the EPA actions it
authorizes displace any federal common law right to seek
abatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel
fired power plants. Massachusetts made plain that emis
sions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to
regulation under the Act. 549 U. S., at 528–529. And we
think it equally plain that the Act “speaks directly” to
emissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants’ plants.
Section 111 of the Act directs the EPA Administrator to
list “categories of stationary sources” that “in [her] judg
ment . . . caus[e], or contribut[e] significantly to, air pol
lution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger
public health or welfare.” §7411(b)(1)(A). Once EPA lists
a category, the agency must establish standards of per
formance for emission of pollutants from new or modified
sources within that category. §7411(b)(1)(B); see also
§7411(a)(2). And, most relevant here, §7411(d) then re
quires regulation of existing sources within the same
category.7 For existing sources, EPA issues emissions
——————

is an exception: EPA may not employ §7411(d) if existing
stationary sources of the pollutant in question are regulated under the
national ambient air quality standard program, §§7408–7410, or the
“hazardous air pollutants” program, §7412. See §7411(d)(1).
