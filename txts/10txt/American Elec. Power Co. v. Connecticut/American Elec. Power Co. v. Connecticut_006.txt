AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT
Opinion of the Court

helps keep the Earth warm enough for life.” 74 Fed. Reg.
66499 (2009).1 Massachusetts held that the Environ
mental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread the Clean
Air Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking
controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor
vehicles. 549 U. S., at 510–511. Greenhouse gases, we
determined, qualify as “air pollutant[s]” within the mean
ing of the governing Clean Air Act provision, id., at 528–
529 (quoting §7602(g)); they are therefore within EPA’s
regulatory ken. Because EPA had authority to set green
house gas emission standards and had offered no “rea
soned explanation” for failing to do so, we concluded that
the agency had not acted “in accordance with law” when it
denied the requested rulemaking. Id., at 534–535 (quot
ing §7607(d)(9)(A)).
Responding to our decision in Massachusetts, EPA un
dertook greenhouse gas regulation. In December 2009,
the agency concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from
motor vehicles “cause, or contribute to, air pollution which
may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health
or welfare,” the Act’s regulatory trigger. §7521(a)(1); 74
Fed. Reg. 66496. The agency observed that “atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations are now at elevated and
essentially unprecedented levels,” almost entirely “due to
anthropogenic emissions,” id., at 66517; mean global
temperatures, the agency continued, demonstrate an
“unambiguous warming trend over the last 100 years,”
and particularly “over the past 30 years,” ibid. Acknowl
edging that not all scientists agreed on the causes and
consequences of the rise in global temperatures, id., at
66506, 66518, 66523–66524, EPA concluded that “compel
ling” evidence supported the “attribution of observed

by human activities include methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocar
bons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. 74 Fed. Reg. 66499.
