Opinion of the Court

its carbon dioxide emissions and then reduce them by a
specified percentage each year for at least a decade.” App.
110, 153.
The District Court dismissed both suits as presenting
non-justiciable political questions, citing Baker v. Carr,
369 U. S. 186 (1962), but the Second Circuit reversed, 582
F. 3d 309 (2009). On the threshold questions, the Court of
Appeals held that the suits were not barred by the politi
cal question doctrine, id., at 332, and that the plaintiffs
had adequately alleged Article III standing, id., at 349.
Turning to the merits, the Second Circuit held that all
plaintiffs had stated a claim under the “federal common
law of nuisance.” Id., at 358, 371. For this determination,
the court relied dominantly on a series of this Court’s
decisions holding that States may maintain suits to abate
air and water pollution produced by other States or by out
of-state industry. Id., at 350–351; see, e.g., Illinois v.
Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 93, (1972) (Milwaukee I) (recog
nizing right of Illinois to sue in federal district court to
abate discharge of sewage into Lake Michigan).
The Court of Appeals further determined that the Clean
Air Act did not “displace” federal common law. In Mil
waukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 316–319 (1981) (Milwau
kee II), this Court held that Congress had displaced the
federal common law right of action recognized in Milwau
kee I by adopting amendments to the Clean Water Act, 33
U. S. C. §1251 et seq. That legislation installed an all
encompassing regulatory program, supervised by an ex
pert administrative agency, to deal comprehensively with
interstate water pollution. The legislation itself prohib
ited the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the
United States without a permit from a proper permitting
authority. Milwaukee II, 451 U. S., at 310–311 (citing
§1311). At the time of the Second Circuit’s decision, by
contrast, EPA had not yet promulgated any rule regulat
ing greenhouse gases, a fact the court thought dispositive.
