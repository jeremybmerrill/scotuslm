Opinion of the Court

climate change to anthropogenic” emissions of greenhouse
gases, id., at 66518. Consequent dangers of greenhouse
gas emissions, EPA determined, included increases in
heat-related deaths; coastal inundation and erosion
caused by melting icecaps and rising sea levels; more
frequent and intense hurricanes, floods, and other “ex
treme weather events” that cause death and destroy infra
structure; drought due to reductions in mountain snow
pack and shifting precipitation patterns; destruction of
ecosystems supporting animals and plants; and potentially
“significant disruptions” of food production. Id., at 66524–
66535.2
EPA and the Department of Transportation subse
quently issued a joint final rule regulating emissions from
light-duty vehicles, see 75 Fed. Reg. 25324 (2010), and
initiated a joint rulemaking covering medium- and heavy
duty vehicles, see id., at 74152. EPA also began phasing
in requirements that new or modified “[m]ajor [greenhouse
gas] emitting facilities” use the “best available control
technology.” §7475(a)(4); 75 Fed. Reg. 31520–31521. Fin
ally, EPA commenced a rulemaking under §111 of the Act,
42 U. S. C. §7411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emis
sions from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired
power plants. Pursuant to a settlement finalized in March
2011, EPA has committed to issuing a proposed rule by
July 2011, and a final rule by May 2012. See 75 Fed. Reg.
82392; Reply Brief for Tennessee Valley Authority 18.

The lawsuits we consider here began well before EPA
initiated the efforts to regulate greenhouse gases just
described. In July 2004, two groups of plaintiffs filed

views opposing EPA’s, see, e.g., Dawidoff, The Civil Heretic,
N. Y. Times Magazine 32 (March 29, 2009). The Court, we caution,
endorses no particular view of the complicated issues related to carbon
dioxide emissions and climate change.
