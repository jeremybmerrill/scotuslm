AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT
Opinion of the Court

582 F. 3d, at 379–381. “Until EPA completes the rulemak
ing process,” the court reasoned, “we cannot speculate
as to whether the hypothetical regulation of greenhouse
gases under the Clean Air Act would in fact ‘spea[k] di
rectly’ to the ‘particular issue’ raised here by Plaintiffs.”
Id., at 380.
We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).
III
The petitioners contend that the federal courts lack au
thority to adjudicate this case. Four members of the
Court would hold that at least some plaintiffs have Article
III standing under Massachusetts, which permitted a
State to challenge EPA’s refusal to regulate greenhouse
gas emissions, 549 U. S., at 520–526; and, further, that no
other threshold obstacle bars review.6 Four members of
the Court, adhering to a dissenting opinion in Massachu
setts, 549 U. S., at 535, or regarding that decision as dis
tinguishable, would hold that none of the plaintiffs have
Article III standing. We therefore affirm, by an equally
divided Court, the Second Circuit’s exercise of jurisdiction
and proceed to the merits. See Nye v. United States, 313
U. S. 33, 44 (1941).

A

“There is no federal general common law,” Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78 (1938), famously recognized.
In the wake of Erie, however, a keener understanding
developed. See generally Friendly, In Praise of Erie—And
of the New Federal Common Law, 39 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 383

6 In addition to renewing the political question argument made below,
the petitioners now assert an additional threshold obstacle: They seek
dismissal because of a “prudential” bar to the adjudication of general
ized grievances, purportedly distinct from Article III’s bar. See Brief
for Tennessee Valley Authority 14–24; Brief for Petitioners 30–31.
