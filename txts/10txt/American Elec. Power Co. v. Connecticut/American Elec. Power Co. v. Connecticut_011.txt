Opinion of the Court

(1964). Erie “le[ft] to the states what ought be left to
them,” id., at 405, and thus required “federal courts [to]
follow state decisions on matters of substantive law ap
propriately cognizable by the states,” id., at 422. Erie also
sparked “the emergence of a federal decisional law in
areas of national concern.” Id., at 405. The “new” federal
common law addresses “subjects within national legisla
tive power where Congress has so directed” or where the
basic scheme of the Constitution so demands. Id., at 408,
n. 119, 421–422. Environmental protection is undoubtedly
an area “within national legislative power,” one in which
federal courts may fill in “statutory interstices,” and, if
necessary, even “fashion federal law.” Id., at 421–422. As
the Court stated in Milwaukee I: “When we deal with air
and water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a
federal common law.” 406 U. S., at 103.
Decisions of this Court predating Erie, but compatible
with the distinction emerging from that decision between
“general common law” and “specialized federal common
law,” Friendly, supra, at 405, have approved federal com
mon law suits brought by one State to abate pollution
emanating from another State. See, e.g., Missouri v.
Illinois, 180 U. S. 208, 241–243 (1901) (permitting suit by
Missouri to enjoin Chicago from discharging untreated
sewage into interstate waters); New Jersey v. City of
New York, 283 U. S. 473, 477, 481–483 (1931) (ordering
New York City to stop dumping garbage off New Jersey
coast); Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 240 U. S. 650 (1916)
(ordering private copper companies to curtail sulfur
dioxide discharges in Tennessee that caused harm in
Georgia). See also Milwaukee I, 406 U. S., at 107 (postErie decision upholding suit by Illinois to abate sewage
discharges into Lake Michigan). The plaintiffs contend
that their right to maintain this suit follows inexorably
from that line of decisions.
