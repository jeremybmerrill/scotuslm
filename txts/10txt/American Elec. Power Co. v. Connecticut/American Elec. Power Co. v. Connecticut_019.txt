Opinion of the Court

members of the same court.
Notwithstanding these disabilities, the plaintiffs pro
pose that individual federal judges determine, in the first
instance, what amount of carbon-dioxide emissions is
“unreasonable,” App. 103, 145, and then decide what level
of reduction is “practical, feasible and economically vi
able,” App. 58, 119. These determinations would be made
for the defendants named in the two lawsuits launched by
the plaintiffs. Similar suits could be mounted, counsel for
the States and New York City estimated, against “thou
sands or hundreds or tens” of other defendants fitting the
description “large contributors” to carbon-dioxide emis
sions. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57.
The judgments the plaintiffs would commit to federal
judges, in suits that could be filed in any federal district,

same limits, subject to judicial review only to ensure
against action “arbitrary, capricious, . . . or otherwise not
in accordance with law.” §7607(d)(9).

The plaintiffs also sought relief under state law, in

Circuit did not reach the state law claims because it held
that federal common law governed. 582 F. 3d, at 392; see
International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 488
(1987) (if a case “should be resolved by reference to federal
common law[,] . . . state common law [is] preempted”). In
light of our holding that the Clean Air Act displaces fed
eral common law, the availability vel non of a state law
suit depends, inter alia, on the preemptive effect of the
federal Act. Id., at 489, 491, 497 (holding that the Clean
