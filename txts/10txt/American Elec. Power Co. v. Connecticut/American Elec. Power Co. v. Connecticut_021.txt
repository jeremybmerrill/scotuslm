AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY, INC., 

ET AL., PETITIONERS v. CONNECTICUT ET AL. 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[June 20, 2011] 


JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the judgment, and I agree with the Court’s
displacement analysis on the assumption (which I make
for the sake of argument because no party contends oth
erwise) that the interpretation of the Clean Air Act, 42
U. S. C. §7401 et seq., adopted by the majority in Massa
chusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), is correct.
