AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT
Opinion of the Court

C
The plaintiffs argue, as the Second Circuit held, that
federal common law is not displaced until EPA actually
exercises its regulatory authority, i.e., until it sets stan
dards governing emissions from the defendants’ plants.
We disagree.
The sewage discharges at issue in Milwaukee II, we do
not overlook, were subject to effluent limits set by EPA;
under the displacing statute, “[e]very point source dis
charge” of water pollution was “prohibited unless covered
by a permit.” 451 U. S., at 318–320 (emphasis deleted).
As Milwaukee II made clear, however, the relevant ques
tion for purposes of displacement is “whether the field
has been occupied, not whether it has been occupied in a
particular manner.” Id., at 324. Of necessity, Congress se
lects different regulatory regimes to address different
problems. Congress could hardly preemptively prohibit
every discharge of carbon dioxide unless covered by a
permit. After all, we each emit carbon dioxide merely by
breathing.
The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the legisla
ture’s “considered judgment” concerning the regulation of
air pollution because it permits emissions until EPA
acts. See Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National
Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 22, n. 32 (1981) (finding
displacement although Congress “allowed some continued
dumping of sludge” prior to a certain date). The critical
point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision
whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions
from power plants; the delegation is what displaces federal
common law. Indeed, were EPA to decline to regulate
carbon-dioxide emissions altogether at the conclusion of its
ongoing §7411 rulemaking, the federal courts would have
no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance
to upset the agency’s expert determination.
EPA’s judgment, we hasten to add, would not escape
