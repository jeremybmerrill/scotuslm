Opinion of the Court

and County of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 535–538
(1967). But those exceptions do not apply where the offi
cer’s purpose is not to attend to the special needs or to the
investigation for which the administrative inspection is
justified. See Whren, supra, at 811–812. The Government
seeks to justify the present arrest on the basis of a prop
erly issued judicial warrant—so that the special-needs and
administrative-inspection cases cannot be the basis for a
purpose inquiry here.
Apart from those cases, we have almost uniformly re
jected invitations to probe subjective intent. See Brigham
City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 404 (2006). There is one
category of exception, upon which the Court of Appeals
principally relied. In Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, we held that
the Fourth Amendment could not condone suspicionless
vehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of detecting
illegal narcotics. Although we had previously approved
vehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of keeping off
the road unlicensed drivers, Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S.
648, 663 (1979), or alcohol-impaired drivers, Michigan
Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444 (1990); and for
the purpose of interdicting those who illegally cross the
border, United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543
(1976); we found the drug-detection purpose in Edmond
invalidating because it was “ultimately indistinguishable
from the general interest in crime control,” 531 U. S., at
44. In the Court of Appeals’ view, Edmond established
that “ ‘programmatic purpose’ is relevant to Fourth
Amendment analysis of programs of seizures without
probable cause.” 580 F. 3d, at 968.
That was mistaken. It was not the absence of probable
cause that triggered the invalidating-purpose inquiry in
Edmond. To the contrary, Edmond explicitly said that it
would approve checkpoint stops for “general crime control
purposes” that were based upon merely “some quantum of
individualized suspicion.” 531 U. S., at 47. Purpose was
