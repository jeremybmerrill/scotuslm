Opinion of the Court 


II 

Qualified immunity shields federal and state officials
from money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts show
ing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitu
tional right, and (2) that the right was “clearly estab
lished” at the time of the challenged conduct. Harlow v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). We recently reaf
firmed that lower courts have discretion to decide which of
the two prongs of qualified-immunity analysis to tackle
first. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009).
Courts should think carefully before expending “scarce
judicial resources” to resolve difficult and novel questions
of constitutional or statutory interpretation that will “have
no effect on the outcome of the case.” Id., at 236–237; see
id., at 237–242. When, however, a Court of Appeals does
address both prongs of qualified-immunity analysis, we
have discretion to correct its errors at each step. Although
not necessary to reverse an erroneous judgment, doing so
ensures that courts do not insulate constitutional deci
sions at the frontiers of the law from our review or inad
vertently undermine the values qualified immunity seeks
to promote. The former occurs when the constitutional
law question is wrongly decided; the latter when what is
not clearly established is held to be so. In this case, the
Court of Appeals’ analysis at both steps of the qualified
immunity inquiry needs correction.

The Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the
people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” An
arrest, of course, qualifies as a “seizure” of a “person”
under this provision, Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200,
207–208 (1979), and so must be reasonable under the
circumstances. Al-Kidd does not assert that Government
officials would have acted unreasonably if they had used a
