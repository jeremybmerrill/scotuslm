ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD
Opinion of the Court

material-witness warrant to arrest him for the purpose of
securing his testimony for trial. See Brief for Respondent
16–17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20–22. He contests, however (and
the Court of Appeals here rejected), the reasonableness of
using the warrant to detain him as a suspected criminal.
Fourth Amendment reasonableness “is predominantly
an objective inquiry.” Edmond, supra, at 47. We ask
whether “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify
[the challenged] action.” Scott v. United States, 436 U. S.
128, 138 (1978). If so, that action was reasonable “what
ever the subjective intent” motivating the relevant offi
cials. Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 814 (1996).
This approach recognizes that the Fourth Amendment
regulates conduct rather than thoughts, Bond v. United
States, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000); and it promotes
evenhanded, uniform enforcement of the law, Devenpeck v.
Alford, 543 U. S. 146, 153–154 (2004).
Two “limited exception[s]” to this rule are our special
needs and administrative-search cases, where “actual
motivations” do matter. United States v. Knights, 534
U. S. 112, 122 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).
A judicial warrant and probable cause are not needed
where the search or seizure is justified by “special needs,
beyond the normal need for law enforcement,” such as the
need to deter drug use in public schools, Vernonia School
Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 653 (1995) (internal
quotation marks omitted), or the need to assure that
railroad employees engaged in train operations are not
under the influence of drugs or alcohol, Skinner v. Railway
Labor Executives’ Assn., 489 U. S. 602 (1989); and where
the search or seizure is in execution of an administrative
warrant authorizing, for example, an inspection of fire
damaged premises to determine the cause, Michigan v.
Clifford, 464 U. S. 287, 294 (1984) (plurality opinion), or
an inspection of residential premises to assure compliance
with a housing code, Camara v. Municipal Court of City
