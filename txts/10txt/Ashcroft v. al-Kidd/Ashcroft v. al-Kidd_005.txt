ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD
Opinion of the Court

eral John Ashcroft authorized federal prosecutors and law
enforcement officials to use the material-witness statute to
detain individuals with suspected ties to terrorist organi
zations. It is alleged that federal officials had no intention
of calling most of these individuals as witnesses, and that
they were detained, at Ashcroft’s direction, because fed
eral officials suspected them of supporting terrorism but
lacked sufficient evidence to charge them with a crime.
It is alleged that this pretextual detention policy led
to the material-witness arrest of al-Kidd, a native-born
United States citizen. FBI agents apprehended him in
March 2003 as he checked in for a flight to Saudi Arabia.
Two days earlier, federal officials had informed a Magis
trate Judge that, if al-Kidd boarded his flight, they be
lieved information “crucial” to the prosecution of Sami
Omar al-Hussayen would be lost. App. 64. Al-Kidd re
mained in federal custody for 16 days and on supervised
release until al-Hussayen’s trial concluded 14 months
later. Prosecutors never called him as a witness.
In March 2005, al-Kidd filed this Bivens action, see
Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S.
388 (1971) to challenge the constitutionality of Ashcroft’s
alleged policy; he also asserted several other claims not
relevant here against Ashcroft and others. Ashcroft filed a
motion to dismiss based on absolute and qualified immu
nity, which the District Court denied. A divided panel of
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed, holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibits
pretextual arrests absent probable cause of criminal
wrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or
absolute immunity. See 580 F. 3d 949 (2009).
Judge Bea dissented, 580 F. 3d, at 981, and eight judges
dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, see 598
F. 3d 1129, 1137, 1142 (CA9 2010). We granted certiorari,
see 562 U. S. ___ (2010).
