JOHN D. ASHCROFT, PETITIONER v. ABDULLAH 

AL-KIDD 

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[May 31, 2011] 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing the Court of
Appeals because I agree with the majority’s conclusion
that Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law. I
cannot join the majority’s opinion, however, because it
unnecessarily “resolve[s] [a] difficult and novel questio[n]
of constitutional . . . interpretation that will ‘have no effect
on the outcome of the case.’ ” Ante, at 3 (quoting Pearson
v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 237 (2009)).
Whether the Fourth Amendment permits the pretextual
use of a material witness warrant for preventive detention
of an individual whom the Government has no intention
of using at trial is, in my view, a closer question than
the majority’s opinion suggests. Although the majority
is correct that a government official’s subjective intent is
generally “irrelevant in determining whether that officer’s
actions violate the Fourth Amendment,” Bond v. United
States, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000), none of our prior
cases recognizing that principle involved prolonged deten­
tion of an individual without probable cause to believe he
had committed any criminal offense. We have never
considered whether an official’s subjective intent matters
for purposes of the Fourth Amendment in that novel con­
text, and we need not and should not resolve that question
