GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment

ing claims against the FBI agents who apprehended him
invite consideration of the issues JUSTICE KENNEDY iden
tified.4 His challenges to the brutal conditions of his
confinement have been settled. But his ordeal is a grim
reminder of the need to install safeguards against disre
spect for human dignity, constraints that will control
officialdom even in perilous times.

4 The District Court determined that al-Kidd’s factual allegations
against FBI agents regarding their “misrepresentations and omissions
in the warrant application, if true, would negate the possibility of
qualified immunity [for those agents].” Memorandum Order in No.
cv:05–093 (D Idaho, Sept. 27, 2006), p. 18. The agents took no appeal
from this threshold denial of their qualified immunity plea.
