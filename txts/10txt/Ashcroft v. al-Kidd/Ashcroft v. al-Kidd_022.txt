GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment
——————
Kidd’s arrest was “based on individualized suspicion.” Ante, at 6, 8.
The word “suspicion,” however, ordinarily indicates that the person
suspected has engaged in wrongdoing. See Black’s Law Dictionary
1585 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “reasonable suspicion” to mean “[a] par
ticularized and objective basis, supported by specific and articulable
facts, for suspecting a person of criminal activity”). Material witness
status does not “involv[e] suspicion, or lack of suspicion,” of the individ
ual so identified. See Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U. S. 419, 424–425 (2004).
This Court’s decisions, until today, have uniformly used the term
“individualized suspicion” to mean “individualized suspicion of wrong
doing.” See Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, 37 (2000) (emphasis
added); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U. S. 305, 313 (1997) (same). See also,
e.g., Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 405 (2006) (referring to
“programmatic searches conducted without individualized suspicion—
such as checkpoints to combat drunk driving or drug trafficking”);
Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v.
Earls, 536 U. S. 822, 830 (2002) (“finding of individualized suspicion
may not be necessary when a school conducts drug testing”); Whren v.
United States, 517 U. S. 806, 817–818 (1996) (observed traffic violations
give rise to individualized suspicion); Michigan Dept. of State Police v.
Sitz, 496 U. S. 444, 451 (1990) (“Detention of particular motorists for
more extensive field sobriety testing may require satisfaction of an
individualized suspicion standard.”); Maryland v. Buie, 494 U. S. 325,
334–335, n. 2 (1990) (“Terry [v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968)] requires
reasonable, individualized suspicion before a frisk for weapons can be
conducted.”); Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 668
(1989) (“[I]n certain limited circumstances, the Government’s need to
discover . . . latent or hidden conditions, or to prevent their develop
ment, is sufficiently compelling to justify [search that intrudes] on
privacy . . . without any measure of individualized suspicion.”);
O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 726 (1987) (“petitioners had an
‘individualized suspicion’ of misconduct by Dr. Ortega”); United States
v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531, 538 (1985) (“Automotive
travelers may be stopped at fixed checkpoints near the border without
individualized suspicion . . .”); New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325,
342, n. 8 (1985) (“the search of T. L. O.’s purse was based upon
an individualized suspicion that she had violated school rules”); Michi
gan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 699, n. 9 (1981) (“police executing a
search warrant at a tavern could not . . . frisk a patron unless the
officers had individualized suspicion that the patron might be armed or
dangerous”).
The Court’s suggestion that the term “individualized suspicion” is
more commonly associated with “know[ing] something about [a] crime”
