ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD
Opinion of the Court

Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing
room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about
open legal questions. When properly applied, it protects
“all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly
violate the law.” Malley, 475 U. S., at 341. Ashcroft de
serves neither label, not least because eight Court of
Appeals judges agreed with his judgment in a case of first
impression. See Wilson, supra, at 618. He deserves quali
fied immunity even assuming—contrafactually—that his
alleged detention policy violated the Fourth Amendment.

*
We hold that an objectively reasonable arrest and deten
tion of a material witness pursuant to a validly obtained
warrant cannot be challenged as unconstitutional on the
basis of allegations that the arresting authority had an
improper motive. Because Ashcroft did not violate clearly
established law, we need not address the more difficult
question whether he enjoys absolute immunity. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
