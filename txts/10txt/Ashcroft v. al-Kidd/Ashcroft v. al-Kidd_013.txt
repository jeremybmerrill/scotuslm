ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD
Opinion of the Court

eral’s personal attention all district judges’ footnoted
speculations that boldly “call him out by name.” On that
assumption, would it prove that for him (and for him
only?) it became clearly established that pretextual use of
the material-witness statute rendered the arrest unconsti
tutional? An extraordinary proposition. Even a district
judge’s ipse dixit of a holding is not “controlling authority”
in any jurisdiction, much less in the entire United States;
and his ipse dixit of a footnoted dictum falls far short of
what is necessary absent controlling authority: a robust
“consensus of cases of persuasive authority.” Wilson v.
Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999).
The Court of Appeals’ other cases “clearly establishing”
the constitutional violation are, of course, those we re
jected as irrelevant in our discussion of whether there was
any constitutional violation at all. And the Court of Ap
peals’ reference to those cases here makes the same error
of assuming that purpose is only disregarded when there
is probable cause to suspect a violation of law.
The Court of Appeals also found clearly established law
lurking in the broad “history and purposes of the Fourth
Amendment.” 580 F. 3d, at 971. We have repeatedly told
courts—and the Ninth Circuit in particular, see Brosseau
v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 198–199 (2004) (per curiam)—
not to define clearly established law at a high level of
generality. See also, e.g., Wilson, supra, at 615; Anderson,
supra, at 639–640; cf. Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 236
(1990). The general proposition, for example, that an
unreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth
Amendment is of little help in determining whether the
violative nature of particular conduct is clearly estab
lished. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201–202 (2001);
Wilson, supra, at 615.
The same is true of the Court of Appeals’ broad histori
cal assertions. The Fourth Amendment was a response to
the English Crown’s use of general warrants, which often
