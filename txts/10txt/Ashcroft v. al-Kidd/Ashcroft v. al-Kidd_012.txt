Opinion of the Court

that we look to whether the arrest is objectively justified,
rather than to the motive of the arresting officer.
B
A Government official’s conduct violates clearly estab
lished law when, at the time of the challenged conduct,
“[t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear” that
every “reasonable official would have understood that
what he is doing violates that right.” Anderson v. Creigh
ton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987). We do not require a case
directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed
the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.
See ibid.; Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986). The
constitutional question in this case falls far short of that
threshold.
At the time of al-Kidd’s arrest, not a single judicial
opinion had held that pretext could render an objectively
reasonable arrest pursuant to a material-witness warrant
unconstitutional. A district-court opinion had suggested,
in a footnoted dictum devoid of supporting citation, that
using such a warrant for preventive detention of suspects
“is an illegitimate use of the statute”—implying (we accept
for the sake of argument) that the detention would there
fore be unconstitutional. United States v. Awadallah, 202
F. Supp. 2d 55, 77, n. 28 (SDNY 2002). The Court of
Appeals thought nothing could “have given John Ashcroft
fair[er] warning” that his conduct violated the Fourth
Amendment, because the footnoted dictum “call[ed] out
Ashcroft by name”! 580 F. 3d, at 972–973 (internal quota
tion marks omitted; emphasis added). We will indulge the
assumption (though it does not seem to us realistic) that
Justice Department lawyers bring to the Attorney Gen
—————— 

General promulgated the alleged policy would not alone decide the case. 

Al-Kidd would also have to prove that the officials who sought his 

material-arrest warrant were motivated by Ashcroft’s policy, not by a

desire to call al-Kidd as a witness.
