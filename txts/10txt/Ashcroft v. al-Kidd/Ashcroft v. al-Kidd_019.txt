ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD
KENNEDY, J., concurring

appellate courts, those officers would be deterred from full
use of their legal authority. The consequences of that
deterrence must counsel caution by the Judicial Branch,
particularly in the area of national security. See Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21). Fur
thermore, too expansive a view of “clearly established law”
would risk giving local judicial determinations the effect of
rules with de facto national significance, contrary to the
normal process of ordered appellate review.
The proceedings in this case illustrate these concerns.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appears to
have reasoned that a Federal District Court sitting in New
York had authority to establish a legal rule binding on
the Attorney General and, therefore, on federal law
enforcement operations conducted nationwide. See 580
F. 3d 949, 972–973 (2009). Indeed, this case involves a
material witness warrant issued in Boise, Idaho, and an
arrest near Washington, D. C. Of course, district court
decisions are not precedential to this extent. Ante, at 9–
10. But nationwide security operations should not have to
grind to a halt even when an appellate court finds those
operations unconstitutional. The doctrine of qualified
immunity does not so constrain national officeholders
entrusted with urgent responsibilities.
