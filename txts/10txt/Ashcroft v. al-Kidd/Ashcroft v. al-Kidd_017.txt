ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD
KENNEDY, J., concurring

before a scheduled flight abroad. It is unclear whether
those facts alone might allow police to obtain a material
witness warrant on the ground that it “may become im
practicable” to secure the person’s presence by subpoena.
Ibid. The question becomes more difficult if one further
assumes the traveler would be willing to testify if asked;
and more difficult still if one supposes that authorities
delay obtaining or executing the warrant until the traveler
has arrived at the airport. These possibilities resemble
the facts in this case. See ante, at 2.
In considering these issues, it is important to bear in
mind that the Material Witness Statute might not provide
for the issuance of warrants within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment’s Warrant Clause. The typical arrest
warrant is based on probable cause that the arrestee has
committed a crime; but that is not the standard for the
issuance of warrants under the Material Witness Statute.
See ante, at 11 (reserving the possibility that probable
cause for purposes of the Fourth Amendment’s Warrant
Clause means “only probable cause to suspect a violation
of law”). If material witness warrants do not qualify as
“Warrants” under the Fourth Amendment, then material
witness arrests might still be governed by the Fourth
Amendment’s separate reasonableness requirement for
seizures of the person. See United States v. Watson, 423
U. S. 411 (1976). Given the difficulty of these issues, the
Court is correct to address only the legal theory put before
it, without further exploring when material witness ar
rests might be consistent with statutory and constitutional
requirements.

The fact that the Attorney General holds a high office in
the Government must inform what law is clearly estab
