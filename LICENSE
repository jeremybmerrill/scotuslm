It is my understanding that Supreme Court decisions, as government works, are uncopyrighted in the United States. I disclaim any copyright or similar right (if one exists) to my cleaned/processed versions. Feel free to use them. Please give me credit for compiling them (since I don't think a similar compilation exists anywhere), but I don't intend to legally require you to.
